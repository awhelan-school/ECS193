 Speaker Paul Ryan's announcement that he is not seeking re-election shocked a Republican Party already facing severe midterm headwinds. His decision will drive down morale in the GOP conference -- and perhaps convince other fence-sitting members who have yet to decide to call it quits themselves. These additional open seats would increase the likelihood that Democrats will take over the House. <br> Ryan's move accelerates a GOP leadership battle between California's Kevin McCarthy and Louisiana's Steve Scalise, both able men who are well-liked by their colleagues (it feels like McCarthy's race to lose at this point). No matter who becomes the next Republican leader, they will sit atop a smaller conference that is likely to be in the minority. <br> Despite the chaos his departure will cause for the party, there are obviously larger issues at play for Ryan that convinced him now is the time to go. <br> Sometimes we forget -- congressional leaders have districts and constituents to think about, too. Ryan's deference to the people of Wisconsin, by not asking them to vote for him when it was very likely he wouldn't serve out his term, is an honorable move. <br> 3. He achieved his dream of tax reform. Ryan is a policy wonk at heart, with a lifelong belief that lower taxes are better for America's working families. He has been a member of Congress for two decades, and his crowning achievement was holding the House together in December for the sweeping tax cuts. <br> Ryan's announcement will signal to Republican donors and activists that the House is most likely lost, which should refocus everyone's attention on holding the US Senate. Losing one chamber will introduce a high level of policy and investigatory paralysis to the Trump administration; losing both would feel like getting sucked into the tenth level of hell for the President. <br> We haven't seen the last of Paul Ryan. He's 48 and I'd bet dollars to donuts he's a future presidential candidate. Leaving now helps his family and will give him some space to prep a run for The White House sometime down the road. 
 Originally, I had decided not to watch the reboot of "Roseanne" because of Barr's vocal and bizarre worship of Donald Trump. <br> I make no apologies for not being a Trump supporter. Moreover, I don't subscribe to the belief that we who oppose Trump should try to "understand" the "misunderstood" Trump supporter. No one called for people to try to "understand" President Obama's supporters when he was in office. No one said Obama supporters were "ignored" over the years. No one gave Obama supporters the title of working class -- as if only white men in red states are the working class. <br> The column inches, airtime, and dissertations given to Trump supporters are by comparison astounding. <br> Within 10 minutes of Tuesday night's reboot, I had to admit, the show was damn good -- and not because of Roseanne. <br> Thirty years later, the Conners' kitchen isn't renovated. They haven't bought a new couch (maybe it was reupholstered?) and the house wasn't even freshly painted. That is the reality of poverty. If I venture back into one of my old neighborhoods, it's shocking how little has changed -- it's as if I was transported back in time. <br> The jokes about financial woes, health care, and the issues that hurt American families are where the show delivers the best laughs. The second episode tackled Darlene's son wearing girls' clothes, something I have never seen on network television and exactly the type of dialogue Trump supporters, if they are watching, would need to see (I hope the show properly unpacks DJ's black daughter as well). <br> In some ways, the show was a billion miles away from the perspective of Trump, Barr and Fox News. As Dan Conner said, "God didn't give me a head this big to have me be narrow-minded." Hopefully, Sean Hannity or Laura Ingraham heard that line. 
 Thanks to the Internal Revenue Service, many dread the month of April. In fact, if given the option between (a) dealing with the IRS or (b) undergoing a root canal, most would probably go to the dentist. That's because the IRS is anything but user-friendly. Trust me, as a certified public accountant, I've heard all the horror stories and have helped taxpayers through a good number myself. <br> Last December, Republicans passed historic tax reform legislation, which President Donald Trump signed into law. With a reformed tax code, it's now time to fix the tax collection agency. <br> The goal for the IRS is to provide first class service to American taxpayers, rather than the dysfunctional service too many have come to expect. Through this legislation, taxpayers will be able to easily access their information, day or night, readily have their questions answered and quickly resolve issues. The IRS should educate and provide guidance to taxpayers on what is required to comply with the tax code -- making the process of paying taxes as painless as possible. <br> Our plan will also protect low-income taxpayers by extending the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Matching Grant Program (VITA), which will provide tax preparation assistance to low-income taxpayers and those in underserved populations. <br> The IRS must work for, not against, the taxpayer. That is why our IRS plan also establishes an independent office of appeals to ensure that taxpayers pay exactly what they owe and receive a fair and impartial review of disputes they may have with the IRS. It provides many important clarifications regarding IRS enforcement powers. This includes reining in civil asset forfeiture authority and also creating new safeguards for taxpayers' private information. <br> It is important to remember that the IRS does not wield ultimate authority in America -- taxpayers do. <br> As we work toward the first revamp of the IRS in 20 years, these reforms must be built upon IT systems that are modern and up-to-date (sorry, fax machine repairmen). The bill also ensures that the IRS is held accountable if modernization efforts fall short by stipulating that funds spent must produce measurable results. <br> Americans must be able to trust that their private information is secure. Although the number of reported identity thefts has recently dropped, the IRS still received a startling 242,000 reports of theft from taxpayers in 2017. It is essential for the IRS to have the capacity to remain ahead of evolving threats posed by bad actors and to be able to proactively combat identity theft refund fraud. Most importantly, the IRS must be able to readily assist taxpayers when they are victims of fraud. <br> We are thinking boldly about the IRS's future -- in order to return the IRS to its service-first mission. Whether it is online, in-person or by phone, taxpayers deserve a tax collection agency that is focused on them. 
 Ask around about Donald Trump's time as an Atlantic City mogul and the stories are legion: A-larger-than-life figure whose casinos were all about him. Some mistakes he would forgive. But according to one story -- maybe urban legend -- there was one unforgivable sin: If you forget to call it Trump's casino, as one employee apparently once did, you're gone. <br> Rex Tillerson made that same mistake: He forgot it's not his casino. <br> It belongs to President Trump. And now more than ever, or so the President believes. <br> In conversations with people who know the President well, one point seems clear: The President thinks the turmoil is great. It shows he's in charge now, for real. <br> "He thinks he's got it," says an ally. "I can tell when he's concerned and when he's not. He's not. He's on cloud nine." A man in full. <br> Trump now figures he knows how to do this presidential thing after a year on the job. "He thinks 'I've come into my own,'" says this friend. "I don't need anybody to tell me how to do this anymore." <br> Sure, Trump is lonely. Sources always say that he doesn't have a lot of friends, save for his family. And lately, with Stormy brewing, Melania is surely less dependable. And the President still gets frustrated by the forced solitude and thinking time imposed on him by chief of staff General John Kelly. <br> But now, after a win on tax reform under his belt and with a good economy, there is a newfound muscle-flexing. Trump is now the CEO. He can rely on basic instinct. And, predicts this ally, "it's not over." <br> Well-founded rumors are flying about Trump's unhappiness with Kelly and his National Security Adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster. But he let his differences with Tillerson fester for months before acting, right? So why wouldn't that delay happen again? <br> Because this version of Trump is apparently more self-assured. He wants to really bring in his own team, not a team he picked when he did not know what direction he would take on foreign policy or anything else. "I'm really at a point where we're getting very close to having the cabinet and other things that I want," Trump told reporters on Tuesday. <br> Besides, now he knows he can say one thing on gun control one day, and do something else the next, and his base will say it's OK. He is more sure. He's "confident," as the friend puts it, even at 38% popularity. "He thinks he's penetrated the BS." <br> So is the Cabinet also on the firing line? Probably. Will Attorney General Jeff Sessions be the next to go? Friends caution that while that could happen (under the anything-is-possible-in-Trumpworld caveat), the Tillerson saga doesn't mean the attorney general is next. Sessions has his own conservative political constituency and still tries to be a respectful ally to the President. Trump considered his secretary of state arrogant, even disrespectful. I mean, he did call Trump a moron, or at least he never denied it. <br> And what about the rest of the Cabinet? The high-flying, pricey-decorating, taxpayer-soaking folks? Sure, anything can happen, especially if Trump is made to look bad -- as with the drama surrounding Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, who CNN reports is on the chopping block. But there also seem to be more important fish to fry. As the Trump friend puts it, "Next to him is what matters," as in the White House staff. So get ready for him to take care of that too. It's about his comfort level, not anyone else's. <br> And never mind the bad form. The Tillerson saga played out for months, and then, in the end, it was still a mess. It's just a Trump pattern, as suggested by that story about the Atlantic City employee who found himself out of a job. <br> It is, as ever, Trump's casino. 
 It comes at a bizarre time, in fact, given that the GOP-led House Intelligence Committee concluded on Monday night that it would be ending its investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The committee determined that there was no evidence to support collusion. <br> The White House was served a win on a silver platter, a narrative it should've let play out over the next few days amid the stories of chaos in the White House and Stormy Daniels' getting closer to her alleged tell-all about her time with Trump. <br> However, in true Trump fashion, he had to make headlines, instead. <br> So, about all of those best and brightest he was going to surround himself with? Well, they either don't want to stay or find themselves at odds with their boss, and out the door. <br> Within the past two weeks alone, there has been chaos and unraveling, as well as three high-profile exits from the White House. <br> People of talent won't work for a boss who discredits and undermines them in public, meaning that the candidate pool for open posts will be very slim or come from within the White House. Even without the blunders, awful rhetoric, Twitter rants and legislative ignorance, the turnover alone is enough to make any sane person reluctant to submit a resume. <br> And the chaotic and uncertain environment that has been described by current and former staffers surely portrays us in a poor light to the rest of the world. <br> On the campaign trail, candidate Trump made it clear that he didn't know much about public policy or the legislative process but that he would surround himself with the best and the brightest in order to legislate effectively and successfully. <br> But while he has surrounded himself with trusted cabinet members and advisers, he often clashes with them publicly on policy and ends up losing them. <br> Just when this administration seemed to be getting a grasp on things by rounding out 2017 with a legislative victory on tax reform, it seems as though the President couldn't resist stirring things up again and sending the media, as well as the general public, into a tailspin in the new year. <br> As Trump pushes forward into the second year of his presidency, particularly with the looming 2018 midterms, he would be wise to start showing some stability within his administration, instead of continuously rocking the boat. 
 Our expectations have sunk so low that a major victory for the Trump team at the State of the Union speech on Tuesday night would consist of the President successfully walking down a long hallway and then reading for an hour from prepared remarks without going off script. <br> If he can accomplish those two things, you can anticipate that the speech will be lauded by many pundits and commentators as a "bright moment in his presidency" and a possible "turning point." <br> In summary: he is facing some serious headwinds. <br> The test for Trump and the White House is not whether he can read from a Teleprompter and look "presidential," but whether he and his team have the discipline and the capacity to use this as a moment to reset. Here are the three real questions the White House should be judged on: <br> 1. Does the speech provide clear policy marching orders? <br> For any State of the Union, the policy is the meat of the sandwich and the focus is almost always domestic. Typically, the process of preparing begins months in advance with large binders and lengthy meetings in the Roosevelt room, as the policy and communications team determines which policies to include. <br> First, what is new and will make headlines and drive an agenda. Second, what Congress might be open to taking up in the year ahead. <br> The White House has already put forward a dead-on-arrival immigration proposal written by none other than Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller. This was supposed to be a framing piece for the State of the Union, and may still show up in the written remarks, but cutting legal immigration back by an estimated 50% and going back to the age of immigration quotas in the 1920s is not going to sail through Congress. <br> The White House has also hinted that infrastructure will be a central focus of the speech. On the surface, that sounds reasonable and it would be hard for Democrats to remain seated during the obligatory standing ovation. But deficit hawks including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan may not be eager to put a big package of spending on the table, especially after the tax reform bill. A good applause line, but hard to see the path forward. <br> So where does that leave the policy marching orders? <br> But the White House has not said that this will be a part of the speech, and members in vulnerable House and Senate districts will not be rushing to sign up to cut social safety net packages in a year when they could lose their seats for far less. <br> Will anything proposed domestically on Tuesday night have the shelf life and momentum to actually move forward in Congress? As of now the answer appears to be no. <br> 2. Does it provide a blueprint for candidates running for office? <br> Barring a surprising legislative surge this year, Trump's success in 2018 will be judged in large part by how congressional candidates fare in November. <br> While his popularity and scandal-ridden administration don't make him the most appealing surrogate for vulnerable members, he is still the head of the Republican Party, which is in charge of both houses of Congress, and he continues to have a strong and loyal following from his base. As we have already seen in special elections, his message will have an impact on both vulnerable incumbent members and candidates running. <br> There is no doubt he will spend a good portion of the State of the Union speech highlighting positive economic indicators and taking credit for the low unemployment rate and the surging stock market. While Democrats accurately argue that these numbers and trends have long been underway, that some of the economic indicators under Obama were actually stronger and that the stock market surge is not helping real people, this will already be a prominent talking point on the campaign trail. <br> Trump may not do any damage in the speech, but it is hard to see what new proposal or new message will emerge as a blueprint candidates can take with them in their march to November. And in an unpredictable environment where Trump may well attack Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell with new cutting nicknames on Twitter by Wednesday morning, it is hard to see how a unifying party message in the speech on Tuesday sticks. <br> 3. Does the speech help expand his base and unify the public? <br> Of all people, the Twitter President recognizes that. And the White House has sold the speech as "unifying." That would certainly be an improvement. Recall just one year ago, Trump delivered one of the better speeches of his presidency to the joint session of Congress. But the speech, described as "optimistic" in advance, quickly made way for one of the darkest and most divisive first years of a presidency in modern American history. <br> While a unifying tone would be smart, recent history tells us that the connection between the tone of the speech and the tone and actions afterward is negligible. <br> The State of the Union has never been about the ability of the President of the United States to read words on a page, but whether the speech has shelf life afterward in the days, weeks and months ahead. Count me as a skeptic that the administration and Republicans will be able to deliver. 
 In his first State of the Union address on Tuesday night, President Trump will have an opportunity to outline his vision, and his apparent goal will be to advocate "bipartisanship." But it is the President who will need to demonstrate that he will retreat from his divisive path and begin to move America forward by putting bipartisan government ahead of political extremism. <br> Obviously in a divided nation, with extreme feelings of alienation on both sides of the political spectrum, it is the overwhelming and festering national need. Racial, religious and political tensions are ripping apart American society. <br> The Founding Fathers stitched together an exquisite fabric to connect a land of different people into one community through balance of power and respect for diversity. The first year of the Trump Administration has weakened those links. E pluribus unum, our nation's founding premise stitched on the seal on the flag behind the President's desk, has been made a mockery. <br> But the President's words alone advocating "bipartisanship" will not fix the problem he created. <br> If the President, who now needs Senate Democrats to pass a continuing resolution and then a budget in February, wants any degree of reasonable cooperation, he will need to make the first moves. <br> The President's State of the Union address must show that he will abandon the extreme conservative orthodoxy he adopted to win the Republican presidential primaries and that he is now ready to govern. He has a large credibility gap that he must cross, as just last week the President's immigration proposal reinforced his extremism and his anti-immigrant philosophy.‎ A State of the Union call for "bipartisanship" must be matched with actual policy proposals that reflect a dramatic shift in his approach to be taken seriously. <br> The President must appreciate the anger and resentment he has caused. On immigration, he has unilaterally ended DACA and now holds it hostage. His proposal on immigration is tantamount to saying, "I will release the hostages but we must close the door to immigration." He may as well ask the Democrats to take down the Statue of Liberty. <br> The President's insistence on a $25 billion "wall" is like asking the American people to finance a campaign poster for his polarizing politics. Saying we should build a wall on the border with Mexico like the Great Wall of China was ridiculous as campaign rhetoric and is even more absurd as government policy. Parts of the Great Wall date as far back as 700 BC. No nation today would employ such an ancient strategy. Security should rest on new technology, motion sensors and infrared cameras at a fraction of the cost. Trump can get a bipartisan agreement on border protection, but let the experts design a real security system at the most efficient price, and not a political icon. <br> His tax reform plan was the most egregious violation of "bipartisanship" in modern history. Rather than gifting corporations a 40% tax cut and hoping their generosity would transfer down to workers, he should amend the bill and say corporations MUST give the windfall to workers by raising their wages or creating new jobs. Tax reform is a $1.5 trillion gift to wealthy corporations that will increase the national debt. It was trickle-down economics on steroids. <br> ‎If the President truly wants to repair relations for a functioning bipartisan government, he must call for a repeal of the vile provision in his tax reform that curtailed the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). It targeted 11 states (and the District of Columbia) -- all Democratic, all states President Trump lost, all states without a Republican Senator and a small minority of Republican representatives in the House. <br> Why did the Republicans do it? They did it because curtailing SALT was a key part of a package of deduction limits and eliminations that provided $668 billion in funding for the tax cuts. Yet these 11 states and the District of Columbia represent 40% of the national Gross Domestic Product. Does any reasonable person believe that damaging 40% of the nation's economy is good for the country? <br> They robbed blue states to pay for the tax cut in red states. It was the declaration of an economic civil war. It has devastating consequences for those targeted states like New York and California, and we are scrambling to rewrite our tax codes in its wake. We believe it is unconstitutional and we will go to court to stop it. <br> How can the Democrats from those states, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer from New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi from California, "compromise" without the SALT provision being repealed? How can they abandon their constituents? <br> The President must be credible on a seemingly incredibly sudden change of perspective. A disingenuous State of the Union is the worst course that the President could take. Judging by his record low-approval ratings, most Americans already doubt his credibility and sincerity. Offering a "do as I say but not as I do " State of the Union would be the height of hypocrisy. <br> As Governor, I have worked with a Republican Senate and a Democratic Assembly for seven years. The transition from campaigning to governing is essential. Governing is effectuating positive change. President Trump cannot do that without Democrats, and his past scorched earth, hyper-partisan approach will not work. He needs Democrats now, and he knows it. But he should know that even in politics, action speaks louder than words. 
 The World Economic Forum just concluded in Davos, Switzerland. As a longtime participant in the annual gathering, I know that some years are good, some years are great. And in some years, history is made. <br> At this year's event, President Donald J. Trump shared with major business and political leaders from around the world his vision for and optimism in the American economy. They can once again look to the United States as one of the most competitive and lucrative places to invest in the world, because "America is open for business." <br> Many people heard President Trump's message that he will always put America first -- just as all leaders must put their own citizens first. <br> Because he spent the last year putting America first, our economy is now resurgent. Massive tax cuts, deregulation, pro-growth energy policies and stronger trade practices are finally lifting the American economy out of a long period of stagnation. Growth is back, and millions of Americans are personally reaping the benefits. <br> For example, since we passed tax reform a little over a month ago, more than 255 companies (and counting) have announced significant new benefits -- including bonuses, higher wages, and better retirement options -- that benefit at least 3 million workers around the country. <br> When combined with America's great workforce, commitment to innovation and strong rule of law, the opportunity to invest and grow here is unprecedented. <br> Investment in America does not just benefit the United States -- it benefits the world. When our economy grows, it is good for the world. When the world economy grows, it is good for the United States. <br> Our pursuit of excellence, our creativity and our culture of innovation help drive change that improves lives around the world -- and creates countless jobs on distant shores. Our belief in free markets and a level playing field are values that make the world more free, fair, and prosperous. Under President Trump's leadership, we are trying to steer the world back to those principles. <br> He also talked about a world where all countries treat each other fairly and where hard work, ingenuity, and natural resources determine economic outcomes -- not protectionist laws and policies distorting what should otherwise be market-driven results. <br> Since taking office, President Trump has taken the principles of his America First vision to many corners of the globe. If this year's World Economic Forum participants truly heed the President's call and work together, this year's meeting will not only have been meaningful -- it also will be a moment of truly positive change for our world. 
 If 2017 is remembered as the year of major tax reform, let 2018 be remembered as the year that the nation's infrastructure was finally recognized as a priority for federal investment. <br> For several weeks, there has been talk that infrastructure could form a cornerstone of the President's new agenda. So, what infrastructure priorities would be top of my list? In no special order, I'd spend our money on the following: <br> 1. Interstate and long-distance rail: Funding for Amtrak, our national rail carrier, has long been a battleground between the political parties. Supporting Amtrak's nationwide operations is not a political sin, but rather a necessity to ensure continued service between cities or towns with insufficient traffic to pay their own way. <br> 2. Bridges and roads: The federal formula for funding roadways, including bridges, is complex -- and few outside of the transport world understand it. Suffice it to say that the lion's share of the cost of our interstate highway system -- of which major bridges are often a part -- has historically been paid for by federal, rather than state, dollars thanks to a burst of federal spending during and following the Eisenhower administration. <br> 5. Ports and port cities: As our appetite for foreign goods has grown, the ships delivering these good to our shores have too -- some of them doubling in capacity over the course of the last generation. Yet our willingness as a nation to invest in the changes necessary to handle these behemoths -- deeper harbors, higher bridges, better intermodal connections and more efficient security systems -- has not. <br> Once upon a time, our nation built the interstate highway system -- and it has paid dividends ever since. Today, however, we rely almost exclusively on the vagaries of state funding, resulting in a prolonged period of declining service across far too many forms of infrastructure. When will we realize that the costs -- in reliability, productivity and safety -- of not investing in these critical areas far outweigh the costs to the nation of doing so, even belatedly? 
 The ongoing conservative civil war came to a head Tuesday with the ouster of Steve Bannon at Breitbart News. This latest twist comes in the wake of a dispute between President Trump and Bannon, triggered by bombshell quotes in Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" book. <br> By separating himself from Bannon, Trump is continuing to govern more like a traditional conservative than many observers expected. Bannon embodied the ongoing strife surrounding the conservative movement, and he sought to circumvent the President and become a movement by himself, in spite of Trump. <br> Yet Bannon's fortunes only rose because of Trump, and he joined the Trump campaign in the homestretch, more than a year after the candidate descended the Trump Tower escalator. Bannon's attempt at internal guerilla warfare is harmful for the future of the conservative movement. If Bannon helped sound the war cry that led to Trump's victory, he failed to understand that to everything there is a season, including peace. <br> If conservatives are smart, Bannon's departure will be a turning point to move beyond the contentious climate of a conservative civil war launched amidst the 2016 election among the Never Trump "Establishment" types, the bomb-throwing, anti-establishment Bannonites and the growing body of conservative Trump supporters. <br> Congress hangs in the balance with November's elections, and ongoing fracturing will be a stumbling block to advancing a conservative policy agenda. Trump was the most non-traditional candidate in modern history, with no elected public policy track record and an aggressive tone. But now a year later, he's delivered in big ways that even the most ardent Never Trump conservatives must acknowledge. <br> Trump has succeeded in placing stalwart conservative judicial nominees at all levels, spearheaded the most robust tax reform in a generation, protected Internet freedom by rolling back flawed net neutrality, and let the world know American energy policy is made in Washington, not on foreign soil. Abroad, Trump continued the efforts that led to ISIS' defeat, stood up to Pakistan on terrorism, rightfully acknowledged Jerusalem as Israel's capital, successfully pressured China to support tougher North Korea sanctions, bolstered the Ukrainians against Russia, and more. <br> It's time for the Never Trumpers (who are my former 2016 compatriots -- I wrote in Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) as a protest presidential vote) to stop living in a fantasy world: Trump isn't going anywhere. The criminal Russia collusion investigation against Trump has not yet turned up evidence of criminal collusion by the President. <br> The way conservatives transcend the tumultuous political climate is to help Trump, and therefore America, succeed. That doesn't mean lawmakers should agree with the president on everything, but the continued Never Trumpers are rejecting William F. Buckley's mantra to back "the rightwardmost viable candidate." Turning your back on a Republican president in office undermines the spirit that Buckley supported. <br> Trump's victory blindsided many "Establishment" conservatives, but that doesn't mean they and MAGA foot soldiers can't and shouldn't work together. Rather than stubbornly clinging to preconceptions about each other, dialogue and respectful understanding of differences will move us forward. A reconciliation could take us a long way back toward Ronald Reagan's Shining City on a Hill. 
 In a year dominated by the beginning of the Trump presidency, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the man occupying the highest office in the land. But Donald Trump's many actions and tweets weren't the only subjects of interest. Stories of racism and white supremacist groups, workplace sexual harassment, freedom of the press and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too. <br> Here are excerpts from a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2017. <br> David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact <br> January 31 <br> I woke up this morning as an alternative fact. <br> In justifying the appointment of Steve Bannon, the President's chief strategist, to the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited my role in the Obama White House as a precedent. Spicer said press secretary Robert Gibbs and I attended classified National Security Council meetings "all the time." <br> That is simply not true. <br> As a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his National Security Council Principals committee over the strategy the United States would pursue in the war with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. <br> I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the President's decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it. <br> Dean Obeidallah: Donald Trump's most bone-chilling tweet <br> February 6 <br> Here is Trump's truly jaw-dropping tweet from Saturday morning: "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!" <br> Why is this so concerning? It's OK to argue about whether the judge should or shouldn't have issued this order. But Trump is apparently attempting to delegitimize our federal judiciary by calling Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush-appointed judge, a "so-called" judge while arguing that his decision is "ridiculous." <br> Let's be blunt, because the stakes demand it: An independent federal judiciary is our last, best hope at preventing Trump from violating the US Constitution and illegally grabbing power. And Trump has to understand that, hence his attempt to undermine it. <br> George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past <br> February 19 <br> I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets. <br> I remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead. <br> That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion. <br> Peter Bergen: Why the 'mother of all bombs' and why now? <br> April 13 <br> The dropping of a "mother of all bombs" Thursday by the United States on an ISIS cave and bunker complex in Achin district in eastern Afghanistan should be understood as part of an effort to reverse a war that is not going well for the Afghan government and, by extension, the United States. <br> The non-nuclear 21,600-pound GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) "targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters use to move around freely," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. <br> Thursday's bombing had a feeling of deja vu. A decade and a half ago the US Air Force dropped massive 15,000 pound "Daisy Cutter" bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001. Achin district is only a dozen or so miles from the Tora Bora region. <br> Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights <br> April 19 <br> The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted. <br> As the US ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming. <br> Sarah Lenti: Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option <br> April 25 <br> It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids. <br> My heart dropped. She didn't know me at all. <br> I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family. <br> Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me -- and it isn't the first. <br> John McWhorter: A man who is tragically unfit to be president <br> May 2 <br> When President Donald Trump revealed that he doesn't know why the Civil War was fought, or at least figures it could have been averted by the kind of deal-making he supposedly excels at, it was revealing in ways beyond the ones easy to glean. <br> The ignorance is, as usual, stunning for someone in the public spotlight. "People don't ask that question, but why was there the Civil War?" Trump asks rhetorically, which is like saying no one has bothered to study anatomy or physics. <br> Yet this sort of thing should no longer surprise us from this man. He doesn't read and lacks curiosity, but that's hardly rare among human beings. A college teacher friend of mine the other day noted that no one in his class could name who was president in the 1980s, nor, upon being told who it was, could they name his political party. People like this don't mysteriously develop an interest in civics after college. Sometimes they become president. <br> Michael D'Antonio: The little boy president <br> May 16 <br> Like most little boys, Donald Trump can be disarmingly honest, as when he once said, "When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same. The temperament is not that different." The trouble is that the first grader is now President of the United States, and his temperament is on display for the world to see. <br> Unpredictable, impulsive and immature, Trump acts in a way that would be expected of a 6-year-old boy, but is terrifying in a man whose moods dictate decisions carried out by adults on behalf of the most powerful nation in the world. <br> Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey offers a sterling example of the childish -- and reckless -- Trump style. When Comey broke with bureau tradition and spoke negatively about Trump's rival in the election, though initially he was criticized by candidate Trump, he was later praised -- and effusively. Over and over again, the soon-to-be-president described how Comey had done the right thing in criticizing Hillary Clinton. Comey remained in Trump's good graces after he was inaugurated, and Trump's team expressed confidence in him up until last week. <br> Anushay Hossain: The ugly truth behind Saudi Arabia's love for Melania Trump <br> May 23 <br> Donald Trump's first major trip overseas may be fraught with diplomatic land mines for the President, but the Trump administration can at least comfort itself with the clear hit that Melania Trump has been with the Saudi press. <br> The fact that Melania is communicating with the media and the public in Saudi Arabia -- mainly through what Saudi news reports have deemed her "classy and conservative" fashion choices -- works well in the notoriously anti-woman kingdom. Her intense appeal makes sense, considering the first lady represents so much that Saudi citizens find familiar and can relate to, especially visually. Melania walks behind her husband, is quiet and reserved, does not make obvious demands (at least not ones we can hear), and most importantly, she looks beautiful and polished... <br> In Melania, the Saudi press and the Saudi government found the perfect spokeswoman, who projects a glamorous image that glosses over one of world's most autocratic and oppressive regimes. <br> Gloria Borger: Trump, home all alone <br> May 30 <br> So Trump returns to the White House this week just as he left -- lonely, angry and not happy with much of anyone. The presidency, Donald Trump is discovering, is not an easy or natural fit. <br> "He now lives within himself, which is a dangerous place for Donald Trump to be," says someone who speaks with the President. "I see him emotionally withdrawing. He's gained weight. He doesn't have anybody whom he trusts." <br> The question, he adds, is whether Trump will understand the enormity of what he faces or will instead "be back to being arrogant and stubborn." He will have to realize that "all this trip really did was hit the pause button." <br> Douglas Heye: After baseball attack, the hate in politics has got to go <br> June 14 <br> Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an art form. But what we've seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others' motives and legitimacy. <br> On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate -- or a blind "us versus them" tribal mentality -- stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks. <br> Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues. <br> We know what we will do today. We will pray and we will come together. But what we do tomorrow is even more important. <br> John Kirby: Here's what we're sure of in the USS Fitzgerald collision <br> June 17 <br> First, we know the crew fought heroically to save their ship and the lives of their shipmates. We know that from early reports by Navy officials but also from the images that flashed across our screens, our tablets and our phones after the incident happened early Saturday. <br> One look at the crushed, twisted starboard side, the hoses flaked about, the water being discharged, the frantic work being done tells you all you need to know about the stuff you can't see in those same images: a fiercely brave crew working together to staunch the flooding, to rescue their shipmates and to save their ship. <br> You can be certain they ended up drenched, exhausted, scraped and bruised -- but not broken. They kept that ship from foundering for 16 brutal hours. And they brought her back into port. <br> Jen Psaki: Putin set a trap and Trump fell into it <br> July 7 <br> The Russians just played the President. It was predictable. And he let it happen. <br> On paper, Vladimir Putin should not have had the upper hand going into the meeting. <br> To start with, Russia has been living with sanctions put in place more than three years ago because of its annexation of Crimea. <br> And most Americans, save a few people including the President of the United States, are confident that Putin led the Russian intervention into the American election and into many other elections around the world. <br> President Obama booted out nearly three dozen spies in December and closed two compounds, and there are many, from both parties, calling for an additional round of sanctions on Russia. <br> We should have had some leverage. So what happened? <br> Jane Carr: What the white supremacist view of history leaves out <br> August 18 <br> The white supremacists in Charlottesville said they wanted to "defend history" by protesting efforts to take down Confederate monuments. They say they feel threatened. They fear the removal of "white stories" from our culture. <br> I used to teach African-American literature and cultural history. I wish I could tell them what real erasure looks like. I'd ask them to think about the memorials that never existed in public spaces in the South -- noting Richmond's past as a slave market, or the communities of free blacks who were terrorized by the installation of these Confederate monuments in the first place. To take down Charlottesville's statue of Robert E. Lee will not change the fact that all Virginia schoolchildren know his name, while the names of those who lived in the lost Charlottesville neighborhood of Vinegar Hill are forgotten. <br> I keep returning to the question: How can people who claim to love history get the meaning of history so very, very wrong? <br> Lev Golinkin: Jared and Ivanka are failing a basic moral test <br> August 19 <br> But the silence emanating from Jared and Ivanka was exponentially more powerful than any I'd heard before. To me, as a Jew, seeing nothing but two tweets from Ivanka brought the kind of pain I'm sure is echoed by African-Americans anytime Ben Carson defends the President, and Asian-Americans in the wake of Elaine Chao's and Nikki Haley's equivocations: condemning hate in general terms while carefully avoiding criticizing the very administration they're part of. <br> No press conference was forthcoming, no rejection of Donald Trump's words; there was no statement from Jared about the horror his grandparents had survived; nothing from Ivanka, who had spoken about standing up for mothers on the campaign trail, about defending today's Jewish children -- her children; indeed all children -- from intimidation and violence. There was nothing, but the sound of steady clicking on Ivanka's electronic device as she wrote two tweets. <br> It was like listening to the fabric of Judaism tear at itself. <br> Peniel Joseph: Can 'I Have a Dream' help us heal after Charlottesville? <br> August 26 <br> Fifty-four years later, King's legacy offers concrete ways of dealing with a contemporary racial landscape that has produced a sense of vertigo in large swaths of the American public. King's words remain a singular anchor for all those who believe in freedom; by speaking truth to power in a political climate more racially toxic than our own, King did more than dream about racial justice. <br> He challenged all of us to embrace a vision of a liberated future capable of touching individual hearts and minds as it traversed through the blood and veins of the body politic, on the way to creating a nation as good as the best of its citizens. <br> Alice Stewart: What Trump got right in Texas <br> August 30 <br> Hurricane Harvey is historic, not just in its size and scope, but in its significance as Donald Trump's first natural disaster test as President. His "darned if you do, darned if you don't" decision to visit South Texas on Tuesday, away from the rescue efforts, was the right call. Trump is demonstrating he has the compassion and commitment to meet the needs of victims of the deadly storm. <br> Critics blasted Trump for not meeting with victims directly to offer his personal condolences. Look, there's plenty of time for the powerful photos showing comfort, but now is the time for action -- not optics. These people are in the rescue and recovery mode, which can only be hampered by the distraction of a presidential visit. They need homes, not hugs; they need structure, not selfies, and they need funds, not a presidential flyover. <br> Unfortunately, every president has been forced to lead this country through natural or man-made disasters and faced the challenges of serving as consoler in chief: President Barack Obama had the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings; President George W. Bush had 9/11; President Bill Clinton met the challenge after the Oklahoma City bombing. All rose to the occasion. <br> Likewise, Trump is stepping up to the challenge, reassuring storm victims that resources are on the way. <br> LaQuishe Wright: Harvey survivor: The loss is hitting me in waves <br> September 1 <br> I woke up Friday morning and looked outside at a deceptively beautiful day. Beautiful because my two sons, Bry and Ryan, two dogs and I are safe and dry and the sun is shining again after days of endless rain. Deceptive because our entire life as we know it is submerged in 4 feet of water less than 20 minutes away. <br> To experience devastation like that brought by Hurricane Harvey feels very different from what you've probably seen on television. I was lucky enough to make it out of my house in Katy with my kids, my dogs, our cars and at least some of our belongings and memories. My neighbors' harrowing evacuations make me feel even luckier to have made it out safely, but I can't help but be concerned about what comes next for us. <br> Brooke Baldwin: Speaking like this to women in 2017? No way <br> September 18 <br> The newsroom around me fell silent. I was staring into the camera trying to make sense of what was unfolding on live television. I even caught my cameraman Jay's eyes in disbelief. I thought again: "It is 2017, and this grown man is on my show talking with me -- a female host -- about boobs. Is this seriously happening?" <br> And then I did something I've done only a handful of times in my career. I told the control room to kill his mic and said "bye." I invite a variety of people on my show with wide-ranging opinions -- sometimes even my jaw hits the floor, too -- but I let them speak. Whether it's left, right or center -- I want to expose my viewers to other perspectives. Agree with them or not, the nation needs to listen. <br> But this ... was different. <br> Eleanor McManus, Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin <br> October 26 <br> Fast forward several months later to when I graduated and asked for an informational meeting. I reached out to Mr. Halperin and he asked me to come see him. I was thrilled that someone from ABC News was willing to meet with me -- perhaps that was my way in the door. It was my first official meeting; I even had to buy a suit for the occasion. <br> I don't quite remember what we talked about, but I do remember him asking me to sit down next to him on the couch. I thought it was awkward to sit on the couch when I was perfectly comfortable sitting in the chair across from his desk. But I complied, and I also remember him sitting a little too close to me... <br> I'm telling my story publicly now because I hope that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not be so courteous and apologetic. I'm hoping women today will finally speak out in real time -- when this behavior happens. Women cannot stay silent for fear it will damage their careers, because that only allows the aggressor to continue his behavior with other women. <br> Marvin Washington: Kneeling isn't about patriotism -- it's a distress signal <br> October 14 <br> I spent 10 years playing in the NFL, won a Super Bowl and have been blessed beyond imagination -- in no small part because of the best fans in professional sports -- fans of multiple races, genders, religions and political persuasions. <br> I'm not confused about the role the fans played in my success and neither are the current players in the league. I understand that many NFL fans on both sides feel strongly about the National Anthem protests and the issues of race that underlie them -- so do I and so do the current players. I am an African-American who grew up in the 1960s and the vitriol that surged two Fridays ago, stoked by a speech delivered in Alabama no less, is eerily reminiscent for me of that dark time in our history. <br> Some players had been engaging in periodic protest long before President Donald Trump's fateful rally, but it's also fair to say this wasn't top of mind for most people before that rally. Trump suggested (mostly white) owners should fire any of the (mostly black) players on their teams who engaged in protest during the National Anthem, and he called them a profane name. <br> The protests, begun by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and now being carried on by current players, are not about patriotism -- they are about systemic racial inequality in the criminal justice system. They are about how communities of color are policed -- problems that experts on both sides agree on. <br> Nicole Stamp: What decent men can do in response to #MeToo <br> October 21 <br> 8. Don't use gendered or misogynist insults. Words like bitch, cunt, or slut only target women. Sissy, fairy and cuck demean feminine traits as lesser, weak and undesirable in men. Avoid those words. If you must insult someone, focus on their actions, not their body or their gender. <br> 9. Free kids from rigid gender roles. For boys and young men, you can role-model that activities and traits traditionally coded as "feminine" are valuable. Challenge dismissive ideas around what counts as "girl stuff." Delight in stories with strong female characters. Give a toddler boy a baby doll and praise his gentleness. Race trucks with a little girl. Give kids the tools and confidence to challenge and defy gender stereotypes. <br> 10. Don't focus on little girls' looks. Many people's first interaction with a young girl is to compliment her cuteness, prettiness or clothing. But this tells her -- and any boys nearby -- that beauty is her most interesting trait. Instead, ask little girls engaging, gender-neutral questions, like "What kind of toy is that? What subjects do you like in school? What's your favorite animal? Hey, what are you reading?" There are so many things to talk about. <br> Brianna Keilar: With my husband deployed, covering the news hits home <br> October 25 <br> The last few days the news has been dominated by a controversy over Trump's call to Myeshia Johnson, a Gold Star widow. She is just 24 years old and pregnant with her third child, mourning her husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in an ISIS ambush in Niger. ... <br> Moments of dignity and solemnity have been interrupted over and over by politics and vitriol and today, it seems, is no different. <br> I turn the television off and retweet the President's tweet, commenting, "As I'm watching 'Taking Chance' this tweet alerts on my phone. And that about sums up this week for me." <br> A few minutes later a man tweets at me: "It's telling that you are only now watching this. Been out for years. More evidence U and other media R in a bubble don't know real people." <br> I just can't let it go. <br> "My husband is on his sixth deployment right now. You don't know anything about me," I reply. <br> Don Lemon: Open letter to Trump: Please stop! <br> October 26 <br> Mr. Trump, please stop it. Please stop! <br> Think of what Sgt. Johnson would want. You are putting his widow in the terrible position of having to fight for her dignity when she should be concentrating on taking care of herself, her health, her two children, and the one on the way. <br> Listen to what Myeshia Johnson said this morning in an interview on ABC. <br> "The President said that he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways and I was -- it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband's name. The only way he remembered my husband's name because he told me he had my husband's report in front of him and that's when he actually said La David." <br> I know you have children -- and two daughters. <br> Can you imagine Ivanka or Tiffany in Myeshia's shoes? <br> Mel Robbins: Why Americans don't give a damn about mass shootings <br> November 6 <br> One month ago, the worst mass shooting in US history took place at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 people injured. Bill O'Reilly boiled the massacre down to six words: "This is the price of freedom." <br> I hate to say it, but he is right. Sunday, just 34 days after Vegas, 26 people were gunned down and about 20 others were wounded during a church service in Texas. And here's what is really sick -- we won't be surprised when there's another mass shooting next month. Maybe it'll be your church, your mall, your concert or your movie theater. That's the price of freedom. <br> In America, we are free to stockpile weapons. We are free to order ammo online. We are free to outfit our guns with bump stocks, like the Vegas shooter did. This is the price we pay for freedom, alright. The freedom to not give a damn. <br> Jessica Barth: We could have made Weinstein powerless <br> November 9 <br> It has taken me a few days to process the sudden explosion of allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and assault made against Harvey Weinstein. Each woman who steps forward leaves me with a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, I feel an overwhelming sense of relief and pride when I see women joining together to share their stories. On the other, I experience a sense of horror over the staggering number of accusers. Women stripped of their power, silenced and shamed. <br> I was one of them and recounted my own experience publicly last week. <br> In my own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, I have been made to feel as if I had to compromise my own convictions for the advancement of my career. I was made to believe that my talent and experience should take a back seat to my physical appearance. I was manipulated into believing I had "asked for it." And I was made to feel that if I spoke out or fought back, the repercussions would make me regret it. <br> Ann Moses: I watched fame take its toll on young David Cassidy <br> November 22 <br> When he got the "Partridge" gig, David was barely 20, and had very little life experience. He also had little or no support system when he became an overnight sensation. I watched it all happen, and later saw it all unravel, as I spent several days a week on the Partridge set, covering David and his co-stars, real-life stepmom Shirley Jones and Susan Dey. <br> At first, David was giddy to be appearing on a prime-time television series. He was cheerful and cooperative, which made my job easier as I worked every angle to come up with stories about this shiny-haired young man. ... <br> A few months later, the nice young man who'd kissed my mom on the cheek in thanks for looking after his puppies was pretty much gone. Whenever I appeared on set, David began to disappear between scenes -- during the times he had once joined me for interviews. I couldn't write about David's favorite snack food (dry-roasted peanuts) or his favorite color ("It depends on my mood") or how he felt about his neat new sports car if he was hiding from me all the time. <br> David Gergen: Trump's foolish war with the press <br> November 27 <br> In other words, we are witness to a war between Trump and the press, playing out every day in newspapers and television. Each morning brings a new revelation; each evening touches off a shouting match. It is difficult to remember any press secretary since Nixon's Ron Ziegler who has faced so much suspicion from the Fourth Estate. <br> Yet what is equally surprising is how oblivious this White House is to what has gone wrong and how to fix it. His team is as disdainful of history as it is of time-honored traditions about press-government relations. Either they suffer from massive incompetence or extraordinary arrogance. <br> History has been quite clear: The presidents who have built the best relationships with the press are those who respect its place in American life, have enjoyed a give and take with reporters and care about the truth. From Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt and Jack Kennedy to Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, press coverage has been much more favorable because those leaders in the Oval Office were not only good copy but men of character in their public lives. <br> Mark Bauerlein: Why Trump is still winning <br> December 5 <br> This is the real battle going on in D.C. today: not Democrats vs. Republicans but President Donald Trump vs. establishment Republicans. Trump is trampling upon every taboo and sensitivity that liberalism has erected in the last 50 years, and Republican leaders have learned to get by in that uptight habitat. ... <br> And now, the needle seems to tilt Trump's way. <br> This correction is not that hard to understand. You see, Trump has an invincible ally at the far end of the ideological spectrum. I don't mean the extreme right, the nationalists, paleoconservatives, and fringe groups that the media relentlessly tie to the President. He has better friends at the other pole, people on the far left who see the world only through the lens of race, gender, sexuality and victimhood. <br> Arianne Zucker, I have no fear, so 'Access Hollywood' tape will never define me <br> December 6 <br> Now that the "Access Hollywood" tape is back in the news after reports that Donald Trump questions its authenticity, I am puzzled for this reason: Just from experience, anyone who has ever been on television before, with a microphone pinned to them, should always assume that someone is listening. And when you get caught speaking poorly about someone, at least own up to it. <br> People ask me whether I need or want an individual apology from either now-President Trump or Billy Bush. Well, apologizing to me would be the appropriate thing to do. Am I losing sleep over it waiting for one? Absolutely not. <br> I refuse to let a situation such as this one take away my emotional power. You are who you allow yourself to be and I did not and will not let this event or any of its aftermath affect who I am as a woman, mother, daughter, friend and partner to a great man. 
 Republicans are euphoric. <br> After years of talking about tax reform on the campaign trail, a bill that cuts taxes, simplifies the code, and primes the American economy for more growth has passed the House and the Senate and is on its way to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. <br> This achievement was years in the making for House Speaker Paul Ryan, solidifying his place in history as a policy wonk with the political skills to see through something as complicated as changing the US tax code. He found enough common ground for what is often a fractured group of his party members to deliver a win on what is perhaps the last unifying issue for Republicans of all stripes: the idea that taxes should be lower. <br> As for Mitch McConnell, he erased the Steve Bannon-fueled narrative that the majority Republican conference isn't delivering for President Trump. Thanks to McConnell, Trump can claim victory on taxes and health care, as this bill achieves what some are calling a "stealth repeal" of Obamacare through the elimination of the individual mandate. <br> Watching the Democrats talk in cursive, warning of the End Times, should tell us what we need to know about their ability to credibly weaponize taxes for the midterms. I used to think Democrats would fall back on the same old tired class warfare bologna, but seeing their new rhetorical arsenal makes me almost pity them as they try to rekindle any sort of relationship with middle America. 
 As a CPA, I could be celebrating these loopholes. After all, I would be able to save my clients a lot on taxes and could be invited to fly along to, say, the Cayman Islands to set up an offshore account under the new regulations. Four days at the beach with a fully-stocked hotel minibar and all the HBO and Showtime programs I can watch -- all fully deductible for me and my client. Sounds nice, right? <br> Wrong. As someone who has served small businesses for more than 30 years, and co-chair of an organization called Businesses for Responsible Tax Reform, I am not cheering. Small business owners aren't cheering the bill either. <br> This change, if enacted, would encourage wealthy businesses to learn how to go offshore to gain a more favorable tax rate than is available within our borders -- giving them a significant financial and competitive advantage over our neighborhood mom and pops trying to stay afloat onshore. <br> As professionals who parse the concrete numbers, not the airy promises of our leaders in Congress, accountants like me are in a position to know the truth about this bill. You can't fool the accountants. <br> At the same time, no one should be trying to fool America's small businesses, either. The GOP tax plan does little to help America's small businesses. Instead it is an enormous transfer of wealth to large companies and wealthy families paid for by the middle class and America's hardworking small business owners. <br> Congress must stand up and do what's right for small businesses, the backbone of our economy. This means lawmakers need to end this charade, go back to the drawing board, and thoughtfully and deliberately develop a plan based on sound economic policies that actually help real small businesses. 
 How sad is it that the party that brought us John F. Kennedy's tax cuts, economic growth and higher wages is now the party that puts redistribution ahead of prosperity. <br> JFK knew that America's biggest problem was not the budget deficit but a growth deficit. And based on Donald Trump's proposed tax cuts, he seems to share JFK's wisdom. <br> In 1997, Bill Clinton -- who admittedly raised taxes in 1993 -- signed into law one of the biggest bipartisan tax cuts in history, including a slashing of the capital gains tax. Although some argue that Clinton's tax cuts were not the cause of the economic prosperity that followed, I don't think it was a mere coincidence that America experienced a growth and employment boom so great that the budget reached a surplus. <br> Question: does that sound like Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer, or Donald Trump? 
 Tax plans can be hard to decipher, but with each passing day, women and moms across the country understand more clearly how the GOP tax plans — both the US Senate and the House versions -- will affect their families and our economy. <br> At MomsRising, we hear from moms -- from Alaska to Alabama -- every day and they are telling us they are terrified. Over the last few weeks, we've seen rumblings of concern turn to full-fledged alarm about what this tax plan will mean for America's women. Their worries are certainly justified. <br> Economic inequality for women is a huge weakness for our nation, and the GOP proposed tax plans in the US House and Senate could turn that disaster into a national calamity. <br> The women of America know that it's not OK to raise taxes for millions of people while gutting essential provisions that boost our access to health care, education and housing, and that fuel our economy. That's not smart economic policy. We also know that it's not OK to starve the federal budget in ways that are sure to put Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Head Start and other essential programs on the chopping block. <br> It's also not OK to pretend trickle-down economics is going to work now, when it never has before. <br> The women of America also know these GOP tax plans don't reflect our values, don't recognize our contributions, and don't boost our economy. Most heartbreaking of all, we know that the GOP tax plan, which is being rushed through even though it's the most comprehensive tax reform bill in decades, takes an ax to the American dream for many of our children. <br> Members of Congress who vote to pass the GOP tax plan do so at their own risk. Women are watching, counting this vote, and will remember this at re-election time. It's time for congressional Republicans to rethink their approach, invest in programs that help reduce income inequality and boost our economy, and open the doors to opportunity, instead of slam them shut. 
 This isn't some "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" faux idealism; it's actually happening and there is a growing group of us who believe that progress is more important than partisanship. We believe that getting to "yes" where it makes sense -- on health care, DACA and border security, infrastructure, and the budget -- is more important than obstruction just for the sake of it. <br> Earlier this year, we used this approach to engage our House colleagues in discussions about how to form an organized bipartisan bloc. Eventually, these efforts culminated in creating the Problem Solvers Caucus, the first bipartisan caucus of its kind. Some scoffed. For the better part of the last quarter century, they pointed out, the House of Representatives has been defined by a winner-take-all mentality. The majority holds the gavels and the power, rarely even acknowledging ideas from members across the aisle. So, how would a bipartisan caucus wield any real influence? <br> But that wasn't their only objection. Even if the Problem Solvers managed to drive bipartisan action in the House, many doubted the Senate would ever follow suit. If the House is dominated by majority rule, then the Senate is known for the fact that one person can stop the body in its tracks. In short, there was little reason to believe we could effectively counteract an entrenched system that drives the majority party to ram through its agenda and compels the minority party to exert maximum resistance. <br> Today, we can say proudly that our detractors were wrong -- even if our Caucus and this Congress still have a great deal of work left to do for the American people. The bipartisan health care proposal the Problem Solvers Caucus unveiled in July, designed to stabilize the individual health care marketplace and lower premiums, was the very first bipartisan plan to fix health care. <br> The work put in by our bipartisan members over many late nights and long meetings paved the way for those on the other side of the Capitol to come to the table, too. And now, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray released a plan last month, proving our bipartisan work could break through institutional barriers on Capitol Hill. <br> As the Alexander-Murray plan weaves through Congress, the Problem Solvers Caucus has been meeting for months on how best to bring tax relief to hardworking families, small businesses and the American people. The House has passed its plan and the Senate is considering its own version. <br> We will disagree with certain tax policy changes, but we firmly agree on this point -- the best way to achieve lasting tax reform is on a bipartisan path. It worked three decades ago for President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill, when a plan for a simpler tax system was signed into law with support from both parties. Depending on what happens this week, our Caucus may still play a role in bridging a divide. <br> Now that Senators Collins and Manchin have agreed to become honorary co-chairs of No Labels, we will be working closely with them -- this represents a rare opportunity for a bipartisan bridge between the House and Senate. <br> Here's the hard truth everyone needs to acknowledge: The absence of bipartisanship has made it almost impossible for either party to govern. We saw that with health care, and now we need to avoid a similar path with tax reform. It's a vicious cycle. <br> Now we are weeks away from all federal funding expiring. The need for a long-term bipartisan budget agreement couldn't be more clear. Neither party wins when nothing gets done. But the real victims are the American people who depend on Washington to tackle the nation's big challenges with a common sense approach. <br> This is why you'll find Problem Solvers, even at long, odd hours in the Capitol, seated together around a large table, debating and negotiating to solve the issues that will shape the future of our America. It's also why we're so grateful to Senators Collins and Manchin for taking up the same cause of bipartisan cooperation in the Senate. Whether or not our cause is popular inside the Washington beltway -- it's liable to be pilloried by those who do better the worse Washington gets -- we now know it can work. We're not giving up on governing to get things done for the American people. 
 This commentary contains graphic language. <br> Like most women (and, I hope, most men), I have read the recent torrent of sexual harassment and abuse stories with horror and dismay. The graphic detail of each incident shocks and infuriates me. I usually can't get through an article in one sitting. It's like watching a horror movie: I instinctively cover my eyes at the scary scenes. Sadly, after 25 years in politics, the "movie" is quite familiar. <br> Each time I stop reading, my thoughts turn first to my children. I have a 19-year old daughter and a 15-year old son. I ask myself if I've done enough to give my daughter the strength and confidence to know what to do if a colleague, a boss, a boyfriend, or anyone ever assaults or harasses her. <br> Have we told her enough times that her father and I will support her and be prepared to fight alongside her (or just kick his ass)? Have I told my son enough times that he should never, ever force a girl into doing anything that she is uncomfortable doing? That he should step in if he sees anyone attempting to assault another person? Have my husband and I explained enough times that he should ask permission to kiss or even hold a girl's hand? Does he understand that sexual assault is really about power, not sex? <br> Have we told them all this enough? <br> My worry for my kids soon turns to anger at these powerful men. As I read, I see my younger self in the victim's stories. Certainly, any woman over 40 probably has her own "Me Too" story. Not all of us have stories of assault or rape. But, I believe we each have a story of a time we were sexually demeaned or humiliated by a superior. And like these women who have come forward, I remember every detail of those incidents. Incidents that are decades old stick in your brain, which is why I believe the women. <br> I am profoundly grateful to the brave women who have told their stories. They have changed the way that we, as a society and culture, look at sexual harassment. Powerful men have been fired, ostracized and ruined. They are finally paying a price for, in some instances, decades of abuse. Yes, you can feel the sea change. <br> As more politicians face allegations, we cannot apply traditional partisanship in our reactions to their stories. I cannot read the stories about Roy Moore and John Conyers (both accused of accused of sexual harassment; both deny it) and react as anything other than a mother. To truly hear these women -- to honor their courage -- I have to put my partisan hat far, far away. <br> The response from the White House on Roy Moore is tragic. Sarah Sanders argues the difference between Sen. Al Franken and Donald Trump is that "Franken admitted to wrongdoing and the President hasn't." Sanders reminds me of Roy Moore's comments to one of his alleged victims, Beverly Young Nelson. After allegedly assaulting her in his car, Nelson said that Moore told her: "You're just a child. ... I am the district attorney of Etowah County and if you tell anyone about this, no one will ever believe you." <br> Later, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway argued that a vote against Roy Moore is a vote against tax reform -- saying, in essence, that by standing up for an alleged child molester, Republicans in Alabama can help deliver the political win Republicans need for the 2018 midterms. <br> We are truly in a bad place when the President of the United States would rather elect a man accused by two credible women of allegedly assaulting them sexually when they were young teenagers than lose another legislative battle before the 2018 midterms. Note to Trump: Write a tax bill that actually helps the middle class, and you won't need the alleged child molester. <br> Of course, putting away my partisan hat means I have to acknowledge my own decisions over the years. I worked on Bill Clinton's 1992 and 1996 campaigns and in the Clinton White House. Like every Clinton White House staffer I know, I'm proud of my service and President Clinton's record. Like every Clinton White House staffer I know, I never took the allegations against him lightly. But that doesn't mean I took them seriously enough. <br> I lumped Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky in with partisan attacks about Whitewater and crazy Vince Foster murder plots. I saw Clinton as "the Comeback Kid" and our White House as a continuation of the famous "war room" that elected him. When it's all "us" vs. "them" polarization, you lose perspective. <br> Each of us who defended President Clinton by dismissing his accusers needs to reckon with it. <br> I'm not sure what there is to do about Bill Clinton now. He paid a steep price, was impeached, humiliated his family, and tarnished an otherwise impressive legacy. He is not on any ballot, nor will he ever be again. <br> One thing we can do is drop the nonsense of minimizing his relationship with Monica Lewinsky as a "consensual blow job." The issue, then and now, is not sex. It is power. That is the common factor in all these allegations of sexual harassment by men in high places, including President Clinton and President Trump. <br> Sexual harassment is not a political issue. It's not about Democrat vs. Republican. It's about the victim. The stories of the victims are horrifying, scary, and disgusting. We need to listen. We need to believe them. We need to talk to our daughters and our sons about them. We, as a society, need to do better. 
 When I was little, my family spent some time on public assistance. So I learned at a young age that the best way to lift people out of poverty and into the middle class is to expand economic opportunity. Creating well-paying jobs allows for the social mobility that is often unattainable for families when they are dependent on government assistance. People thrive with the dignity of self-reliance. <br> The US tax code works against this principle. <br> The tax code is built upon bad fiscal policy, which is, needless to say, bad for the nation. We have to find a better way to operate. <br> On Thursday, the House passed a tax reform bill, and the Senate has advanced its own tax proposal, both of which would be a big step toward remedying some of these ills. <br> In different ways, the House and Senate bills would cut back on the deductibility of state and local taxes (SALT). This provision has generated some strong pushback, but let's consider what this means for a minute. <br> How is it fair that residents of low-tax states are left subsidizing the bad choices made by lawmakers in other states? Why should two people with similar incomes and similar life situations who live perhaps miles apart near a state line be treated so differently? <br> The answer, of course, is politics. <br> Talk about immoral. That's time parents could be spending with their kids. That's money small business owners could be investing in their stores, their employees, their futures. <br> Then there's the unfairness of it. <br> What we're left with is a two-tiered system in which some are the movers and shakers, and the rest of us are just left shaking with rage at the injustice of it all. <br> Will either the Senate or House tax reform measures fix all these problems? Of course not. What legislation ever solved a problem completely? Deals are cut, compromises are necessary, politics continues to be played. <br> But both bills include provisions that constitute an improvement over the status quo. <br> Lower rates on individuals mean more money in the pockets of taxpayers, and corporate rate cuts benefit everybody. These reforms should not be viewed as "tax cuts for the rich." Instead, they are tax cuts that enrich us all. <br> Bitter partisanship should not preclude Washington from doing the right thing and fixing the unfairness that permeates the tax code. It's time to move away from a convoluted and arcane system that discourages economic growth and baffles most of us, toward a simpler, fairer system that creates opportunity for all. 
 Dear Sens. Susan Collins, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, Ron Johnson, John McCain and Lisa Murkowski: <br> I fear for the future of our country. I know that you do as well. You are patriots first and partisans a distant second. <br> We are at a defining moment in our history: The tax cuts just passed by the House and the last-minute changes to health care proposed by the Senate leadership could put our country into a tailspin. <br> Congress members and pundits tell us that Republicans need to pass tax cuts to appease their party's mega-donors. Senators, patriots need to protect the future for our children and grandchildren. <br> I also opposed the bipartisan deal in 2012 to make permanent most of the Bush-era "temporary" tax cuts, for the same reason. My Democratic friends took exception with me both times. I told them that the country's future comes before the party. <br> This CBO projection is actually too optimistic. It assumes modest interest rates for decades and no major new outlays for the military or for coping with climate change, and no meaningful increases in federal spending on science, technology, education, labor, infrastructure, low-income families, children in poverty and other pressing needs. It assumes no major stumbles in the economy, such as occurred in 2008. <br> By some estimates, the long-run "fiscal gap" between outlays and taxes, measuring both in net present value, is now more than $100 trillion. That is more than five times today's national income. <br> Perhaps taxpayers have come to believe that the public debt and unfunded liabilities not yet on the books do not matter. Too many politicians of both parties have pretended as much over the years. Yet debts must be paid and unfunded net liabilities must be closed. <br> This may make it seem that poor taxpayers will gain slightly while rich taxpayers would obviously gain a lot. In fact, the poor and working class will almost surely end up far worse off than now. When steps are taken to close the deficit, programs like Medicare will face the ax, or payroll taxes will rise. The bottom half will end up paying much more than they gain in the meager tax cuts allocated to them. <br> This is just basic fiscal arithmetic: If you make massive transfers to the rich, the rest of society will pick up the bill. <br> As you know well, senators, most economic models show large and persistent budget deficits as a result of the House proposals.Even if there is some modest economic growth down the road, the tax losses will come up front while any growth effects will come later. In fact, we should not expect much, if any, added growth. Some sectors might benefit slightly (manufacturing) while others (commercial and residential buildings) are likely to be hit. <br> Even the Senate legislation would make many of the incentive provisions temporary, raising uncertainty and limiting or eliminating any incentive effect from the very start. The only sure effect would be the enormous tax saving of the rich and the enormous rise in the budget deficit. <br> Even worse, our competitors are likely to match the US corporate tax cuts in a global race to the bottom. All countries will end up losing tax revenues with no net gains in growth. <br> Rather than slashing the statutory tax rate, the best tax policy to spur new business investments would be to expand the provisions for accelerated depreciation and expensing. <br> The high statutory rate would continue to collect federal revenues on pre-existing investments and on monopoly profits; the accelerated depreciation and expensing would lower the marginal effective tax rate on new investments. <br> Yet such a preferred policy would also have to be made up by raising tax revenues elsewhere, both to pay for the accelerated depreciation and to move towards closing the long-term fiscal gap. <br> Real tax reform would also include an end to the abusive transfers of intellectual property to overseas tax havens by America's largest companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Facebook, and Microsoft; an end to the carried interest loophole by wealthy CEOs of hedge funds and private equity funds; an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers; and a tax on carbon emissions so that fossil fuels pay their true social cost. None of these are in the House tax cut. <br> Real tax reform certainly would not repeal the estate tax paid by the mega-rich, a clear and ruthless wealth grab by the President and his Cabinet of billionaires. <br> Real tax reform would not make incentive effects temporary, such as the Senate proposal to eliminate expensing of investments after five years. The phase-out of key incentives exposes the hypocrisy of the tax-cut effort. If the real goal is to improve incentives, then do so, but pay for them honestly. To propose eliminating incentives within a few years makes clear that the real aim is to transfer trillions of dollars to the richest Americans. <br> Americans want a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, as expressed by the great Republican President, Abraham Lincoln. They do not want a government of the ultra-rich, by the ultra-rich, and for the ultra-rich. Americans want to be able to compete in world markets without the government suffocated by debt. Please protect our nation from fiscal disaster at the hands of a few greedy donors to the Republican Party. <br> With respect, <br> Jeffrey D. Sachs, university professor, Columbia University 
 This reform proposal makes it clear that Republicans are not interested in advancing policies that benefit anyone but their most deep-pocketed donors. Meanwhile, Asian-Americans watch as Trump and the party he leads continue to threaten trade war with China, nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and a war on the basic American values of birthright citizenship and family reunification immigration. It doesn't sound like they'll be winning back the vote of the fastest-growing population in America anytime soon. 
 And local groups around the country have been watching closely to see if success in Maine could herald potential success in their own states. <br> Take Kathleen Phelps of Wilton, Maine. <br> Now Phelps will finally be covered by Medicaid. There are millions of Americans just like her, having to make life or death choices because they can't get coverage. Our elected leaders have a moral obligation to fight for people without care, and when they avoid that responsibility, citizens will take action to control their own destiny. <br> There has been much debate in Washington about what "the people" want. But the people have been quite clear. Americans of every political persuasion want affordable and comprehensive health care for themselves, their families and for the most vulnerable in their communities. In fact, just this week, with no marketing or publicity from the federal government, a record number of people signed up for health coverage under the ACA in the first few days of open enrollment. <br> It was such "repeal and replace" attempts this year that sparked a national awakening, showing that our collective voices can have real power: Supporters of the Affordable Care Act blocked an effort in Congress to overturn it and dismantle our nation's safety net. It felt like the entire nation was sitting on the edge of its seat in July as Sen. John McCain followed his colleagues, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, and delivered the last word with his thumbs down vote. <br> And more recently, President Donald Trump bluntly called for undermining the ACA by eliminating the individual mandate as part of the tax reform package, which would raise the cost of health care for those who need it most. <br> Fortunately, in the face of this relentless attack on our health care, Maine has demonstrated that ballot initiatives are a powerful way for Americans to go on offense in support of their quality of life. At a time when everyone expects health care to go in one direction -- with fewer people getting more expensive coverage -- voters stood up with one voice and said "no" to political gamesmanship and insisted on taking care of the most vulnerable. It won't be the last time. 
 How do you run in the era of Trump? As a Democrat, evidently.   <br> The first two gubernatorial elections since President Donald Trump took office went in favor of Democratic candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. The lesson to be learned is that this is not about the personalities; it's about the base. Clearly, the Democratic base is more motivated. <br> In Virginia, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam beat former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. Two blue states, serving up a black eye to the GOP in this off year election. <br> The Virginia and New Jersey races are a shot in the arm for beleaguered Democrats still reeling from the 2016 presidential loss. <br> As for the GOP, this double defeat is another wake-up call for Republicans in the House and Senate to work together on meaningful tax reform. Democratic momentum in the absence of GOP legislative accomplishments is not a good way to kick off a midterm election year. <br> Democrats realized this was not a margin to take for granted, especially with the late-breaking momentum behind Gillespie. <br> Despite the results, Gillespie did run a smart campaign. In a state where Donald Trump is not popular, Gillespie kept the President at arm's length. He did not bring President Trump into Virginia to campaign and did not seek his support. He did, however, work to rally Trump supporters by focusing on issues that are important to them: immigration and protecting Confederate statues. <br> As soon as the dust settled and the race was called for Northam, President Trump didn't waste any time before criticizing Gillespie, tweeting that he "worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for." <br> In essence, he was sending the message that "Trumpism without Trump will not work." <br> This was a hard-fought loss. The Republican National Committee did spend nearly $5 million dollars on helping to elect Gillespie, putting 100 staffers on the ground, and making nearly 3 million door knocks, RNC officials tell me. <br> Democratic leaders in Virginia tell me their get out the vote effort was also strong. They knocked on more than a million doors, made more than a million calls and sent out more than a million-and-a-half texts. <br> It helped that Virginia is a blue state, led by current Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is term-limited out. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in the Old Dominion by five points. Former President Obama won Virginia in 2008 and 2012.    <br> Northam, a pediatrician and former Army reservist, connected with Democrats with his low-key demeanor and ability to moderate some positions. 
 If passed, the bill would eliminate a deduction on interest paid on student loans, a move that has borrowers up in arms. And while the student loan interest deduction could certainly stand to be improved, eliminating it entirely is the wrong approach. <br> In other words, someone who took on large debts to pay for an advanced degree is likely making much better money than a person who never enrolled in college at all, and the student loan interest deduction benefits only the former. <br> These differences are not just theoretical: Despite income limits on who can claim the student loan interest deduction, actual tax claims support the idea that high-income borrowers benefit more. <br> It's clear the deduction could do much more for low-income families. But that's not what the GOP has proposed. <br> Some of these are indeed aimed at middle-class taxpayers, including an increase in the standard deduction, but the combined changes make it hard for the average Americans to fully understand how their net tax liability will change if the GOP bill becomes law. 
 What do we see? <br> The same old, same old: massive treats for the rich and confusing tricks for the rest of us. <br> These treats for the rich go a long way to adding $1.5 trillion to our national debt -- a trick for the future to figure out how to pay. <br> How can we tell who "wins" and who "loses" in a very narrow, immediate sense? To be precise, most ordinary folk likely will have to wait until April, 2019 -- after the midterm elections -- when we fill out tax returns for the 2018 year. <br> Trick or treat? You be the judge. <br> When all the dust settles, we end up where we started, where Republicans have always been. As confusing as it is to figure out the many losers from this proposed law, it is abundantly clear who the winners are: America's plutocrats, including the man in the White House. <br> Happy Halloween, rich kids. 
 Thirty-one years ago this week, President Ronald Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 into law. This date is particularly significant: It was the last time Congress and the president worked together to overhaul our tax code. <br> The world today looks vastly different from the world in 1986. It is much more connected, globalized and driven by new technologies and the internet. But our tax code is stuck in the days where the Chicago Bears were winning the Super Bowl and "Top Gun" was number one at the box office. <br> We need a simpler tax code that puts more money back into the pockets of workers and families. <br> Our sky-high corporate rates, combined with our outdated global tax system incentivizes companies to ship jobs and capital overseas, directly contributing to lagging economic and wage growth. <br> Our updated system would provide clarity and simplicity. Under our proposed plan, the vast majority of taxpayers would be able to fill out their returns in a matter of minutes. <br> This change would make the United States a more attractive place to grow and start a business, meaning more investment and innovation here at home. <br> Tax reform was important in 1986, and it is equally important today. We cannot maintain the status quo, and failure to enact meaningful tax reform would mean further damage to our economy and a lower quality of life for Americans. <br> The American people need us to succeed. And we don't intend to let them down. 
 Still, Trump is correct that the GOP Senate passed this budget Thursday to pave the way for massive tax cuts. And Trump is also correct that the "MSM" -- the mainstream media -- has not covered this story the way it deserves. <br> But that's where we part company. Trump wants the media to pat him on the back for the budget passing and for his proposed tax cuts. In contrast, I want the media to highlight for our fellow Americans that the budget passed by the GOP-controlled Senate would massively cut both Medicare and Medicaid in order to give the richest Americans a big, fat and unnecessary tax cut. <br> And as Trump stated in his tweet, all of these proposed budget cuts are designed to give "the biggest tax cut in U.S. history." And who will benefit from this gargantuan tax cut? Well, again, you don't need to be an expert to know that when the Republicans are in control of government, the rich often benefit the most. <br> Recent reports indicate that House Republicans may simply adopt the Senate approved plan because they are feeling pressure not just from Trump but also from wealthy GOP donors, who have threatened to put up challengers against sitting congressmen if they fail to deliver. <br> The reality is that if American citizens don't vocally oppose the proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, why wouldn't the GOP Congress simply approve it? As a reminder, the GOP's attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace with a far inferior plan was only defeated because Americans -- both on the left and the right -- stood up and objected. <br> That is why those who oppose these cuts must speak up now. If not, then expect Medicare, Medicaid and other safety net programs to be slashed so that the GOP can give a tax cut that primarily benefits the top earners in America -- the ones who need it least. 
 Why? Because our problem is not our tax burden. Our problem is low wages. If economic growth is truly the goal, raising workers' wages should be our national focus, not cutting taxes. <br> The debate over economic growth, then, should really rest on three simple ideas. We have plenty of money in the richest nation in human history. We should not cut taxes if we want to have a society that works. We should make sure everyone earns a decent paycheck. 
 "Saturday Night Live" typically satirizes the political events of the previous week. But this weekend, "SNL" took a shot at forecasting what Trump's next culture war will be: Demanding every store employee say "Merry Christmas" this holiday season. <br> And if Trump's record is any indication, "SNL" is probably spot on. <br> Later we see "Pence" at a Starbucks on the phone with Baldwin, who asks, "Do the cups say 'Merry Christmas' or 'Happy Holidays'?" "Pence" explains that it's still too early in the year for Christmas cups -- and that instead the cups read, "'Pumpkin Spice is back'" To which Baldwin replies, "Get out of there, Mike!" <br> In this sketch, "SNL" makes it clear what we can expect from Trump this holiday season: a war on "Happy holidays." In fact, Trump insinuated as much on Friday when he spoke at the Values Voter Summit, a right-wing event sponsored by the Family Research Council -- an organization committed to upholding "traditional" family values. <br> And when Trump thinks his base likes something he is saying, he will double, triple and even quadruple down on it. <br> In this same vein, there's little doubt that come this holiday season Trump will use Twitter to attack stores that don't mandate their employees say "Merry Christmas." We may even see Trump declare that stores saying "Happy Holidays" are losing business and possibly suggest a boycott of those stores until every employee wishes shoppers "Merry Christmas." <br> The reason we can expect Trump's war on happy holidays is simple. Like with the NFL controversy, it's part of Trump's twofold strategy. First, it plays to his base. With the NFL debate, Trump framed it as an issue of patriotism and respect for our flag and armed forces. That plays well with his right-wing base the same way demanding everyone say "Merry Christmas" will play well with his conservative Christian base. <br> Second, these issues distract from Trump's failed record of legislative accomplishments. There has been no Affordable Care Act repeal as Trump promised (though his recent executive orders have certainly undermined it). There has been no comprehensive tax reform yet. There is no shiny new wall along the Mexican border. And the list goes on. <br> So, come this December, don't expect a politics-free holiday season. Prepare for divisive and ugly partisan divides in stores across America. After all, in Trump's America, why should we expect the holidays to be any different than the rest of the year? 
 The emergence of two new fronts in President Donald Trump's war on the Republican establishment endangers his ability to deliver on his campaign promises. <br> Last weekend may prove to have been a pivotal moment in the Trump presidency. It might determine whether he succeeds in enacting his agenda -- or if his presidency will simply be a series of reactions to weather emergencies and world crises. <br> Trump needs Corker more than Corker needs Trump, especially now that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman has announced his retirement. In fact, Trump needs all Senate Republicans (minus two) to enact tax reform, which was already on life support before the social media slap fight. <br> That makes six of 52 Senate Republicans whose relationship with the President (or disdain for his agenda) has endangered the GOP's ability to keep its campaign promises. <br> Only Ted Cruz is getting a pass from Bannon, according to reports, which is curious since he actually votes with Trump less frequently than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. <br> That's 12 of 52 Republicans who find themselves in Trump World's crosshairs in one way or another. And that doesn't even count McConnell, who has voted with the President 96% of the time, led the charge on filling a Supreme Court vacancy, tried mightily to repeal Obamacare, and is now working feverishly to cobble together the votes on tax reform. <br> The President attacked McConnell this summer and apparently holds him responsible for the times when McCain, Collins, and others on Trump's naughty list didn't go along with his program. I suspect the President's relationship with these wayward senators has more to do with their voting records than their relationships with McConnell. <br> These people are supposed to be one big happy Republican family, although some are distant cousins who have clearly never met and are now forced to sit next to each other at Thanksgiving dinner. To succeed in passing an agenda, this family must pull itself together sooner rather than later. Trump's war on Corker and Bannon's war on the establishment complicate matters even further. <br> Meanwhile, the average Republican voter, who cast a vote for sweeping change in 2016, must be thinking: "What the hell is going on here?" 
 America is standing at a crossroads. We face a historic opportunity to lift American workers up, grow paychecks, create more jobs and out-compete the rest of the world. We have the chance to boost manufacturing in the United States and strengthen the backbone of our economy: American manufacturing workers. Tax reform is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. <br> In addition to the personal toll of high taxes, which raise the costs of living for everyone, American manufacturing workers face increasingly fierce competition from overseas. This threatens both job creation and economic growth here at home. There is no question that federal tax policies put American companies at a clear disadvantage. <br> Our international competitors know this. They have modernized their tax systems to make it more attractive to do business in their countries. The United States, on the other hand, hasn't reformed our tax code since 1986, when the world looked dramatically different. <br> If you're like me, you look at today's outdated tax code and ask: What are we doing to ourselves? What are we doing to American businesses and workers? We get to write our own rules, so why are we writing rules that penalize success, harm families and give our competitors an advantage? <br> The longer we fail to act on tax reform, the more time other countries have to gain an edge on the United States. The more we wait, the less money we will invest in research and development for new technologies or lifesaving breakthroughs. <br> Those who defend the current tax code are defending a manufacturing worker in Ohio losing a job to a worker overseas. They are defending less innovation and fewer technological and medical discoveries. They are defending years of tightening family budgets, stagnant wages and communities losing hope. <br> In a country with so much incredible potential, it's indefensible. But we can do something about it by modernizing our tax code to promote the type of economic growth and job creation that will raise personal incomes, reduce the costs of living and make lives better for everyone. So many Americans are struggling to get by, with no hope for saving for the future, much less retirement. We can change this -- and fast. <br> First, to stay ahead of the curve, we must cut tax rates for all businesses. Manufacturers have long championed a 15% rate for those organized as corporations. We are encouraged that the framework agreed upon by White House and congressional leaders has gotten close to that. <br> We also need similar significant reductions for the two-thirds of manufacturers -- mostly small businesses -- that are organized as pass-throughs and pay taxes at the individual rate. Small manufacturers are the heart of our industry, and small businesses drive our economy, so it's time for the tax code to stop treating them like an afterthought. <br> Second, the United States needs to catch up with the rest of the world and implement a territorial tax system, which would allow companies to be taxed once on overseas earnings. Today, if a US company wants to reinvest its overseas earnings in our American facilities, workers and communities, we get hit with a second, hefty tax bill that many of our overseas competitors do not. Why would we want to discourage companies from investing more in American workers? <br> Third, we need a system that encourages businesses to make the kind of investments, such as new equipment, that empowers them to expand their companies, sell to more customers and ultimately create new jobs. Manufacturers also need strong research and development incentives to promote the kind of innovation that drives our country forward. <br> That is why manufacturers are all in on tax reform. If our leaders can improve the tax code for American workers, we will be able to tackle so many more of the challenges our country faces -- from job creation to community development, from health care to education. <br> It is up to President Donald Trump and Congress to seize this opportunity to modernize the tax code. They said they will -- and said they will do so this year. On behalf of the more than 12 million Americans who work in manufacturing, we encourage our leaders to be bold and determined and do what is right and best for all Americans: Reform the tax code -- now. 
 While much of the American public never ceases to be amazed at the President's tweets, antics or declarations from the stump, those who have known him for years take it in stride. "This is who he is," says a longtime ally, referring to the NFL take-a-knee conflict. "He triples down, and he thinks this all is great." <br> Huh? He's got a disaster in Puerto Rico (not to mention two others in Texas and Florida), a failed health care bill, a pending tax reform fight, a potential deal on Dreamers that could anger his base -- oh, and by the way, a confrontation with North Korea that reaches new rhetorical excesses daily. <br> But he's obsessively tweeting about the NFL -- or Steph Curry refusing to pay homage at the White House (President to Warriors: Don't come). Over and over again. More than 20 times. <br> So what's he thinking? First, says a friend, "he thinks all of this is great for him. He says that his base and most of America agree with him." Indeed, the President told this friend, "I say what they all want to say." The feeling, he adds, is that the President believes he is "doing what he was sent to Washington to do, to chip away at all of these establishment notions in places where people are afraid to go." <br> But not brave Donald Trump. He's so brave that he's willing to cast aside the First Amendment so those "sons of bitches," as the President calls them, don't take a knee as a form of protest when the anthem is played. Instead, he'd like them fired. Maybe it's not such a brave move, especially considering that what he cares about is deeply political: playing to his base of support with his version of patriotism. He knew it would play well when he campaigned in Alabama the other night. That way, if his base is jittery over his deals with the Democrats, he can throw them a bone. Or a flag. <br> It's intuitive, this Trump MO. When doing the CNN documentary on candidate Trump last year, I spoke with Louise Sunshine, a vice president of the Trump Organization for a dozen years in the seventies and eighties. Something she said about Trump's management style stuck with me: "Donald has always managed to walk into a meeting and say something nobody else ever expected him ever to say, upend the entire meeting, leave everybody agog and control every situation that way..." <br> Well, there you go. Only now it's not a small business meeting, but a national conversation. And we follow him around like moths to a flame. One minute, it's North Korea. But wait. There's an incendiary tweet on the NFL. Onto that field. <br> Unfortunately for Trump, criticism is impossible to avoid if you're president. And so this President becomes consumed by grievance. And he's equal opportunity: whether it's about his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, or about Hillary Clinton or the NFL or the size of the crowd at his inauguration. No slight is too small to be dealt with by the most powerful man in the world. <br> He'll come at you, as he did in his real estate glory days when he even posed as his own press secretary to sing his own praises and critique others in Trumpian fashion. But there's a difference: Former employee Sunshine recalled that, back in the day, when he got bad press, she would run into his office and say, "Look, Donald, this is terrible," and he would tell her to calm down, reminding her that all publicity is good publicity. <br> This is a different time and a different job. Somehow, the man can't match this moment. 
 It's not that nothing has been done on the Hill. However, the American people are not enthralled with what we've accomplished so far. To this point, we've come up short and our voters have every right to demand not just the goals but the strategy and the action steps to fulfill these past promises. <br> We can parse the meaning of the 2016 election all we want, but one thing is clear: it was a mandate election. <br> Republicans need to remember the corollary to any mandate: if you do not deliver, voters will find others who will. I know that this message was clear to my colleagues during the August district work period. Even supporters and friends are confused at why the significant items we promised have not been written into law. <br> I am confident that the American people will deliver their final grade on Republicans over the next three months based on three things: repealing and replacing Obamacare, passing tax reform, and increasing border security. If Republicans cannot achieve results on these endeavors, do we deserve our majorities in both houses? <br> The group which I lead, the Republican Study Committee, is renewing these promises to the American people. We are calling on all Republicans in Congress and the White House to do the same. We must deliver before the calendar reads 2018. <br> Repeal Obamacare <br> Obamacare should be the easiest of the three. After all, the House of Representatives voted more than 50 times to repeal the law that destroyed our health insurance markets through skyrocketing premiums and fewer options. If we cannot deliver anything on Obamacare, Republicans are guilty of false promises and political malpractice. To be fair, the House already did our job in passing the American Health Care Act this year. <br> We must continue to push for repeal, including dismantling the most damaging aspects of the law like the individual mandate, employer mandate, medical device tax, and the provision that gives employers an incentive to use part time workers rather than hire full timers. <br> We should also pass common-sense replacement policies, like expanding how much money employees can contribute to their health savings accounts (HSAs) and selling insurance across state lines, which would increase competition. We have just a few days before Mitch McConnell's September 30th deadline to enact health care changes with a 51- rather than 60-vote majority in the Senate and the Graham-Cassidy bill is in trouble, but regardless of whether Congress can come to a solution in that time, we cannot turn our backs on our promise to the American people. <br> Fixing Obamacare is not an option. We cannot pass any type of "stabilization" package that only cements this horrific legislation further. Obamacare repeal and replace is not merely a political goal. There are Americans suffering immensely from this broken law, and we have a moral obligation to act by replacing it with patient-centered health care that prioritizes quality of care over anything else. <br> Tax reform is a must <br> Tax reform is another must-pass item before the end of the year. <br> After years of stagnant growth due to ever-expanding government and regulations during the Obama years, our economy needs a jumpstart, and tax reform is the solution. <br> Tax reform needs to be pro-growth, comprehensive, and permanent. We need our tax code to let Americans keep more of their paycheck and give companies an advantage compared to their overseas competitors. <br> We need to show the world once again that America is a place where businesses can thrive. <br> Border security <br> In a time of increased threats to our national security by those that will do us harm, President Trump ran on a simple idea: border security. Securing our southern border is a must-do for Congress -- we cannot idly sit by while our nation's laws are flagrantly ignored, allowing potentially dangerous individuals to enter the United States with zero repercussions. <br> Democrats try time and time again to have an immigration "fix" now and secure the border later. We cannot fall into this trap again. We need a real fix to our immigration challenge, not a band-aid that exacerbates the problem. <br> While Republicans need to channel our legislative efforts into a long-term solution focusing on border security first, keeping America secure does not end at our borders. Republican solutions must include strong immigration enforcement mechanisms, including e-verify, entry-exit tracking, and cracking down on sanctuary cities. <br> This three-pronged mandate does seem more daunting at this point, but Republicans are only in this situation because Congress did not do its job the first nine months. If members cannot get the job done, voting Americans might find representatives who can. 
 People are scratching their heads, hard-line conservatives are pulling out their hair and Republican leaders are watching from the sidelines as President Donald Trump negotiates directly with Democrats on some of the major issues facing the nation. <br> Even though President Trump indicated that he is more willing now to work with Democrats, the answer is we really don't know. We are just one tweet away from the President changing his mind. <br> But House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has witnessed five presidents come and go during her time in Congress (Donald Trump is the sixth), suggested the President may be coming to grips with the reality that he cannot govern by decree. <br> "I would say that President Trump is, I think, understanding better that it isn't just what the President says, this is not a parliamentary system, that the Prime Minister says something and then his party endorses it. This is a presidential system," Pelosi said in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday that will air this weekend on SiriusXM's 'Full Stop with Mark Preston.' <br> "So I think that he's learning now that he not only has to reach out across the aisle, but he has to have the vote on his own side, and that's something that is, I think, quite obvious," Pelosi said. <br> Forget about great ideas. True success in Washington can only be achieved by securing a majority of votes in the House and Senate, and sometimes that means breaking bread with political enemies. <br> But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Nothing is ever done in Washington until it is done and Donald Trump still needs the support of the GOP leadership, which controls the congressional agenda. <br> Pragmatism over partisanship <br> While President Trump is bombastic in his political pronouncements, he is still an opportunist at heart and when presented with the chance to score a win, at least seven times out of 10 he will take the victory (I would've said 10 out of 10, but again, we are talking about the unpredictable Donald Trump). <br> For Donald Trump, the most pragmatic thing to do was buy some breathing room. He did just that. <br> But don't misinterpret the recent cozying up to Pelosi and Schumer as a sign the President has newfound friends in Washington. By his very nature, personality and actions, President Trump doesn't have any natural allies in the nation's capital, and he never will. <br> Pelosi noted that her relationship with the President "may be something different" depending on the day. <br> "I respect the office he holds, I respect the people (who) voted for him," Pelosi said. "We have a responsibility always to find our common ground; if not, we have a responsibility to stand our ground. What I would hope we can arrive at is a place where there is an understanding of what is at stake and that our decisions would be evidence-based and not based on a notion." <br> So much for the long, warm embrace from the House Democratic leader, who understands, perhaps better than anyone, that political alliances in Washington are often situational. <br> Friend today, enemy tomorrow <br> Pelosi may find compromise with Donald Trump on DACA, but as the Democratic leader said, she is more than willing to "stand her ground" against the President when she disagrees with him. And cooperation between the White House and congressional Democrats is likely to dissipate soon after the calendar page flips to 2018. <br> If Democrats take back the House in 2018, the Trump administration will no longer be shielded by a Republican-controlled Congress. <br> "I think that the power of subpoena is a very important power that the Democrats would then have, and that is something to take very seriously in terms of the executive branch," Pelosi said. "It would give the Democratic Party much more leverage in Congress." <br> Democrats' ability to force the Trump administration to comply with congressional subpoenas is one of the things his supporters fear most. With the exception of the Russia investigation, oversight of the Trump administration has not been, let's say, robust. <br> Democratic control of the House would press an already embattled White House up against the wall. Investigative inquiries would double, maybe triple -- dare I say quadruple -- consuming the time and energy of a barely functioning White House. On a personal level, it would drive President Trump crazy. <br> Cracking the whip <br> Likely leading that charge in 2018 would be the then-78-year-old Pelosi, who learned the rough-and-tumble world of politics from her father, a former congressman and Baltimore mayor. <br> "I remember staying up late or listening from the other room when they would just get out the yellow legal pads and go over, 'This is how many votes we need, this is where we will get them and this is where we have to do more,'" recalled Pelosi of the late-night political discussions between her father and mother. "That had to add up, so you never overestimated what your vote count might be." <br> "I am a good vote counter, I would say that," she said. <br> But it is not just Pelosi who believes this -- former aides, current lobbyists, and even GOP strategists acknowledged that the California Democrat is one of the best in Congress at whipping votes. <br> And like any old-school politician, Pelosi knows her friends and her foes, particularly those in her own political party. <br> These political skills helped Pelosi make history in 2007 when she was elected to be the first woman ever to serve as speaker of the House -- a position she held until 2011 when the GOP took back control of the chamber. <br> Friendly fire <br> Over the years there have been calls for Pelosi, as well as other Democratic leaders, to step down, move aside, make room for the next generation of House Democrats to move up. <br> The Democratic leader said Republicans are targeting her because of her role in helping pass Obamacare, and at the same time the GOP is unfairly criticizing her liberal, San Francisco constituency. <br> "I don't think our caucus should support that," said Pelosi. <br> "The thing is that you can't let the opposition choose your leaders, you can't feed into that. Now there is personal ambition in our caucus, there's no question about that, but I feel very confident in the full support that I have in my caucus." <br> Pelosi would not specifically say whether she has spoken directly to Moulton, Rice or her other Democratic critics, but did take the opportunity to cast some shade on them. <br> "I discuss matters with members who are constructive on how do we go forward," she said. "I will always have a conversation with any member who wants to have a conversation. But I wouldn't elevate them to a high level in our caucus, because they really don't have much of a following." <br> Still, the NRCC told CNN to expect more of the same next year: Pelosi will play a starring role in many of the opposition ads that air against Democratic candidates in the midterm elections. <br> "She is a very polarizing figure," said Matt Gorman, spokesman for the NRCC. "People have very acute memories about what a Pelosi speakership means." <br> Clock is ticking <br> When Donald Trump cut the deal with Pelosi and Schumer last week, he bought time not only for himself but also for Congress, whose members were under pressure to reach an agreement on the 2018 budget and debt ceiling increase by September 30. <br> With the new date now December 8, the clock is reset and ticking again. Failure to find a resolution on these two issues in time could result in a government shutdown and an inability for the U.S. to pay its creditors. <br> At the same time, Pelosi is preparing for a political battle with Republicans over tax reform. <br> The Democratic leader noted her "biggest fear," in terms of domestic issues, is if Republicans are successful in passing their tax reform legislation. And she is hoping to see the same grassroots opposition to the GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare in action during the tax debate. <br> "Hopefully the American people will pay very good attention, because the American people are in charge," Pelosi said. "They saved us from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, people speaking out." <br> How grassroots Democrats mobilize or fail to do so could be an early sign about the voter intensity heading into the midterm elections. The same can be said for Republican voters, as the House GOP leadership prepares to defend the 24 seats Democrats need to take control of the chamber in 2019. 
 A new administration in Washington is something like a new high school freshman class. They arrive full of energy and ambition, but in a short time the system reveals who is who, and the sorting begins. <br> In the case of the Trump administration, the "troublemaking" kids -- Stephen Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Michael Flynn and others -- formed a clique with the President that made life hard for everyone, including him. But now they are gone, and he has found new friends named Sen. Charles "Chuck" Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who may help him to apply himself to the work at hand. <br> Sen. Schumer is, like Trump, a New Yorker who can talk tough and doesn't take it personally when others do, too. Rep. Pelosi is also a big city politician who doesn't mind a scrap. Although they are both Democrats -- the sort many Republicans consider denizens of the Dark Side -- they are practical-minded politicians who understand they lead the minority in Congress. <br> They also may understand Trump better than the Republican leaders who have failed to deliver for the President on Capitol Hill. <br> These activities gave Trump something to do as his inexperienced team groped its way around the White House without detailed policy plans or governing expertise. <br> Former National Security Adviser Flynn, who came to power as a controversial figure, became the first victim of the scandal surrounding Russia's aid to the Trump campaign. Factions gathered behind the co-chiefs, Bannon and Reince Priebus, and the President relied on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan to deliver legislative achievements. <br> In the chaos, an order banning Muslim visitors, fashioned by the Bannon crowd, was rejected by the courts, leaving the President humiliated. The promise to "repeal and replace" the health care system known as Obamacare was supposed to be fulfilled by Ryan and McConnell in consultations with Priebus, who was one of the few in the administration with mainstream credentials. <br> Ryan struggled to get a compromise, which Trump vainly celebrated with a party at the White House, through the House. Then, demonstrating his own ineptitude, Trump managed to alienate the fence sitters McConnell needed to finish the job in the Senate. <br> After repeal and replace died, Trump's sliding poll numbers continued to drop, which meant that the brand he had cultivated for decades was in danger of being ruined. He may have been heartened by what he heard while tuned in to "Fox Friends" in the morning, but he knew he wasn't winning. <br> Today, the President, who knows his poll numbers, has freed himself of Bannon, Priebus, Flynn and others who were less than helpful playmates. Ryan and McConnell, who don't seem to fully grasp that Trump is more interested in personal popularity than policy, are watching as the President seeks success through alliance with people he once verbally tormented. <br> Pelosi had the foresight to use the opening to press for help for the Dreamers and now she and Schumer are collaborating with Trump on it. <br> This is the kind of thinking that could make Donald, Chuck and Nancy BFNs -- best friends for now-- while leaving Paul and Mitch on the outside of the cool kids' clique. 
 We are living through a historic shift: there are more natural disasters, they are coming more frequently, and are fundamentally altering our economy and the way we live. <br> We can no longer view natural disasters through the singular lens of "disaster -- recovery." Rather, a complete paradigm shift is necessary. We must adjust to this new norm of major natural disasters by paying radical attention to resilience. <br> Certainly, discussing future preparedness in the middle of a crisis seems off the mark. But that, actually, is part of the point: America is often at its best when it's being challenged. From confronting world wars to reacting on 9/11, Americans have been clear-eyed ready to hear what needed to be done to prevent a tragedy from occurring again. <br> Here today, the public is ready to respond to the immediate disaster, but also needs and wants to hear the reality of what must be done moving forward. Our elected officials must be honest about the changes the nation needs to make as a result of climate-related disasters. <br> So, as funds are dispersed for recovery from the twin disasters of Harvey and Irma, keeping track of how best to build back will be the central focus of many agencies -- not just FEMA. The federal attention that will be required to respond to and help these communities recover will cost hundreds of billions of dollars -- that's right -- hundreds of billions of dollars, spread across agencies. <br> Third, the Trump administration needs to help keep our country focused. While tax reform undoubtedly affects millions of Americans, speeches in Missouri and North Dakota in the middle of preparations, response, and recovery to Harvey and Irma, distract from the need to bring Americans together to help. Yes, the President can walk and chew gum at the same time. That's not the point. The point is that now is the time for the President to bring Americans and Congress together to do something big. <br> The American people are generous and more than able to bounce back from all manner of trials, but during a time of national crisis, they rely on encouragement from elected leaders. <br> The real cost will come later on, when the American taxpayer is footing the bill for future disasters that our leaders failed to plan for. Now is the time to use the power of the presidency to rally the American people, to prepare them for the long road ahead, and for a more resilient future. <br> That is the only way to continue to keep America great. 
 "Daddy, can I go with you?" <br> With that introduction, little Ivanka took the stage. <br> Among the many confounding aspects of the Trump presidency has been the role of Ivanka, his elder, and clearly favored, daughter. (When's the last time you heard him talk about Tiffany, his daughter with ex-wife Marla Maples, never mind trot her out before a crowd of voters?) Ivanka and her husband are official White House advisors -- and two of the President's closest. <br> Ivanka Trump presents herself on social media and elsewhere as socially progressive. And she has been pegged by many as a (notably female) counter to Trump's more openly conservative stances on everything from immigration and national security to, yes, women. <br> But whether she's actually succeeded in pulling her father away from the strongest impulses of the right remains up for debate. This was perhaps never more clearly seen than in her father's bumbling post-Charlottesville attack statements. After all, if ever there was a time for Trump's Jewish daughter to sway her father to moderation, it was then. Instead, he chose to defend the "good" people among the white supremacist crowd. <br> But then, how much pull could we actually expect her to have with a man who refers to himself as her "Daddy?" The moniker, used in relation to a person on one's senior staff, is unprofessional at best, demeaning and infantilizing at worst. <br> One could argue that sometimes, "Daddy" is just a name, a term of endearment -- not an indication of some perceived immaturity. <br> The difference, of course, is that Trump has made his little girl one of the more powerful women in Washington, at least by title. When you do that, you don't get to bring your family nicknames, especially if they can be read as juvenile, onto the national stage. <br> The Trumps don't have the luxury of not being examined. Having a Commander in Chief refer to himself as the "Daddy" of a 35-year-old woman, having him assert that she -- one of his most important advisors -- pleadingly called him that as she asked be taken along on a trip, is off-putting to say the least. <br> We don't know how she felt about being a character in his "Daddy" story -- many daughters would be mortified. But by parading her in this way, he not only risks people not taking her, or women in general, seriously -- he does the same to himself. Behind every powerful woman is her ... daddy? What a great message to be sending to our young girls. Daddy-in-Chief? Not comforting. <br> To be fair, Ivanka has assumed a role that, while not uncommon between generations of powerful people, is far more common between men and their adult sons. Consequently, there is an element of progress, and progressiveness, in all of this, deep down. <br> The catch-22 for Ivanka, of course, is that her ability to make change is both enabled, and threatened, by her father. Or, that is, her daddy. Can she overcome? It's a tough job for a little girl. 
 Don't hold your breath. <br> Just to clear this up: No, we are not headed toward a blissful and cooperative relationship between Donald Trump and Democratic leadership for the next three-plus years. <br> The agreement to a three-month extension of the debt limit, instead of the 18 months Republican leadership smartly wanted to get this past the 2018 congressional election, was a bad deal for Trump. <br> There is not a lot of power in the hands of minority leaders, but what the deal guarantees is another bite at the apple for must-pass legislation in December. In other words, it's an opportunity for Pelosi and Schumer to attach an authorization of the DREAM Act or another priority important to Democratic leadership to the next debt ceiling extension. <br> Despite that, in Trump's eyes, it was a still a deal. And for an hour or two he could bask in the glow of striking his first deal in quite some time. <br> Second, he is not exactly thrilled with the leadership and work of House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. <br> While President Trump may not score well on a test about how a bill becomes a law, it was understandable that he was stunned, not unlike many Democrats, that seven years after Obamacare passed, the Republicans did not have a viable plan on the shelf for repealing and replacing. And was less than pleased that attempts to repeal his predecessor's signature achievement failed not once, but twice. <br> So did he poke McConnell and Ryan in the eye on purpose? Maybe, but we probably won't know until he tells us during his next press availability. <br> Third, even the White House is not spinning the deal with Schumer and Pelosi as the beginning of a new strategy to reach across the aisle. They were in the unenviable position of explaining why their boss agreed to a proposal made by the Democratic leadership, that the Republican speaker of the House called, "ridiculous and disgraceful" just hours earlier. And their answer? According to the White House director of Legislative Affairs, the deal will "clear the decks" for tax reform. <br> That might have merit, if... there was a tax reform package, not just principles, that had been heavily litigated through the web of tax lobbyists, interest groups, and members of the Republican caucus who viscerally disagree on rates, how to pay for the tax cuts and which loopholes should be on the chopping block. None of those things have happened. <br> And finally as a heavy consumer of media, President Trump is unlikely to be pleased by how his Wednesday morning deal-making is playing -- as a big victory for the people he negotiated with. Even that alone will be a big deterrent to going down the road of deal-making with the Democrats anytime soon. <br> And all of this is bad news for a DACA deal. For Democrats, immigration advocates, and people with a shred of a soul, President Trump's comments about DACA on Air Force One were encouraging. "Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I. <br> "I think they're going to make a deal. I think Congress wants to do this." <br> But here is the rub. <br> If Schumer and Pelosi have their way, there would be a clean authorization of DACA. There would be no funding for a wall on the Mexican border attached to it. In fact, it is hard to believe they would accept funding for a wall in any form given that it would be perceived as a big victory for Trump and a promise delivered. And the scope of other "border security" options that would be acceptable to Democrats and pro-wall building Republicans is narrow at best. <br> Trump ran as the law and order, anti-immigrant candidate who wanted to build a wall and round people up to kick them out of the country. And there is a faction of the country that voted for him as a result. Trump can't and won't be the arbiter of a deal on DACA. He may hold his nose and sign it, but he won't be striking a deal on it. His politics won't allow it. 
 President Donald Trump is in for a bumpy political ride when Congress reconvenes after Labor Day. A remarkable number of leaders of the President's party have begun sharply criticizing Trump, signaling that he can no longer expect lawmakers to follow the White House's lead on major legislation. <br> The latest blast from Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who was elected to his sixth term in the Senate on the same day Trump won last November. <br> "We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don't answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power." <br> In political terms, that's a declaration of independence -- one that could, over time, turn into a declaration of war. <br> "Hill Republicans are increasingly worried that Trump's penchant for drama -- and the constant bickering in the West Wing -- is going to crush their agenda," Politico reports. <br> There's a reason for the growing distance between Trump and Capitol Hill Republicans. In the tough jungle warfare of Washington, professional politicians of both parties are quick to sense weakness and tend to move with ruthless speed to fill power vacuums. <br> Experienced legislators look at Trump's tumultuous eight months in office and see weakness. <br> Washington politicians have clearly sized up those kinds of problems and concluded that the Trump White House is in no position to dictate the shape or speed of legislation to Congress. <br> That was tame compared with what McCain wrote. <br> Concerns about getting tax cuts and other legislation passed goes hand in hand with the hard reality that Trump's low approval numbers could spell political trouble for Congressional Republicans in next year's midterm elections. 
 What do you say to someone who's lost everything? <br> At this moment in Houston and other places affected by Hurricane Harvey, parents are sitting in emergency shelters wondering: How will we rebuild our home? How will we get to work? How will we get the kids to school -- and is there a school to go to? <br> This is the scene President Donald Trump flew into Tuesday. And to be sure, the people who have suffered in Harvey's wake needed to hear from him. In a national disaster, the words of the President of the United States matter. He needs to be reassuring to survivors. <br> But there is something else he must do. He needs to help set realistic expectations for the long road to recovery. He needs to tell them the truth. <br> The truth is that over the course of the storm, more than 24 trillion gallons of water have fallen on Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana. This recovery will take years and billions of dollars. People continue to be evacuated and tens of thousands of residents will need temporary shelter and transportation to jobs and schools. <br> The truth is, actually, that he would do well to take a page from President Barack Obama. As Hurricane Sandy made landfall in 2012, those of us at FEMA knew that any failure on our part would be directed at the President. He had an election just weeks away, but his only message to us was to save lives. <br> He hugged survivors. He called local leaders every day. He made Hurricane Sandy about all of us and led us in how to help them begin the recovery process. Trump faces an even bigger disaster. <br> It is easy to see why President Trump must show full engagement. He, too can lead by example, by making this -- not other issues -- his focus, and the nation's focus. He can set aside tax reform for the moment, and tell people how to get involved, where to donate money and volunteer. He has the most powerful bully pulpit in the world and he needs to use it to drive attention and aid to the region. He needs to show that he's pushing hard -- every day. <br> Words -- and the "optics" meant to telegraph them -- are equally as important in recovery. <br> Recovery will not be "quick" as President Trump said. And his waving a Texas flag, as he did Tuesday in Corpus Christi, won't help the people standing in lines to register for FEMA assistance. <br> On Wednesday, floodwaters were still rising and people continued to be rescued by helicopter. Yet President Trump went to Missouri -- to talk about tax reform -- with a brief prelude to acknowledge the heroic work of first responders, and add that "recovery will be tough but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand all over this country." <br> This was an improvement on his tone-deaf remarks the previous day, but he needs to show he is focused enough on Harvey. <br> As Americans, we will all have to bear the burden of recovery and rebuilding, so it is critical that the President leads by making Houston's success an American success. That starts by staying on topic as the nation's 4th largest city reels after a storm of biblical proportions. He must remind us that we're in it together, not change the subject. <br> From my years at FEMA, this I know: Having a realistic perspective is as much a part of recovering from a crisis as the giant to-do list that face most families. Having a realistic understanding about how Hurricane Harvey will transform our country will force those of us not in harm's way to take a serious look at our own priorities and preparation. <br> President Trump must get survivors ready for the long haul, convey a clear understanding of the immense challenges ahead, not use his time before the cameras to set timelines for self-congratulation for his administration's job well done, as the President alluded to in Corpus Christi, or spend Twitter time politicking about NAFTA and tax reform. <br> Regardless of what the President tweets, the survivors of Harvey will rebuild their lives, but they will be different than before. Trump himself set the expectation that his way will be the best way. We should hold him to that. 
 As Congress returns next week, attention will turn to matters of budget, spending and taxes. The tax reform package that legislators will take up will have major implications for years to come, and we should get it right. <br> Unlike health care, tax reform can be simple, but I'm afraid those who are in charge will make it unnecessarily complicated, especially when coupled with an alarming timidity that could render the reform's impact nearly meaningless. <br> Revenue neutral ultimately means that someone pays more for someone else to pay less. It means tax "reform" without real tax cuts. <br> Let me ask you a serious question. If someone has to pay more for someone else to pay less -- which category do you think you and other Americans might fall into? I fear that tax reform that mandates revenue neutrality will result in those with the best lobbyists, lawyers and accountants being the winners, while most everyone else either gets nothing or largely loses out. <br> It doesn't have to be that way. We can be bold yet simple. We can cut taxes, and promote jobs and growth, without picking winners and losers. <br> To get this done, our tax reform needs to have three main areas of focus. <br> First, every American who pays taxes should get a tax cut. Every rate should be lowered by a percentage. What percentage? That's where we conservatives can negotiate with fence-sitters if necessary. I'd favor a large cut of at least 15% for every taxpayer. But the main and important thing is that everyone gets a tax cut. <br> Next, we need to simply slash the corporate tax rate to 15%, and not worry about any complicated reform that no one will agree on, or that takes 500 pages to explain. <br> Let's cut the rate to 5%, make it voluntary and get that money home to create more jobs. A 5% voluntary rate still brings in billions of additional revenue, which could be targeted to building and repairing infrastructure. <br> Three simple items. Every Republican and even some Democrats agree with the basic premise of this plan, and we can get down to arguing about the exact numbers. <br> We can do this, but not if we operate the way the Swamp normally does. Secret meetings. Leaders writing complicated bills no one sees. Lobbyists getting their pet provisions in bills. <br> If tax reform is run like most things around here -- like Obamacare repeal, for example -- then I can't predict what will happen other than it will be complicated, won't help much and could even fail. There's no excuse for that. <br> I urge President Trump and his advisers to heed this warning. Do not let what happened during the last battle up here happen again. You'll get the same results, and no one should want that. <br> Lead with boldness and vision. Lead with simple ideas. And make sure your simple ideas don't get hijacked by others' agendas. I'm right here, ready to fight. 
 It will be remembered as one of the most awkward scenes of an administration replete with them. Two Cabinet members of the Jewish faith standing at President Donald Trump's side as he drew a moral equivalence between the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who rallied in Charlottesville and those who came to protest their hate-filled message. <br> Standing to the President's right, National Economic Council director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin looked stricken. They had shown up for a press conference on infrastructure, only to be cast as supporting actors in a bizarre and distasteful scene. It was as if they had been invited for a ride, only to discover, to their horror, that they suddenly were involved in a stickup. <br> Mnuchin made a vain effort to defend the President's comments on the Sunday shows, undoubtedly winning points for loyalty from the boss, but earning the disapprobation of many others in and out of the Jewish community for failing to roundly condemn the indefensible. <br> In contrast, Cohn, whose pained expression was most evident at the President's press conference, said little after that August 15 debacle. <br> "I'm a patriotic American," Cohn said, explaining that he felt a duty to continue to serve the country despite his anger and unhappiness with the president's remarks. <br> Cynics may conclude that Cohn's decision to hang on might also have something to do with rumors that he is in line to succeed Fed chair Janet Yellen when her term expires next year. Others would point to the seductive nature of power. For my part, I tend to believe published stories that Cohn wrestled with leaving, even going so far as drafting a letter of resignation, but pulled back because he felt he could do more good -- or, perhaps, prevent more bad -- by staying inside the turbulent White House. <br> When rumors swirled about Cohn's imminent departure, the markets, which have been on an ebullient trajectory, took a dive. He is in a widely reported battle with economic nationalists who resonate with Trump over protectionist policies. He is the point man on the President's looming campaign for tax reform. A Democrat, he sees himself as a moderating influence in the White House. <br> So it's easy to see how Cohn might have been persuaded -- or persuaded himself -- to stay, in the same way the President's national security team of Mattis, Tillerson and McMaster and chief of staff Kelly seem determined to tolerate Trump's tantrums in order to prevent more cataclysmic eruptions. <br> Perhaps they see themselves as the thin line -- not simply between America and an inherently dangerous world but between the world and an impulsive, dangerous president. <br> The price Cohn apparently demanded for staying was the freedom to make his own displeasure clear over the President's offensive remarks. And Mr. Trump uncharacteristically may accept this small bit of apostasy to keep Cohn, his key link to Wall Street and the markets. <br> But for Cohn and the remaining establishment pillars within the administration, the road ahead likely will get harder. <br> This President is not going to change and they will be forced to confront over time whether by staying, they are managing his worst instincts -- or simply enabling them. 
 House Speaker Paul Ryan used his televised town hall meeting Monday to gingerly walk across the tightrope congressional Republican leaders will face this fall: how to put distance between themselves and President Donald Trump without alienating the White House. <br> The goal of this Republican political unity, Ryan also made clear, is passage of a federal budget full of tax cuts for the wealthy and deep reductions in social service programs. <br> Ryan went out of his way to praise Trump's latest attempt to undo the damage caused by his statements suggesting "both sides" of the recent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville were at fault for the resulting violence. <br> But when asked if he would take steps to hold the President accountable by supporting a resolution for censure, Ryan firmly refused. <br> "I will not support that. I think that would be -- that would be so counterproductive," he said. "If we descend this issue into some partisan hack-fest, into some bickering against each other, and demean it down to some political food fight, what good does that do to unify this country?" <br> Pressed on whether he'd go as far as his former running mate, Mitt Romney, in demanding an apology from Trump, Ryan again refused. <br> "It is very, very important that we not make this a partisan food fight," he said. "It is very important that we unify in condemning this kind of violence, in condemning this kind of hatred. And to make this us against them, Republicans against Democrats, pro-Trump, anti-Trump, that is a big mistake for our country, and that will demean the value of this important issue." <br> Ryan's take-home message is that people can disagree with Trump's comments and actions individually, but he won't use the power of his office to voice a collective objection. <br> "The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 22.5%. And we are taxing American businesses 35% to almost 45%? That is a recipe for disaster," Ryan said. "The biggest business we had in Wisconsin, publicly traded, was Johnson Controls. They are now an Irish company. Their worldwide tax rate is 12.5%... We're losing businesses left and right. And this is among the reasons why we have to have fundamental tax reform. " <br> "We're in the 32nd year of (the) War on Poverty. Trillions spent, and guess what -- our poverty rates are about the same as they were when we started this war on poverty 32 years ago. So the status quo isn't working, sister," Ryan said. "We are not solving the problem of poverty." <br> That's highly debatable, and mostly wrong. <br> Beyond the income debate, measuring the War on Poverty requires taking into account what really matters: whether people have been helped to live better lives since Johnson launched the crusade in 1964. <br> Ryan's remarks aren't just a political debating point. Conservatives who think government has done little to improve life for the poor are likely to try and defund key programs. <br> That's a battle that will be joined in earnest as Ryan tries to pass a budget later this year. Democrats will fight ferociously for the social programs they've created, and Ryan will try to reduce or gut them -- and also continue to tread carefully to avoid antagonizing the White House. <br> It should be quite a tightrope act. 
 The Trump administration has shifted its approach on health care repeal, tax reform, infrastructure and other major campaign promises. <br> That's not going to happen with immigration. <br> Why? Trump's avid support of newly proposed immigration legislation reflects a longstanding fear among some conservative Republicans that our current, family-based immigration system will result in millions of new African, Asian and Latin American newcomers -- people who will eventually acquire full citizenship and end up voting for Democrats. <br> The solution, according to Coulter and other movement Conservatives, is to change the rules of the system, which, they say, encourages so-called "chain migration" by giving preference in the immigration system to family members of current immigrants. <br> For many Republicans, changing the rule is a political life-or-death issue. As Coulter warns, "there's no sense in arguing about any other political issue. If we lose immigration, we lose everything." <br> That logic means Republicans will likely put up a ferocious battle to change the rules on immigration. This will engage not just the White House, but the broader party, which sees the fight as a matter of political survival. 
 It's an alarming read, particularly when you remember that the person who is struggling to speak authoritatively or coherently on virtually any topic is the same person that is in charge of America's military might and its nuclear launch codes. <br> There are three main takeaways from the interview. <br> First, Trump has, at best, an extremely thin understanding of every major policy issue, from health care to tax reform. When pressed for any details, Trump retreats to empty platitudes and deflects by saying: "We'll see what happens." <br> Second, the interview is a window into a mind that is singularly obsessed by his election victory last November -- which took place 268 days ago. Repeatedly, Trump is stuck in a distant past that he perceives to be glorious, which is distracting him from creating a better future for America. <br> Third, Trump makes demonstrably false statements with incredible frequency -- even about trivial matters. <br> His casual relationship with the truth, as though it's a pesky but disposable annoyance, has destroyed the credibility of the White House in just six months. <br> Let's take a closer look at the key takeaways from this strange interview, with direct quotes from the President himself. <br> The reporter asked Trump several policy-related softball questions -- questions that any normal politician would hit out of the park with ease. Trump's responses whiff instead, meandering around the question nonsensically without answering it. His response to a basic question (What are the main goals of your tax plan?) starts like this: <br> "I want to achieve growth. We're the highest-taxed nation in the world, essentially, you know, of the size. But we're the highest taxed nation in the world [note: this isn't true]. We have -- nobody knows what the number is. I mean, it used to be, when we talked during the debate, $2.5 trillion, right, when the most elegant person -- right? I call him Mr. Elegant. I mean, that was a great debate. We did such a great job..." <br> This doesn't make sense. This would fail an elementary school test for lack of clarity, non sequiturs and rambling incoherence. But beyond the hard-to-follow twists and turns of this answer, the interview also shows an astonishing shallowness to his understanding of enormous policy debates. He repeatedly makes mistakes when he does provide detail, but most of the time he steers clear of detail and retreats to safer ground he knows well -- his election victory. <br> When asked if he hopes to work with Democrats in Congress to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill (which Democrats have indicated they are willing to work on with President Trump), his response begins as follows: <br> "Well, they tried -- they tried it with me. She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads. She didn't do a positive ad, virtually. And she lost easily, you know, 306 to 223 I think, right, -- 223 something like that." <br> The question was about infrastructure. It was about bipartisanship. Trump turned it into an opportunity to discuss his defeat of an election opponent last November. Imagine if President Barack Obama had fixated on beating John McCain in August 2009. It would have been perceived as being unhinged, because it is. And yet, time and again, Trump singularly fixates on the election, mistaking the starting gun of his presidency for the finish line. <br> The credibility of the White House matters. Trump has willingly sacrificed it, tossing it away for no reason, to boast about matters as a trivial as a speech to Boy Scouts. The loss of credibility for America's President will have serious consequences, both for Trump's domestic agenda and for the standing of the United States in the world. It's not an amusing matter. <br> This latest rambling interview is yet another window into the White House. It makes clear that the recent staff changes will do little to rescue the Trump presidency, because the real problem with the Trump presidency starts at the very top. 
 Here's hoping Mr. Trump knows how to use him. <br> Because if he taps into General Kelly's inherent qualities, the President could actually come out on the far side of these first six tumultuous months looking pretty good. Well, better than that, actually. He could come out with a plan to achieve a heckuva lot in his next six months ... and longer. <br> He could make a full-court press for an infrastructure bill, make some progress on tax reform. <br> He could get his hands around a strategy for Afghanistan and maybe even sharpen the effort against ISIS in Syria. <br> He might finally find a road ahead with Russia, and he will certainly find in General Kelly a man who will contribute meaningfully to the very complex challenges North Korea poses. <br> And here's another item worth mentioning: with Kelly at the helm, the President might finally get his house in order. <br> He'll be able to do all these things with General Kelly and more, because Kelly is a leader. A natural leader. It's not even something I think he thinks about much. He just does it ... wouldn't know how not to lead, quite frankly. <br> And Kelly is a believer, too. People closer to the general than I am tell me he is unabashedly committed to President Trump's agenda, if not also President Trump the man. He has worked assiduously at the Department of Homeland Security to execute Mr. Trump's immigration and border objectives, and he believes in his heart that Mr. Trump has exactly the right vision for the country. <br> There will be a lot of things the President has to worry about in coming months. General Kelly's personal loyalty does not appear to be one of them. <br> I worked with General Kelly on the staff of Leon Panetta, then-secretary of defense. Kelly, a three-star at the time, was Mr. Panetta's senior military assistant. He was a marvel of organization and efficiency, of candid counsel and dogged persistence. <br> Here he was, a combat veteran, a man who had seen the hell of war and the pain of losing his own son to it ... a man with, understandably, strong views about terrorism and extremist violence. And yet he did that job with all the flash and flair of a man stooping to sweep off his front porch. <br> To him, drama is a movie genre he can choose on Netflix -- if he even watches movies much -- not a way of life. <br> Kelly doesn't suffer fools, and he sure as hell doesn't suffer individualism, ego and anything less than 100% teamwork. <br> I remember asking the general to write a note of encouragement to my son, who was then just about to ship off to Navy boot camp. I won't betray the contents of exactly what he wrote; that should stay in our family. But basically it was about the importance -- the privilege -- of sacrificing one's personal needs and desires for the greater good. It was about duty. <br> And I guess that's the only thing I really worry about. His sense of duty is so clear that Kelly could fall easy prey to those in the West Wing who ascribe to, shall we say, less exalted motives. <br> He's no shrinking violet, mind you, and certainly no stranger to staff shenanigans. But, in addition to being loyal to Mr. Trump, he knows and professes a higher loyalty to country. <br> Would that everyone in the West Wing could take that same approach. <br> In the end, I suppose, it will come down to how much Mr. Trump invests in Kelly ... in how central to the effort he deigns to make the White House chief of staff. <br> At the Aspen Security Forum last week, panel moderator Pete Williams, of NBC News, noted Kelly's penchant for beginning every set of public remarks by praising the men and women of DHS. <br> "Well," replied Kelly, "it's called leadership." <br> So, there's your new chief of staff, Mr. President ... if you're wise enough to use him. 
 President Donald Trump is undermining his party's ability to succeed. The President, who has squandered five months of united government, has single-handedly made the entire legislative process more difficult for Republicans. <br> While Trump maintains strong support from his base, congressional Republicans are struggling to work with him on substantive legislative change -- most recently, the repeal and replace of Obamacare. <br> During the important weeks when Republicans are trying to build support for a major change in health policy, he keeps distracting Americans with one outrageous statement after the other. That's hardly the kind of inspiring oratory that will motivate nervous legislators. <br> More broadly, there has been no effort to build a message in the last few months on what should be the party's signature legislation. Contrast President Barack Obama, who delivered numerous speeches on his health care bill, including an address to Congress and a televised exchange with Republicans. <br> Rather than taking the time to build a case with the public like Obama did with the Affordable Care Act or Lyndon B. Johnson did with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or Ronald Reagan did with tax reform in 1981, Trump has been consumed with tweeting about what he brands as fake news and reiterating that he really did defeat Clinton. <br> Indeed, right when Republicans need Trump to help put a new health care bill together, he sent an explosive and outrageous tweet about Mika Brzezinski, which caused an uproar Thursday. <br> But all this might be unfair to Trump. It could be that the substance of this legislation is so problematic and so unpopular that even the most engaged and charismatic president could never have saved this bill. Maybe, just maybe, enough Americans don't believe it's acceptable to strip away health care coverage from millions of Americans whose only crime is to face illness. <br> Regardless, Trump has not helped Republicans on the Hill make their case. <br> If health care passes the Senate and then survives the conference committee, it will be in spite of the President's leadership skills. <br> Republicans like Nebraskan Ben Sasse are desperately trying to salvage the situation. He admitted that Trump's latest tweet was "not normal," and then proposed repealing the ACA -- with a one year delay in implementation. Trump seemed to like the idea, tweeting "if Republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately repeal, and then replace at a later date!" <br> If the bill fails, a large part of the burden will rest squarely on his shoulders. This is something the elephants in Congress certainly won't forget. <br> This piece has been updated to reflect Sen. Ben Sasse and President Trump's latest comments on health care.</div> 
 Many Americans may not believe it, but most public servants in Washington are here for the right reasons. Republican or Democrat, we all want to build a stronger country. None of us would run for office if we didn't believe we could contribute to the greater good. <br> But that spirit is all too often shrouded in the vitriol that seems to worsen by the day in Washington. Members of both parties feel blindly compelled to attack the other party's approach to nearly every problem. There is a constant political incentive to attack first and consider the consequences later; it is much safer to not reach a hand across the aisle. <br> Then tragedy strikes. A terrorist group launches an attack against innocent civilians. An angry psychopath terrorizes a college campus. A madman tries to assassinate one of our peers. <br> In the days that follow, our rhetoric changes. We note, as both Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi did, that "we are one House." <br> We remind ourselves that Congress is a family. Families have disagreements—sometimes they bicker. But in trying moments, they come together. And that's exactly what many in Washington have done since the shooting attack in Alexandria, Virginia. <br> Unfortunately, as the memory of each shock fades, the two sides quickly retreat into their respective corners and Washington returns to the status quo—at least until the next tragedy. But we want it to be different this time. We don't want the spirit of solidarity on display in the aftermath of the shooting to fade back to the old routine. <br> When we talk about the need for unity, let's really mean it. It's what the American people want. It's what the times demand. <br> Earlier this year, having recognized that we shared this sentiment with many our colleagues, we decided to form a Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus. <br> Comprised of 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats, our aim was to create a durable bloc that could champion ideas that would appeal to a much broader spectrum of the American people—even if those ideas were anathema to people on the fringes of our parties. <br> We are united in the idea that there are common-sense solutions to many of the country's toughest challenges—but partisanship keeps those solutions from making their way into law. We believe that's bad for America. <br> The Problem Solvers Caucus is more than just a bipartisan coffee club. We recently adopted a rule that if 75 percent of our bloc and a majority of members in both parties support a position, we will stand behind it. And we as co-chairs of this group have pledged not to engage in campaigns against other members of the caucus. <br> Already, our commitment to bipartisanship has had an effect. When the government came close to shutting down in April, we issued a statement demanding that poison-pill amendments to the budget be set aside and those considering whether to press the issue chose not to. <br> We've met with both Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to offer our help bridging the partisan divide. And we're working hard to craft a bipartisan plan on tax reform and infrastructure and to avoid another debt ceiling debacle later this summer. <br> Members of our caucus won't agree on everything --in fact, they may not agree on most things. But we owe it to ourselves and to the American people to find bipartisan agreement wherever possible. And we should always strive to treat one another with respect and civility. <br> A recent Harvard/Harris poll found that 89% of Americans want their representatives to reach across the aisle. <br> The Problem Solvers Caucus intends to champion that approach and we invite our colleagues to join us in that mission. <br> After all, American democracy is premised on the idea that people with different ideas can work together toward a common solution. Washington shouldn't have to rely on tragedy to be reminded of that. 
 When he ran for president, one of the many things that made Donald Trump stand apart from other politicians was the way he turned the implied into the literal. <br> You can look at this as an admirable forthrightness -- the difference between him and the rest of his party isn't in what they believe, just in how willing he is to speak it out loud. Trump may tell more lies than any other politician any of us has ever seen, but there's never any mystery about what he wants his audience to think. He lacks the subtlety to conceal his feelings behind clever formulations and eloquent words. <br> "This is the president of Goldman Sachs. Smart. Having him represent us, he went from massive paydays to peanuts ... these are people that are great, brilliant business minds and that's what we need, that's what we need to have so the world doesn't take advantage of us anymore." <br> He went on: "And I love all people -- rich or poor -- but in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? If you insist, I'll do it -- but I like it better this way, right?" <br> To start with, let's be clear that we aren't talking about actual poor people. No one's suggesting that the President ought to pluck someone working for minimum wage at a fast-food restaurant to be the next chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. When Trump says "poor," what he really means is "not rich." <br> The difference is that only Trump argues that these people will do a good job precisely because they're rich, that their wealth is itself a qualification. <br> Just look at what Republicans in control of the government are doing right now on health care. Their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act is essentially a giant tax cut for the wealthy, financed by taking insurance away from millions of poor and middle-class people. <br> Once that's done, they'll be moving on to tax "reform" -- another giant tax cut for the wealthy, which they'll justify by arguing that we must unburden the noble "job creators" of the oppressive weight of taxation under which they currently suffer. When that's through, they'll be attacking other elements of the safety net, including food stamps. <br> When they're in charge -- however differently they may frame it for the base -- the wealthy will be hired, catered to, indulged and pampered, while the poor will be the target of vicious budget cuts and stern lectures about pulling on those bootstraps. It doesn't come from any notion about what makes for effective policies -- it's about values. <br> Trump is just a little more willing to say it. 
 While I love KU basketball and our head coach, the fact that he paid no income tax on $2.75 million in compensation shows he is as shrewd with his taxes as he is on the sidelines, but that isn't fair to Kansas families scraping to get by. Putting more money into the pockets of those who need it the least doesn't create jobs. It just weakens the fundamentals that keep our economy and communities strong. <br> It is impossible to hide the effect of slashing revenue, and Americans will feel the impact of these cuts. His plan will give tax breaks to the largest corporations and mirrors the agenda that put Kansas in dire fiscal straits. And from a political perspective, it is historic that a Republican controlled legislature is rebuking their Republican governor over tax cuts. Why? Because the rhetoric on tax cuts does not match reality. 
 In addition to describing the events he witnessed, he spoke from the heart. <br> "This hatefulness that we see in this country today over policy differences has got to stop ... Republicans and Democrats need to use this day today to stand together and say 'stop.' Let's work together. Let's get things done," he said. "We can have our differences, but let's not let it lead to such hate." <br> President Trump holds the world's largest microphone and therefore can do the most to quell much of the angry rhetoric we've seen. <br> These things accumulate, which means they inevitably escalate. And whether the targets are Republican members of Congress, like today, or Democratic politicians or members of the media, it was perhaps inescapable that something tragic was coming in an environment like this. <br> Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an artform. But what we've seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others' motives and legitimacy. <br> On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate -- or a blind "us versus them" tribal mentality -- stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks. <br> Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues. 
 While Washington fiddles, the American people are angry. While our elected officials descend further into frenzies of partisanship, voters feel left out. Their kitchen table concerns are repeatedly ignored, forcing many families to face the twin economic disruptions of globalization and the advance of technology on their own. <br> But in an era of partisan media, unchecked Internet trolling and ideological polarization, the Constitution's blueprint for balanced government has been lost in a political fog. Unlike the parliamentary systems that provide for one-party rule, our system is based on checks and balances. In other words, American democracy centers on the expectation that the two parties will resolve their differences to move the country forward. <br> By all means, Congress should carry out its function of investigating important matters such as Russian covert activities and the possible illegal unmasking and leaking of classified information. But these investigations cannot be allowed to take a car already moving at only 5 mph and grind it to a halt. I was there in the Senate in 1998 during the impeachment inquiry and trial of Bill Clinton, and we learned to investigate and legislate at the same time. We didn't stop what we were there to do -- we put progress over partisanship. It's an important lesson for today. <br> The Problem Solvers are bringing a common-sense approach to the nation's toughest problems. It's time for the rest of Washington to catch up. When in power, neither party will win enduring victories without reaching across the aisle. When in opposition, neither party will leave an imprint if it resists every proposed initiative regardless of merit. Enough of the partisanship that only weakens our country and emboldens our adversaries. It's time for the nation's leaders to put country before ideology and party. 
 There is a simple reality that often seems lost on many inside the Beltway: The priorities of the mainstream media and Washington elites are not those of the American people. <br> If you've watched cable news any given day since President Donald Trump's inauguration, you've been subjected to near-hysterical coverage of the latest "scandal" that threatens to doom his presidency. You've probably seen pundits, analysts and politicians relentlessly deliver talking points on why Trump is unfit to be President -- or even why he should be impeached. <br> Yet here we are, six months into President Trump's term, and many Americans have grown weary of the constant media frenzy regarding his administration. And those who voted for the President continue to support him. <br> This principle might seem shocking to Washington, but average Americans -- many of whom I spoke with while campaigning for then candidate Trump -- will tell you that they could care less about the latest Washington cable news drama. Rather, what they care about are policies that impact their families, their pocket books and their everyday lives. <br> Those Americans -- from Western North Carolina to Ohio to Pennsylvania to Michigan -- aren't focused on the latest breaking "news" on the Russia investigation. They care about seeing results and solutions that help their businesses survive -- and grow. They care about having access to high quality, affordable health care. They care about lower taxes that allow them to keep more of their paychecks. They care about the safety and security of their family. <br> And, in Washington, we have done an abysmal job of maintaining our primary focus on those issues. Passing important policy that impacts every day Americans requires consensus building, marketing our ideas to constituents through media and building coalitions of support. With the constant focus on Russia, big important policy items like tax reform have been stalled. <br> Now, make no mistake, it's critical that we not gloss over any potential wrongdoing in the Russia investigation. If there were improper activities, we need to get to the bottom of the issue -- and no one will be more committed to getting to the truth on a bipartisan basis than I will. <br> At the same time, congressional investigations have to follow a deliberative process that takes time. I've conducted oversight of government agencies and officials for the last five years as a member and a subcommittee chairman on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I've investigated cases ranging from the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal to the IRS targeting scandal to the Benghazi attack where Americans lost their lives. <br> In all of these cases, we had a deliberative process that spanned months -- and in some cases, years -- to collect proper evidence, interview key witnesses and see where the facts led. And, in some instances, the facts didn't lead anywhere, and the cases were dropped. <br> Congress has a duty to hold government officials accountable when necessary, but it is counterproductive for the media and some of my Democrat colleagues to throw unsubstantiated claims regarding White House officials against a wall repeatedly to see what sticks. Media and political hysterics work in opposition to -- not in favor of -- getting to truth and transparency. <br> Furthermore, while foreign interference in our election is something that our republic cannot and should not tolerate, it seems a bit ludicrous to suggest that tens of millions of Americans made a choice for president based on Russian influence. This is evidenced by the fact that President Trump continues to share the support of a plurality of Americans who believe they made the right choice for president -- because they voted for his agenda. <br> America must not tolerate Russian intervention in our elections, but we must also not perpetuate a narrative that suggests a far bigger role than any evidence has proven. Fueling exaggeration and constant hysteria is something that could unravel a democracy like ours. It's time we let the special counsel do his job and allow Congress to focus on actually on doing ours. <br> Let's also remember that through the frenzy, no formal charge has been leveled against anyone in the administration, no direct evidence uncovered and no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia confirmed. This is nothing warranting wall-to-wall speculation from the pundit class. The hysterics surrounding Russia merely serve to distract from accomplishing the priorities of the American people -- and for what, partisan gain? <br> There is real work to be done for the American people. Much of it can and should be possible to accomplish on a bipartisan basis. Now is not the time to circle the partisan wagons, but a time to deliver on the commitments we made to the American people. We need to deliver on undoing the harmful regulatory environment that stifles businesses, reforming the tax code to leave more money in the pockets of hard working Americans, replacing our broken health care system with one that will bring down premiums for American families and properly supporting our men and women in uniform. <br> It's time Congress and the media redirect their attention to those same principles. Let's focus on the American peoples' true priorities -- the Main Street issues that matter. 
 The Trump administration's budget has met withering criticism for its vast spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and for its assumptions about revenue and growth. <br> Is it really all that bad? <br> The U.S. faces serious fiscal problems. The economy is now projected to creep along at a bit less than 2% annual growth. Spending and revenues remain dangerously out of whack because of rising entitlement spending. This threatens to steadily crowd out discretionary spending on national security, basic research, education, infrastructure — the things the Founders saw as the actual responsibilities of government. <br> Viewed from this perspective, the budget deserves mixed reviews, but not disdainful dismissal. It strongly recognizes the need for better growth, and assumes the average growth rate will rise from 1.9% annually to 2.9% over the next decade. <br> Is that aggressive? Yes, but every president's budget is aggressive. It would require that everything -- tax reform, regulatory reform, infrastructure, education reform and more -- be enacted and work exactly as predicted. But that's how every president's budget is formulated. If Trump's budget is right, it would be an enormous improvement in the economy, but more importantly in the lives of every American. <br> The fuss over the revenue seems misplaced. The budget has few specifics, but at the top line it shows that nominal gross domestic product averages growth of 5% per year over the budget window and revenues average 5.2%. <br> By comparison, in the Congressional Budget Office baseline, the corresponding growth rates are 3.9 % and 4.2%. The administration has boosted its estimates by roughly a percentage point, with correspondingly faster revenue growth. By the standards of most presidents' budgets, this is a misdemeanor at best. <br> Turning to controlling the entitlement-spending explosion, Trump deserves credit for proposing a serious Medicaid reform. Critics may not like the particulars, but nobody should argue with a straight face that the status quo is acceptable and reform per se is a bad idea. So, kudos to him. <br> In the other direction, the budget takes Social Security and Medicare off the table. This sends the message that these programs are fine; they are not. Neither program will be financially sustainable over the long-term and seniors deserve programs they can count on and, in the case of Medicare, deliver the highest value of health care. These programs should be in the reform mix. <br> The demerits in the budget belong with the annual discretionary accounts. The budget simply accelerates an already unappealing trend. There will be too few resources to fund the national defense needs that experts have identified and, for example, 18% cuts in the National Institutes of Health go the wrong direction on basic research. This is not to say that every non-defense discretionary program is perfect. They are not. In particular, the anti-poverty programs have failed to produce economic self-sufficiency among their beneficiaries and, as a result, have not "solved" the poverty program. <br> But these programs should be critiqued, better alternatives developed and the budgetary costs of the improved programs incorporated into the discretionary totals. That is, change the programs on their merits. The 2018 budget sends the message that they are being cut simply in order to reach balance. It invites the portrayal of an administration callously indifferent to the quality of the programs for lower-income Americans. <br> The 2018 budget does not get straight A's, but it is a far cry from the complete failure that critics have claimed. 
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. <br> It seems like a distant memory now, but it was only about six months ago that Republican leaders were giddily proclaiming a new political era. <br> What a difference half a year makes. <br> Ethical stumbles, rookie errors and sheer political arrogance have left the Republican agenda -- and the GOP legislative majority itself -- in grave peril. <br> That virtually guarantees the Senate will kill or substantially rework the legislation, leaving the Republicans' No. 1 promise -- shouted daily on the campaign trail by Trump and virtually every Republican lawmaker -- unfulfilled. <br> The second main agenda item, tax reform, also looks shaky: Congressional leaders have already fallen behind the aggressive schedule needed to produce a bill by August. <br> These aren't just gossipy distractions. Enacting major legislation requires a White House that is focused, confident and coherent. That is how the Reagan administration led a divided Congress to tax reform in 1986 and how the Obama White House won passage of a stimulus bill, auto industry bailout and health care reform. <br> It remains to be seen whether voters will punish Republican members of Congress for the problems of the man in the White House. But while the Trump-Russia investigation grinds on, congressional Republicans would do well to find other ways to enact their agenda, mostly by working closely with GOP governors. <br> Congress will need substantial buy-in at the state level to enact many of the big-ticket Republican agenda items, from reforming health care to building a border wall and other infrastructure. Now would be a good time to work with GOP governors on Republican agenda items like state-run high-risk health insurance pools and shovel-ready infrastructure projects. 
 Cassidy's resistance to using health care reform as a front to slash taxes for the wealthy is not a popular position in his own party. But he is absolutely right about the true intentions behind this proposal: Republicans are jamming through a massive tax giveaway under utterly false pretenses. With the process now moving behind closed doors in the Senate, and Washington increasingly consumed with investigating the troubling links between the President and Russia, it is critical that Democrats expose and defeat this cynical ploy. <br> Cassidy agreed with Kimmel. "Tell the American people to call their senators," he urged. <br> We must take him up on that. As the Senate begins considering -- in secret, at the moment -- what to preserve and what to eliminate from the House bill, we should deliver a loud and clear message to Washington: leave those wasteful tax cuts on the cutting room floor. <br> These giveaways are a feature, not a bug, of the House health care plan as intended by its authors. In the rollicking negotiations that led up to the House bill's passage, many provisions underwent major changes, but the tax cuts remained intact throughout. <br> These tax cuts also actively thwart the objectives of making coverage more accessible and affordable. <br> There are literally millions of lives at stake when it comes to the issue of health care. Congress should be ashamed of itself if it treats this as just another opportunity to provide a tax windfall for the fortunate few. 
 The news that former FBI director James Comey wrote in a memo that President Donald Trump asked him, in February, to stop investigating national security adviser Mike Flynn has sent shockwaves through Washington. <br> It comes amid Trump's worst week in politics, and that's saying a lot. After many months of shocking and aweing the nation, the President is finally doing something that seemed impossible -- he is threatening to crack the Republican firewall on Capitol Hill that has done more than anything else to protect him. <br> In general, House and Senate Republicans have stood firm as Trump has issued controversial statements and provoked international tensions. They have given him the benefit of the doubt, hoping that even though the President's first 100 days lacked any significant legislative accomplishments, the second hundred might allow the GOP to finally make progress on their agenda after eight long years in the wilderness. <br> Despite concerns that the health care legislation that passed the House would prove to be damaging to Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he still had confidence he could put the pieces back together into a successful initiative. <br> But in the span of just seven days, everything has changed. President Trump stunned the nation when he fired FBI Director James Comey in the middle of the agency's investigation into his campaign, then admitted in a TV interview that he did it because of the "Russia thing." <br> Presidential advisors were left tripping all over themselves trying to justify what happened, each seeming to contradict the other. They had no time to catch their breath before The Washington Post published a bombshell story Monday night alleging that Trump had extemporaneously shared highly classified information about ISIS with visiting Russian officials. While it is legal for the president to do this, providing this kind of sensitive information to a non-ally is highly unusual and, most experts agree, dangerous. <br> Sounding exasperated, McConnell told reporters, "we could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things so that we can focus on our agenda, which is deregulations, tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare." <br> Then came the Comey bombshell. <br> The triple whammy of Comey's firing, the intelligence sharing with Russia and now the Comey memo has shaken the GOP, generating immense, open questions about whether the President is able to handle two core presidential functions that Republicans have always prioritized -- law and order and national security. <br> Now, more Republicans like Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, who warned of a "downward spiral," are speaking up. Others are not springing to Trump's defense and remain conspicuously silent. None of them know exactly what to do. <br> The controversies of the past week have also taken place at a critical moment for Republicans. Members of Congress have been eager to move forward on some kind of legislative agenda. They wanted to make progress on some kind of health care bill and they were particular eager to move forward on Trump's proposal for supply-side tax cuts. <br> They were hoping that this would finally be the moment when Trump made a "legislative pivot" and actually took the job of pushing bills through Congress as seriously as he did his tweets. <br> Some have even hoped that, just maybe, despite all the odds, the President would be able to produce some kind of dramatic diplomatic breakthrough during his visit to the Middle East. <br> None of this looks like it is going to happen. The momentum has moved in the exact opposite direction. The President is now politically paralyzed and will be on the defense as the White House tries to manage fallout. With the pressure over ongoing Russia investigations and talk of mental competence and impeachment moving to the front pages, the President's men and women will be devoting much of their time to damage control. <br> A day before the headlines about Trump's Oval Office meeting with Russian leaders emerged, The New York Times had already reported that Senate Republicans were planning to go it alone to move bills. <br> House Speaker Paul Ryan said through a spokesman: "We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount. The Speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration." <br> For all the talk about populism and his maverick appeal, the heart and soul of Trump's survival has been the power of partisanship. During his election campaign, he depended on most Republicans to support his version of the party line regardless of what they thought of him. And Republicans came through. <br> Since taking the oath of office Trump has counted on congressional Republicans to protect him from investigation or political backlash based on their desire to make the most of what is possible with united government. <br> To be sure, it is not clear yet if Republicans will actually break ranks. So far its been mostly talk and tweets. But the pressure is clearly building, and the voices of conservative protest are growing louder. <br> If the outrageous actions of the past seven days break this partisan unity, then President Trump will be truly exposed. If legislators feel that their majority is at stake and their party's long-term standing is in jeopardy -- particularly because of a President many of them did not like to begin with -- then anything becomes possible. <br> And at that point, this President may learn just how imperial the legislative branch can be when it puts its mind to taking on the White House. <br> This commentary has been updated from a version published earlier.</div> 
 Health care is a big red flag signaling trouble ahead for President Trump's hope of passing a major tax reform package. <br> If President Trump and the Republicans in Congress are having to work this hard to approve legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare -- an article of faith that they've reaffirmed at least once a day eight years running -- then the odds of major changes in tax law are uncertain. <br> That's because the policy is no less complicated, nor the politics less complex. Indeed, they're more so. <br> House Republicans have been working on their own plan. <br> But House Republicans aren't giving up just yet, adding another layer of volatility to the GOP's effort to overhaul the federal tax code for the first time in three decades. <br> That's why, especially after progress on health care with House passage of the American Health Care Act, there's an episode that might better reveal the political briar patch Republicans and the administration are about to dive into: "Plan B." <br> Lesson of 2012 <br> Rewind to December 2012, when the Bush-era tax cuts were set to expire and the country tottered on a "fiscal cliff." If Congress didn't approve some sort of tax deal by New Year's Eve, virtually every American would get stuck with the bill. <br> House Republicans were scrambling to avoid getting run over by Obama, freshly re-elected and, for a moment, politically strengthened. <br> He wanted to preserve tax cuts for the middle class enacted by President George W. Bush in 2001, but let tax rates rise to where they used to be for higher income people -- "millionaires and billionaires," as he put it. <br> John Boehner, then the House speaker, first sought an expansive deal with Obama to preserve most of the Bush tax cuts, linking that provision to substantial entitlement reform (about $1 trillion) and authority to raise the debt ceiling. When that fell apart, Boehner pivoted to "Plan B." <br> The Ohio Republican told his conference that they had one chance to turn the tables on Obama and protect 99% of Americans from a tax hike: Offer a deal that took the President's 2012 campaign promise literally, to raise taxes on "millionaires" and above, but preserve existing rates for everyone else. <br> House Republicans demurred. And not just conservative rebels; some of Boehner's own lieutenants rejected the strategy. Politically, letting taxes rise for everyone was deemed preferable to taking a tough, compromise vote that would have saved tens of millions of Americans from a writing a bigger check to the IRS. <br> "The policy outcome was worse because Republicans couldn't do something that was tactically smart but politically difficult," recalled GOP operative Michael Steel, then a senior Boehner adviser. <br> (Obama ultimately struck a deal with Senate Republicans, then in the minority, to maintain the Bush-era rates for individuals and married couples earning less than $400,000 and $450,000, respectively -- well below the $1 million threshold Boehner tried to engineer.) <br> Fast-forward to 2017. <br> This won't be easy <br> Trump is proposing to strip the tax code of scores of cherished deductions as part of an overhaul that would cut rates on corporations and small businesses by a whopping 20 percentage points and, theoretically, reduce the burden on individuals and married filers. <br> Only the mortgage interest and charitable giving deductions would survive. Rather than relying on spending reductions to cover lost tax revenue, Trump's cuts would be paid for by the economic growth they generate, senior administration officials say. <br> Now: Explain how a party that couldn't even muster one tough vote on taxes not too long ago is going to withstand aggressive opposition from industry and political advocacy groups with their flush advertising budgets, and, oh, voters, and accomplish tax reform? <br> "It's not a plan, it's phony," a veteran House Republican who is usually supportive of the President told me, on condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly. "They're going to lower the rate to 15 percent but it's going to be revenue neutral? It's not going to work. That's not even well thought out." <br> Yet the prospects for tax reform have brightened somewhat with House approval of the American Health Care Act. <br> Sure, the Obamacare repeal package cleared the House with only two votes to spare, and faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Republicans in that chamber think so highly of it, they've decided to throw it in the trash and write their own bill. <br> But success in the House nonetheless proved that Trump and congressional Republicans might have the chops to govern, injecting fresh optimism into the party's tax reform push. <br> "This has brought the Republican Party together," Trump said during a public event to celebrate the House vote. "We're going to get this finished and then we're going, as you know, we put our tax plan in, it's a massive tax cut. The biggest tax cut in the history of our country." <br> The President might want to wait before he sends a braggadocios tweet. <br> That means tax reform that is revenue neutral. <br> In other words, contra Trump, House Republicans oppose reform that would send more money back to the people in tax cuts than it would generate in taxes paid. And, don't forget those pesky, beloved tax deductions that could be near impossible to find the votes in Congress to get rid of. <br> Politicians on both sides of the aisle like to say that health care is complicated because it involves one sixth of the economy. Well, tax policy is the economy. This is the breadth of the challenge that waits. 
 With his proposed tax cut, President Trump is giving the Republicans the red meat they have been craving. <br> After spending so many months toying around with his faux populist agenda, now the White House is really getting down to business. Coming at the end of this 100-day mark, President Trump's dramatic proposal to cut corporate tax rates from 35% to 15%, slashing individual rates, eliminating the alternative minimum tax, and abolishing the estate and gift tax signals that he understands where his bread is buttered, and that is by the Republican majorities on Capitol Hill. <br> Of all the moves that he could possibly make, including the failed attempt at repealing Obamacare or the infamous border wall, supply-side tax cuts are the most effective way for him to solidify his partisan support, which will be important to his future success with legislation and the possibility of re-election. <br> Tax cuts have been bread and butter for Republicans since the conservative revolution that rocked American politics in the 1970s. Along with anti-communism, few issues have energized Republicans like dismantling the progressive individual and corporate income tax system put into place in the early 20th century. <br> Conservatives made a number of arguments about why taxes should be cut on the wealthy. "Supply side" economists claimed that if the government freed up upper income earners and business with lower marginal tax rates, investment would start to flow and everyone would benefit. <br> Other conservatives stressed that progressive taxes were unfair, a symbol of big government, and lowering them was the most effective way to put a stake in the heart of big government liberalism. <br> Just because wealthier people and organizations earned more than the middle class, it was not fair that the government should be required to pay a higher rate than lower income Americans. <br> Tax cuts skewed toward the upper income brackets play with well with the business and financial community that have often been big supporters of the GOP. In addition, shrewd conservatives like David Stockman, who served as President Reagan's budget director, championed the "starve the beast" argument. <br> It's a losing argument to convince Americans that government programs which they perceive as providing benefits should be cut. So if the Republicans wanted to shrink government programs, their best bet was to lower tax revenues, making less money available to Washington for spending. <br> For decades, Republican presidents have made tax cuts a priority. President Reagan pushed through a historic tax cut in the summer of 1981 that lowered the top rate from 70% to 50% for individuals and lowered corporate income taxes by over $150 billion. <br> "No other issue," Reagan said, "goes so directly to the heart of our economic life." In 1986, he worked with Democrats in Congress to pass loophole-closing tax reform in exchange for lowering rates once again. <br> President George W. Bush did the same in 2001 with a $1.3 trillion reduction (including the elimination of the estate tax), ending the era of federal surpluses that started under President Clinton, and again in 2003 even though the US was in the middle of a war. Bill Plante of CBS News recalled that "the younger Bush went around telling people, 'Look, I'm more like Ronald Reagan than my father." <br> Indeed, the big exception to GOP tax-cutting was President George H.W. Bush, who despite lowering the capital gains tax accepted tax increases as part of the 1990 deficit reduction plan. He paid the price. Conservatives like Congressman Newt Gingrich, future speaker of the House, never forgave him. And he wasn't able to win a second term in his race against Bill Clinton. <br> It took some time for President Trump to get to the tax plan, but now it looks like he is going to send conservatives what they want. <br> While there are many economists who don't believe that this tax cut would have beneficial consequences over the long term, especially by bursting deficits that will strain the nation, politically this could be a winning proposal. <br> Coming at a time when many Republican legislators are itching to deliver an important victory, this would have great appeal to the traditional constituencies of the Republican Party. <br> The corporate world, still uneasy with Trump's populist rhetoric and attacks on free trade, might be a big more comfortable once they are delivered this benefit. And as Presidents Reagan and Bush realized, there are ways to package supply-side tax cuts with rhetoric and targeted sweeteners so that working class conservatives believe they will be sharing a piece of this economic pie. <br> Even though there is a lot of grumbling among Republicans about the impact on the deficits and proposals such as eliminating the deductions for state and local taxes, which will hit New York and California residents hard, Reagan also had trouble moving his tax bill in 1981. <br> After the assassination attempt on his life, Reagan came back and mounted a full-scale public relations blitz that was effective. Most Republicans who opposed him backed off. Democrats ended up adding provisions to the bill (compared to Christmas Tree ornaments) that benefited middle class Americans rather than trying to block it altogether. <br> It will be difficult for Democrats to fight back against President Trump's proposals. While the House and Senate Democrats have found considerable room to obstruct and say no to President Trump, standing against tax cuts has often been one place the party feels vulnerable. <br> They all remember when Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale admitted in 1984 that if elected he would raise taxes, which gave President Reagan ample material to attack. Democratic senators from swing states will be uneasy taking a stand against tax cuts, even if they believe them to be irresponsible, for fearing of giving their opponents a powerful issue to campaign on. <br> Unlike some of the other issues thus far, like refugee bans and health care, this is an issue that President Trump can't afford to lose. This is one of the principal demands from Republicans of their president and it is an issue where the political dynamics in an era of united government point to success. This, more than anything, will give us a measure of what he can do on Capitol Hill. <br> If President Trump can get the tax cut back to his desk for a signature, this could be an important turning point in his policy agenda after the early turbulent months of legislating. Just this one victory, which would be a big one politically, could give him and the Republicans more than they need to take onto the campaign trail in 2018 and 2020 as they aim to keep control of Washington. 
 What we have learned about Donald Trump's leanings on tax policy make them Exhibit A in his bait-and-switch presidency. Although he was elected as a man of the people, Trump's tax reform plans make it clear that he is serving as a baron for billionaires. <br> The tea leaves that pass for a coherent legislative policy suggest that Trump's Plan A had pulled a page or two from House Speaker Paul Ryan's playbook, long on the shelves. Ryan had a wonky, but nifty, three-step: <br> -- One, repeal, but don't quite replace Obamacare; <br> -- Two, enact a corporate tax reform featuring a brand new "border adjustment" tax, also known as tariffs; and <br> -- Three, enact sweeping income tax cuts and repeal the estate tax. <br> Alas, Plan A didn't quite work. Turns out that the people paid attention to details, like the devilish one about the 24 million who stand to lose health insurance coverage. <br> Unfortunately, real tax policy ought to be more than a Vegas-style magic show. There are two painfully serious sets of problems with the return of supply-side witchcraft. <br> Even if growth were to spike up quickly to these rosy-hued levels, interest rates, still historically low, would certainly rise. This would doubly hurt the federal government, because it would have more debt to finance, due to the tax cuts, and at higher interest rates. <br> Second, even if we were to plunge into more debt on a risky gambit for greater growth, why should tax cuts for the rich get the first (and maybe only) priority for the corresponding goodies? <br> Couldn't the trillions for billionaires be better spent, say, on middle-class tax cuts, infrastructure investments, and/or education, with perhaps a little left over for science, the environment and international affairs? <br> Donald Trump got elected president promising to be a man of the people, a ruler for the forgotten. Now it is he who seems to have forgotten. His Plan A on tax reform was to take from the bottom to give to the top. Thwarted in that effort by the people, who turn out to like having health care, Trump turned to Plan B: take from the future to give to the top. <br> Let us hope that the people rise up again and stop the latest attempt at a billionaire money grab. <br> Then maybe, just maybe, Trump could live up to his promise to be a new kind of politician, one for the American middle class. He could give us Plan C: a tax reform that, instead of giving more breaks to the billionaire class, actually asks them to share more with the rest of us. Unfortunately, it is exactly such a sensible reaction to rising economic inequality and mounting associated political concerns that sounds like voodoo these days. 
 President Donald Trump doesn't care what the experts have to say. "No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!," he tweeted. <br> While his critique of the concept of the first 100 days might be fair, it is hard to look at how Trump has performed in the first months in office and not conclude that he and the Republicans face a serious problem. <br> On foreign policy, he has flipped and flopped without any major diplomatic or military breakthroughs. He has stimulated an energized opposition movement that has caused Republican legislators attending their own town halls to think twice about supporting anything that he says. Throughout everyday of this period a major scandal involving collusion with Russia in the election has loomed over his actions. <br> Just maybe, however, the failures of these months are not as devastating as some might think. <br> Normalizing the presidency? <br> And notably, the normalization of a presidency that seemed so tenuous in January is an accomplishment in itself for Trump. With many observers wondering if he would be able to handle the day-to-day challenges that come with the job and whether he would last for very long with his twitter-storms and tirades, it is worth noting that as we enter into the summer most of the discussion now centers on what comes next with his policy agenda. What will he do with North Korea? How will he handle relations with China? Can he move forward with tax reform or an infrastructure package? The shift in discussion has been a remarkable turn of events for this controversial former reality television show star. All the talk about the conflict of interest with his family business and new political business has generally subsided. <br> This is the kind of scandal that could make Watergate or Iran-Contra look like child's play. Yet, at least thus far, he has survived. Partisan loyalty has protected the administration in the House where the Intelligence Committee investigation initially seemed to have broken down. Other than a handful of voices in the Senate, such as John McCain or Lindsey Graham, there has been notable silence within the GOP about all the evidence that has emerged. This scandal could still get much worse, but at least at the close of the first 100 days Trump is still standing and the national conversation has shifted to other issues. <br> Trump's agenda <br> The administration has been able to destabilize the standing of the media. Trump's incessant attacks on news organizations as "fake" and his ability to flood the country with misleading or false statements via Twitter and his advisers have made it more difficult for Americans to tell the difference between fact or fiction. <br> He has built on trends that have been gathering strength over decades, such as the increasingly partisan news and distrust in the media, to undermine confidence in what people hear from established sources. In this kind of atmosphere, it is easier for the President to shift the national agenda to new issues and confuse public understanding of what is going on. Reporters are having difficulty serving as "watchdogs" when more people don't believe what they are saying. <br> Executive power, though not as long-lasting as legislation, has served as a potent tool in Trump's arsenal. At the same time he has shown almost no interest in working on legislation or even engaging members of Congress, he has tapped into his CEO instincts by using executive orders with increasing ferocity. <br> While the ban on refugees stalled in the courts, other measures such as accelerated deportations and deregulations of energy markets have moved forward at a Rooseveltian pace. He has staffed many key agencies with top opponents of the programs they now run. Senate Democrats were unable to stop the confirmations. The measures will have a big effect on the lives and industries being regulated, while his appeals to the mainstream Republican Party -- at the same time he drops his populist facade -- will shore up his support with Republicans. <br> Still Trump can't be boasting about what's happened since January. In the list of presidential 100 days, his will be low on the list. If he wants to be part of the pantheon of productive presidents, there is no way to make that case convincingly. <br> His opponents though shouldn't be so confident either since a closer look at what's happened since inauguration suggests this President might be in much better shape than they think, with a lot of time still left on his political clock. For those who initially asked if impeachment or resignation would happen soon, they might start thinking about what the odds are for a second term. 
 It can be tempting to try and draw far-reaching conclusions about the 2018 midterm elections from the special election results in Georgia's 6th congressional district, where Democrat Jon Ossoff came close to winning the 50% of the vote he needed to capture the longtime conservative seat. <br> But those midterms are more than 19 months away and a whole lot can change between now and then. President Trump is likely to encounter additional national security challenges; congressional Republicans may by then have tackled big issues like tax reform and infrastructure spending; and the state of the country's economy may be very different than it is today. <br> For all of these reasons, all pundits and prognosticators should take a deep breath and realize that whatever electoral predictions they make today have a decent shot at being proven wrong when voters test them in November 2018. <br> In many ways, Republicans are still learning what it means to have unified control of the federal government. As Speaker Paul Ryan noted when he withdrew the Republican alternative to Obamacare in late March, there are growing pains that come with the new responsibilities that GOP officeholders have been tasked with. <br> To be successful in 2018, Republicans in Congress -- working with the Trump administration -- will need to work out the kinks and make progress in advancing a conservative governing agenda. And that begins with demonstrating an ability to pass a sensible replacement to the Affordable Care Act. <br> Voters in Georgia's 6th congressional district didn't appear to be punishing Republicans for their inability to repeal and replace Obamacare in late March -- Democrat Jon Ossoff only slightly outperformed Hillary Clinton's in last night's election and Republican Karen Handel will likely beat him in the upcoming runoff. But GOP voters' patience is not infinite. <br> For more than seven years, Republican officeholders and candidates have promised that they would take decisive action on President Obama's signature health care law. A single failure to do so can be attributable to "growing pains." But a continual inability to pass into law a conservative, market-based alternative to the Affordable Care Act will have electoral consequences for Republican congressional candidates across the country. <br> President Trump did the right thing by featuring the American Health Care Act as his first major foray into working with Congress. While the results were not positive, he recognized that failure to act on health care would have political consequences. It's now up to him and congressional leaders like Speaker Ryan to finally deliver. Failing to do so will impact election results not just in Georgia's sixth congressional district, but across America. 
 On April 15, many Americans will join Tax Marches in cities in almost every state to tell Trump that we do, in fact, care a great deal about his taxes. <br> Though folks may grouse, most people in the United States take very seriously our collective responsibility to pay our taxes. We know that taxes help provide clean air and water, safe food and drugs, passable roads and bridges, protective police, successful schools and so many things that make our communities livable. We, therefore, need to create a more equitable system that closes loopholes, invests in communities and puts money in the hands of working Americans. <br> Trump's tax returns -- or lack thereof -- cannot be excluded from any discussion of a more equitable system. His returns are critical to understanding the true state of Trump's financial affairs. Without complete returns, we won't know whether he owes money to foreign governments or their leaders, how much he has given in charitable contributions, how much (if anything) he has personally paid in taxes and what some of his assets really are. <br> On the matter of international entanglement, a surprising new buzzword -- "foreign emoluments" -- has entered the political lexicon. This phrase refers to any payments from foreign governments to the president, as our founders had the foresight to include a clause in the Constitution prohibiting foreign nations from bribing our top executive. <br> The people really do care -- if he has benefited from the many tax breaks afforded to the rich, his gains would reflect a fundamental inequity in the American tax system and a driver for the weekend march. <br> So Trump can be sure that Americans won't stop marching, chanting and demanding his tax returns until he finally releases them. 
 CNN Opinion invited commentators to weigh in on President Trump's speech to Congress Tuesday night. The views expressed are theirs. <br> Eric Liu: A master of symbols over substance <br> In his first presidential address to Congress, Donald Trump tonight reminded us that he is a master of symbols over substance. And he reminded us as well that this is a pretty effective formula for success in American politics. <br> From his opening (if belated) words condemning recent acts of anti-Semitism to his promises to cut two regulations for every new one created to his highlighting the widow of a Navy SEAL, Trump dealt mainly in rhetorical gestures. <br> But people who criticize Trump for dealing in such gestures and for offering few specifics forget that public leadership depends on symbols. More than that, it depends on setting a simple vision and animating it with symbols and with stories. Like it or not, Trump is good at that. <br> This speech was his most effective moment as president. It played to his natural strengths -- performance and theatricality -- while keeping his liabilities, like cynical incuriosity and casual cruelty, at bay. More than that, with talk of infrastructure investment and hints at immigration reform, it showed his willingness to keep both left and right off-balance. It hinted at the trouble Democrats would be in if Trump could ever sustain discipline. <br> Unfortunately for him, the rest of his job requires him to face the world in its actual complexity -- and to deliver. The daily grind of governing will likely reveal tonight's Trump to be the exception rather than the rule. "The time for trivial fights is behind us," he said. But shortly afterward, he regained access to his Twitter account. <br> Eric Liu is founder of Citizen University and executive director of the Aspen Institute Citizenship American Identity Program. His books include "A Chinaman's Chance" and "The Gardens of Democracy." He was a White House speechwriter and policy adviser for President Bill Clinton. Follow him on Twitter: @ericpliu. <br> Mark Bauerlein: Leaning on themes that got him elected <br> Trump supporters might have found the pageantry of the lead-up to Donald Trump's speech a bit much, impatient as they are of DC puffery. But soon after Trump started, the wellsprings of his patriotism fed their profound hunger for national meaning. <br> It's a desire that my fellow academics and cosmopolitan elites do not understand. As I was interviewed on CNN International last week, the host insisted that America was doing just fine--low unemployment and strong stock market--so why the talk about American decline? I answered that a nation isn't measured primarily by money. There is, first, the sense of home and self-esteem and respect for law and order. <br> In fear of strong convictions, it pushes the minimization of nation, the break-up of American tradition into a breezy multiculturalism, the opening of borders, the conversion of American citizens with roots in a time and place into global citizens with no roots and who should belong everywhere, which is to say, nowhere. Trump's understanding of this is why he won. <br> The details in the speech were unsurprising: fewer regulations, less lobbying, less off-shoring of jobs, new trade agreements, border security, repeal of Obamacare, an end to the "cycle of poverty," a stop to violent crime, the suggestion of opening vouchers to religious schools. As always, the consequences of all these claims remains to be seen. <br> One thing is certain, though: President Trump stuck to the very themes that have generated so much rancor and heat, and nothing he said or did tonight promises to lower the temperature. When he said that his job is not to "represent the world," only the USA, the globalists and internationalists and intellectuals suspicious of American power knew their enemy. <br> Mark Bauerlein is a professor of English at Emory University, senior editor of the journal "First Things" and author of "The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future; Or, Don't Trust Anyone Under 30." <br> Jen Psaki: New tone, but no new clarity <br> It is safe to say there has been no "joint session" speech in modern televised history that was anticipated with lower expectations. We waited for Donald Trump to invoke American carnage and doom and gloom and instead we got something much closer to a broad and traditional address. <br> The change in tone, helped by the personal stories in the second half of the speech, was noteworthy--though the glow will only last as long as he maintains the positive tone, which may be a matter of hours. <br> Also striking was how completely disconnected these remarks were from the speeches and the actions of first five weeks of the Trump Administration. <br> Beyond the news cycle coverage of any joint session speech, the goal of such an address is to give marching orders for the months ahead. But Trump failed to lay out a specific path to achieve his policy objectives. It is just as mathematically impossible today to keep health care coverage for pre-existing conditions, repeal the Obamacare mandate and lower costs as it was yesterday. He did not make any tough choices on how exactly to achieve tax reform where tax cuts to the middle class are not impacted. And he did not present a new strategy for going after ISIL. <br> The audience is the American people at home, but more than five weeks into the administration it is also the people in the room. They may be relieved by the change in tone (and we will see how long that lasts) but they don't have any more clarity on his legislative agenda now than they did before the speech. <br> Jen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, served as the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. <br> Kayleigh McEnany: Democrats cool to Trump's message of unity <br> His words reflected the American ethos. But, sadly, unifying, benevolent messages like extending treatment for Americans addicted to drugs were met with Democratic recalcitrance, as left-wing elected officials sat firmly planted on one side of the House chamber, where clapping was sparse. <br> Democratic resistance could not squelch the overriding message of unity, best represented by the emotional moment when Trump saluted Carryn Owens, wife of fallen Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, reminding us that, "the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom --- we will never forget him." <br> Kayleigh McEnany is a CNN commentator </em>and a graduate of Harvard Law School. <br> Errol Louis: An olive branch for Democrats? <br> President Donald Trump delivered what many hoped for: a speech calling for unity with Democrats -- a key departure after antagonizing them during his first month in office. <br> The commander-in-chief's straightforward presentation was also a departure from his usual bombastic style. Trump stayed cool when Democrats stayed seated as Republicans rose to clap, or gave a thumbs down to his proposed Obamacare repeal. He largely refrained from his habit of rehashing the election and the rise of the coalition that brought him to power. <br> While Trump seemed to be sending an olive branch to Democrats with his approach Tuesday night, the Republican is going to face problems within his own party when it comes to his budget. <br> Trump might not find a friend in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, either. The Kentucky Republican said today that the upper chamber would kill Trump's budget plan -- featuring a 37 percent spending cut to the Department of State -- if it's sent to the Senate. <br> In other words, Trump may have connected with some Democrats, even as a showdown looms with his fellow Republicans. <br> Errol Lous is the host of "Inside City Hall," a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. <br> Sahar Aziz: Solidarity with his far-right, anti-Muslim base <br> Donald Trump prides himself on snubbing political correctness. Thus, he made sure to emphasize that the terrorism he is fighting is "Islamic." <br> While Trump rightfully acknowledged the rise in hate crimes against Jewish communities, he was resoundingly silent about the rise in attacks and discrimination against American Muslims. Even his mention of the shooting in Kansas City left out that the victims were apparently mistaken for Muslim. Trump's material omissions demonstrate that he did not have American Muslims in mind when he stated "We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood." <br> Evidently, Trump is concerned with political correctness more than he admits -- the type imposed by his far right, anti-Muslim base. <br> Sahar Aziz is associate professor at Texas AM University School of Law, where she teaches national security, civil rights, and Middle East law. She is also a fellow at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. <br> Aaron David Miller: What the President really meant to say <br> Not surprisingly, foreign policy didn't figure prominently in the president's address to the joint session of Congress. But President Trump did lay down several foreign policy markers. Here's a rundown of what he said in the speech, and what I'm pretty sure he really said about them during the car ride over to the Capitol. <br> ''We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim World, to extinguish this vile enemy ISIS from our planet." Trump in car: Boy am I really out on a limb on this one; I said in my inaugural that I'd eradicate ISIS from the face of the earth. But how can I do that without eliminating the conditions in Syria and Iraq on which ISIS feeds. And that would mean deep US involvement in nation-building; not only that, the plan the Pentagon has given me is really just a plus up from what Obama been doing. <br> "America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align." Trump in car: This was really clever on my part. I didn't want to mention Russia, let alone Mr. Putin, for obvious reasons; but I really did want to give him a shout out. He's strong and tough like me; and I know I can cut deal with him. <br> "My job is not to represent the world, my job is to represent the United States of America." Trump in car: Boy do I love that line. To all you liberal interventionists and neocons who somehow think I belong to the "US as the indispensable power" club, think again. No more globaloney. It's America first. I'm looking out for number one. And you know who that is. <br> Alice Stewart: Trump in charge <br> A lengthy standing ovation honoring American hero Ryan Owens and led by Donald Trump allowed him to demonstrate, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he is President and Commander in Chief for all Americans- no ifs, no ands, no buts. <br> To say that President Donald Trump's joint session speech was optimistic is an understatement. The more than hour-long address was filled with references to renewal of the American spirit. Trump spoke of unity, with a heartfelt tribute to Black History Month, condemned attacks on Jewish Community Centers and cemeteries, and the recent apparent hate killing in Kansas. <br> Democrats sat on their hands for much of the speech, even during talk of a $1 trillion infrastructure spending package. The president simply looked the other way and drove home his commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, defend our borders, provide tax relief for the middle class, build the Keystone pipeline, and restore respect for the rule of law. <br> For those who have been asking when President Trump was going to start reaching outside his base, the joint session speech is your answer. From Obamacare, to immigration, to national security -- President Trump stressed that the best way to solve these complicated problems is to join forces. <br> Alice Stewart is a CNN Political Commentator and former Communications Director for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. She has worked in communications for the presidential campaigns of Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann, as well as communications for Concerned Women for America. <br> Peniel Joseph: A speech that trafficked in fear and division <br> President Donald J. Trump opened his first congressional address with a rhetorical flourish that noted the last day of Black History Month as a time to reflect on the nation's past progress toward civil rights, marred by a recent uptick in anti-Semitism that may well be at least partially a result of the divisive language used by the President himself. What the President touted as a "renewal of American spirit" is actually a period that has been marked by a resurgence of racism, xenophobia, religious intolerance, and attacks on LGBTQ communities. <br> Like champions of Brexit, Trump doubled down on his nation building rhetoric Tuesday night, with a promise to rebuild long decayed industries and "make America great again." <br> Veterans, white industrial workers, and active military and law enforcement shine in this narrative, which makes the ambitious claim that inner cities like Chicago, and all the rest of urban America will be dragged into prosperity (presumably kicking and screaming since the president received a scant 8% of the black vote) by the sheer will of a president touting pro-growth policies. These he claims will jumpstart an American economy that has already seen steady, but relatively constrained, growth since the great recession. <br> The president repeated his campaign promise to build a "great wall" along the nation's southern border in an effort to defend the homeland against, what he has repeatedly called the "bad hombres." <br> Threats from terrorists, illegal immigrants, and drug cartels formed the core of a presidential speech that trafficked in fear as the fuel for a renewal of the American Dream. The President ratcheted up his law and order rhetoric by parading victims of immigration crimes in the gallery, in a shameless act of exploitation designed to further mass incarceration. It was a divisive, intolerant, and ultimately dangerous speech from a president content to serve more as a demagogue than inspirational leader of the world's greatest democracy. <br> Peniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Political Values and Ethics and the Founding Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. <br> Michael D'Antonio: A 'Game of Thrones' mental landscape <br> With repeated references to "I" and "my" and "me," Trump flashed his lifelong narcissism and reassured the nation that at least he is consistent. With so many warlike references and the promise of a new fortress America, walled off and fearful, we returned to Trump's true inner reality. It's a mental landscape worthy of Game of Thrones. <br> Michael D'Antonio is the author of "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success."</div> 
 What American doesn't love a good deal? A free lunch, a gallon of unleaded for $1.50, half-priced theater tickets -- they never get old. We love them so much that we even invent opportunities for more in the form of game shows such as "Let's Make a Deal" or "The Price Is Right." <br> But in the era of President Donald J. Trump, the stakes of our political deals are much higher. That is why, especially for conservatives, reading the fine print with every purchase is critical. If we do not, we risk getting taken for a ride -- trading away the health of our democracy for less critical wins. <br> This means that Trump now needs conservatives far more than we need him. Understanding this leverage will be critical to our negotiations with him for the rest of his presidency. <br> He knows this all too well and has turned to conservatives, recently hosting a campaign-style rally in Florida and, last week, appearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he heralded his election as a "win for conservative values." On Tuesday night, he'll address Congress and, if past is prologue, direct his comments again to his core supporters. <br> Trump has deployed his deal-making skills in our direction from the beginning. His pitch was simple: "Vote for me and I'll appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court." Most conservative voters were willing to hold their noses and agree to this, in spite of his many concerning qualities. <br> But as we would with any other important deal in life, we must now assess what we're actually giving up against what we're receiving. Because what we're compromising, in this case, may be worth far more than what we're getting in return. <br> For example, Trump promised national security through increased military spending, but then opened the door to Russia's assault on our democracy and that of our most important allies in Europe. <br> He promoted a departure from political correctness in the name of free speech, but then put us in league with white nationalists, who oppose equality, as he undermines our free press, and even truth itself, by labeling them "fake news." <br> He sold us a conservative justice but appears intent on also delivering a judiciary branch with diminished independence through his attacks on what he calls "so-called judges," whose reasonable, yet unfavorable (to him) decisions he calls "political." <br> This deal should have us checking to see if we still have our wallets. It's as though Trump is granting us a free night in one of his garish gold-plated hotels as long as we part with our life savings in the casino downstairs. <br> Each of these trades is designed to give us a policy win we want in exchange for our turning a blind eye to Trump's amassing of power at the expense of our republic's essential ideals, norms, and institutions, which are enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. <br> Conservatives have loudly warned of their erosion as a matter of highest concern for decades. Will we now trade them away them for important, but lesser prizes? If so, was liberty ever our real concern, or was it merely a partisan prop in a political play? <br> We should expect Trump to approach the rest of his presidency in this transactional manner and our nation will be well-served if we demand first his respect for that which ensures our freedom. <br> For conservatives, protecting the republic requires our walking away from supporting Trump when the price to too high. As important as they are, defense spending increases, regulation rollbacks and tax reform are not a good enough trade for Trump's alignment with Russia, attacks on our free press and other branches of government, and conflicts of interest associated with his foreign business interests. <br> Continuing to back him while ignoring his attempts to weaken our democracy jeopardizes our liberty and will have long-term, negative political consequences for Republicans. <br> For the country, and for ourselves, it's time for us to say "no deal" and demand better of our president. 
 Trump's greatest firewall against the Democrats has been the fact that he enjoys a united Republican government. As of now, the GOP has been very reluctant to challenge the administration and generally remains optimistic about the political benefits that will accrue from this moment of Republican control. <br> This was supposed to be the Republican moment. But with a little over of a third of the Hundred Days almost over, Capitol Hill sounds like crickets chirping in the dead of night. <br> The early months of a presidency can be critical. Franklin Roosevelt, who would send 15 major bills to Congress by the end of his Hundred Days, had legislators working on an emergency banking bill just days after taking office. The Economy Act, which cut spending, passed a few days after FDR began work in the White House.. <br> On the night of John F. Kennedy's assassination, Lyndon Johnson was already meeting with advisers to plan how he would move forward a massive tax cut and civil rights bill through the Senate, while mapping out a schedule for sending to the Hill a host of other domestic bills. <br> Notwithstanding the controversial election that brought him into office, George W. Bush was pushing within weeks for a massive supply-side tax cut and a federal educational bill to show that he would govern like he had a mandate. By the end of January in President Obama's first term, the House had passed a massive economic stimulus bill and both chambers had voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. More importantly he was already working on health care and financial reform. <br> Why is Trump moving so slowly on the legislative front compared with his nonstop pace on everything else? If you asked him, the President would certainly blame the Democrats. He would say that the Democrats are obstructing and delaying so that he can't get anything done. But the fact is that Republicans control the House and the Senate, so charges of obstruction make little sense. <br> And in fact it's not clear whether Trump even has much interest in the legislative process. This is where his background in business might not serve him well. Congressional politics is slow, messy, incremental and often frustrating. None of this is the kind of experience that Trump enjoyed in the world of business. The command-and-control structure of the corporation, where the CEO is boss, doesn't exist in our separation of powers, where the president has to work with or find ways to work through many other actors with fiefdoms of their own. <br> To be sure, the Hundred Days ain't even close to over yet. There is still more than enough time for Trump to start moving on the legislative front and to put his opponents in a defensive position. Tuesday's address to Congress serves as an opportunity for him to get this part of his term going. If he tries a rapid-fire approach, as he has done with executive orders, with legislation, then congressional Republicans will move the bills with speed and muscle. But he has to keep them on his side. <br> Most members of Congress understand that moments of partisan unity like the one Trump now enjoys are few and far between. Time is the most valuable commodity in American politics, and with every day the opportunities for passing legislation fall away. <br> Trump needs to be careful right now. Many Republicans are clearly grumbling that the pace of the legislative agenda is not just halting but almost non-existent. Trump should not confuse partisan loyalty with love for him. The Republicans want bills to be sent their way. The longer he waits, the more that frustration builds and the more temptation there could be for the GOP to break with him. Then President Trump might find out, like presidents before him, just what Congress can do to a commander in chief they don't like. 
 As a very young man barely rounding the corner on 30, I had the opportunity to witness and view the Reagan revolution by serving as an enthusiastic and blindly optimistic apprentice in his administration. Now at the opposite bookend of my life, I have the challenge and honor of providing tiny bits of advice and counsel to my friend, the President of the United States, Donald Trump. <br> Like President Reagan before him, President Trump is beginning a White House journey with a rocky and tumultuous introduction in the midst of great division, discontent and confusion among a very diverse and conflicted American and foreign constituency. I cannot help but reflect on the parallels of these two administrations as a compass for clarity and direction. <br> President Trump is not only changing the tapestry of policy but is maneuvering the manner in which it is woven and the threads of its composition. His campaign was unconventional and disruptive, and he is now tackling Washington in an unconventional and disruptive way. It was Reagan who famously responded to a question from a Washington veteran on doing things unconventionally, "Well, isn't that why we are here?" <br> The arrival of President Trump is causing many legacy institutions to feel challenged as they scramble with the change that he is stewarding. The inertia and momentum of the government does not naturally lend itself to new methods of communication, thinking and negotiation. <br> In fact, the stable, recurring patterns of the Washington bureaucracy are designed to be immune from a consistent changing of the deck chairs, and become agitated by the need to acclimate to new circumstances. President Trump is facing the same opposition that President Reagan did almost four decades ago from the fixtures of the Washington and the global geopolitical scene. The bureaucracy is not the enemy but an essential ingredient to our success. <br> Without an unwavering entrenched establishment providing bureaucratic stability, our democratic system would cease to function in the ever-changing winds of temporal political shifts. An entrenched establishment is a safeguard, not a terminal illness. However, the bureaucracy must be amended, adopted, nourished, realigned, incentivized and held accountable. If not, the machinery itself, not the people who run it, become corroded and corrupt. Without constant supervision and monitoring, the bureaucracy will both grow in size and diminish in efficacy. <br> The President's policies were clear and distinct in his campaign and continue to be his priorities into his second month of governing: tax policy, job growth, immigration reform, a reworked health care system, a renewed national security alignment, a strengthened military and a re-engineered trade practice and policy. If the President is able to take advantage of an aligned Congress and executive branch to enact even half of these policies within the first year of administration, he will accomplish more than any other president in history. <br> The difficulty and challenge is the implementation of the President's policies into action by the agencies that are built to preserve the status quo and prevent abrupt movement. Aligning the leadership and bureaucracy of the Cabinet agencies with the policy initiatives of the President is a managerial nightmare. <br> The agencies are manned by political Schedule C appointees (individuals who report to presidential appointees), and an army of civil servants working hand in hand. Either group operating in isolation without the other is ineffective and somewhat dangerous. A little more than 30 days since the inauguration, the administration still has 2,000 vacancies, many of which require Senate confirmation, a process which is antagonistically slow and politically charged. These appointees are the nano-engines that will realign the bureaucracy to appropriately adapt to the President's and Congress's direction and practices. Without them, it will be status quo, "for better or worse." <br> The press is not the enemy, the intelligence community is the not the enemy, and even leaks in the new world of instantaneous information and social media are not the enemy. The enemies are time and confused expectations. <br> If we stop judging the President and his administration on every word that is uttered, every hour, and instead hold him accountable over time for the implementation of policies under which he ran, confusion might turn to clarity. <br> The challenges that the President is facing are not abnormal, nor are they earthshaking. Leaks to the press, death by bureaucratic sabotage and rogue cables from within the State Department are nothing new under the sun; in fact, they are celebrated traditions and were even more demonstrable during the era of the Reagan administration. <br> America is a vast tapestry of millions of threads, a multitude of colors and a diverse and distinguished array of fabric. What is truly important to the mastery of the artistry is a process that melds all these diverse elements into an understandable and lucid portrait. <br> President Reagan is not remembered for the initial confusions as he first began to set the pace. In fact, the first year of the contrarian Reagan revolution was anything but seamless. Reagan is remembered for his effective policies -- tax reform, deregulation, reinvigorating our military, bringing down the Berlin Wall -- accomplishments which were not achieved in his first year and in fact, were the result of a lengthy processes requiring significant time in the saddle, and incredible perseverance in the face of opposition. <br> The bottom line is the debate, the dialogue, the concern, the bickering, the parrying and thrusting all contribute to the process of American democracy. The institutional press is doing its job in bringing to light all sides of the Rubik's cube. <br> Journalism has dramatically changed over the last decade. Everyone has instantaneous access to data. Walter Cronkite's "And that's the way it is" no longer holds relevance to a viewer who can access information in an instant. The art of journalism is now about adding perspective and point of view to widely available facts that were once scarce and only disseminated to mainstream media. This, ultimately, is a good thing, and through adversity produces prolific dialogue and greater understanding of all points of view to a broader audience. <br> The results will always appear unsatisfactory to varying constituencies. What makes America work is the process that allows us all to express our dissatisfaction, not necessarily bask in the results of unquestioned splendor. <br> So, as I sit here musing almost 40 years later, I am hopeful and encouraged by lessons learned from the final chapters of the Reagan presidency. President Trump is a great man, and the most effective action we can take as Americans is to give him a chance. <br> With our help, he will find the same trajectory as that of President Reagan, and the nation and the world will soon look through his abrupt, blunt and esoteric style to find bold substance, compassion, implementation of his policies, global respect and admiration, and a rebalancing of the attributes that truly make America great. Let's simply hold the President accountable for delivering on the promises and policies upon which he was elected. <br> "And that's the way it is." 
 It was a disciplined message he delivered in Maryland, though in his usual extemporaneous style -- and that message was all about commonality of purpose. <br> To the left and those inside the media, it may have seemed like business as usual -- a reinforcement of traditional conservative talking points and promises. But that would be to misunderstand what the appearance meant for the Trump of 2017 -- in a different position now from the Trump who snubbed the proceedings in 2016, causing conservatives and populists at the annual conference to take sides. <br> On Friday, he arrived at CPAC having proven that he could motivate enough support outside of those policy and media circles to gain the power to deliver on those conservative promises. <br> And he has connected not just with the gathered activists and policy wonks, but with voters in Middle America that felt left out and left behind. Indeed, he continues to demonstrate that his message and his agenda can energize and motivate conservatives and other voters, including those who just a year earlier in this same venue viewed his candidacy with considerable skepticism. Now they are excited about him. <br> "It's great to be back at CPAC ... I love this place," he declared. The reception from the capacity crowd made it clear that the feeling is mutual, at least for now in the flush of victory, with the 2016 tensions replaced by a remarkable sense of optimism and enthusiasm. <br> That enthusiasm came in part because of Trump's address, which shrewdly framed his agenda in the context of familiar conservative flashpoint issues. He targeted the media, long a bête noire for the right, calling out "fake news" and the use of anonymous sources on stories. "Let their names be put out there," Trump said about critical stories based on leaks. "Let them say it to my face." <br> He continued his attack on "fake news," but said he respected the media and reporters who work hard to get stories right. Trump insisted that he will defend the First Amendment -- "who uses it more than me?" he quipped, getting a laugh -- but that it also allows him to criticize the media, just as it allows the media to criticize him. <br> On policy, Trump also stuck mainly to the common ground between populists and conservatives. Border security and immigration enforcement got the loudest cheers, as well as his pledge to represent the United States rather than the globe. <br> He repeatedly praised the NRA and pledged, "We will protect the Second Amendment," another hot-button issue with conservatives. He pledged that tax reform and deregulation, longtime projects at CPAC, would be high on his list of priorities, too. <br> All of those issues command common between populists and conservatives. The one area in which Trump appeared to seek a middle ground was on national security policy in the Middle East. He criticized the interventionist foreign policies of both Barack Obama and George Bush, saying "if our presidents had gone to the beach for the last 15 years, we'd be in much better shape." <br> However, Trump also got loud cheers for his pledge to "obliterate ISIS" and conduct "one of the great military buildups in American history." The two positions are not necessarily contradictory, but they do highlight one political tightrope he must walk between the two factions responsible for the Republican Party triumph in 2016. <br> The populists who carried Trump to victory, especially those of the Ron and Rand Paul factions, want an end to foreign entanglements altogether. Movement conservatives and the neocons mainly favor a forward strategy on terrorism, and hope to advance Western interests in former Soviet republics, which populists blame for bad relations with Russia. Balancing all this will be especially tricky in the months ahead. <br> Factions may end up at odds again before next year's CPAC on other potential fracture points, such as the tension between conservatives and populists on the deficits and on entitlement reform -- the latter especially acute on the issue of Obamacare repeal. <br> For the moment, though, the focus remains on the potential for significant advances for the right -- and Trump's speech reminded conservatives at CPAC of those tantalizing possibilities. 
 Facing fierce criticism from the right on fiscal policy, President Donald Trump has developed a new sense of urgency. In an interview last weekend with Fox's Bill O'Reilly, when asked if Americans should expect a tax cut this year, instead of saying something along the lines of "yes, absolutely," Trump offered the more restrained, "I think so ... before the end of the year. I would like to say yes." <br> Reforming the tax code is likely to be far more politically complicated than the Trump officials, most of whom are new to Washington, think. As a congressional staff aide and later an outside adviser, I worked on both the 1981 and 1986 tax reform packages. <br> The process of seeking a consensus was difficult and time-consuming. In the case of the 1986 tax reform, it took years to resolve some serious differences. Trump will face a similar challenge in a much more compressed time period. Announcements are easy to make. Actually enacting tax reform is a lot more difficult. <br> The details of the President's plan have yet to be announced, but a rough outline exists. The outline largely reflects the House Republican tax reform plan. And the answer to two questions will likely determine the success of the overall effort: <br> First, will the Senate (and perhaps even some House Republicans) kill the House's proposal for a border adjustment tax (which produces an estimated $1.4 trillion in new revenue over 10 years, the amount roughly needed for Trump's infrastructure spending and military modernization)? <br> Second, will the Senate accept the House's use of "dynamic scoring" in determining the budget implications of tax reform? Dynamic scoring assumes tax incentives have some effect in creating greater tax revenue. Critics charge that dynamic scoring is "funny math." Proponents use the analogy of a small business. "If you expand your sales budget by $100,000, you wouldn't expect sales revenues to stay the same," they argue. <br> Here's why these questions are relevant: If dynamic scoring is accepted, tax reform will include the immediate expensing for tax purposes of all capital investment, a huge stimulus for business expansion. As one congressional leader told me, "If there is no dynamic scoring, expensing is out," because the static revenue loss (on paper) as a result of the stimulus would not comply with the 10-year budget restrictions previously set by Congress. <br> By the same token, if there is no border adjustment tax, the Trump fiscal stimulus is likely to be significantly smaller than originally envisioned. US tax policy will change, but there may be nothing "phenomenal" about the final result. <br> Making tax policymaking entails a series of trade-offs. If the choice is between a border adjustment tax versus Trump's reckless call for 35% or higher tariffs aimed at US trade competitors, the choice is clear. <br> Tariffs would risk a global trade war and almost certain worldwide recession. The border adjustment alternative would likely be consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization and would not lead necessarily to trade retaliation. The US corporate tax system would not be dissimilar to the value-added tax systems used elsewhere in the world to the disadvantage of American companies. <br> But here's the ultimate question: Is the President's call for tariffs the opening bid in an elaborate effort to strike a deal on a border adjustment tax he wanted all along? <br> In other words, by threatening the world with tariffs, does the border adjustment tax (and its $1.4 trillion in new revenue) become the reasonable and safe alternative? Or is the new President not that clever? When all is said and done, one thing is certain about tax policy: All policy changes produce unintended economic and political consequences. That's why enacting a border adjustment tax is hardly a sure thing. <br> Finally, there is the issue of Trump's promise of individual tax rate reduction. Some of the administration's economic advisers have suggested the personal tax reductions be separated from the corporate tax stimulus, with the personal tax code to be addressed at a later time. <br> Here's the problem: More than 80% of businesses in the United States use so-called "pass-throughs" to pay their taxes -- proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter S organizations that all pay their taxes using the personal income tax schedules. Unless these firms are part of the corporate tax reform plan, small businesses and startups, which are already at a disadvantage relative to large corporations because of the complexity of the tax code, will fall further behind. <br> The upshot is that many Democrats in Congress are open to supporting a plan that reforms the inefficient corporate tax system. Few Democrats will support a plan for individual tax rate reduction. Here's the problem: Can a President who won by promising support for the Rust Belt's "forgotten man" really agree to a plan that delays tax rate cuts for the middle class and pushes fiscal stimulus for the corporate class? 
 The clock is ticking. President Trump has between now and April 29 to make the most of his Hundred Days. <br> Ever since Franklin Roosevelt introduced the term in 1933 as he pushed through Congress one of the boldest domestic agendas that the nation had seen, 75 bills in total, these important weeks in the early history of a presidency have become a lens through which politicians and pundits view the effectiveness of a new leader. <br> The Hundred Day record for presidents is mixed. <br> John F. Kennedy saw a Democratic Congress -- deeply divided between conservative southern Democrats and liberal northern Democrats -- stifle most of his domestic agenda, while the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba undercut the perception that many Americans had of his foreign policy competence. <br> Ronald Reagan didn't get nearly as much done as FDR, as a Republican Senate could not overcome the opposition of a Democratic House, and in March the would-be assassin John Hinckley shot him, but the president was able to get a historic tax reduction moving through Congress and he deregulated oil markets through executive action. <br> Bill Clinton had an even worse experience than Kennedy, despite enjoying a Democratic House until 1994 and even though he had promised overwhelming success. <br> In his Hundred Days, President Obama moved his stimulus bill through Congress and put into motion the financial regulation proposals that would culminate in the Dodd-Frank legislation. <br> The truth is that the Hundred Days is just a construct, a way for presidents to define a specific period of time and to create pressure on allies in Congress to move as fast as possible before their time for legislating closes. It's interesting to note that some presidents who are considered failures, such as Jimmy Carter, actually had a bountiful Hundred Days. <br> The narrative <br> The notion of the Hundred Days offers a way for the news media to create a sense of drama for viewers and readers by fashioning a clear narrative. <br> The entire premise rests on the belief that a president has some "political capital" he can use after an election to push things through Congress, a so-called "honeymoon" period when legislators will bend to his will. As every president discovers, these concepts are overblown and opponents are ready to fight in the first Hundred Days and thereafter. <br> What will President Trump do in his Hundred Days? For all the talk about his unpredictability and maverick style, the outlines of what we are going to see in this period are pretty clear. His inaugural address indicated that, once again, the Trump "pivot" will have to wait. While the details are fuzzy, and the devil is in the details, we can expect to see him work with the Republican Congress on a number of objectives. <br> Deregulate <br> Few issues have animated Donald Trump as much as deregulating the economy, particularly energy markets and financial institutions. It was not much of a surprise that the markets boomed after Trump was elected president. <br> After all, Trump is an ardent supporter of this core idea from the Reagan Revolution: removing government restrictions from economic activity is the best way to go. Trump has made it clear throughout his campaign that he views federal regulations as an inhibition to economic growth. <br> We should expect to see him push aggressively for ending the prohibitions on offshore drilling that have hampered oil exploration. With a Cabinet team picked right out of Wall Street, the administration will also work to either overturn or gut the Dodd-Frank financial regulations that were put into place after the 2008 crash. <br> Deregulation will not only occur through executive action and legislation, but also through the hands of potential Cabinet officials like Rick Perry and Scott Pruitt, if they are confirmed, who have no sympathy for the programs they are now responsible for administering. <br> Repeal <br> Trump has made it clear that he is coming after as much of President Obama's legacy as possible. The first program on the chopping block is the Affordable Care Act, and the congressional Republicans have already gotten started by passing bills that eliminate most of the program. <br> If Trump follows through on his promise to gut the program, it will be difficult for Democrats to stop him. Yes there could be catastrophic fallout and a political backlash as millions lose their benefits, but right now it seems that Republicans are deciding that they will deal with that later. <br> Trump has also promised to go after other programs, such as the "Dreamers" executive action that allowed the children of undocumented immigrants who were born in this country to stay. <br> He might use his executive power to overturn what Obama achieved on issues like the Paris climate agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Iran Nuclear deal. <br> He will also likely go after lesser known executive orders, such as Obama's 2016 action instructing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that significantly broadened the term of who was "engaged in the business" of selling guns so to give the federal government greater regulatory power. <br> Legislate <br> Trump won't only be focused on tearing things down. With a very conservative Republican Congress to work with, he will try to use this window to start creating a legacy of his own. Although we don't know if he will brand his programs with the Trump logo, we do know that there are a number of areas where he will pursue legislation that fulfills some of his campaign goals. <br> We are very likely to see efforts from the White House to make good on his hard-line anti-immigration rules. He might go for broke and push for the construction of a wall -- or else he might work within the boundaries of what's politically easier such as increasing deportations and putting more funding into border control. He is also expected to put forward an infrastructure bill laden with tax incentives for developers to show that he is serious about creating jobs while placing Democrats in a difficult position to oppose him. Another area where he could potentially attract Democrats would be a tax reform package that eliminates incentives for corporations to move overseas. Loophole-closing reform has often been an issue that can draw bipartisan support. <br> Nominate and confirm <br> President Trump has already started with this process. He has pushed hard and fast for his Cabinet picks, staffing the offices with members who if confirmed will push for a very conservative agenda. Some of the nominees might get tripped up, particularly on ethics issues that have emerged in the hearings. <br> The main problem is that Senate Democrats did away with the filibuster for nearly all confirmations in 2013, meaning that Republicans only have to get a simple majority of the Senate to approve nominees. <br> The most difficult battle will be the Supreme Court where the Democrats still do have the filibuster at their disposal. Trump has promised to make a very conservative pick to fill the vacancy that now exists, tipping the balance to the right. We should expect he will do that early on to build his support with the conservative base. The Supreme Court won't be the only selection. He will move to fill as many federal judgeships as he can with conservative justices to build his support with the right and with Senate Democrats now unable to filibuster his appointments. <br> Fight <br> Don't be surprised if Trump exercises presidential power with a show of force against ISIS. Throughout his campaign, the president blasted the Obama administration for being too timid against international security threats. <br> He criticized the administration for refusing to take forceful action when terrorists struck and for not doing enough in Syria to put down the ISIS forces fighting against the Assad regime. All eyes are now on the White House to see whether the president employs military force to respond to these security concerns. <br> He will reverse much of what Obama has accomplished by putting diplomacy and international alliances front and center. We should expect the continuation of provocative statements about countries such as China as well as the use of threats involving trade against countries he sees as hostile. <br> NATO will be tested more than ever with Trump's attacks on the alliance and potential support for Republicans threats to reduce our financial contributions. At the same time we should not be surprised to see an easing of sanctions against the Russians. <br> Of course, it's not possible to completely predict how the Hundred Days will shape up. Unexpected events have a way of reshaping the agenda of an administration, forcing the president to adjust and improve and to move in new directions. 
 To his credit and to the ultimate benefit of the nation, Trump has been far more conciliatory toward his erstwhile opponents than they would have been had Clinton won. And for the most part, they have responded by joining his team. Trump tapped South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for the important role of ambassador to the United Nations, and by all reports, Mitt Romney was high on Trump's list for secretary of state. And Trump has welcomed into his transition longtime campaign staffers and consultants who only a few months ago worked to defeat him. <br> This coming together of the party has been driven by Trump himself. Trump did not transform into a liberal the moment Clinton conceded, as many in the Never Trump camp warned he would. Instead, he has continued to champion the same conservative ideals that won him so much grass-roots support. <br> But before we all gather around the fire and sing "Kumbaya," there's still much work to be done. While Never Trump didn't mean never for many, holdouts remain, particularly in conservative media. Whether at The Wall Street Journal, the National Review, The Washington Post or in the feeds of millions of Twitter followers, their voices matter -- more for what they don't say than what they do. It's not as if the left ever intended to allow Trump a political honeymoon. He was always going to face attacks by Democrats and their allies. What Trump needs now is for smart, principled people to push back. He needs his own echo in the echo chamber. <br> It's true that Trump did just fine without that kind of support during the campaign. But that success was based on the sheer power of his personality. Governing is different than campaigning. If Trump wants to accomplish his goals, he'll need to convince a skittish and often skeptical Congress to go along with him. That job will be much more difficult if he is constantly fending off attacks from his own political base -- or if that same base is silent in the face of the Democratic political machine. <br> The Cabinet fights that are ramping up are simply a preview of things to come. Democrats aren't attacking Sessions because they actually believe he is a racist. If that were true, Booker wouldn't have been cozying up to him only a year ago. Rather, Democrats don't like Sessions because he's conservative. He'll do things such as enforce our laws on immigration and illegal drugs, a dramatic change from Obama's Department of Justice. But the left recognizes that the American people are actually pretty fond of the rule of law: Enter the race card. <br> Never Trump Republicans need not abandon their principles to do their part. There will be debates to come -- on trade, on spending, on national defense. But conservatives are also presented with an opportunity to reform the government, to implement good policies, and, yes, to make America great again. But it will only happen if conservatives are willing to swallow their pride and support a president they don't always like and with whom they haven't always agreed. <br> Because I can promise you this: The Democrats are ready for a fight. 
 If there was one unambiguous bipartisan message from the outcome of the November election, it was this: It's time for business as usual to come to an end. Washington, we heard over and over again, has become too unaccountable to the voters and in the minds of many, corrupted by power. <br> Yet Monday night, behind closed doors, the House Republican Conference made their very first act of the new Congress an explicit rejection of that unmistakable message. <br> If House Republicans want to get back on track, they will need to treat this as a teachable moment on the lessons of transparency in the Age of Trump. <br> The new rules proposed by rank and file Republicans stipulated that the nonpartisan office be subject to oversight by the separate House Committee on Ethics, made up of members of Congress. It could not make public statements or examine anonymous complaints. It could not review any possible violations of criminal law. In other words, there was not a heck of a lot it could do. <br> There is indeed a legitimate case to be made for what the Republicans did. There has been bipartisan grumbling about some of the Star Chamber-like qualities of the office since Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats created it eight years ago. <br> In many cases, the damage was already done, and the members' exonerations weren't usually covered at all by the media. <br> But I've had my own dealings with Office of Congressional Ethics and, without exception, found it to be thoughtful and deliberate. They take complaints and accusations of ethical breaches seriously. Their very strength was their independence. By contrast, too often in the past the House Ethics Committee has been reluctant to investigate its own. <br> That doesn't mean the office doesn't need reforming. Proceedings need to be made more transparent and should provide a better sense of due process to those the office investigates. Democrats seemed to agree with that as much as Republicans. <br> But in an era where bipartisan agreement may be rare amid proposals for replacing Obamacare and passing tax reform, why not try to forge a solution that Democrats could agree with? Why not do so out in the open instead of confirming the worst stereotypes about smoke-filled rooms in Congress? <br> The President-elect rightly called out House Republicans' fecklessness and misplaced priorities over his favorite medium, leading to a near immediate repeal. The House Republican caucus would have faced never-ending ridicule by Democrats, government watchdogs and transparency advocates. <br> Republicans will have no shortage of legislative battles in the coming months that will test their unity and whether there are compromises to be made with the other side. It's a shame that their first test on this front came up so short. 
 To the untrained eye, that sure makes it sounds like the President-elect, with a couple of tweets, forced the House to abandon its plan to put the Independent Office of Congressional Ethics under lawmaker control, a move that split the party and had just about everyone scratching their heads. <br> And so began the pronouncements that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's influence was all but dead. What he can accomplish with a microphone or a gavel, so this hyperventilating went, was no match for what Trump could do with a tweet. <br> But, as is often the case when it comes to covering Trump, there's more to the story. <br> It's an understandable -- and indeed compelling -- way to frame his unprecedented social media prowess. <br> Yet consider the sequence of events in this case. <br> Then, word came that House Republicans scheduled an emergency meeting to pull the measure. <br> "President-elect Donald Trump dramatically strong-armed House Republicans into line Tuesday in his first Washington power play, after they voted to gut an ethics watchdog in a manner that undercut his vow to drain the establishment 'swamp.'" <br> To be fair, it's a safe assumption that upon seeing Trump's tweet many of the amendment's supporters -- who are ironically also Trump supporters -- decided they would not fall on a sword to defend an optically imprudent proposal that the President-elect was not behind. <br> But it's also just as reasonable to believe many of those same House members caved to public pressure as news of the perplexing legislation made its way through the press back to constituents who thought it a troubling first item of business for the new Congress. <br> What is not reasonable, though, is the assertion that Republican leadership somehow caved to Trump. In fact, it's more likely the other way around, even if Trump himself doesn't know it. <br> Ryan, as well as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, voiced their concerns with this measure Monday night in the closed-door meeting, sources in the speaker's office tell me. While most agreed the ethics watchdog panel was problematic -- it allegedly leaked stories to the press and forced lawmakers to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars proving their innocence against anonymous tipsters -- leadership was outspoken that this amendment was the wrong way to go about reform. Alternative paths were proposed, but they were overwhelmingly denied by House members. <br> In reality, Paul Ryan was against this before Trump was. According to my sources, Ryan and Trump only spoke after the vote was resolved. 
 Democratic lawmakers representing liberal parts of America habitually denounce this sort of thing: Spending reductions combined with tax cuts benefiting upper incomes. The question is, "should they?" and the answer is "no." The blue states should take the money and run. <br> Most of the proposed federal tax reforms would leave more wealth in the affluent blue states. They could capture some of it through their own taxes and economic activity unleashed by residents with more money in their pockets. <br> The federal income tax has been called a blue-state tax because the higher incomes tend to cluster in Democratic strongholds. What's especially unfair about this is the federal tax code does not account for cost of living, which is highest in the elite coastal cities. <br> There's no reason why like-minded states can't get together and solve problems, including local challenges and international ones like climate change. For the richer blue states, a reduced federal tax burden would leave them with the added means to address these challenges. And the nicest part: They can spend the money at home. 
 Judging by appointments to top posts in health care, the incoming Trump administration is on course to validate its campaign promise to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act. <br> Despite the emphasis by many on preserving secondary parts of the law like maintaining children up to age 26 on the parent's coverage, Americans should understand that the ACA indeed must be eliminated. Why? Because its misguided amalgam of regulations generated skyrocketing insurance premiums, reduced choice of doctors, funneled millions more poor people into substandard programs and accelerated consolidation throughout the health care industry-- serious consequences directly harmful to patients. <br> The ACA's biggest error was broadening a detrimental misapplication of health insurance that began decades ago. The point of insurance is to reduce risk of financial disaster. Instead, with its long list of mandates and regulations, the ACA furthered the inappropriate construct that insurance should subsidize all medical care and minimize out-of-pocket payments. The ACA's coverage requirements directly caused more widespread adoption of bloated insurance. <br> When combined with invisible health care prices as well as doctor qualifications, most patients have virtually no incentive and lack sufficient information to consider value; similarly, providers don't need to compete on price. The consequences are the overuse of health care and unrestrained costs. <br> HSAs, tax-sheltered accounts for smaller health expenses, are another critical component of reform, because they motivate direct consideration of price. Better than simple tax deductions, HSAs also incentivize saving. These accounts have been over-regulated by current law. Raising maximums and catch-up contributions at least to those of IRA limits, and allowing uses for elderly parents and rollovers to surviving family members are steps to take immediately. <br> Beyond the numbers, the tax exclusion created perverse incentives. It encouraged higher demand for care, regardless of cost, while distorting insurance into covering almost all services, greatly increasing health care costs. Rational tax reform should have three main features: 1) deductibility for everyone, whether insured through employers, or self-employment, to level the playing field; 2) limits on exclusions to the maximum allowable HSA contribution; and 3) limited eligibility for exclusions to incentivize appropriate health spending, i.e., HSA contributions and catastrophic coverage. <br> This approach has important advantages over tax credits, an alternative favored by many conservatives, including U.S. Rep. Tom Price and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Tax credits would create yet another government entitlement, at a time when entitlement reform in the opposite direction is already urgent. Tax credits further complicate a monstrously complex tax code. Tax credits further expand the far-too-dominant IRS's mission from collecting revenues to doling out money to favorite economic activities. <br> Tax credits are actually reminiscent of Obamacare subsidies, given that government officials would necessarily set rules about eligibility, including "appropriateness" of coverage, to receive the credit. While politically appealing as a visible demonstration of a "helping hand", let's realize this -- tax credits represent another example of government literally taking taxpayer money from one person and allocating it to someone else. <br> Moreover, we must know by now that entitlement costs always -- always - expand far beyond projections. Income exclusions, on the other hand, meet a different and important fairness test -- the government overtly admits that some earned income is simply off-limits to the dictates of government and should stay with the worker. 
 Comments from Donald Trump or his transition team tend to spur frenzied efforts to figure out the President-elect's policy intentions. So new rumors over his trade policies are hardly a surprise. <br> That would be a step away from Trump's commitment to spur growth, wages and jobs in the United States. While it's true that some American workers and industries suffer from international competition, the economy as a whole is stronger and more productive when engaged in trade. <br> And the country's future prosperity demands that we reach out to the 95% of the world's consumers who live outside our borders. Raising tariff walls, hiding behind isolationist barriers, is a recipe for Japanese-style stagnation. <br> Here's another blunt reality. A 10% import tariff would be simply a tax that would raise consumer prices for every American family. It would clash directly with Trump's supposed commitment to lower taxes and grow families' budgets. <br> At the same time, according to CNN, the transition team is floating the idea of "a border adjustment tax" on imports -- an idea proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady -- as a way to spur American manufacturing. <br> Because it would exempt US exports from tax, it would allow them to compete on a level tax playing field in their country of destination -- both US goods and Brazilian goods, for example, would pay Brazil's taxes. <br> Similarly, US goods and imports would both pay the US tax. Fair is fair, and the best products win in market competition. <br> Moreover, this isn't a matter of collecting cash in every port. Under Brady's proposal, as each firm prepares its year-end tax return, it would exclude from the tax base all cross-border transactions. Specifically, it would not report overseas sales revenue -- effectively exempting it from the US tax -- or costs of imports into the United States, thereby including the cost of imported intermediates. <br> This has three virtues. First, the tax code is much simpler. A US multinational firm engages in three types of transactions: between its foreign affiliates and others abroad, between the domestic company and its foreign affiliates, and between the domestic company and others in the United States. <br> To compute their tax under the House proposal, firms operating in the United States would need only to report transactions of the last type -- domestic transactions. This limited focus also makes it easier to verify that firms are complying with the tax code. <br> The second virtue? The incentives to "game" the tax system, or hide profits offshore, are eliminated. The tax base is unaffected by the value of exports or the cost of imports, so there is no payoff to manipulating "transfer prices" between domestic and overseas operations so that reported profits are lower in the United States and higher in overseas, lower-tax jurisdictions. <br> Most importantly border adjustment removes incentives for domestic firms to relocate production offshore. Because they will owe taxes on US sales whether production takes place in the United States or elsewhere, and owe no US taxes on non-US sales, they will gain no tax benefit from shifting operations abroad. <br> We can concede global production to our competitors and make it more expensive for US families to purchase those products. Or, in the context of a larger tax reform package, we can remove the incentives that drive production to other countries and increase jobs, wages and US prosperity. Interest from the Trump transition team in moving this effort forward is a good sign. 
 After several decades of policy stalemate in Washington, cynics might conclude that the Trump era will be more of the same. Think again. Significant change is coming if only because the GOP controls both Houses of Congress, along with the White House. <br> True, some analysts argue that serious divisions within the GOP will make it tough to achieve policy consensus. But Republican congressional leaders give three reasons why civil war is unlikely and big change is coming fast. <br> First, the fact that the GOP lost so few House seats in last month's election gives House Speaker Paul Ryan a lot more ideological room to negotiate. Had some of the polls been correct and the GOP lost 20-22 seats, leaving the thinnest of majorities, the Republican House today would indeed be ungovernable. <br> Second, Republicans are terrified that if they don't deliver, the same working-class voters who turned on Hillary Clinton will turn on them. <br> And third, Republicans have a definite fear of Donald Trump himself, whose coattails in last month's election were surprisingly strong. Obstructionists will almost certainly be the subject of ridicule in a Trump tweet. <br> Here's how the next six months could unfold: <br> Tax plans <br> Trump and the GOP House leadership have surprisingly similar tax reform plans. Both include reform of the corporate and individual tax codes. Both plans have identical reductions in individual tax rates (with brackets down to 12, 25, and 33%) and are fairly similar in what they propose for other provisions of the tax code. <br> The tax plan agreed to by both Trump and the Congressional GOP will almost certainly be achieved through the legislative vehicle called reconciliation, which means only 51 votes are needed for passage (the GOP has a 52-48 Senate majority). Translation: Immune to being filibustered, their plan will likely become law very quickly. <br> The greatest difference to be resolved centers on individual taxation at the highest tax bracket. Team Trump, while lowering the top tax rate for upper-income earners, would reduce deductions such that the net effect would be no change in total taxes paid by those at this bracket. Congressional GOP tax plans would bring the top tax rate down but leave enough deductions such that the upper-income taxpayers would receive a tax cut, as measured by total taxes paid. <br> High income vs. middle-class tax cuts <br> How this difference will be resolved, and other details of the tax code (number and size of exemptions and deductions), will be determined depending in part on how Senate Republicans and the Trump administration respond to the House Republicans' decision more than a year ago to use "dynamic scoring" to determine the revenue implications from various tax policy changes. The move to dynamic scoring originated from the House Ways and Means Committee and suggests that tax policy can stimulate the economy, increasing tax revenues somewhat. No, tax rate cuts cannot pay for themselves, but they do generate some economic activity and thereby increase revenues, proponents argue. <br> How GOP differences are resolved on dynamic scoring will determine the number and size of deductions left in the tax code. Depending on how Congress scores the revenue loss, for example, the top corporate tax rate, which is now 39%, could be reduced to as low as 15% or as high as 20%. <br> On the issue of whether the final tax plan, while reducing the top tax rate, has no net tax cut (Trump Plan) or a net tax cut (House GOP Plan), watch for Trump to have the upper hand. The likely outcome is that high-income earners will receive a net tax cut, but not nearly as generous as congressional GOP tax writers propose, meaning a significantly larger net tax cut is in store for the middle class. Both approaches would entail significant revenue losses and the deficit would grow. <br> Future of Obamacare? <br> Candidate Trump vowed to "kill" Obamacare. The GOP could accomplish that goal immediately using the vehicle of reconciliation, which again only requires 51 votes to eliminate the part of the legislation that finances the program. <br> Republicans sense they need to send their core constituency the message that they took action to kill a plan that has allowed health care premiums and deductions to skyrocket. But the politics are tricky. The implementation of any legislative action will likely be delayed, probably until after the 2018 midterm elections. Here's why: Replacing Obamacare with some new health care system cannot be done through reconciliation, which is a special legislative approach limited to financial and budgetary matters. Instead, enacting an entirely new health care plan requires the legislative track called "regular order" which requires 60 votes for passage (by overcoming a certain filibuster) and therefore will need the support of a number of Democratic senators. <br> That sounds like a recipe for legislative stalemate. But there may be a reason a number of Senate Democrats (25 out of 48 are up for re-election in 2018, with 10 coming from so-called "red" states) may be willing to compromise with Trump and the Republicans on a health care reform plan. <br> The GOP will delay implementation of any effort to kill Obamacare precisely because of the anticipation the program will die its own death. So why take the blame for killing it? Both parties would then have no choice but to devise a bipartisan replacement. As one GOP congressional leader told me, "There are some things the Democrats want that we can live with. Compromise is not out of the question. We'll come up with a new plan. We have to." <br> Infrastructure: A trillion-dollar question? <br> Finally, there is the issue of infrastructure spending. It is assumed that on the first day of the Trump administration, $1 trillion in infrastructure spending will be dropped from a helicopter onto the US economy. But such an approach is not practical. Instead, a lot of the upcoming infrastructure spending is likely to be stretched out over several years with decisions made in close coordination with state and local governments. <br> The Republican leadership says it is determined to avoid the Obama administration's experience in 2009 when officials were desperate to find "shovel ready" projects to initiate as stimulus in response to the financial crisis. A lot of less-than-essential projects were funded. "Shovel ready" in too many cases proved to be a euphemism for "needless but ready." <br> But how will Congress finance this new spending? Think big corporations. In 2015, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and then-Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, were engaged in negotiations over the connection of an infrastructure spending plan to a plan for overseas corporate profit repatriation; currently $2.5 trillion in US corporate profits are parked overseas, where tax rates are lower, and could be put to work building the US economy. <br> Senate leader Harry Reid (retiring this year) stepped in and killed any chance of compromise. Watch for the Schumer-Ryan negotiations to begin again. In their negotiations, any infrastructure spending plan should involve US corporations being asked to purchase a specified amount of low interest rate infrastructure bonds as part of any generous overseas profit repatriation exercise designed to bring the $2.5 trillion back home. <br> So, here's my crystal ball on what is about to quickly unfold. With upcoming changes to the tax code and replacement of Obamacare, Congress will take the lead. Change will happen relatively quickly, but Team Trump will have influence in keeping the bulk of the stimulus directed at the middle class. But here's the point: The rough outlines of the proposed reforms have already been debated and are on the shelf, waiting to be quickly enacted. <br> On infrastructure spending, President Trump will likely take the lead. Throughout his first term, the new president will position himself as the hands-on, shirtsleeves-rolled-up "builder." In other words, on domestic policy he will appear to be more like a big city Northeast mayor than a traditional conservative Republican president. Trump will regularly visit infrastructure construction sites, with press in tow. <br> As always, the question is whether the end result avoids a new round of Solyndras, "bridges to nowhere" and other nonsense associated with stimulus and infrastructure spending in the past. <br> The smarter approach would be for the President-elect now to do something that Congress would hate: Establish a distinguished panel of independent experts to decide which projects are funded. This would be similar to the successful military base realignment and closing commission that worked so successfully between 1988 and 2005. But then again, when has Washington ever adopted the smarter approach? <br> Meanwhile, get ready for takeoff. 
 "For of all sad words of tongue and pen, The saddest are these: 'It might have been.'" <br> Four years ago, I watched our country miss a tremendous opportunity to vastly improve our national well-being when we re-elected President Barack Obama and shunned Mitt Romney. <br> To this day, I believe the United States suffered on every measurable level -- economically, societally and internationally -- because of that decision, and I suspect many of my fellow Americans retrospectively agree. <br> Why? Because of what "might have been." <br> Compared to the undeniable chaos of the last four years, a Republican presidency would have delivered a dramatically better reality for our citizens and for the world. <br> Domestically, dozens of serious jobs bills would likely have been signed into law; the Environmental Protection Agency's war on American energy, especially coal, would likely have ended; the Keystone XL pipeline would surely have begun construction; comprehensive tax reform could have lowered rates for everyone and made our tax code fairer; corruption at the IRS would more likely have been properly condemned and punished; the Little Sisters of the Poor would no doubt have been left alone to keep caring for the elderly instead of being forced into court for their survival; and so much more. <br> Abroad, the war on terrorism could have been waged with resolve, not reluctance; the Islamic State would have been taken seriously at its infancy and exterminated without restraint; the Iran nuclear deal would never have happened; Vladimir Putin's resurgent Russia would have been seen as the geopolitical threat it is, and likely would have been deterred before victimizing our ally Ukraine; even the situation in Syria may well have looked more positive than its current state of agony. <br> Yes, these are hopeful hypotheticals. But I don't list them to express useless regret. Instead, they should be seen as affirming that, as much as ever, elections have consequences. <br> The course of the next four years is completely in our control and should not be permitted to resemble the last eight years. The challenges of those years still exist, yet for now, so do many of the opportunities. Time will not stand still if we wait to seize them. <br> It is abundantly clear that a President Hillary Clinton, bound to a ruthlessly left-wing base, will simply not be able to break from the Obama trajectory and thus provide the stronger leadership these tough times demand. Only a unified Republican government, unbeholden to the status quo, is capable of confronting today's reality and securing a more prosperous and hopeful future for all Americans. <br> This, of course, means making Donald Trump our 45th president. <br> To be sure, I've read the big-name newspaper endorsements of Mrs. Clinton. I hear what Hollywood celebrities are saying. And, yes, Mr. Trump's secretly recorded comments remain unacceptable. But I care far more about actions and products than words, and in government the most important product is policy. <br> Donald Trump is not feeble, nor without immense energy. And when it comes to what actually matters -- policy -- he will use his energy to empower those outside of Washington, not in it. Only a Trump presidency can undo the current damage caused by explosive government growth and chart a new direction. <br> As Obamacare keeps imploding and working families keep suffering, Mrs. Clinton will focus her efforts on patching up the law and keeping it on life support; Mr. Trump has pledged to sign repeal legislation to end the disaster and start fresh. <br> And when the unaccountable regulatory state inevitably gets challenged before the Supreme Court, Clinton-appointed justices will ignore the Constitution and let the red tape keep flowing; Trump-appointed justices will do exactly the opposite. <br> When it comes to the most urgently needed policy overhauls, a victory for Donald Trump next month would be a course correction for our entire union. The tragedy would come in 2020 if Americans -- worn down from more division, more anxiety and more stagnation -- have to look back at another four wasted years and think those saddest of words: what might have been. 
 House Republicans have had a tough decade. Many of us elected in 2010, 2012 and 2014 went to Washington to challenge President Obama's big-government, progressive agenda that was sending our country down the wrong track, driving up debt, and imposing growth-choking, Washington-knows-best regulations on our health care, financial services, energy and other industries. <br> Although President Obama and congressional liberals blocked many of our efforts, we have enacted critical opioid, infrastructure, human trafficking and veterans legislation. And while the Obama agenda has not been stopped, it has been slowed. In the past 5½ years, congressional Republicans blocked, among other things: <br> We've also exposed agencies and high-ranking officials who violated fundamental precepts of public service. We've put bills on the President's desk to repeal Obamacare and block implementation of onerous EPA rules. And the Senate has exercised its constitutional prerogative to decline consideration of the Supreme Court nominee of a President who has willfully overstepped his constitutional limits. <br> A platform for the future <br> But our proposals for health care, tax and regulatory reform, strengthening security and generating upward mobility will only become reality if someone in the White House signs our legislation. That is the fulcrum on which we sit. We simply cannot afford another four years of sputtering zero to 2% economic growth. That is the consequence if A Better Way is not enacted into law. Hillary Clinton's status quo, big-government policies will only lead to more debt, doubt and decline. <br> While I appreciate the concerns I hear from some constituents and fellow members about the choices the American people face this November, I encourage everyone to consider something that has been missing in this debate. It actually concerns one of the planks in our Better Way platform, and that has to do with the people with which I serve -- the members of the United States Congress. <br> In A Better Way, we describe how Congress can reclaim its constitutional responsibilities. Those responsibilities go to the heart of the notion of self-rule. Our Founders recognized that in our country, the people are the sovereign. The people exercise that sovereignty through elected representatives, who in turn enact laws to which the people are subject. If the people do not consent to those laws, they can change their representatives. <br> Regulatory superstate <br> When you couple the regulatory leviathan with our broken appropriations process, where Congress gets cornered into take-it-or-leave-it omnibus spending bills that grotesquely limit its spending power, the legislative branch today exercises far less authority than the Constitution grants to it. <br> But now the good news. Our historic Better Way platform puts us on offense. This is fitting, because we, the people's representatives, are the ones who should be setting the nation's policy agenda. It is in Congress where government of, by and for the people happens. <br> Donald Trump is following our lead on other matters as well. For example, his tax plan has evolved to conform more closely to our tax plan in the Better Way. <br> Our three branches of government are supposed to be independent and separate. That means, for example that if a Republican were in the White House, a Republican Congress would still be free to exercise its own, independent constitutional role. And there should be a healthy tension between the branches. <br> I would expect such with a Republican Congress and a Trump administration. Unlike the manner in which congressional Democrats have circled the wagons to defend President Obama's unconstitutional overreach and Clinton's email debacle, Benghazi lies and failed tenure at the State Department, I fully expect to see a Republican Congress hold a President Trump accountable. <br> We have already seen, for example, members of our party disagree with Trump when he expresses opinions that are inconsistent with their own. <br> Holding President Trump accountable <br> Holding a President Trump accountable includes ensuring he keeps the commitments he has made to conservatives, especially regarding nominations to the Supreme Court. Who knows, as we conduct such oversight, it is possible our Democratic colleagues may finally understand that a large part of the past six years of GOP House control has not been about like or dislike of President Obama, but about his failed policies and the protection of institutional, constitutional prerogatives of the United States Congress. <br> And while a Trump administration will be subject to checks and balances from a Republican Congress, I expect a President Trump to exercise the executive branch's checks and balances as well. <br> It would be great to see Trump help Congress find spending discipline by forcing Congress to abandon its bipartisan, spend-by-omnibus tradition. He should veto any of these thousand-page, trillion-dollar bills that reach his desk. <br> None of this happens, however, if Hillary Clinton is President. With Donald Trump, you have someone who has already pledged to sign transformative legislation to restore congressional oversight, has embraced tax reform and health care reform proposals similar to those in A Better Way and pledged to support conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. <br> Should he not follow through on these commitments, Congress will exercise stringent oversight. In other words, a Trump administration offers a rare opportunity for a resurgent legislative branch. <br> Ours is a unique moment in history. It is time for Congress to step up and into the role the Founders envisioned for the branch closest to the people. That makes this coming Election Day a date with destiny we should embrace. 
 There are two key lessons in this. <br> Yet the truth is that Clinton's just-released 2015 return is fully open to being audited. For the next three years, the IRS could challenge Clinton on anything that anyone -- an eager press, an active "right-wing conspiracy" -- might find in those returns. <br> How would Trump's tax plans affect him, personally? Hillary's tax returns showed that she and Bill earned about $10.6 million in 2015, and paid $3.24 million in taxes for an effective tax rate of about 31%. Hillary's tax reform plans would raise her own family's taxes, by hundreds of thousands of dollars. <br> Trump does tout how he is closing the "carried interest" loophole that Wall Street hedge fund managers use to reduce their taxes, but it is not clear that their taxes will in fact go up at all. It is also not clear if any of this is relevant to Trump, personally. <br> Trump and his fellow Republicans like to lambaste Clinton for her alleged "pay-for-play" schemes. Is Donald Trump paying to become president so he can play trickle-down-tax-policy for himself and his family, to make the Trump brand rich again? If that sounds crazy, then Don't-Disclose-Donald can prove it is indeed crazy by one simple step -- releasing his returns. 
 Donald Trump's travesty of a presidential campaign is forcing Republicans to ask themselves some hard questions: Does party loyalty outweigh the risks of putting a self-infatuated political ignoramus in the White House? Do they hate Hillary Clinton more than they love their country? <br> No doubt Democrats are enjoying the GOP's agonizing moment of truth, but their party also faces a big strategic choice. Will Democrats wage the fall campaign as pro-growth progressives or as angry populists? <br> Trump's reckless caricature of the U.S. economy as a "disaster" gives Democrats a huge opening. They can offer anxious voters a hopeful counterpoint to Trump's fearful narrative -- a positive plan for parlaying our country's strengths in technological innovation and entrepreneurship into stronger economic growth that works for all Americans. <br> An opportunity for Democrats <br> Like all of Trump's forays into policy, the speech was widely panned, including by conservative economists. It showed how little Trump appreciates the key role innovation plays in driving growth in today's knowledge economy, and how nostalgic he is for the factory economy of the 1970s. <br> Consider this: the digital sector -- broadband, mobile devices, social networks, online content providers -- is responsible for 45 percent of private sector growth since 2007 and virtually all the productivity gains, according to PPI research, and virtually all the productivity gains. Yet it didn't rate a mention in Trump's speech. As if stuck in an Archie Bunker time warp, he promised to bring home jobs from China and Mexico and restore America's old dominance in steel and autos. Soon we'll all be driving U.S.-made muscle cars again -- believe me! <br> Trump's retro vision of what makes America great -- namely, low-tech, middling skilled, labor-intensive manufacturing jobs that are highly vulnerable to automation -- is a major political liability. Yes, it taps into the gnawing sense of economic and cultural dispossession felt by many blue-collar workers. <br> But it doesn't speak to the aspirations of middle-class voters who now mostly work in offices, use digital technology to boost their productivity, and understand that their jobs depend both on keeping their skills up to date and on their companies' ability to succeed in global competition. <br> What Trump offers is mainly a fantasy of retribution against the "elites" who have supposedly wrecked the U.S. economy. In picking him as their standard bearer, Republicans have abandoned any pretense of being the party of economic competence and growth in this election. <br> This presents Democrats with a striking opportunity -- if they can resolve their own identity crisis. Are they a party of economic innovation and progress, or a party of economic reaction -- a left-wing version of Trump? <br> What not to do <br> Although Clinton staved off a surprisingly strong challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders, she felt constrained enough to make significant concessions to her party's increasingly assertive populist wing. The big question now is whether this distinct social democratic tilt will prevent Democrats from taking full advantage of the GOP's blunder in making Trump their standard bearer. <br> The conventional view among party elites, echoed by political reporters, is that Clinton must keep railing against the "rigged game," free trade, Wall Street and other populist bogeymen, for two reasons. One is to prevent Trump from making deeper inroads among white, working-class voters in Midwestern swing states like Ohio and Wisconsin. The other is to keep Sanders' voters -- especially his young white supporters -- in the fold. <br> Such calculations, however, look back at primary and caucus voters rather than the national electorate candidates will face this fall. Trump's nativism and bigotry make him anathema to millennials, whose mantra is diversity and equality. True, there are still a hard core of "Bernie Bros" who despise Clinton as a corporate sell-out and warmonger. Some of them may opt for third-party candidates or stay home, but young voters' antipathy to Trump will be a strong motivator to turn out in the fall, however tepid their enthusiasm for Clinton. <br> Nor does it make much sense for Democrats to compete with Trump in pushing blue-collar America's hot buttons. In the first place, non-college-educated whites have been voting predominantly Republican for a generation, more on cultural than economic grounds. And nobody is going to "out-populist" Trump on trade, immigration, "law and order," hostility to Muslims, or the alleged incompetence and corruption of the nation's political class. <br> Targeting aspirational voters <br> Instead, Democrats should recalibrate their primary message to appeal to aspirational voters across the middle of the political spectrum -- independents, college-educated suburban moderates and a substantial slice of Republicans who can't abide Trump. <br> A savvy economic platform <br> To build a broad majority that can deliver victory up and down the ballot, Democrats should offer voters a progressive alternative to populism that puts economic innovation and growth front and center. They need a plan to attack today's popular discontents at their root -- by breaking our economy out of a slow-growth trap that's been holding down wages. <br> These include major public and private investments in modern infrastructure; a strong push for advanced materials and 3D printing to keep America in the vanguard of advanced manufacturing; a strategy for digitizing the physical economy and accelerating the "Internet of Things"; pro-growth tax reform (including bringing business taxes down to globally competitive levels); a systematic lowering of regulatory barriers to innovation and startups; and, a robust system of career and technical education to equip workers without college degrees with skills and credentials valued by employers. <br> Trump's economic illiteracy gives Democrats a chance to own economic growth and opportunity. They'd be fools not to seize it. 
 The economic plan that Donald Trump presented on Monday in Detroit, while light on details, provides a good glimpse into what the nation can expect from a Trump presidency. Though the plan had a few noteworthy ideas, it misfired on issues ranging from tax reduction and reform to regulatory reform and trade policy. <br> The plan promises across-the-board tax reduction, aimed mainly at middle-class Americans. Reductions in marginal tax rates can spur economic activity, but unless the tax cuts improve the incentives to work and save, they are at best mildly beneficial in the short run and detrimental in the long run. <br> In particular, Trump proposes allowing parents to deduct the average cost of child care from their annual taxes. This incentivizes more children and spending -- the opposite of good reform. Policy distorts incentives when it takes a stand on the number of children or the kind of spending; it should remain neutral about these decisions. <br> Trump also called for tax simplification, such as reducing the number of existing tax brackets. This is fine as far as it goes, but in an era of HR Block and TurboTax, it's a trivial simplification. True improvement means elimination of the code's myriad exemptions, deductions, credits and other features that favor particular types of income or activity. Trump's plan so far provides no such examples. <br> At the same time, Trump promises a lower tax rate on business income and full expensing of investment. This is all for the better. Lower taxation encourages businesses to locate domestically, and full expensing allows a simpler corporate tax code. The lower rate does mean a higher deficit, but by a modest amount, given the additional business activity that will occur in the United States. <br> Concern that lower business taxation helps the rich is misplaced. By keeping jobs in the country, a lower rate mainly benefits the working class because they are less likely to see their jobs shipped overseas. <br> On regulatory reform, Trump's proposals are headed in the right direction but unlikely to have much impact. A moratorium on new regulations will simply generate a bump in regulations once the moratorium ends. A directive to regulatory agencies to identify misguided regulations will mainly generate feel good suggestions that never materialize. Trump's claims about regulatory overkill are also likely exaggerated. <br> Regardless, Trump would have to target specific agencies and regulations if he wants to make a real difference. <br> And Trump's proposals on trade are particularly dangerous because some sound "reasonable" at first glance. He suggests, for example, that we impose tariffs on countries that "cheat" by subsidizing exports. Yet every country cheats in this way, including the United States. So this "sensible" departure from free trade is an excuse to impose tariffs widely, often at the urging of crony capitalists who stand to benefit. <br> Taken as a whole, Trump's economic plan is disastrous. Large tax cuts without even larger spending reductions mean explosive deficits and debt. Massive interference with free trade means a far less productive economy. The few sensible elements -- tax reform and regulatory reform -- cannot plausibly undo the damage of the other proposals. 
 The Framers of our Constitution meant Congress to be a great deliberative body. It has become an embarrassment. Congress doesn't deliberate to resolve important national issues. Congress fundraises, and postures to fundraise, to support the next fight for control. <br> The transformation to this "Fundraising Congress" began in 1993. Newt Gingrich was its leader. After claiming Republican control of both houses of Congress in 1995 -- for the first time in 40 years -- Gingrich launched his new army of reformers on a project to secure permanent control of that institution, and of government. <br> Fundraising was the key to that strategy of control. The Republicans came to power raising a then unheard of amount of money: $618.42 million in the election cycle ending in 1994, compared to the Democrats' $488.68 million. <br> In the four years between 1994 and 1998, Republican candidates and party committees would raise over $1 billion. Never before had a party come anywhere close to raising that amount of money, because never before had any party's leaders so effectively focused the energy of their members on this single task: fundraising. <br> Gingrich concentrated the "work" of Congress into a three-day "work" week. He sent his caucus home for the rest of the week, in part so they had time to launch cross-country fundraising missions. <br> Members of Congress now spend between 30% to 70% of their time raising money to get re-elected to Congress or to get their party back into power. And not just the Republicans: The Democrats quickly followed the lessons of Professor Gingrich. And in the 20 years since he came to power, practically everything about that great institution has changed. <br> Gone is any semblance of deliberation, or the idea that there is a business of the nation to be done, as opposed to the business of the party in power. Instead, the institution that Gingrich inherited -- the one in which Democrats worked with Republicans to pass the most important tax reform in modern history (Reagan's), and in which Republicans led Democrats to break a filibuster in the Senate and pass the most important social legislation in a century (The Civil Rights Act of 1964) -- was gone. What replaced it is the completely dysfunctional institution that practically no American has confidence in today. <br> "Republicans took over ... determined to cut the government down to size. [But] their ambitions were soon compromised. ... Gingrich initially supported ... efforts to impose discipline on spending. ... But in the face of perceived political necessity, the leadership wavered. Cutting spending was good, but Gingrich, (Dick) Armey, (Tom) DeLay, and others quickly realized that 'we have another aspect to our existence here, which is that we must use the Appropriations Committee as a resource to protect our vulnerables, because once we got into power, we wanted to stay in power.'" <br> The job of Congress was no longer the work of the nation. The job of Congress was to help its majority "to stay in power." <br> This is the legacy of Speaker Gingrich. It is a legacy that has done the nation great harm. 
 With increasing awareness in the electorate about the implications of global warming, these shifts may open up political space after the elections in November and pave the way for a new, bipartisan U.S. climate and energy policy framework. <br> Such a framework should provide a predictable, level playing field that factors in the social and environmental costs resulting from carbon emissions. It should put a heavy emphasis on research and development of cutting-edge energy technologies that will enable the full decarbonization of the energy sector. <br> It would propel energy efficiency investments and enhance the competitiveness of carbon capture and storage techniques that could provide a long-term future for gas. A carbon fee would also go a long way toward helping revive the commercial prospects of zero-carbon nuclear power. <br> Finally, but most importantly, carbon revenues could also boost research and development spending on breakthrough energy technologies needed to make full decarbonization by mid-century easier, in line with the goals of the U.S.-led Mission Innovation project announced in Paris. <br> Without bolder public policies in place, the United States risks losing out on the energy revolution -- one of the most consequential transformations of this century. It is time to start constructing a new U.S. energy edifice. 
 In the GOP presidential debate, Marco Rubio responded to a question about work, wages and college tuition by attacking philosophy majors. He said: <br> "Here's the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. For the life of me, I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers." <br> But this isn't just about how awesome a philosophy major is. The data on wages and education reveal two things. First, college degrees are a good investment, though we've got to address the high cost of tuition and the student debt crisis. Second, welders, and all skilled blue-collar workers, need a raise. <br> Philosophy is not unique in propelling its majors to financial success. Like my own degree in history, philosophy gives students a key set of analytical and expressive skills that are mandatory for nearly every high-paying career. College graduates do better in the job market not only because some acquire useful skills, but also because employers want employees with the ability to think critically and to adapt to the jobs of tomorrow. <br> There are, of course, many complexities to these numbers, such as whether low-achieving high school students should invest in college and take on debt, but the overall pattern is clear. These numbers are why we must continue to fight to make college affordable, accessible and high quality for everyone. That means no shortcuts like cheap online programs, over-reliance on temporary adjunct professors, and unethical for-profit colleges. <br> But the crux of these discussions isn't just about the earning potential of liberal arts majors. <br> Welders, and all people who work in blue-collar industries, are too often underpaid. It's easy for white-collar pundits and former political science majors (a heavily philosophical discipline) like Marco Rubio to forget. I'm reminded of Joe the Plumber from the 2008 campaign, a man who was famously neither named Joe nor working as a plumber. He told then-candidate Barack Obama that as a plumber he soon expected to earn over $250,000 a year, therefore Obama's tax plan would hurt him, and by extension good American small business owners everywhere. <br> The best way to help the large swath of American middle class -- both white-collar workers and blue-collar workers -- is to focus on a new labor movement and revitalize unions. <br> I believe in an America where those who want to study philosophy can do it with the knowledge that they will be prepared to compete for good jobs as they move forward. I believe in an America where people interested in trades can, likewise, find good work that pays living wages. <br> It's time for a new labor movement that unites college students with underpaid skilled labor. Blue-collar and white-collar, college-educated and skilled labor, should stand united, shoulder-to-shoulder. We're all in this together. 
 Throughout history, there have been many unlikely pairs in politics. President Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Tip O'Neill had a meeting of the minds on tax reform; Sens. George McGovern and Bob Dole worked together on food stamps; and Sens. Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy drafted the original proposal for a Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. <br> While today's political discourse often seems hopelessly steeped in gridlock, sometimes an idea comes along that's so obvious, so important and so worthwhile that it transcends political divides and brings elected leaders together. <br> As governors -- one Republican, one Democrat -- there are some issues we don't see eye to eye on. But one thing we can wholeheartedly agree on is that when it comes to our students' education, great teachers matter. <br> Research shows that teacher quality is the most important in-school factor affecting a student's academic achievement, and students who are struggling academically or who come from low-income backgrounds benefit the most from excellent teaching. <br> Having access to high-quality teaching has significant economic benefits for students. Just moving from a classroom with a low-performing teacher to one whose performance is average for the academic year can mean an additional $50,000 in lifetime earnings per student, or $1.4 million per classroom. <br> Learning from other nations <br> Clearly, giving more students the opportunity to learn from excellent teachers should be a top priority for policymakers, as it has the potential to spur dramatic improvements in student outcomes. We know that this is true because other nations that perform highly on international assessments -- like Finland, Korea, and Japan -- and those that have seen dramatic improvements -- like Canada and Poland -- have made improving the systems that educate, train and develop teachers a high priority. <br> As governors, we've taken different approaches to improve the teacher pipeline in our states, reflecting our unique state circumstances. <br> Iowa is establishing the most extensive teacher leadership system in the nation, with two main goals: The first is better utilizing the expertise of many of our top teachers to improve instruction and raise student achievement. The second is attracting and retaining more outstanding teachers with new career pathways. That includes rewarding top teachers with higher pay for taking on leadership roles, such as instructional coaches who help analyze data, fine-tune instructional strategies and co-teach. <br> Working in greater collaboration with colleagues, teacher leaders provide embedded professional development in the classroom directly related to what students are learning. When Iowa's new Teacher Leadership and Compensation System is fully phased in next school year, it will cost $150 million annually, with about 25% of Iowa teachers in leadership roles statewide. This investment is important because giving students a globally competitive education today requires making the most of principal and teacher leadership. <br> Raising expectations <br> Meanwhile, Delaware has raised expectations for our college and university teacher preparation programs. That included higher criteria for student admissions, higher-quality student teaching experiences, a requirement that graduates pass a performance assessment, in addition to the traditional written exam, and a process to hold the state and individual programs accountable by tracking graduates. <br> Delaware has also upgraded in-school supports, including with professional learning communities that provide teachers up to 90 minutes a week to spend with a small group of peers dissecting data on which lessons and teaching techniques are having the greatest impact. And the state is working to transform Delaware's educator compensation system to raise starting salaries, as well as to pay teachers more for taking on more responsibilities and working in high-need schools. The traditional system of paying only for years of experience and college degrees does not fully respect our teachers' work. <br> Because we know how important this work is, we were thrilled to speak Tuesday at the launch of the Teach Strong campaign, a diverse group of 40 coalition partners working together to change the national education policy conversation and make modernizing and elevating the teaching profession the most pressing and significant education policy priority for our nation. <br> By putting forth a shared vision for improving our public schools, the campaign is working to depolarize the education policy landscape and lay the groundwork for the fundamental changes that are needed to dramatically improve student achievement. <br> Modernizing and elevating the teaching profession is the right thing to do for students and for teachers. As governors, we are working hard to achieve these goals, but more must be done. Improving the teacher pipeline needs to be a national imperative, starting today. 
 Two things in life are inevitable: death and taxes. But not for big corporations. <br> Although they are "legal persons" and can fund politicians of their choice without limit, they don't have to be limited by time and, thanks to our outdated system of taxing global profits, they can easily shirk paying taxes. <br> While multinational companies can get away with paying little or no taxes, average workers have no choice in the matter because their income taxes are paid even before they receive their paycheck. And while big businesses can exploit tax loopholes and shift profits to offshore subsidiaries by employing sophisticated tax planners, small and medium-size businesses have little choice but to pay the full rate. <br> This week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, unveiled its package of reforms to the global tax system. This joint G20/OECD exercise is known as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, or BEPS. The BEPS Project is commendable: it is important to own up to the mammoth problem of tax avoidance and the outdated tax system its member countries have created. Just five years ago, a reform like BEPS would have been unthinkable. But after the financial shocks and revelations of widespread tax abuse by global companies, the G20 called on the OECD in 2013 to propose reforms to the global tax system. <br> Locating the problem <br> Getting the issue on the table and admitting the problem is a start. And the BEPS Project has made remarkable progress in addressing the problems. However, this is just the beginning, and one should not view it as a successful fix of the broken system of taxing global corporate profits. Although several of the reforms inch toward the project's goal of taxing profits "where economic activities take place and where value is created," there is much more work to be done and many more countries to be included in the conversation. <br> The proposed requirement under BEPS of country-by-country reporting to tax administrations of revenues, profits and taxes paid is an impressive step forward for transparency. However, the home countries of multinational companies will need to require their multinationals to file these reports. Moreover, country-by-country reporting will only be required for entities with revenues above $845 million and even then, these reports will not be made public. <br> Another important set of reforms attempts to prevent avoidance of tax by contracting out important business functions, such as sales and distribution activities, to separate companies. If a company does business in a jurisdiction, it has tax nexus — and thus, its profits are taxable by that jurisdiction. However, as long as corporations are able to create infinite numbers of subsidiary companies, business operations can be artificially segmented to get around nexus rules. <br> Moreover, the strong lobby of the technology firms blocked inclusion of digital activities in the list of business operations that create tax nexus. New York state has a very simple and effective approach: tax related companies within the United States as single firms and companies that generate revenues over $1 million from New York are taxable — regardless of the type of business activity. <br> Overall, the biggest deficit of the BEPS Project is its inability to address the core problem of the global tax framework: the transfer pricing system. This system provides wide latitude for companies to move profits around the world toward low tax jurisdictions, using mythical prices. And the problems have only been amplified with the growth of intellectual and other forms of "soft" capital. Using the transfer pricing system for the allocation of profits originating in the different U.S. states would be absurd. But as globalization proceeds, doing so within the different states of the world is equally absurd. Yet the OECD attempts to reduce tax avoidance and make improvements in a flawed system studiously avoid addressing these fundamental issues. <br> Searching for solutions <br> Tax avoidance, whether by corporations or individuals, reveals the dark underbelly of globalization. While well managed globalization can increase global efficiency, it can also facilitate illicit activities, including tax avoidance, and these can distort efficiency and increase inequities around the world. We have come to realize that we need global solutions to these global problems, which can only be obtained with appropriate global governance. <br> At the United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the developing countries and emerging markets expressed distrust, almost anger, at the United States and other advanced countries. Over the years, they have been told to open up their markets to multinationals with the promise that these firms would contribute to their growth, but the result was that these firms manipulated the books so as to avoid the most important corporate responsibility of all — paying their fair share of taxes. <br> Could the governments representing these multinationals be trusted to devise a fair global tax regime or will they use their power to devise a regime that advantages their own companies and taxpayers? The international community has already created a body — the United Nations — to address global issues of common concern, and certainly tax avoidance falls under this remit. That is why we believe that all countries should have a voice in creating global rules and that this conversation should take place within the United Nations. <br> As the BEPS Project outcomes are presented to the G20 finance ministers this week, reflection on the sufficiency of its outputs as well as global tax reform beyond BEPS is critical. Our world has been changed by globalization. It's time for smarter rules based on global negotiation, made in the interest of all. The BEPS Project should be viewed as a beginning, but just that. We need to go beyond it. 
 Now, we have further proof that Trump is becoming more and more like the professional politicians he so often lambasts. Trump's campaign released a document setting forth "the goals of Donald Trump's tax plan," cheerfully titled, "Tax Reform that Will Make America Great Again." <br> Spoiler alert 1: There are no great surprises here. <br> Spoiler alert 2: Don't worry about that whole "the rich should pay more taxes" thing. <br> Trump's plan centers around "simplifying" the tax law (I am still searching for a candidate running on a "more complexity" platform). He would get many taxpayers off the tax rolls altogether by raising the standard deduction, a play out of Ronald Reagan's playbook. Rates would come down to a top rate of 25% (now 39.6%) on individuals. Trump would repeal the alternative minimum tax (AMT), an annual headache for tens of millions of taxpayers (mainly high wage earners in high tax states like California, Illinois and New York), along with the "death tax," a tax easy enough to oppose. On the business side, Trump would again lower rates (from 39 to 15%), to stir business and create a "huge number" of jobs. <br> How to pay for all this in a time of mounting deficits? No worries: The plan is "fiscally responsible" and "revenue neutral" because it will eliminate "deductions and loopholes available to the very rich," but not, of course, including the mortgage interest or charitable contribution deductions. <br> What's left to eliminate? Trump doesn't say, but it's a good bet that it includes the deduction for state and local taxes, which the AMT is now taxing anyway. Trump also claims he will bring in hordes of revenue by a "one-timed deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas." It is hard to know exactly what that even means -- Trump is still leaving the details to offstage devils whom we may never meet -- but, apparently, this "one time" tax on cash accounts will magically balance the books. <br> All of these ideas have floated around various desktops inside the Beltway for some time now. This is cut-and-paste tax policy. Like his fellow Republicans, Trump is almost certainly playing fast and loose with the math of the matter -- a whiff of voodoo is in the air. We cannot count on lower rates and more revenue as a handy combination of phrases to avoid actual thinking and making hard decisions about tax and spending systems. <br> There is however one thing we can keep counting on -- the rich are not going to see their taxes raised by one Donald Trump. It's still morning in America for the wealthy. 
 People running for president might be expected to focus on issues like the economy, national security and foreign policy. Sure, religion has to come up sometime, and candidates on both the left and right have discussed faith, but in America, well, we try to leave religion out of government. <br> But not Mike Huckabee. He sounds more like he's running for Pope than President of the United States. It seems like faith is all he wants to talk about. <br> He went on: "I'm less concerned about what faith the person has. I'm more concerned about the authenticity of their faith." This is a jaw-dropping -- and disturbing -- statement. The "authenticity" of a person's faith? <br> Juxtapose this against the apparent belief of Huckabee, who would like to be our president. According to him, your faith is no longer between you and God; it is now between you and Mike Huckabee. Huckabee appears to the judger in chief. <br> Huckabee, however, has done more than just call for religious liberty in this campaign, he has actually questioned our entire system of government. <br> Huckabee has even injected religion, instead of sensible policies that could save American lives, into the aftermath of tragedy. <br> I'll reiterate: He wants to be president. <br> If only he were alone among the GOP presidential candidates in putting religion front and center, but he's not. <br> But it will be impossible to judge his competence as a potential commander in chief if he continues to define himself pastor in chief. 
 Donald Trump has managed to open up a serious debate within Republican politics. His call to eliminate a tax break that protects the wealth of hedge fund managers has stimulated a backlash among conservatives. <br> The conservative Club for Growth has predictably blasted the idea. This reform, it says, constitutes the kind of tax increase that should be anathema to the party of President Ronald Reagan. Raising taxes is unjust, club members say, and stifles economic growth. <br> Liberals who are becoming too giddy about this proposal should calm down. Both Bush's and Trump's plan would slash corporate and individual rates, making the tax system more regressive by lowering taxes on the wealthy. This is just one loophole-closing reform within a broader agenda of slashing the progressivity of the income tax system. <br> Bush's proposal, according to Jared Bernstein, a former adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, is a "revenue-eating wolf in sheep's clothing." <br> Still, the debate that is taking place is very real for Republicans. The party has gone to great lengths since the 1970s to take tax increases off the table after many decades when a sizable part of the party understood that fiscal austerity required a combination of revenue hikes and spending cuts. <br> The tenor of Republican politics changed significantly with the rise of the conservative movement. An anti-tax movement in California helped inscribe these principles into property taxes. <br> He and others in his administration promoted a "starve the beast" strategy whereby Republicans would cut off the revenue sources of the federal government so that it would be harder to launch new programs. <br> Reagan's historic across-the-board tax cuts in 1981 were praised as a major victory against liberalism. Grover Norquist, an influential conservative activist who founded Americans for Tax Reform (which promotes the no-tax pledge), pressured Republicans into agreeing they would not support tax increases. <br> The positions of conservatives have moved even further to the right than when Bush was in office. Today, this is evident as the Club for Growth is attacking a proposed cut in loopholes, something that Republicans had accepted. Even this is much too much for them. <br> If Trump and Bush are able to shift the conversation back at least to where it was in the 1980s, it would be important step for the party -- even if it is a baby step. <br> The adherence to no tax increases under any circumstances has damaged the ability of the GOP to legitimately claim the mantle of fiscal conservatism, and this stance has been a huge obstacle in budget negotiations with Democrats. <br> The fact that two mainstream candidates are willing to start taking on this orthodoxy could put the Norquist crew on the defensive and help the GOP strengthen some of its public image. More important, it might start to create conditions that would make it possible to normalize the budget process. <br> While there are some issues where conservatives are willing to give and take, taxation has not been one of them. Without any kind of change within the GOP, the prospects of a sounder budget process and path toward fiscal balance will remain elusive. 
 Thursday's announcement by the Federal Reserve Board that it would maintain short-term interest rates came after many weeks of intense anticipation and hyperbolic prognostication by financial pundits across the globe. One pundit went as far as to declare that the Fed's decision would determine next year's presidential election. <br> No doubt, decisions by the Federal Reserve have significant implications for our economy. But the reality is that the power of monetary policy to grow our economy is vastly overestimated. Instead, history tells us that public policy choices have a far greater impact on growing the American economy. And right now, sound public policy decisions are something that are desperately needed -- for America's workers and job creators alike. <br> This is especially true in light of Thursday's tacit acknowledgment by the Fed of the long season of tepid economic growth we have unfortunately grown accustomed to. <br> Because of these disturbing trends among workers and job creators, Congress should enact sound public policy to jump-start our economy. <br> First, Congress must end deficit spending. Reckless spending in the past has resulted in perpetual deficit spending in the present. Excessive borrowing and spending threatens economic stability, jeopardizes American power abroad and passes along a mountain of debt to our children and grandchildren. Returning our country to sound fiscal footing will take more than governing via crisis. No more fiscal cliffs, no more deficit spending. <br> Second, Congress should pass comprehensive tax reform and new trade agreements. Against the headwinds of the slowest recovery since 1960, small business owners are dealing with a tax system that is hopelessly complex, full of provisions that expire every one or two years, riddled with special exemptions, deductions and preferences and filled with new penalties. It is long past time to simplify this byzantine code. <br> Equally as important to economic growth is trade, which has a clear impact on jobs. Earlier this year, Congress acted to give the President Trade Promotion Authority to negotiate trade agreements with other nations under strict parameters. Congress must now call on the administration to finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership, submit the agreement for approval in the Senate and engage with other trading partners on additional trade agreements that will create new markets for American businesses. <br> Government bureaucrats have implemented barriers to entry on professions from florists to interior designers, personal trainers to retailers of frozen desserts. Obamacare's myriad of taxes and mandates continue to represent a significant threat to employers and employees alike. For our economy to thrive once again, we must remove these barriers to job creation. <br> Collectively, these actions can help unlock our economy's potential and create opportunity for all Americans. Imagine what could be accomplished if the same amount of attention and energy given to announcements by the Fed was directed toward putting this pro-growth economic agenda into action. 
 In the topsy-turvy world of tax politics, here's the latest twist: Donald Trump is making some good points about taxes. <br> Now the devil is as always in the details. Trump has a long ways to go in providing that -- and what details do seem lurking beneath the surface hardly seem promising. But let's not nitpick just yet. Trump ought to be applauded for throwing out some ideas -- any ideas -- about fundamentally fixing America's flawed tax system. None of the many other Republican candidates seeking the presidency has done anything truly resembling that. <br> And that is surely the first and most important point to make here. The mainstream political system -- Congress, the president, committees, lobbyists and all that jazz -- have become a large part of the problem of tax. Looking to these usual suspects to be part of the solution seems hopelessly naive. Traditional politicians offer tepid manipulations of the status quo in tax. It takes someone coming from and thinking "outside the box" to light the kindle of rage against tax as is. <br> We have seen this script before. Remember Ronald Reagan? When Reagan took office in 1981, the top marginal tax rate on income was 70%, as it had been since JFK cut it to that level in 1963. Five years later, in 1986, Reagan had the rate down to 28%. It hasn't exactly stayed there, but the point is that Reagan -- an unconventional politician -- was able to go over the heads of traditional decision makers and make his case directly to the people. That's being a Great Communicator. The income tax hasn't really changed since. <br> Maybe, just maybe, Trump, some 30 years later, can give us more of the same -- significant tax reform by taking his case to the people and forcing traditional law and policymakers to get on board. <br> Let's get to those ideas. Each, individually, makes some sense and, collectively, could form a powerful vision of a 21st century tax plan for America. <br> One, lowering America's corporate tax rate makes a good deal of sense and would be supported by most mainstream economists. The trouble today is that the U.S. corporate rate is now among the highest in the world, so companies explore various gaps in the tax base to avoid taxes. <br> One of these avenues is to move overseas, for there are plenty of jurisdictions with far lower rates, even ones at zero. No reform is going to bring trillions of dollars home, just like that -- those devilish details, again -- but sensible corporate tax reform entailing a lower nominal rate structure is clearly sensible. <br> So too, with idea two, eliminating "death" taxes. <br> These taxes raise little revenue, apply to far less than 1% of the population and can be avoided by byzantine tax planning that benefits no one except the financiers who manage the resulting trusts and foundations. Getting rid of these relics altogether makes good sense. <br> Which brings us to idea three: making the wealthy pay more. <br> Here, Trump's one detail is silly and grandstanding: He is picking on hedge fund managers, who have found a trick, in "carried interest," to defer taxes and pay capital gains rates. These are two benefits not available to working folks, who must pay their taxes now and at ordinary rates. <br> It is fair enough to think that this is a problem. There have been proposals to shut down this "loophole" in Congress for over a decade now. But the problem of under-taxing the rich hardly maps onto the problems of taxing hedge fund managers, who are but a small drop in the rich person bucket. Trump, for example, has ample billions without ever having to have become a hedge fund manager. <br> The good news is that there are very serious ways to tax the rich -- like a progressive spending tax, as I and others have been advocating for many years. Such a tax would not burden work or savings (or dying, giving, or getting married, for those matters), but instead would fall on the private act of spending, at higher rates the more luxurious the spending level. <br> It would work like an income tax, but with an unlimited deduction for savings -- any income that is not saved is, by definition, spent. Progressive rates would apply to the spending level. So, any one wealthy enough to spend more than a million dollars a year, say, would see his tax rate go to 50% or higher. <br> A progressive spending tax, by the way, would be consistent with each of Trump's three primary ideas -- lowering (or repealing) corporate tax rates, repealing death taxes (because dead men don't spend -- the heirs can be taxed when they do), and, of course, getting the wealthy to pay more. <br> Trump has a long way to go from his tax-policy-by-sentence fragments to anything like a real, practicable plan. But he has set forth some rather plausible ideas, and certainly some principles worth attending to. If this is all we get, and some more conventional politicians are stirred into some serious thought about tax reform, so be it. <br> When conventional thinking is part of the problem, we should be thankful for the unconventional voices still talking. So keep going at it, Mr. Trump. 
 It looks like the Republicans in Congress have failed again. House Republicans defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration. <br> McConnell proposed that there would be a separate vote on the immigration issue. When Speaker John Boehner proposed an even narrower compromise, funding the Department for only three more weeks, his caucus said no. The final bill provides funding for one more week, at which point Congress needs to take up the issue again. <br> Yet from a different perspective, congressional Republicans are achieving their goal. Once again they are using up a valuable chunk of President Obama's political time. Congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions, such as economic inequality or climate change, which the White House hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the Republicans refused to do anything about these problems. <br> While the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim, President Obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues, like tax reform, where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough. <br> Using up the legislative clock has been central to the Republican strategy since the 2010 midterm elections, a tactic that the Democrats have found difficult to fight back against. <br> The strategy has been pretty straightforward. Each time that President Obama tried to introduce a new issue to the nation, whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality, Republicans have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy. <br> This is what Republicans did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if Democrats did not accede to their budget demands. Congress spent many months wrangling over the budget as they faced the real possibility of the federal government going into default. This was all that anyone in Washington was talking about. The GOP did the same with the threat of a government shutdown. <br> Even though the possibility of repealing the Affordable Care Act is remote, Republicans keep bringing it up for a debate, forcing Democrats to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing. <br> The "tea party" faction of the House Republicans has been pivotal to this strategy as was clear this week. Since they have shown repeatedly that they are willing to employ the most extreme measures to defend their principles, and that they won't allow Boehner to rein them in for "practical" political considerations, Democrats can't afford to take the threats lightly. <br> Republican leaders can and have said to the White House they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems, but with a nod to the Republican caucus, remind Obama that they don't have full control. <br> While it is true that these tactics have hurt the name brand of the GOP and place Republican presidential candidates at greater risk in 2016, many congressional Republicans have been willing to suffer hits in the polls because the tactic has allowed them to continue using up time on the legislative calendar. Aside from vetoing bills, President Obama doesn't have many options other than to watch the clock tick away. <br> Now the GOP has done it again. Even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security, months have been consumed on Capitol Hill. When the year began President Obama wanted to make economic inequality a defining theme for the year. He wanted to use the limited power he had to bring more attention to the growing divide between the rich and the poor, as well as the struggles facing middle class Americans. But he has only had limited success. Instead, he and his party have been consumed with this struggle over the budget bill. <br> When House Republicans pushed their "stop-gap" measure to fund Homeland Security for just another week, they were following the standard game plan. By avoiding permanent solutions to budgeting problems, and keeping the debate over these issues in play for even more time, the GOP continues to eat away at the president's political clock. <br> Usually political extremism does not have the virtues that Sen. Barry Goldwater claimed in his famous 1964 speech to the Republican Convention, but it sure can have short-term political benefits in Congress. Just ask Mitch McConnell, who can barely contain his grin. 
 Given the partisan stalemate in Washington, many pundits therefore view the White House budget as a purely political statement intended to frame the 2016 presidential debate. Next, the GOP Congress will produce a conservative alternative, and each side will spend the next two years accusing the other of waging class warfare. <br> Except that the federal government actually does need a budget, especially one that reinforces the economy's gathering momentum. The one thing both parties seem to agree on is that reversing middle class stagnation is the nation's top priority. What America needs more than anything else is a long stretch of robust economic growth, something we have not seen since the 1990s, when both the growth and unemployment rates averaged about 4 percent a year. <br> It's true that stronger growth alone ultimately may not suffice to restore mass upward mobility. In the absence of real wealth creation, however, a politics of redistribution can only sustain a fleeting illusion of shared prosperity. <br> The Obama budget also calls for a 6% increase in federal RD funding, especially for biomedical research. Public investment that replenishes America's depleted stock of physical and knowledge capital is crucial to putting the U.S. economy back on a high-growth path. <br> In addition, the president wants funding for seven more manufacturing institutes that enlist companies, governments and universities to put America in the vanguard of advanced manufacturing, including 3-D printing. There's also more money for career training and on-the-job apprenticeships, as well as an intriguing Upward Mobility Project aimed at spurring enterprise in impoverished communities. <br> The controversial centerpiece of the president's budget is a grab bag of big tax changes that take from the rich to give to, well, everyone else. These include a minimum tax on millionaires; a higher capital gains tax (including on inherited wealth); and limits on the value of itemized deductions claimed by the wealthy. There's also a new tax on the nation's 100 largest banks. <br> Surging revenues would pay for an array of costly tax breaks for families with modest incomes, including a tax credit for second earners, an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without children and a tripling of the child tax credit. But while there's no doubt the overall effect would be to make federal taxes more progressive, it would also make the code even more insanely complicated. <br> Unfortunately, Obama's budget stops short of a comprehensive tax reform that would close loopholes for both individuals and corporations and use the added revenues to reduce rates for all taxpayers. Most economists believe that junking, or at least limiting, a host of special preferences and tax breaks would reduce economic distortions, promote more efficient use of capital, and generally make federal taxes fairer and simpler. <br> Congress, in short, is wearing fiscal handcuffs. Lawmakers can't launch fresh initiatives to tackle contemporary problems without either piling on new debt or reneging on old commitments (to spend more, or tax less). What's more, as the nation ages, more of our resources are channeled into automatic, formula-driven spending on current consumption -- mainly through Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- leaving fewer dollars to invest in children and families or future economic growth. <br> No one expects President Obama to solve this problem unilaterally, especially with a Republican Party so addled by anti-government populism that it can't distinguish between consumption spending and genuine economic and social investment. But neither can America afford a federal budget so paralyzed by old promises and interest group gridlock that it is essentially a blueprint for national decline. <br> That's why progressives need a strategy for reclaiming their fiscal freedom -- and the ability to invest in America's future. 
 On the individual side, he would increase taxes on the very wealthiest Americans to pay for tax cuts for lower- and middle-income Americans, including limiting tax benefits of itemized deductions for the best-off Americans, scaling back gigantic tax breaks for capital gains and large estates, and ensuring that hedge-fund managers pay their fair share. Each of these steps would reduce glaring inequities in our tax laws that allow the Warren Buffets of the world to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. <br> On the tax-cutting side, Obama would expand tax credits for child-care and education expenses, boost the earned-income tax credit for childless workers, and give a new tax break to two-earner couples. Critically, these tax cuts would be paid for by the loophole-closers already mentioned. <br> Unfortunately, these sensible proposals are almost certainly dead on arrival in the GOP-led Congress. <br> But on the corporate side, the president's plans actually have a chance of being taken seriously by congressional Republicans — possibly because his ideas are more in line with the ideological push for lower corporate tax rates. <br> The president's plan would impose a one-time 14% tax on the $2 trillion in untaxed income that multinational companies collectively have stashed in tax havens. While 14% is certainly higher than the single-digit rate companies such as Apple and Microsoft have paid to date on their offshore cash, it's still a lot less than the 35% these companies should be paying on their profits, and it's less than what many other businesses are already dutifully paying. Members of Congress have made similar proposals, including Sens. Barbara Boxer and Rand Paul, who recently proposed taxing foreign profits at 6.5%. Put another way, the president and lawmakers' theory on taxing offshore profits appears to be "getting something is better than nothing." <br> But we can do better. <br> In the wake of a titanic debate last year over what should happen to the corporate tax rate, Obama's budget is equally notable for failing to include a comprehensive proposal to eliminate tax giveaways. <br> The President has said that he wants a revenue-neutral corporate tax change that collects the same amount of revenue by lowering the corporate tax rate while eliminating loopholes. But his budget proposal is silent on how to accomplish this goal. The goal of corporate tax reform should be raising more revenue, not the same amount. <br> Measured as a share of the economy, the U.S. corporate tax is lower than almost every other developed nation -- and our corporate tax collections are at nearly their lowest point since World War II. This decline has been driven by rampant tax avoidance by big multinational corporations. <br> There is some good in the president's tax reform proposal. In particular, the low-income tax credits will encourage work and pull millions of workers out of poverty. Unfortunately, it is hard to imagine these ideas receiving a real hearing this year. <br> But the President's plan to lower the corporate tax rate and reward companies that stash their profits offshore with a lower tax rate -- coupled with his budget's lack of detail on a road map to eliminating corporate loopholes -- signals there is fertile ground for compromise that would fail to achieve a fair and sustainable corporate tax. 
 In the United States, the top 1% control more than one third of the nation's resources. Two out of three Americans disapprove of the current distribution of income and wealth. They believe that our economy and government unfairly favor the rich. <br> One of the major contributors to rising inequality is our tax system. Raising taxes on the very wealthy is an idea that appeals to many Americans, including the middle class and poor. <br> Republicans, meanwhile, are already apoplectic about President Obama's plan. One of the more curious phenomena about Republicans is that their economic agenda is entirely independent of the facts of the moment. So when the economy is strong, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich. When the economy is weak, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich. When the economy is recovering, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich. <br> President Obama is also proposing fees to make it more costly for the biggest financial companies to excessively borrow money. Post-recession, corporate profits have soared, but wages for Americans workers have not. Once upon a time, corporate profits used to correlate more closely with economic growth and wage prosperity for average Americans. In other words, we used to do well all together. <br> But increasingly, especially in the past decade thanks to Republican tax cuts and deregulations, corporations have succeeded while ordinary Americans have fallen behind. How else do we explain the stock market hitting record highs while many Americans are still out of work? This runaway train of inequality won't solve itself. We need government action -- action the majority of Americans strongly support. <br> In his State of the Union address, President Obama will argue for closing the "trust fund loophole," which, according to the White House, is one of the biggest tax loopholes plaguing our economy and lets the wealthiest Americans avoid hundreds of billions in taxes every year, money that should be helping build roads and schools that help us all. <br> President Obama will also propose raising the top capital gains and dividend rates back to what they were under President Ronald Reagan, which clearly Republicans once agreed was a sufficient level. And to hedge the sort of gambling that puts our entire economy at risk, President Obama will propose a fee on the nation's largest financial firms in proportion to how heavily they borrow and leverage. <br> These modest measures will help us reinvest in America's middle class and strengthen our economy for everyone's benefit. Among the President's proposals is a $500 tax credit for second earners in families where both spouses work, a proposal that will benefit 24 million American families. The President will endorse tripling the child care tax benefit, to help 5.1 million American families cover the cost of child care. President Obama will provide students with up to $2,500 a year toward the cost of college and make the first two years of community college free. And President Obama's plan includes giving 30 million more workers the opportunity to easily and automatically save for retirement through their employers. <br> While American voters across the board think that Democrats help the poor, middle class and rich fairly equally, 69% think Republican Party policies favor the rich. Even conservative voters are concerned about rising inequality. <br> The political pressure is on the GOP to prove they're not just the party of the 1%. There are some encouraging signs that Republicans believe tax reform should include increasing the share paid by the wealthiest Americans. President Obama's plan is a modest and effective set of policies that sensible Republicans can support. <br> The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. We've cut taxes on big businesses and the rich to near historic lows. Those tax cuts have only helped corporate profits and yacht sales. It's time that our economic policy helps all Americans. In this economic and political climate, not supporting basic tax fairness is insane. 
 Income inequality is like the weather: Everyone talks about it, but no one does much about it. Now comes President Obama in his State of the Union Address, hoping to do more than just talk about it. <br> The President tackles this perennial conundrum by proposing that the tax code be changed in two very distinct directions: 1) Provide extra money to low- and middle-income families in the form of tax credits for children and working couples. 2) raise taxes on upper-income taxpayers, especially the fabled "one percent" through various cutbacks and increased restrictions on savings. <br> It is certainly easy to dismiss his suggestions given the makeup of the new Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, but stranger concoctions have been enacted when major tax overhauls are undertaken. So what does the President suggest? <br> The majority party in Congress may not be particularly enthralled with President Obama's caveat that this credit phase out when a family's annual income reaches $120,000, but such parameters can be negotiated as legislation gets developed. <br> The tax changes on upper-income taxpayers are more likely to generate partisan resistance. As a general matter, Republicans want to lower or even eliminate taxes on capital gains, and this position has been party dogma since the first Bush administration. <br> In contrast, President Obama proposes to raise taxes on capital gains received by married couples with incomes exceeding $500,000 per year. That income level may be above most people's conception of "middle class," but it is far below what it takes to be a "one-percenter." Nevertheless, if one wants to address anomalies like Warren Buffett and Mitt Romney paying lower effective tax rates than their employees, then raising tax rates on capital gains is a necessity. <br> But President Obama goes much further and attacks the so-called "step-up in basis" rule -- which the White House calls the "trust fund loophole" -- that allows gains on inherited property to go untaxed, regardless of amount. Targeting this longstanding tax rule takes aim not at those who have worked hard to create businesses and build wealth, but at those whose pathway to riches was having the right relatives. <br> Obama's proposal, in other words, seeks to reduce wealth disparities without disincentivizing the job creators among us. Along these lines, he also proposes that no tax be due on inherited family-operated businesses until they are sold. <br> Will this time be different? Perhaps the sense among some citizens that the system is "rigged" will produce a different result this year, but income inequality is fundamentally not a problem that is exclusively or even primarily about taxation. Causes range from globalization and unfair trade agreements to falling educational achievement and the decline of private sector labor unions, among others. <br> Tweaking the tax code, even in the substantial and perhaps radical ways that President Obama is due to propose on Tuesday, can go only so far in addressing this issue. On the other hand, the U.S. tax code is one part of the puzzle that the federal government can control and do something about in fairly short order. <br> Tackling tax reform more broadly could be a pathway to bipartisan cooperation that creates a genuine achievement for both President Obama and the new Congress. In that context, repealing the "step-up in basis" rule and perhaps equalizing tax rates on capital gains and regular income would go a long way to simplifying tax planning and return preparation while allowing the market to allocate capital without the often nonsensical preferences embedded in the current tax code. That is certainly a worthy project. But it is a very different focus than trying to ameliorate income inequality. <br> Regarding the latter, even if President Obama's tax proposals are enacted exactly as he set out, they may not do much about income inequality in the United States, but they at least do more than just talk about it. 
 As a long-time advocate for reducing inequality -- or to put it another way, upping the fairness factor in local and global economies alike -- I am heartened to hear world leaders and policy-makers increasingly agree that growing inequality is undesirable. <br> But while we all agree that the world is facing an unprecedented number of large-scale, complex economic challenges, there remains heated discussion about the policy fixes needed. <br> Wealth gap increasingly 'obscene' <br> As economist Thomas Piketty so eloquently argued this year, wealth and the return on capital are growing faster than the overall economy and income from labor. Making matters worse, labor income is becoming increasingly skewed, with an ever increasing share going to a small band of top earners. <br> This means we are approaching levels of inequality in wealth and income that are increasingly difficult to justify, increasingly obscene, and are an increasing drag on productivity and growth. <br> Inequality of this magnitude undermines the basic notions of trust, fairness, and social cohesion that underpin our economies and societies. <br> That's why civil society wants G20 nations to embed equity in their country growth plans by measuring improvements in the incomes of the bottom 20% of households. <br> The G20's commitment to pursuing economic growth of two percentage points above current targets over the next five years is welcome. But the success of the Brisbane talks must also be viewed through the lens of fairness. Leaders must be held to account for ensuring the benefits of growth are spread more widely. <br> G20 needs to change <br> Just as the G20 has evolved in recent years from a gathering of finance ministers to include national leaders, the involvement of non-government organizations in G20 meetings and decision-making is a reflection of the realities of contemporary governing and policy making. <br> Put simply: the continuing relevance and legitimacy of the G20 as an effective global economic policy-making body is reliant on it being more people-focused. <br> That means the realization among global policy agenda-setters that inequality and exclusion stifles economic growth must drive better responses to addressing the economic impact of climate change, for example, and the establishment of robust post-2015 sustainable development goals. <br> The way forward <br> The Australian presidency has no less a task than securing the G20's future. The jury is still out on whether its outreach to non-government actors and, importantly, to developing nations is enough to deliver this. <br> Consider the key agenda item of driving jobs growth. Governments must work with the corporate sector and the community as equal partners to provide real and quality jobs in the formal sector of the economy, with social and legal protections so that all workers, especially those from vulnerable groups, have the opportunity for improved participation. <br> The G20 is also poised to make genuine progress on glaring faults in global governance, via its tax reform and transparency agenda. The potential benefits of coordinated action to increase transparency range from strengthening efforts to combat corruption and money laundering, to finally countering tax evasion and avoidance. <br> It's time to end tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions, and the practices that allow earnings to be "washed" or hidden, as well as the lax residency standards and treaty shopping that allow profit shifting. <br> Aggressive tax planning alone is estimated to cost developing nations billions of dollars a year. These are the same countries which rely heavily on foreign aid and lack the resources to deal with poverty or fund essential health care and education services. <br> As governments of wealthy and developing nations alike decry their ability to "afford" to meet the growing demands placed on them by their citizens, they surely have no excuse to ignore the policy levers they have at their disposal to plug leaky and opaque tax systems. <br> Is it too much to ask that adequate health services, better education opportunities and even clean water no longer remain hostage to capricious and shady global tax arrangements? <br> I'd say it's only fair for the G20 to act. 
 Each time, we've put forward a plan that stops spending money we don't have, creates jobs with pro-growth reforms, strengthens the safety net, and expands opportunity for all. And each time we've learned a little bit more about where the two parties stand. <br> He wants to raise taxes by $1.8 trillion -- on top of the $1.7 trillion he's already raised. He wants to increase spending by $791 billion. And he never balances the budget -- ever. <br> Time and again, the President and his party put government in the driver's seat. They want to take more from families to spend more in Washington. Whether it's health care, energy, or taxes, Democrats want the federal government to play a bigger role in the lives of Americans and our economy. <br> And that's great for Washington; it thrives on more power. But the American people will lose out. They'll face less opportunity, more debt, and fewer jobs. <br> A quick reality check for the critics and big spenders in Washington: On the current path, the federal government will spend roughly $48 trillion over the next 10 years. By contrast, this budget will spend nearly $43 trillion. On the current path, spending will grow, on average, by 5.2% a year. Under our budget, spending will grow, on average, by 3.5% a year. Nearly $43 trillion is enough. Increasing spending by 3.5% instead of 5.2% is hardly draconian. <br> Responsible spending restraint is just one part of our plan. We also call for pro-growth tax reform and greater energy production. We repeal Obamacare and clear the way for patient-centered reforms. We protect and strengthen Medicare. We repair the safety net so it's there for those who need it, and we give states the flexibility they need to help people move up the ladder of life. <br> All of these solutions would help create jobs. Instead of sending more money to Washington -- instead of funding more Solyndras and racking up more debt -- we return power to the people by cutting tax rates and wasteful spending. Under our plan, people will spend less time navigating the maze that is Washington and more time developing the new ideas that will power our economy. <br> So this debate boils down to a question of trust. Do we trust Washington to know what's best for our health care, our economy, or our families? Or do we trust the people of this country to make an honest assessment about what's best for their lives? <br> Republicans have made our choice. We've put forward a budget that harnesses the power of economic freedom and respects the dignity of every person. We trust the American people to lead our country forward. 
 You may not have noticed it, but in the midst of all the usual finger-pointing and polarization, a bit of actual problem-solving is underway in American politics. <br> A coalition of unlikely allies has coalesced in recent months to advance criminal justice reform. These strange bedfellows -- from liberal Democrats such as Sen. Dick Durbin to tea party darlings such as Sen. Mike Lee, from the NAACP to Americans for Tax Reform -- are all proposing reductions in mandatory minimum sentences. <br> U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's calls for such reductions have been cheered by some of the same Republicans who otherwise want to impeach him. In Texas, a conservative group called Right on Crime has led the way on prison and sentencing reform -- earning plaudits from, among others, California progressives. <br> Why this rash of consensus? <br> Well, for the right, it's mainly about getting control of big government -- prisons now consume a quarter of the Justice Department's budget, and state prison spending has been on a multidecade boom with little corresponding "return on investment." <br> For the left, it's mainly about social justice -- the disparity in criminal sentencing for crack versus powder cocaine has a long-documented racial dimension, and blindly filling the "school-to-prison pipeline" has seemed misguided and cruel. <br> Democrats and Republicans agree the metastasis of the prison-industrial complex is unhealthy. But for each side there are also benefits to acknowledging the other side's rationale. In a GOP sometimes perceived as intolerant, Rand Paul's embrace of sentencing reform lets him to show his concern for minorities. Civil rights Democrats, meanwhile, get to embrace fiscal responsibility. <br> The criminal justice deal-making suggests a possible way forward for our politics: crosspartisanship. Crosspartisanship may look like bipartisanship, but it's different. <br> Bipartisan compromise typically splits the difference between the views of two parties, giving each side less than its ideal outcome. A crosspartisan approach, by contrast, finds issues where people from both parties converge on a common principle, even if for different reasons, and achieve an outcome that's ideal to both. <br> Where else might such crosspartisanship take hold? Curbing government surveillance is a possibility. Reducing crony capitalism is another. Even reform of the federal tax code, an arena as full of political landmines as crime and punishment used to be, might be feasible. <br> On surveillance, Edward Snowden's revelations have scrambled party affiliations, bringing civil libertarians from left and right together to push back against the National Security Agency. Liberals hate the size of the national security state because they are wary of war; conservatives hate it because they are wary of government. <br> On crony capitalism, Republicans since 2008 have blamed the housing and financial collapse on the profligate policies of quasigovernmental agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while Democrats have blamed unregulated and predatory Wall Street firms. It's possible, of course, that they're both substantially right. <br> The moment is ripe for a liberal to say that government created the conditions for corruption in housing finance, and for a conservative to say that the absence of government accelerated such corruption. Perhaps both sides can agree that when public policy allows businesses to privatize gain while socializing loss, that's neither true capitalism nor good government. <br> On taxes, GOP House member Dave Camp of Michigan recently put forward a framework for tax reform that, while admittedly going nowhere legislatively, did take aim at tax expenditures -- loopholes -- that disproportionately benefit the privileged. He's not alone among conservatives, and they may be able to join with liberals who see such tax expenditures as welfare for the rich. <br> I'm not suggesting by any means that we're about to enter some golden age of collaboration in our politics. On plenty of issues -- making it easier for unions to organize workers or cutting taxes on the rich -- there are still irreconcilable policy differences that reflect deeper differences in worldview. <br> Some people, like me, think unions are generally a force for good; others see them as inherently inefficient, even evil. Some people divide the country into "makers" and "takers"; others find that division and its implications repugnant. <br> So the fighting will in most cases continue. But in the same way that the United States in foreign policy can sometimes partner with adversaries or rivals -- simply because it is in our interest in that moment to do so -- perhaps in domestic politics we can foster more such pragmatism. And make it contagious. <br> If that's going to happen, though, it'll be up to us as citizens to say that we want it. We'll have to reward elected leaders for this style of crosspartisan problem-solving. We'll have to resist punishing them for even talking to "the enemy." And then more leaders will have to learn to think -- and lead -- outside the lines of party. 
 CNN asked for views on President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night, in which he called for "a year of action"-- with or without Congress's agreement -- on combating inequality, creating pathways into employment, immigration reform and more. <br> Julian Zelizer: Obama's message to the middle clas</strong>s <br> President Barack Obama's State of the Union Address offered both a threat and a promise: To use the federal government's power to tackle the economic challenges the middle class has faced in recent decades. His theme was opportunity, namely, using government to ensure that all Americans have a genuine chance to climb the ladder "of opportunity" to make it into the middle class and become self-sufficient. <br> Relying on the government to ensure that those doors stay open is a traditional theme for Democrats, one they've employed effectively since President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s. <br> While the speech did have more proposals than some expected (tax reform, investing in infrastructure and research, job training, education, equal pay, minimum wage and more), the address was generally vague. But offering a laundry list was not the President's main intention. Nor was his primary goal to boost his approval ratings. <br> What the President really hoped to do with this speech was to direct the national conversation for the coming year. He wants to move Washington further away from its political obsession with austerity -- cutting spending and cutting deficits -- and toward a debate about how the federal government, through the President if necessary, can take concrete steps to alleviate the problems of inequality and provide renewed security to the middle class. <br> President Obama asked Republicans in Congress to join him in entering this discussion and dealing with this problem through concrete policy, while he also sent a clear warning that he will move ahead without them if they resist. "But America does not stand still," the President said, "and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do." <br> LZ</strong> </strong>Granderson: A missed opportunity on inequality <br> Considering how much stock Democrats have put into the debate over income inequality recently, President Obama's State of the Union speech didn't spend much time driving the party's point home with specifics or facts. <br> Instead he over-relied on anecdotes. Yes, he correctly pointed out the three decades of technological growth had slowly eaten away at middle-class jobs. But by focusing the nation's attention more on the band-aid minimum wage increase -- and making only cursory mention of more permanent solutions, such as the specific loopholes he would close and tax code revisions he would make -- Obama missed an opportunity. And that was to convince Americans that his economic policies are not the reason median income has dropped since he took office and that he's still capable of big policy initiatives, the kind that could find a little bipartisan support from tax hawks on the moderate right who also want to re-write the tax code. <br> That's not to suggest an executive order to raise the minimum wage won't help people; it will. But to change the dynamic that has kept wages stagnant since President Reagan, it's going to take something big. And for all of the big talk about income inequality from Democrats, President Obama's address presented very little in terms of specific ideas, backed by facts, that would change the trajectory. <br> Instead, by glossing over the country's economic arc -- and not educating people on the decades-long regression of the middle class because of the tax code -- he made it easier for his critics to simply point a finger and say "it's his fault." <br> Anne-Marie Slaughter: Where was foreign policy? <br> The biggest surprise of Obama's speech last night was his return to a campaign pledge from his first Presidential run: To close the Guantánamo Bay prison where the U.S. government is holding detainees accused of terrorism without formal charge or trial date, violating one of the most fundamental safeguards of our Constitution. <br> That is the only comfort that human rights supporters and humanitarians got from tonight's State of the Union address. On Syria, the greatest moral challenge of our time and a pressing strategic issue, the President said nothing except to make a quick reference to the removal of Syrian chemical weapons due to U.S. "diplomacy backed by force." <br> That kind of diplomacy is exactly what is lacking in Syria; the participants in the ongoing conference in Switzerland have no reason to think that if they cannot agree to a peace agreement the United States will respond with anything more than exhortations. Indeed, elsewhere in the speech the President echoed his remarks last May when he insisted that "America must move off a permanent war footing," adopting restrictions on the use if drones. He also anticipated the day when the Afghan war, the longest war in American history, would be over. <br> Looking at the speech as a whole, the real core of the President's foreign-policy is not political but economic: His point early on that America is now the No. 1 place to invest in the world, beating out China. Notwithstanding Secretary of State John Kerry's strenuous efforts on three different fronts -- Iran, Syria, and Israel/Palestine -- his boss used this speech to toss breadcrumbs to various foreign-policy constituencies. It's the economy stupid, never more than now. <br> Kevin Appleby: An immigration reform goal he may be able to reac</strong>h <br> A highlight of President Obama's State of the Union address was his call for bipartisan cooperation in passing immigration reform this year: "Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted. I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same. So let's get immigration reform done this year." <br> Unlike other years, this year's call to action actually has a ring of political reality, as the House Republicans are preparing to release their own principles for reform. <br> But getting a fair immigration bill through the House of Representatives in an election year will be tough, requiring more political leadership and less political gamesmanship. It is achievable, provided all sides enter the fray in good faith and with a sincere desire to tackle the problem. As the President said in his speech, "...it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders and law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system." <br> Both sides will have to compromise and, believe it or not, work together to pass positive and humane legislation. There will be real differences on the substantive issues, particularly in how the undocumented population will be allowed to apply for citizenship and what future enforcement policies may be adopted. But they are not irreconcilable. <br> The human stakes are high. If the President and Congress fail to repair our immigration system, immigrant families and communities -- and the social fabric of the nation -- will continue to break apart. <br> As Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles has aptly stated, our current immigration system is a "stain on the soul of the nation. " As a moral matter, we can no longer wait to fix it. <br> Kevin Appleby is director of Migration Policy and Public Affairs at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. <br> Timothy Stanley: Obama plans to ignore Congress</strong> </strong>-- and they'll ignore him back <br> The latest State of the Union address reflected the Washington partisanship we've all come to know and hate. Obama began the speech by asking for unity, but quickly made it clear that he a) didn't expect to get it and b) is prepared to break the deadlock with executive action. Take the minimum wage. Obama made a moral case for it being raised, implied that he expects the Republicans to refuse support, and then indicated that he'd find ways of doing it anyway. <br> Last year he was prepared to fight the Republicans in Congress. This year he'll ignore them and, presumably, travel the country calling them heartless instead. So the battle will take on a new, slightly less Constitutionally-sound dimension. No less bitter, of course. <br> Where he has asked for cooperation, it's doubtful he'll get it. Solar panels and amnesty for illegal immigrants are not things that John Boehner can easily deliver votes on. Meanwhile, Republicans will probably avoid engaging rhetorically with Obama's economic populism and continue to talk about Obamacare and the deficit instead, setting themselves up to reap a protest vote in the November midterms. <br> So what we heard last night was an admirably feisty attempt to regain the political initiative by establishing the Republicans as the party of stasis and the President as a man who just wants to get things done. The problem, though, is that the political realities continue to block movement. <br> Last year we saw a shutdown, light gun control initiatives defeated and even a war averted by just the terror of taking it to Congress. Why should this change? The Republicans won't gain anything from being nicer to the President and the President is staking everything on the country turning against the Republicans. Sorry, but 2014 looks like it'll be a repeat of 2013. <br> Nick Ehrmann: Early education important, but don't forget high school <br> Last night, President Obama made an impassioned and necessary case to lower the barriers for low-income students to succeed in higher education. He said: "The problem is we're still not reaching enough kids, and we're not reaching them in time." He's right. That has to change. <br> The President points out that "one of the best investments we can make in a child's life is high-quality early education." His focus on mustering resources from both the public and private sectors, of creating "a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists" to increase access to quality early education is smart. <br> Let's not forget that the same is true of students further along in their education. Research has shown that academic preparation in high school is the single strongest predictor of college completion. <br> Take 18-year-old Estiven Rodriguez, the Dominican-born student whom the President hailed in his speech for extraordinary academic achievements, including a scholarship to Dickinson College for the fall. After arriving to the U.S. speaking limited English, Estiven's path to opportunity accelerated with exposure to rigorous academic preparation later on in his journey through the New York City public schools. <br> Making the President's vision a reality requires collaboration from both the public and private sectors, from the best minds in education, from parents, teachers, policymakers, and nonprofits alike. This is about Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School -- or WHEELS, an urban public high school -- partnering with nonprofits to create a learning environment that helps students like Estiven thrive. <br> We have the rest of 2014 to see whether the President's intention to work outside of Congress to expand educational opportunity will prove effective. <br> Nick Ehrmann is the CEO and founder of Blue Engine, a New York City-based education nonprofit that partners with public high schools to prepare students for college success. <br> Maria Cardona: GOP should follow Obama's lead on women's issues <br> In his State of the Union speech, President Obama offered a blueprint for moving the country forward with optimism, economic opportunity and pathways to prosperity for all. But thanks to obstruction in Washington, too little has been done to make these a reality for all Americans, especially women. Here is where Republicans should pay attention. <br> Republicans can also follow the President's lead on raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for future federal contract workers as a way to climb out of their self-dug hole with women. Women hold a majority of low-wage jobs in America. Raising the minimum wage and closing the gender wage gap will help the 1 out of 3 women who live in or on the brink of poverty, could cut poverty in half and add half a trillion dollars to the economy. <br> Add to that abandoning the GOPs obsession with repealing Obamacare -- an initiative that has given countless mothers the security of knowing that their children with pre-existing conditions will be covered by a health plan -- and you could have the beginning of the end of the Republicans' problems with women. Maybe. <br> John Stoehr: He can't address inequality without spending <br> President Obama's fifth State of the Union address was haunted by the specter of austerity. Very few of the measures he asked Congress to act on -- education, tax and immigration reform, closing Guantanamo or passing fair-pay legislation -- would require the federal government to spend. <br> That's what was missing. <br> The closest Obama got to discussing spending was after urging Congress to close tax loopholes that reward corporations for sending jobs overseas while creating disincentives to creating jobs at home. We can take the money saved from tax reform, he said, and spend it "rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes." But if Congress fails to act, he said he would use the powers of the executive to fast-track "key projects" to "get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible." <br> That's fine, but there's only so much Obama can do without Congress. He can cut red tape all day but that's not going to put more money in more Americans' pockets, boosting their purchasing power. His call to raise the minimum wage will indeed increase demand, and alleviate poor sales, but even a $10.10 minimum wage doesn't keep pace with productivity gains over the past decade. This economy is not able to create enough quality jobs on its own. In the absence of benevolent market forces, the government must spend. <br> John Stoehr is managing editor of the Washington Spectator. <br> Aaron Carroll: No victory lap on Obamacare <br> Given that this is the year when the Affordable Care Act really gets into gear, it's not surprising that the President took the opportunity to highlight some of the important things that are happening right now due to health care reform. He highlighted the case of a woman in Arizona who was previously uninsured, but who was able to get health insurance on January 1 thanks to new regulations and the insurance exchanges. Millions of people stand to gain insurance this year, and the administration is eager to highlight this achievement. <br> But the President also seemed to acknowledge reality in the sense that people are not signing up for insurance at the rate that he had hoped for. He exhorted people to get family members to sign up for care. He used Kentucky as an example of success, but even that state isn't where many hoped it would be. <br> He urged Republicans to change their tactics on the law. Instead of "refighting old battles," he asked them to offer new ideas and allow them to be compared to his law in terms of costs and coverage. <br> This certainly didn't feel like a victory lap. President Obama continues to face opposition and calls for the law to be repealed. That's almost certainly not going to happen, but it has to be frustrating to the President that he still has to appeal to the American people for support on a law that was passed almost four years ago. <br> Bob Greene: The state of the union? Discord and inaction <br> Three bangs of the gavel, "Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States," "High privilege and distinct honor," and the annual grandeur-on-demand unfolded right on schedule Tuesday night. <br> The State of the Union address was not short on human moments. President Obama, in the first minute of his speech, evoked teachers, entrepreneurs, auto workers, farmers and rural doctors to argue that America's finest moments are crafted not in Washington, but out in the nation. <br> He pointed out that "the son of a barkeep" -- John Boehner -- was Speaker of the House, and that the son of a single mother -- Obama himself -- was president. <br> But when Obama declared that "this chamber" -- the well of the House of Representatives, on this evening filled with members of Congress, members of the Cabinet, justices of the Supreme Court, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- "speaks with one voice," his words, no matter how well intentioned, rang necessarily a little hollow. <br> The leadership of this nation? Speaking with one voice? <br> If ever in the country's history it was true -- and it probably never was -- it certainly isn't today. The President was making the case that the upper echelon of American politics and government concurs that "the state of our Union" is strong. <br> That sentiment is far from unanimous, and before long you will find ample evidence in the wall-to-wall attack ads that, as always, will be an inescapable feature of Congressional campaigns across the country. The State of the Union address long ago ceded its place as the main barometer of how political and governmental America feels about itself; the attack ads paint a truer cumulative portrait. <br> The president vowed "a year of action," and he will be correct, although perhaps not in the way he intended. The action is up the road, in the bare-knuckles election campaigns that lie ahead. The state of the union -- at least the political union -- is combative and discordant. Which is probably healthy, although sometimes not easy to watch. As messy as America's civic life can be, in the end it is hard to dispute that it is indeed a high privilege and distinct honor to live here, to be a part of it all. <br> CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose 25 books include "Late Edition: A Love Story;" "Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War;" and "Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen." <br> Edward Morrissey: Papering ove</strong>r</strong> poor track record on jobs <br> It's always difficult for a President starting a sixth year in office to frame a State of the Union speech for a forward-looking agenda, even when the basic economic environment is good. When that President has governed through a dysfunctional recovery and watched the workforce dwindle down as a share of the working-age population, it's nearly impossible. President Obama's speech, needless to say, did not accomplish the impossible. <br> He started out the speech bragging about adding eight million jobs in four years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that figure is 7.5 million since December 2009, although it's closer to 6.5 million in the Household survey. Even at the higher number, job growth works out to an average of 156,250 net jobs added each month. <br> Thanks to population growth, the U.S. economy needs to add about 150,000 jobs each month just to stay even in terms of workforce employment. What President Obama fails to mention is that his economic policies have dragged employment and active engagement in the workforce as a percentage of the civilian population down from 64.6% at the beginning of that four-year period to 62.8% now, a level not seen since Jimmy Carter gave his first official State of the Union speech in 1978. <br> Clearly, then, Obama's policies have not brought prosperity and job creation to the nation. At best, we have had four years of stagnation on job creation, and the falling top-line unemployment number reflects an exodus from the workforce, not any improvement in the job market. Why is that? Obama slipped into the passive voice to explain it: "But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled." Obama seems to think that he's just arrived on the scene, but it has been his economic and regulatory policies for the past five years that produced this stalled economy and stagnation environment. <br> And what did Obama propose to solve this? The same policies that produced it -- spending on supposedly shovel-ready public works, short-term gimmicky incentives and government programs, most of which have nothing to do with freeing capital to unlock job creation. <br> No one expected Obama to offer anything innovative or new, so it's hardly a disappointment. But like his last few State of the Union speeches, it was largely a laundry list of priorities far out of touch with Americans who just want to get back to work. <br> Anthony Leiserowitz: A renewed</strong> </strong>promise of action on climate change <br> President Obama's 5th State of the Union address called for reigniting the American dream -- one that feels increasingly out of reach for far too many Americans. <br> He vowed to take assertive presidential action this year -- with Congress where possible, but without Congress when it refuses to act. This includes perhaps his most important legacy -- making serious and substantial progress to reduce the threat of global warming and prepare the nation for the impacts already beginning to hit home. Future generations will look back on this President and on this time as a critical moment in the history of the world: did we choose to address this real and present danger or did we choose to ignore or deny the problem until it festered beyond repair? <br> The President listed his accomplishments so far -- stronger pollution standards for cars, rules to limit pollution from power plants, investments in the transition to clean energy. He also described new partnerships with states and local communities to begin preparing to protect the nation from extreme weather and other climate impacts. <br> These are important first steps. There is much still to be done -- by individuals, communities, states, the nation and the world. And there are still political divisions within America about the reality and seriousness of the threat. (He was in fact blunt: "...the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact," he said.) <br> But as the President reminded us, progress never comes easy. "Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged. But for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress." <br> Anthony Leiserowitz is </em>d</em>irector of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication at the Yale School of Forestry Environmental Studies. 
 When President Obama takes center stage for the State of the Union Address on Tuesday night, he is certain to address the issue of economic inequality. <br> Over the past few months, President Obama has become increasingly vocal about the growing divide between the rich and the poor in America. During a speech at the Center for American Progress in December, he warned that the nation needed to deal with the "dangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility that has jeopardized middle-class America's basic bargain—that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead." <br> The problem is that any talk about tackling inequality runs directly into the reality of Washington gridlock. In an age when so little gets done, it is hard to imagine Obama will have any luck achieving much progress on this issue. <br> But he needs to try. At a minimum, he can use the power of the presidency to at least get these issues into the national debate for now and for the future. <br> There are also some concrete proposals on the table that could take a dent out of inequality. <br> 1) Raise the minimum wage: Most important, the minimum wage has been central to the nation's efforts to provide a base of support to working Americans. Since its enactment in 1938, the federal minimum wage has been integral to boosting the income of workers in some of the lower-paying jobs. <br> But current minimum wage levels are not adequate. Most economists agree that there is room to increase the minimum wage without any dramatic impact on unemployment. There are proposals in Congress to raise it to $10.10 an hour from $7.25. The proposal has enormous national support even though there is still stiff opposition from Republicans in the House <br> 3) Restore extended</strong> </strong>unemployment benefits and food stamp spending: Congress must also restore some of the benefits that they have taken away from those who are struggling. It is one thing to stop progress on fighting inequality, another to make things worse. <br> Unfortunately, in recent months some Republicans have aggressively sought to undercut key pillars of the social safety net. The GOP blocked an effort by Democrats to extend unemployment benefits that expired. States are following through by cutting benefits as well, a dynamic that is having devastating effects on those who have been living on the edge. Congress has also enacted cuts to the food stamp program, one of the most effective measures that we have had since the 1960s to help poorer Americans. <br> 4) Add incentives to hire the long-term unemployed: Congress must also consider new incentives to persuade business to hire the long-term unemployed. In 2010, Congress enacted a tax benefit to employers who hired the unemployed. New incentives should be added that target the long-term unemployed. One of the most urgent challenges facing the government is to help the unemployed get back into the labor pool. The longer workers are out the more difficult it is to get back in. <br> 5) Close tax loopholes: President Obama should call on Congress to move forward on tax reform, an issue that has been discussed for years. Tax reform is one of the most effective means for raising revenue from wealthier Americans. At this point, Congress has little chance to move forward on a tax increase on wealthier Americans. But loophole-closing tax reform is a way to raise revenue by taking away benefits that some of the wealthiest Americans thrive on. There are a number of conservatives who have supported tax reform, a means of making the tax code more efficient and dealing with the deficit problem without raising tax rates. <br> Even though they are modest, some of these measures will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve and the odds are low. But President Obama must at least put the issues up on the agenda and energize the debate about how to tackle this problem. 
 President Barack Obama has had a tough year. Although he began in January well aware of the immense problems that second-term presidents have historically confronted, it still doesn't seem that he was fully prepared for what was to come. <br> The past 12 months have found the president struggling to protect his domestic policies from attack and to maintain control of the national agenda. <br> Obama began the year enjoying the glow of his reelection against Mitt Romney. The year ended with his approval ratings plummeting; more and more Americans reported that they didn't trust Obama. Many of the main items on his agenda -- tax reform, gun control, immigration reform, and climate change -- are languishing. <br> What factors made this year so difficult? The toughest challenge that President Obama faced has been the continuing ruthless opposition he has encountered on Capitol Hill. <br> Congressional Republicans have maintained their aggressive stance toward the administration, using the legislative process to achieve their objectives. The most tangible example of this strategy has been their threat to not raise the debt ceiling to force the president into several weeks of confrontation over the budget. <br> Even as their own party approval ratings plummeted, Republicans displayed a fierce determination to move forward with their strategy. Part of the problem stems from the fact that House Republicans play to their activist base, which will shape the primaries in their safe districts, rather than to independent voters. Tea party Republicans control enough of the House Caucus to force the speaker into their corner if he wants to keep his job. <br> Although Obama held his ground on the final outcome of the debt ceiling battle, the budget brinkmanship consumed a huge amount of valuable political time. If Congress passes the current budget deal, it will create a temporary pause in the budget wars, but the battles have already taken their toll <br> Republicans used other tactics as well. They stifled Obama's federal judicial nominations and executive appointments, until Senate Democrats became so frustrated that they changed the filibuster rules (a true sign of desperation in the upper chamber!). <br> House Republicans refused to move forward with an immigration bill with bipartisan support sent to them from the Senate, and conducted many hearings about the president's health care program trying to find scandal in a story about poor implementation. <br> That brings us to Obama's second challenge in 2013, one that did not come from his opponents but the failures of management and organization of his own administration. <br> After his health care program had survived judicial and legislative challenge, all eyes turned to see what the Affordable Care Act would look like when the government launched the federal online health care exchange on October 1. <br> The results were not pretty. The website was filled with problems. The system kept crashing when people tried to sign on. It gradually became clear that the site was not even prepared to disseminate the information about who purchased insurance to the insurers. <br> Investigative stories soon revealed that high-level officials had been aware of these problems long before the web site went live, and failed to properly prepare. Two months later the administration was able to get the system running relatively smoothly, as far as we now know. But the embarrassment of the first weeks had its cost on American's confidence in the program, as well as in the President. <br> Political scientist Theda Skocpol has reminded us that Social Security policymaker Wilbur Cohen, an iconic figure in the 1950s and 1960s, once said that Medicare was 1% inspiration and 99% implementation. In a toxic political atmosphere, Obama caused huge problems for himself with the way that he handled the 99% of the job. <br> And Obama has continued to struggle in the politics of perception. This has been a weakness of this administration from the start of his first term. <br> Obama is a politician who maintains an unending belief in rationality. He refuses to embrace the frenzied media environment where it is often difficult to tell fact from fiction. Since taking office, Obama has continued to hold firm to the idea that over time voters will pay attention to the facts, and that the candidate with the best argument will win. Sometimes, particularly on foreign policy, his outlook has proven to be correct. <br> But on many other occasions he has seen how quickly the national conversation can shift as the president stood silent. When Obama persuaded Congress to pass an economic stimulus bill in 2009, the administration did little to sell the program. Even though it was a modest program, heavily weighted toward tax cuts rather than government spending, conservatives branded it as a failed big-spending program that did nothing for the economy. <br> When Congress passed a health care program in 2010 that left the private insurance system fully intact and avoided anything looking like a national health insurance plan, the White House stood still as Republicans defined the bill as big government gone wild. <br> It was especially important that the White House respond aggressively this year before the rollout, but it did not. The public never got fully behind the law, let alone understood it. <br> The President has also allowed small stories to shift public discussion. Most recently, he delivered a major address on inequality in America. The speech was meant to outline an agenda for the rest of his presidency and provide a framework for the policies that he would pursue. <br> Within a few days of the speech, however, many reporters had refocused on new pseudo-scandals, such as the revelation that Obama once lived with an uncle who was almost deported as a result of a drunken-driving arrest. <br> Administration officials might rightly complain that these kinds of stories have little to do with the underlying issues facing the nation, but they still reflect the kind of media environment all presidents face. <br> From marketing their programs to fighting back against smaller scandals, the President's team needs to do a much better job in the politics of information. In apparent recognition of this failing, the administration is adding John Podesta, Phil Schiliro, and Katie Beirne Fallon to the White House team. <br> In the realm of national security, Obama also struggled in the face of the ongoing disclosures over the NSA surveillance program. Major leaks have revealed the extensive spying that the United States has undertaken within the United States and overseas, revelations that have angered many of the President's supporters who had believed he would do things differently than President George W. Bush. <br> The one area where the president has experienced slightly more positive outcomes are in foreign policy. In confronting a series of crises -- including Syria's use of chemical weapons against rebels and Iran's nuclear buildup -- Secretary of State John Kerry has put in place a series of temporary deals that aim to curb these threats. <br> Although the verdict is out on both of these, and each deal can backfire on the administration if they don't work out, for the time being the White House has calmed the storms. <br> Obama's supporters should hope that the tough moments of the year turn into learning moments for the President, hardening him for the coming year and giving him a better roadmap about how to push for his agenda in the upcoming year. They might take some solace from President Ronald Reagan, who enjoyed some of his most important accomplishments in his final years in office -- the signing of the INF Treaty with the Soviet Union -- as well as President Bill Clinton, whose approval ratings skyrocketed in his final years. <br> The good news for the president is that there is time left to win back public support and build on his record for the history textbooks. He also can gain some optimism from the fact that he is facing a deeply divided Republican Party whose approval ratings are even worse than his. 
 On the surface, Montana Senator Max Baucus's proposal to reform the corporate tax code seems politically insane. The powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has proposed tightening up the tax treatment of corporate profits overseas. The Senator, along with legislators in both parties, wants to use this proposal as the basis for broader loophole-closing reforms that also tackle the individual tax code. <br> Given how difficult it has been to pass any piece of legislation in recent years, it seems impossible that Congress will muster the energy or courage to challenge powerful interest groups that benefit from the status quo and to reform the tax code. <br> While loophole-closing tax reform might be good policy, it is hard to see how it can be good politics. "This is a big rock to push up the hill," warned Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden. <br> But in fact there is reason to believe that tax reform might have a chance to pass. The proposal comes at a good time. Congress is stuck in the mud. As an institution, Congress needs a big victory. Polls show that the approval ratings of Congress have reached all-time lows, now having fallen to an abysmal nine percent. <br> Although members of Congress tend to focus on their own electoral future, the public image of Congress has reached such a low point that the leaders of both parties are seriously concerned. <br> When public disapproval of the institution is so strong, it creates the environment for a possible "throw the bums" out atmosphere in which all parties are at risk for an anti-incumbent election. <br> Nothing can boost the image of Congress as an institution like a reform that benefits the public interest over private interests. Although achieving tax reform is extraordinarily difficult, Democrats and Republicans could walk away from a deal looking as if they were finally willing to take on the status quo in Washington and to defy the powerful interest groups who lurk on K Street. This might be enough to bolster public attitudes about the House and Senate going into the next couple of election cycles. <br> If Congress gores enough oxen, with both parties equally implicated in the reform, members could insulate themselves from the fallout—preventing one party from using this as an issue against the other--and strengthen their standing with the electorate as a result. <br> Both parties also stand to benefit from tax reform because it remains one of the best ways to raise revenue without raising taxes. One of the reasons that tax reform has always attracted the interest of fiscal conservatives is that cleaning up the tax code of its loopholes quickly raises more revenue. <br> Most fiscal conservatives understand that serious deficit reduction is only possible through a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts. <br> Although the United States has maintained a progressive tax code since 1913, few upper income individuals or corporations pay the actual higher rates since loopholes diminish their obligations. Occasionally, such as in 1969 and 1986, Congress has closed loopholes as a way to raise more money to curb the deficit. <br> Unlike 1986, this time the legislation would not be revenue neutral. The amount of money raised by closing loopholes would be more than the money saved by taxpayers enjoying lower rates, and that money could be used to help shrink the deficit. That could enable the grand bargain over deficit reduction that Democrats and Republicans have been unsuccessfully pursuing for years. <br> As occurred when Ronald Reagan was president in 1986, tax reform was an issue that both parties had an incentive to support. For unpopular Republicans, tax reform can offer evidence that the party is committed to fiscal responsibility and demonstrate that they are capable of governance. <br> Passage of the legislation would offer a contrast to the image that the party gained when it used the debt ceiling to try to force President Obama's hand on spending cuts. For Democrats, tax reform can shift the national agenda away from the problems with the roll out of the Affordable Care Act and toward a legislative accomplishment. <br> Finally, tax reforms can be one of the first tests of the post-filibuster reform Congress. The Senate voted to prevent filibusters on executive and judicial nominations. They did so through a majority vote, establishing for the first time that a majority was sufficient to change the rules. <br> Many experts predict that this precedent might scare senators from using the filibuster as much as in recent years, fearing that the tool might be eliminated altogether. It is thus possible that tax reform would now only require 51, rather than 60, votes in the Senate. <br> President Obama could desperately use a victory like tax reform. As the chances for passing immigration reform diminish, and the possibilities of achieving progress on climate change are nil, tax reform might be one of the few areas where progress is possible. <br> Ronald Reagan scored a big victory in 1986, one that remains a noted part of his record and legacy. Unfortunately, over time new loopholes were created and there is a need for another around of reform. The president should seize the moment, to make sure that his second term is not solely defined by the bitter partisan battles over the budget and health care. 
 If this were a movie, we would be at the part where the hero finds himself surrounded. He has no escape routes and he's outgunned. What will happen next: Will our hero prevail like John McClane in "Die Hard," or will he fail like William Wallace in "Braveheart"? <br> Well, the good news for Obama is that the script for the final scenes of his presidency has not been written yet. The bad news is that he may not be the one writing it. <br> Simply put: Obama is not the protagonist driving his own story. Rather, his storyline is being dictated by others. No question, he has long had trouble controlling the narrative, with a GOP bent on denying him, basically, everything he wants. But now he's heading toward the end of his final term -- and the clock is ticking on his agenda. <br> It was as if Obama had become George Clooney as the captain of the fishing boat in "The Perfect Storm." The rain has stopped, the ocean is turning calm and there is even a glimmer of sunlight; he's beaten the storm. But then moments later, the sky darkens and there is a deluge of rain. The choppy waters (in this case, the Obamacare website debacle) soon consume the ship. <br> Is this Obama's metaphoric fate? He can accept another plotline -- let's say of "Gravity," with Obama as a character like Sandra Bullock's, hit with one harrowing challenge after another. This may be exciting to watch, but not great for the character, who has no idea what will happen next. <br> I'd recommend a different story line. I'd use the ending of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" as inspiration and metaphorically go out with guns blazing. Why not set some lofty goals that will frame the agenda anew going forward? <br> Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News. But the upside is that the debate will be about the issues the President has chosen. <br> It's denouement time for Obama as we enter the final act of his presidency. Will the President's agenda continue to be dictated by others, making him nothing more than a lame duck, caretaker President? Or will he use every means at his discretion to write his own story? <br> Obama is the star of this movie. The only question is: How is it going to end? 
 Driven by a hard-line faction of conservatives, Washington has done something terribly stupid: shutting down the national government. Most of America is aghast. But it is also just possible that doing something stupid will help us avoid doing something truly dangerous. <br> Shutdowns are a lousy way to run a government. Just for starters, this one has cut off services to women and children in need, furloughed hundreds of thousands, further shaken the confidence of the public, sent a shudder through the financial world and created new storm clouds over the economy. And once again the world is wondering about our capacity for leadership. <br> But all of this damage pales in comparison with the danger posed by a second, lurking threat: a default on our public finances. <br> The United States has had 17 government shutdowns since 1977 and has generally recovered well. But we have never had a default. Experts, while not fully certain, are convinced that it could be hugely destructive -- even leading to a worldwide financial meltdown. Unless Congress and the White House get their act together, we could default in less than three weeks. <br> But a shutdown could have a silver lining. It could be such an electric shock to the political system that it forces the politicians in Washington to settle their squabbles before the default deadline. <br> What we know from past shutdowns is that not only citizens -- especially older ones dependent on Social Security and Medicare -- start raising hell, but so do business and financial leaders who see damage rippling across their economic interests. Politicians are increasingly seen as villains. Pressure tends to grow so unbearable that eventually Washington finds a solution. <br> Seasoned GOP leaders across the country know that if the shutdown does serious damage, chances of Republicans picking up Senate seats in 2014 and the White House in 2016 could evaporate. Those leaders will push intensely for a way out. <br> But Republicans are not the only ones who will come under pressure to find a settlement. So will Democrats, starting with President Obama. We expect our presidents to be leaders of all the people, not a single party or ideology. We want them to rise above the squabbling and keep us on track. The harsh rhetoric that the president has been directing at Republicans suggests that he is less interested in settlement than unconditional surrender. <br> Moreover, as Republicans make their counterarguments, it is becoming increasingly apparent that they have some valid questions. Is Obamacare truly ready for prime time? Shouldn't the two parties work together on the tax code? When is Washington going to get serious about overhauling the entitlement programs so they will survive for coming generations? <br> Yes, conservative hard-liners have chosen the wrong place to fight; arguments over Obamacare are no excuse to shut down the government. Yes, hard-liners like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are creating deeper partisan divides. But Democrats can ill afford to continue rejecting any talks or negotiations. <br> Now that the shutdown has happened, Obama has a fresh opportunity -- indeed a fresh responsibility -- to seize the mantle of leadership and get us out of this mess. Instead of just blaming the Republicans, he should call in the leaders of both parties and in Lyndon Johnson fashion, keep 'em talking till they get a deal. <br> With the shutdown underway, the president has new leverage to say, "Look, we are here to negotiate a settlement so that we can reopen the government. We are not here to negotiate over a possible default; I have said all along that I won't do that. But those of you who have been listening closely know that I have also been saying that I am open to conversations about settling our policy differences so that we can keep the government running. <br> "Tax reform, entitlement reform and even some tweaking of the Affordable Care Act are on the table now. I have only two conditions: I will not accept a gutting of Obamacare -- we settled that at the ballot box in 2012 -- and any settlement here must include a pledge not to let the country go into default. So, let's get started." <br> Would it work? Who knows for sure? But one thing is clear: If enough Americans rise up now and pressure politicians in Washington to call off this circus, we could not only end this foolishness over a shutdown, but we could also avoid a truly dangerous default. And we could hold our heads up again. 
 In contrast to the 2002 farewell summit between President George W. Bush and outgoing Chinese President Jiang Zemin at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, this week's talks between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in California mark the first time in history that a U.S. president will host a series of informal meetings with a new Chinese leader. <br> While issues such as North Korea, cybersecurity and the economy will likely dominate their discussions, what really matters is whether Xi and Obama can establish a trusting personal relationship that will help both leaders overcome stark policy differences. <br> As charismatic leaders who view themselves as transformational figures, what better way to start the conversation than to outline their aspirations and plans for resolving pressing domestic matters? <br> Both Xi and Obama are finding themselves at political crossroads that will define their subsequent days in office. Both need to solve a confluence of structural problems while confronting cynical constituencies that can easily turn on them. <br> For Obama, dealing with a seemingly intractable partisan divide in Washington is hard enough. A series of recent bureaucratic problems has made his burden worse, resulting in what some have referred to as his "second term blues." <br> For Xi, an apparent turn to conservatism has the potential to bring his erstwhile reform-minded political honeymoon to an untimely end. <br> Luckily, each leader has the opportunity this week to talk with one of the few counterparts in the world who can empathize with the magnitude of the issues. <br> In his first few months as president, Xi has worked to give the Chinese government a face-lift, trying to contain corruption and construct a sense of nationalism by offering his people something they aspire to: the Chinese Dream, or what Xi has described as the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the opportunity to realize a middle-class lifestyle. <br> As Xi pursues these aspirations, he should join Obama in exploring similar issues that are hindering both countries -- a growing divide between the rich and poor, persistent post-graduate unemployment, housing bubbles, food safety concerns, immigration (or internal migration for China) reform, health care reform and tax reform. <br> If Xi is to be successful in confronting these issues, it will be difficult to do so without political reform. <br> In China, dissent has been growing on college campuses, where academics have received recommendations instructing them not to speak about seven sensitive issues: universal values, freedom of the press, civil society, civil rights, past party mistakes, crony capitalism and judicial independence. Whether such official guidelines persist will determine if there is hope for an open and intellectually dynamic political environment that can accommodate socioeconomic changes. <br> As a former professor of constitutional law, Obama is uniquely situated to address the importance of Chinese political reform and constitutionalism. Obama needs to stress that avoiding intellectual discussion of political issues doesn't make them go away—it only pushes such discussion into less structured arenas, and China has seen how that has turned out in the past. <br> As the first black president, Obama can also candidly and respectfully articulate America's lessons from the civil rights movement and its firm commitment to democracy, human rights, media freedom and the rule of law, which the United States believe to be fundamental to the long-term stability and prosperity of any country. <br> Some might argue that discussion of China's much needed political reform would set Obama and Xi on course for a contentious relationship. In fact, it would help remind Xi that he can seize this moment to stand on the right side of history and turn back from the conservative path before he squanders the reform-minded political capital he has built over his first productive months in office. <br> Instead of focusing solely on specific issues like national security and economic rebalancing, Obama and Xi have an opportunity to set the stage for a deeper, more candid and more cooperative Sino-American relationship by crafting a shared vision of the future and drawing on the common needs and desires of the Chinese and American people. <br> Only by talking about their domestic challenges and areas for improvement will they realize the potential fruits to be born out of such cooperation. And only when such unity of purpose is realized will China and America be able to work together and tackle the economic and security issues of our time. 
 The controversies generated a big stir in Washington and the news media, though it is unclear that the general public is quite as interested as the politicians and the reporters. Nonetheless, at least for now, both stories have produced intense congressional investigations to find out who was responsible for any wrongdoing. <br> While investigations to determine whether laws were violated and who should be blamed are important, it is also crucial that Congress use these moments as opportunities to reform processes and laws that are broken. <br> Having a tax system that retains strong legitimacy among the public is essential. After all, taxes are the lifeblood of our federal government, providing the funds necessary to keep citizens safe and to provide needed services lacking in the private sphere. The more the government can do to create the impression that the system is working well, the more confidence we can gain in our government on the right and the left. <br> In the past, tax scandals have led to substantive reform. There have been moments when stories about wrongdoing within the IRS have led to restructuring and reorganization that improved the basic operations of the agency. Following the revelation that bribery, kickbacks and other kinds of corruption had been taking place in the IRS during the 1940s, Congress imposed stricter civil service rules to govern bureaucrats in the agency. <br> In response to news about cases in which tax agents were aggressive in their treatment of taxpayers in the mid-1990s, Congress passed a reform in 1998 that reorganized the IRS, creating an oversight board, and imposed much stronger restraints on IRS agents to make them more accountable to citizens. <br> New revelations about how individuals and organizations abuse the tax code through exemptions, deductions and loopholes has also produced reform. During the mid-1980s, there were a slew of stories about how wealthy Americans escaped their tax obligations while average Americans were required to pay more. <br> Reformers used the concept, born in the 1960s, of "tax expenditures" to explain the multiple ways in which the federal government provided social welfare by freeing people of their tax obligations. <br> Through a bipartisan effort in 1986, Congress reformed the tax code by cleaning out many of the loopholes that existed. President Ronald Reagan called the legislation a "sweeping victory for fairness." While the reforms came undone gradually over the next decade, the legislation did mark a shining example of how both parties could, under the right conditions, join forces to support the general interest over private interests. <br> Finally, there have been moments when scandals involving the government treatment of political organizations has produced reform, not simply media frenzies. In 1907, in the wake of stories revealing the sordid connection between money and politics, Congress passed a law that prohibited corporations and banks from contributing to the campaigns of federal officials. <br> In 2002, Congress passed another reform that made it illegal for business and unions to use their funds for "electioneering" purposes within 30 days of a primary or 60 days before an election. The McCain-Feingold reform targeted campaign ads that aired on television. All of this came totally undone with the Citizens United decision. <br> Tax reform is always extraordinarily difficult to accomplish, even though the issue draws support from liberals who seek to create a fairer system and conservatives who want a more efficient system. The problem is that the status quo is powerful. <br> There had been talk about tax reform during the budget battles as a method for raising revenue that did not require raising tax rates. But those discussions faded. There are vested interests, both organizations with financial power and bureaucrats, who don't want anything to change. Scandals such as these have the potential to change the equation, by creating political pressure on elected officials to do something to the system upon which they thrive. <br> What kinds of reforms are needed now? The first area that needs reform is our tax code. Without question, the reforms of 1986 have come undone. Legislators have filled the code with too many loopholes, exemptions and deductions that cost the government huge amounts of revenue and are unfair. The time has come for another round of reform, going through the tax code to eliminate provisions that allow individuals and organizations to escape their obligations. <br> The second reform has to do with the exemption for political organizations that is at the heart of the ongoing story. The good news is that the revelations have already triggered discussions about why these organizations receive exemptions and what purpose this loophole serves. It is worth considering whether the loophole should be changed. <br> Third, we need to make sure the IRS is adequately staffed with competent and skilled employees in local offices who won't allow these kinds of mistakes to be repeated. Finally, this scandal should trigger tighter rules against targeting particular kinds of organizations. <br> Whether reform follows the scandal will depend on how much heat legislators feel from the stories coming out of Washington and whether there are leaders in the House and Senate willing to take a stand for those issues. If they do, they will take the most constructive possible actions. 
 The media verdict is in: Barack Obama is cursed. <br> Less than four months after taking the oath of office for the second time, he is seen as falling prey to some mysterious witchcraft that casts a fatal spell on re-elected presidents. <br> One can almost conjure up a bubbling cauldron of black smoke with a wand-wielding wizard laughing diabolically. <br> Now, there's no question that second-term presidents often stumble or run out of gas. But the punditry suggests a one-size-fits-all scenario that isn't borne out by history. What's more, there's a rush-to-judgment air to some of these pronouncements that implies his second term is on the verge of failure, with more than 3 1/2 years to go. <br> Republicans, meanwhile, have been making Obama's life miserable, defeating a modest measure on background checks for guns, slow-walking immigration legislation and refusing to vote for some Cabinet nominees. <br> Oh, and the economy isn't doing that well either. <br> But does that amount to a jinxed second term, or the same kind of partisan standoff that has marked Obama's years in office? A look back at recent second-termers makes clear that every set of problems is inherently different. <br> As for Obama, smart journalists are careful not to be definitive when writing their trend pieces. Politico says the recent setbacks "have left the president feeling deeply frustrated, even angry — and eager to find a way to recapture the offensive." The Washington Post piece describes his mounting woes as "diversions working against a president who is keenly aware of how little time he has left to achieve big things." <br> This brings us to the thing that every second-term president since FDR has indeed faced: a ticking clock. <br> A re-elected commander-in-chief is a lame duck whose ability to reward and punish inevitably diminishes as his departure date approaches. And that, rather than any sinister voodoo, may be Obama's biggest problem as he tries to dig his way out of this ditch. 
 President Barack Obama is having a tough time. <br> Now the president faces another challenge with immigration reform. A bipartisan group in the Senate, led by Charles Schumer and Marco Rubio, has put together an immigration bill that includes a path to legalization for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in this country and tighter border control. It appears that the bill has a chance to pass the Senate. <br> But will House Republicans subvert the deal? <br> Immediately after Congress killed the gun control legislation, critics started pointing to the president's hesitation to twist arms and lean on members of Congress. In what has become a familiar refrain, Obama was no Lyndon Johnson. <br> Yet Obama's trouble has much more to do with the way government works than his skill, or lack thereof, at working Capitol Hill. <br> Too much emphasis is placed on the small picture of what he does or does not do in his personal interactions with Congress, or his "messaging." Actually, it's not so much him as the government. <br> Obama understood this when he ran for president in 2008. He spoke constantly about the need to reform the government and the way in which our political processes hamper the ability of Congress and the president to take action. <br> Yet once he was president, Obama put the issue of reform on the back burner. He decided to focus on the policy challenges ahead, generally dismissing the idea that there was much chance for him to make government work better. In certain cases, such as with the use of private money and political action committees, he decided to join the game and make sure it worked to his advantage. <br> The decision has come at a cost. <br> Throughout his presidency, Obama has struggled as private interest groups have continued to exert enormous power over the legislative process. When Obama pushed his health care law through Congress, he felt the need to abandon hugely important measures that would have imposed tough cost controls. He did so to placate powerful interest groups in the medical industry who were dead set against these measures. <br> The financial regulations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in response to the financial crisis of 2008, have struggled as interest groups continually undercut their effectiveness by persuading legislators to avoid any kind of tough implementation. <br> This time around, gun rights organizations -- from giants such as the National Rifle Association to smaller operations -- conducted a massive and unyielding blitz on legislators. Even bipartisan support, a rarity in Washington, was not enough for the bill to succeed. <br> Other issues, such as tax reform to close loopholes, have simply been abandoned because they seem so impossible given the power of lobbyists and campaign contributors who lurk on K Street. The power of money makes it extremely difficult for politicians to go out on a limb. <br> The filibuster has also remained the chronic obstacle for Obama. With the constant threat of the filibuster against almost any piece of legislation, almost every bill requires a 60-vote super majority in the Senate. This makes it hard to build a coalition behind legislation and in most cases allows small factions within a party to subvert presidential proposals. Presidents usually need bipartisan support to get 60 votes, and bipartisanship is almost impossible nowadays. <br> This was certainly a challenge for gun rights, and could make immigration reform vulnerable in the final stages of debate. As with money and politics, the filibuster has also made other issues altogether impossible to consider even. <br> When the immigration bill reaches the House of Representatives, the trouble will begin. House members in gerrymandered districts care about the party activists who tend to be the loudest voices. The situation to avoid is one where the Republican caucus drifts further to the right even while counterparts in the Senate and public opinion support immigration reform. <br> The truth is we will never know what was possible in that transformative moment that followed Obama's historic election or after his re-election in 2012. But without reforming our government, the path to gridlock is not going to disappear. 
 Several sitting governors might be contenders in the 2016 presidential election. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have given indications they are thinking of running, although they haven't announced candidacies at this very early stage of the contest. <br> Both are serious candidates. Christie, a Republican, has demonstrated his ability to handle the heat from the national spotlight and he has positioned himself as a tough, northeastern budget cutter who can appeal to moderate Republican voters and disaffected Democrats. <br> Cuomo, a Democrat, has earned considerable praise for advancing a brand of pragmatic liberalism by championing issues like same-sex marriage, progressive tax reform and rent regulation while also fighting to reduce spending, taking on public unions and reforming government. <br> Each governor faces some difficult challenges within their states. Over the past week, Cuomo has watched as a massive political scandal has unfolded within the Democratic Party, centering on an official who tried to bribe his way into becoming a candidate in the mayoral election of New York. The stories coming out of the state suggest the culture of Albany might not have become as different as Cuomo has claimed. <br> Christie also finds himself in the national spotlight after the release of a shocking video showing the coach of the Rutgers University basketball team berating and hitting his players. The revelation that Rutgers officials knew about this behavior for at least a year has led to calls for the resignation of top administrators at the state-funded university, including the president. Thus far, Christie has backed away from calls to have the president removed, though he has used some tough rhetoric in his comments about the coach. <br> Other governors are thinking of running as well. For example, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, is gaining some national attention by pushing his state to the left on a number of key issues, including a proposal to repeal the death penalty and the recent passage of sweeping gun control legislation. Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, has long been considered a potential superstar for the GOP. O'Malley has received some flak from the right for his fiscal record in the state, while Jindal's falling approval ratings in Louisiana could pose a big problem for a national run. <br> The governors need to handle these challenges with extreme caution and each must make sure that his record as the chief executive of his state, always one of the biggest selling points for governors running for president, does not turn into an albatross that brings his candidacy down. <br> In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis ran for the presidency against Vice President George H.W. Bush. Dukakis started his campaign by touting his role in bringing about the "Massachusetts Miracle," the revitalization of the state's economy around high-tech industries along Route 128. <br> At first, Republicans were worried that his record could allow the governor to position himself as a new kind of Democrat, someone who understood how to nurture economic growth and whose economic policies offered a model of smart government investment as an attractive alternative to Reagan's free-market economics. <br> But Massachusetts, miracle and all, soon turned into a nightmare for the Democrat. Vice President Bush and his aggressive campaign staff found ways to rip apart his record in the state and they used it to defeat him. Some of the attacks were vicious, taking aspects of the state government's record and twisting them into devastating campaign arguments. <br> The Republicans, for instance, pointed to a law that Dukakis had vetoed as governor that would have required teachers to conduct the Pledge of Allegiance with their class. Dukakis had been told in no uncertain terms that such a law would be unconstitutional. The Republicans highlighted the veto to paint Dukakis as a liberal of the far left variety. <br> Bush adviser Lee Atwater also put together a television ad focusing on a program that a Republican governor who served before Dukakis had put into place that granted prisoners short furloughs. One prisoner, Willie Horton, had killed a man and raped his fiancé during his time out of prison. The famous ad, playing on racial fears, focused on the program, presenting it as one of Dukakis' legacies. <br> Vice President Bush targeted the pollution in Boston Harbor to question Dukakis' environmental record. "Two-hundred years ago tea was spilled in the Boston Harbor in the name of liberty. If tea were spilled in the Boston Harbor today," Bush said, "it would dissolve in the residue of my opponent's neglect and delay." <br> As economic conditions changed, Bush pointed to evidence that the state was starting to falter. Combined with reports of a looming budget deficit, Republicans used the data to challenge the very centerpiece of Dukakis' campaign. <br> In 2012, another man who served as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney, suffered from similar challenges. Romney's signature legislation as governor, the health care program of Massachusetts, undercut some of his ability to challenge President Obama on this issue. His record of increased "fees" in the state and problems with the economy also became fodder for the primaries and general election. <br> The condition and record of their states almost always becomes the prism through which presidential candidates who are sitting governors are evaluated. Sometimes governors use this to their advantage, like Bill Clinton in 1992 and George W. Bush in 2000. But often the states can turn into a problem. <br> Cuomo, O'Malley, Jindal and Christie, who still have to decide whether to run, need to handle these challenges with extreme caution. If they don't, they might find themselves suffering the fate of Dukakis, who, like them, was once touted as the most exciting voice of his party. 
 President Obama has characterized his 2014 budget, released Wednesday, not as his ideal vision for how much the federal government ought to tax and spend, but rather as a compromise that aims to respect the priorities of Democrats and Republicans. He has insisted that congressional Republicans see the policy options laid out in his budget as a package deal, not as a menu of policy options from which to choose. <br> And so the president's budget includes reductions in the planned growth of Social Security and Medicare spending, to appeal to conservative advocates of spending restraint, and a number of tax increases, the bulk of which are designed to affect high-earners, a high priority of the president's congressional allies. <br> House Speaker John Boehner and other leading congressional Republicans have made their opposition to further tax increases clear. But President Obama's tax proposals nevertheless merit close attention, as they tell us a great deal about his priorities. <br> One of the ways the Obama administration seeks to raise revenue is to have the federal government adopt chained CPI, a method of calculating consumer price inflation that factors in the fact that consumers tend to substitute some goods for others in response to rising or falling prices. <br> Chained CPI has been discussed primarily with regards to its impact on federal outlays, and particularly Social Security spending, as it is expected to lead to somewhat lower cost-of-living adjustments that in turn will lead to somewhat lower Social Security benefit levels. <br> Yet chained CPI will also lead tax brackets to be adjusted more slowly than they are under the federal government's current inflation index. This adjustment is expected to yield roughly $100 billion in new tax revenues over the next decade. <br> In addition, the president has revived two proposals that figured prominently in his 2013 budget: the so-called "Buffett Rule," which requires that households earning $1 million or more pay a minimum of 30% of their income in federal taxes, after allowing for charitable giving, and a limit on tax deductions for the highest-earning 2% of households. <br> The downside of the Buffett Rule, according to Viard, is that it might discourage capital investment and increase reliance on debt financing. The limit on tax deductions, meanwhile, reduces the value of itemized deductions to the 28% tax rate for households. <br> That is, even as a household enters the 33, 35, and 39.6% tax brackets, the value of its itemized deductions will remain at the lower 28% rate. The president's budget also calls for substantial increases in federal taxes on tobacco products, which are designed to fund new preschool efforts. <br> President Obama's tax proposals illustrate how difficult it will be to raise tax revenues by a substantial amount while shielding middle-income households from tax increases. Chained CPI and tax increases on tobacco products will almost certainly affect some number of households earning less than $250,000 a year, yet the Obama administration also intends to increase the size of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which will tend to mitigate any harmful effect. <br> If President Obama hopes to build momentum for a substantial revenue increase, he would be well advised to cheer on the efforts of Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, and Rep. Dave Camp, R-Michigan, the chairmen of the tax-writing committees of the Senate and House respectively, as both are working toward a larger, more ambitious tax overhaul. <br> Despite these substantially lower rates, revenues would increase, in part because capital income would be subject to the same tax rates as ordinary income. Of course, measures like the Buffett Rule would increase effective taxes on capital income even further. If Baucus and Camp converge around something like the Modified Zero Plan, the tax debate might finally break out of its current grim stalemate. 
 It's not often that a presidential to-do list (and legacy-making agenda) comes down to a couple of key weeks, but here we are: gun control, immigration reform and the budget -- all front and center, right now. <br> It's an odd time in Washington. The president has been dating Republicans, dining with senators with whom he has hardly spoken in the past. Republicans seem to believe they can actually work with the president -- on immigration, at least. <br> As for guns, well, some in the GOP seem ready to filibuster an issue -- background checks -- that has overwhelming public support. "That won't do us a lot of good," moans one GOP pollster. "We will look like the party taking extremist positions." <br> Remember how well that worked with women in the last election? <br> And then there's the budget. The president decided to propose one this year that starts with compromise -- containing some of the entitlement reforms that he worked out with House Speaker John Boehner before the "grand bargain" became the grand failure. A couple of senior GOP pollsters tell me that they can't quite figure out why the president did something guaranteed to annoy his liberal base. <br> How about this for an answer: When all else fails, it doesn't hurt to look credible. Better yet, it doesn't hurt actually to be credible. <br> After all, what's the downside? "When you are dealing with dysfunction, the best you can do is demonstrate that you are reasonable," one senior administration official tells me. "The alternative would be throwing fuel on the flames. We need to be serious here." <br> It's about time. On all fronts. <br> Understand this: This is a not a strategy hatched by a bunch of Pollyannas at the White House. It is borne of necessity, and bred with an understanding of a public that has just about had it with Washington. The president played tough in the sequester fight -- calling for new revenues -- and he lost. Now he's not overplaying his hand; he's playing it smart. <br> On immigration, he's hanging back, letting congressional negotiators take the lead. He was called out for doing that on health care reform -- rightly so, allowing top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to manage an unpopular process and produce an unpopular bill. But this time, it's different: Republicans understand that immigration reform has now become a gateway issue. 'It's now a basic way for us to find our way back into national politics," one GOP pollster tells me. "It doesn't solve our problem with Latino voters by itself, but it helps." <br> Even polls show that a majority of GOP voters -- once opposed to reform -- are now on board with some version of it. The notion of a "pathway to citizenship" still stirs all kinds of fears about amnesty with the GOP base, but that's less of an issue these days: All things considered, any gain in Latino voters outweighs some shrinkage of the base. <br> It's a trickier route for the president on guns. Barack Obama didn't intend for gun control to be part of his second-term legacy; it came to be after Newtown. And this is an issue, by the way, that splits the Democratic Party more than it splits the GOP. A half-dozen Democratic Senate races in pro-gun states next year could hang in the balance. And if the Democrats lose those senators -- and can't break a GOP filibuster -- it's dangerous for them, too. <br> Not as dangerous, of course, as the GOP holding up any vote on a gun bill. That, I would argue, could have a great deal of impact on the midterm elections. Why? Because the president will continue to take the issue directly to the voters, 90% of whom agree with him on background checks. <br> It's a delicate time here in Washington. If nothing happens on guns, for instance, what about the rest of the Obama agenda? "If you can't pass a bill on guns in this environment, what can you ever do?" asks one senior administration official. "It sets the bar so high for anything, people will be demoralized." <br> The result? Retreat. Maybe some sort of immigration reform passes (it's in everyone's self-interest) but no tax reform. No serious entitlement reform. Nothing big on the agenda, just small-scale items. <br> Perfect for politicians unable to respond to crisis, much less the will of the people. 
 As the House and the Senate debated and passed budgets recently, one person was notably absent from the debate: President Barack Obama. <br> Unfortunately, the president's tardiness is reflective of his fundamental lack of seriousness when it comes to budgeting. Families and businesses have to ensure that their spending, including their debt payments, doesn't exceed their income, but the president acts as if he doesn't think that should apply to the federal government. <br> Recently, when speaking about his budget (which the White House says will be out next week, a full two months after the deadline), the president said that he didn't want "to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance." Well, perhaps he should chase a balanced budget for the sake of our economy. <br> The impact of those policies has not been pretty. <br> While it's certainly true that the president inherited a bad economy, it's important to note that he inherited it more than four years ago. What has he been doing since? <br> Let's put this in perspective. Ronald Reagan inherited a bad economy. But Reagan put in place growth-oriented economic policies such as fundamental tax reform and fewer regulations, which turned the economy around. <br> The fact is Obama's spending, tax and regulatory policies are smothering economic recovery, jobs and opportunity. <br> Yet despite the abysmal failures of the president's policies, he continues to argue for more of the same. <br> It's time to try something new: Time to balance the budget, rein in Washington's dangerous levels of spending and unleash economic growth by expanding energy production being held back by the Obama administration, such as the Keystone XL pipeline. It's time to cut excessive government red tape strangling our small businesses and to truly reform our tax code to make rates lower and fairer for all Americans. <br> We should be taking an honest look at the relationship between the president's policies and economic growth. The president's tax hikes, runaway spending and onslaught of new and burdensome regulations are preventing a real economic recovery. <br> It's time for the president to get out of the way of the American people and let our economy take off. It's time to do better than 0.8% growth. 
 Cold weather has delayed spring in Washington, but we can detect a clear warming trend in our politics. <br> To be sure, the distance between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans remains vast, executive and judicial nominations remain blocked by an unprecedented number of filibusters and major legislative accomplishments are still months away. But the ice of gridlock is starting to thaw. <br> Evidence of a healthier, more normal politics is beginning to reappear, centered in the Senate, our political institution that has declined the longest and the furthest. <br> The Judiciary Committee has reported the first major gun control legislation since 1994, though its fate is far from certain. <br> Freshman Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown have expressed similar views as have Republicans Bob Corker and Chuck Grassley on the dangers of ''too big to fail" banks. Democrat Max Baucus, Senate Finance Committee chairman, and Republican Dave Camp, House Ways and Means chairman, have accelerated their effort, started two years ago, to enact the first major tax reform legislation since 1986. <br> The atmosphere is palpably better. President Barack Obama's "charm offensive" on Capitol Hill won approval from many Republicans. <br> Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, who after meeting with the president in 2010, called him "thin- skinned" and recommended that he "take valium," praised him generously this time around for the substantive meeting on the budget and related economic issues. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who famously declared that defeating Obama was his highest priority, has this year shown much more graciousness, respect and even occasional humor. <br> Two factors are most responsible for the improvement. <br> First, it turns out that elections do have consequences. <br> Obama's decisive re-election, coupled with what amounted to a national landslide won by the Senate Democrats, has forced the Republicans into a period of reassessment and repositioning. Of course, some Republicans still believe that their party lost because its right wing views were did not come through clearly enough. <br> But most Republicans recognize that the party's combination of extremism and obstruction proved to be a losing strategy. They know the Republican brand is in deep trouble. The election results seemed to have convinced at least some of the Senate Republicans that finding areas in which to cooperate with the president is necessary. <br> But the second factor, less understood than the impact of election returns, is just as important. By the end of 2012, for many returning senators and those newly elected, dismay about the Senate has hardened into disgust and determination to change it. <br> Across the political spectrum, senators are fed up with lurching from crisis to crisis, leaders dictating straight party votes, endless filibusters and constant failure to address the nation's problems. <br> Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, compared the Senate to "the Russian Duma ... an endless series of secret conclaves .., with meetings everywhere but in the committee room or the open air of the Senate floor." <br> Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, took pride in the "zone of civility" created by the increasing number of women senators. <br> Sen. Schumer, D-New York, longingly "looked forward to the good old days when we had major legislation go through committees." <br> The shorthand for what the overwhelming number of senators want is "regular order" -- legislation that results from committee consideration, vigorous debate, the opportunity to offer amendments and hard bargaining to reach principled compromise -- and the Senate is changing as its leaders respond to the members' frustration and anger. <br> Legislating in our diverse, contentious country, with our system of separation of powers, has never been, and will never be, easy. Former Sen. Gary Hart once described the great Senate of the 1970s as "a kind of controlled madhouse." <br> The path to major legislative accomplishments is always treacherous and strewn with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. <br> Today, the partisan divide is much deeper and the political culture far more vitriolic than 20 or 30 years ago. Although senators cannot choose the era in which they serve, they can choose the way they approach their work and they can determine the way the Senate functions. <br> It doesn't take much time, or that many people, to change the Senate. Hopefully, day by day, that change is starting to happen. 
 For most Americans, the budget debate in Washington is reaching dog-whistle pitch, a tone that only partisans can hear. Which, as far as I am concerned, is a mercy. <br> Paul Ryan offered his budget on Tuesday. Let's do give him props for making the effort and all. The vast majority of his colleagues are potted plants on this front, reading talking points, sometimes banging the table and doing precious little else. But what Ryan calls a budget is what any CEO would call a firing offense. It uses some numbers and some words that appear in real budgets. But it neglects some other key elements ... like arithmetic or the truth or a greater economic purpose. <br> The Ryan budget depends entirely on unspecified tax reforms and the replacement of revenues he doesn't care for (such as those associated with Obamacare) with others he doesn't care to actually define or describe. The rigorous, widely respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities slammed the exercise, taking Ryan to task for failing to live up to his billing as the guy courageous enough to put his ideas out there. <br> It wrote, "Is it courageous to propose tax cuts but not identify a single tax expenditure to rein in? Is it courageous to target your deepest cuts on the poorest Americans, who vote in lower numbers and provide little in campaign contributions? Is it courageous to camouflage hundreds of billions in cuts for the poor and disadvantaged in broad budget categories without identifying the programmatic cuts, so that analysts, journalists, and other policymakers can't identify the specific cuts and assess their impacts?" <br> Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, we have a real sign of the End Times: Senate Democrats have actually come out with a budget for the first time since the iPad was invented. There are children in school, reading, who were born since their last budget. <br> Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray unveiled it Wednesday. Her budget is as partisan as Ryan's and offers little common ground with his on controversial issues. It calls for $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction through the end of the decade, almost $1 trillion of it from new revenues. <br> Ryan calls the divergent plans the beginning of a process. The question is where that process will lead. <br> Early next month, the president will submit the budget he was supposed to have sent to the Hill in February. There it will sit, because it too is just a negotiating ploy, an opening bid. <br> These compilations of charts and data are not budgets at all. They are just props in the Budget Follies of 2013. Not one of the long-term visions sketched out in these plans will actually be realized. There will be no serious discussion or honest debate about enacting meaningful tax reform, rethinking defense spending or remaking our entitlement system for a world in which people generally live longer and in which government resources are stretched. <br> But, frankly, these aren't even the most critical issues we should be addressing. <br> The budget is important. Cutting our deficits matters. But in a country in which corporate profits and the stock market are at record highs but in which jobs are being created far too slowly and median incomes are sagging, we have far more basic issues to grapple with. <br> The United States is like a business whose model for making revenue is failing, trying to save itself by cutting down on travel expenditures and the cost of making photocopies. Sure, we shouldn't overspend. But if we don't figure out what business we're in -- what new industries will create tomorrow's jobs, what kind of new workers we'll need, what kind of infrastructure we must have to be competitive and attract investment -- our deficit problems will seem minor compared with our social and political concerns. <br> Our most important national discussion should not be about spending but about investment. We need to recognize that some federal programs help grow the economy and weigh the return on investment we will get from these and which are essential to growing the new industries that will be the employers of tomorrow ... and will provide the growth that is the only real solution to our debt issues. <br> The Ryan budget cuts transportation spending in a country that has neglected its highways and bridges for over half a century. It doesn't plan for the infrastructure spending we will need to respond to the consequences of climate change (like hurricane relief) or anticipate the investment we could make to avoid such problems in the first place. It doesn't discuss how to expand information technology and next-generation energy infrastructure as we must. <br> Perhaps the Senate budget or the president's will be wiser about investing -- although neither is likely to think big enough about transport spending or an infrastructure bank or, better, a network of regional infrastructure finance institutions. What seems more likely, sadly, is more hollow gestures, scurrying to avoid artificial deadlines and visionless crisis management. Not one leader has emerged in Washington who is providing anything truly different that cuts to the core questions we face or rises to the true challenge of our times. <br> Which leaves us but one consolation. Washington has grown so shrill that most of this empty debate will be heard only by our dogs. Pity the dogs. 
 This, of course, is something completely different. After his re-election, the president was asked about his unusually standoffish behavior with Congress. He took offense. <br> Look at what happened with me and Speaker John Boehner, he said. "When we went out and played golf, we had a great time. But that didn't get a deal done in 2011." And just recently, a senior administration official told me, "There's this myth in Washington that somehow if we all sat down around a table, Republicans would miraculously be more willing to work with us." <br> That's ridiculous, he clearly thought. Just absurd. <br> So now the White House has decided it's not so silly after all. The president had dinner with 12 GOP senators Wednesday. The big question: Why now? <br> There are all kinds of ways to answer that, and I'll get to them in a moment. But let me first say this: Give the president some credit. It's the right thing to do, and he should have done it awhile back. He has nothing to lose, and has never had anything to lose by engaging. And if he is interested in some larger budget deal down the road, this is the only way to figure out if it is at all possible. <br> They're also seeing the president's popularity suffer: It has dropped an average of four points since mid-February. <br> Worse yet, they're seeing that Americans are starting to blame both sides for the Washington standoff. Not long ago, Republicans bore most of the blame. Not anymore. <br> The administration's strategy hasn't worked. The White House made the assumption that because it succeeded in getting new revenue during the fiscal cliff negotiations, it would be able to do so again. After all, that's what the 2012 election was about: the middle class versus tax cuts for the wealthy. The argument worked and Republicans caved on the fiscal cliff, so they would cave again. <br> Just the reverse has happened. The GOP cut a deal in January that included tax increases without commensurate spending cuts. No doubt it was a short-term tactical success for the White House, fresh off its impressive re-election. But in the long run, it could turn out to be a strategic mistake. Why? Because Republicans are now more dug in than ever on taxes -- at least without tax reform or serious entitlement cuts. <br> It's not without irony that the Democratic win on the fiscal cliff narrowed its chances to get a deal on the forced spending cuts. The deal didn't happen. And the public didn't buy the Armageddon scenario. So the once unthinkable cuts are now real, and the public isn't predicting the end of the world. <br> All of which gets us back to the White House dinner party. Having failed to secure a short-term truce, maybe the White House is finally thinking big picture. The public doesn't like the military cuts; neither do lots of Republicans, including McCain. Maybe that's the entry into a larger discussion: How can we do this without damaging our military? <br> The pieces are all there: Graham has already told CNN he would be open to increasing revenues if the administration is willing to do serious entitlement reform. Other senior Republicans have said there's a window this summer to get something done. The president is trying to protect the rest of his agenda -- immigration reform, climate change, gun control -- from falling victim to the budget wars. <br> So even if this is a cynical and calculated dinner hosted by a president in danger of losing political altitude, I'll take it. Even if the president is doing it to prove it won't work, I'll take it. It's not the Last Supper, but it is the first. 
 Among Republican insiders, Bob McDonnell, governor of Virginia, isn't considered a leading presidential contender. Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan and Rand Paul have all garnered more attention. The more interesting question has been -- until this week, at least -- why that is the case. <br> Moreover, McDonnell's 2009 campaign was in many respects an excellent template for a national GOP campaign, as it focused on job creation and energy development while largely avoiding ideological bromides. <br> Part of the reason McDonnell was able to run as jobs-centric pragmatist is that his socially conservative convictions were not in serious dispute. Indeed, Democrats in 2009 sought to highlight McDonnell's anti-abortion views, but to no avail. Just one year after Barack Obama had rallied moderate voters in Virginia's affluent northern counties, McDonnell managed to win many of them back. He aggressively courted Asian-American and Latino voters, an effort that helped blunt the growing Democratic advantage in these constituencies. One would think Republicans would be beating down McDonnell's door. <br> But recently, many conservative activists have soured on McDonnell. For much of 2012, the Virginia governor has struggled to make progress on his policy agenda. Progress in some areas, like K-12 education, has been overshadowed by inaction in others, like the privatization of Virginia's state-owned liquor stores or the all-important issue of alleviating traffic congestion. <br> Last week, however, McDonnell finally brokered a deal with the Virginia General Assembly to finance a sharp increase in new transportation spending with new taxes. This is despite the fact that McDonnell had pledged to resist any and all tax increases in his 2009 campaign. <br> Not everyone is furious about McDonnell's measure that would increase taxes. Some prominent voices, including Washington Post conservative commentator Jennifer Rubin and Washington Post columnist Robert McCartney, have praised the governor for addressing Virginia's transportation woes. One wonders whether McDonnell might somehow be able to turn a liability -- having reneged on his tax pledge -- into a strength by presenting himself as a pragmatic, bipartisan problem-solver. <br> It's a long shot, given that primaries tend to be dominated by highly ideological voters. But it might be worth a shot all the same, particularly if the Republican presidential field proves thinner than expected in 2016. 
 So let's try to recount why we are where we are. In August 2011, Washington was trying to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling -- so the US might continue to pay its bills -- when a stunt was hatched: Kick the can down the road. <br> And not only kick it down the road, but do it in a way that would eventually force Washington to do its job: Invent a punishment. <br> If the politicians failed to come up with some kind of budget deal, the blunt instrument of across-the-board cuts in every area would await. <br> Unthinkable! Untenable! <br> Until now. <br> In fact, something designed to be worse than any conceivable agreement is now completely acceptable to many. <br> And not only are these forced budget cuts considered acceptable, they're even applauded. Some Republicans figure they'll never find a way to get 5% across-the-board domestic spending cuts like this again, so go for it. And some liberal Democrats likewise say 8% cuts in military spending are better than anything we might get on our own, so go for it. <br> The result: A draconian plan designed to force the two sides to get together has now turned out to be too weak to do that. <br> And what does that tell us? More about the collapse of the political process than it does about the merits of any budget cuts. Official Washington has completely abdicated responsibility, taking its dysfunction to a new level -- which is really saying something. <br> We've learned since the election that the second-term president is feeling chipper. With re-election came the power to force Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy in the fiscal cliff negotiations, and good for him. Americans voted, and said that's what they wanted, and so it happened. Even the most sullen Republicans knew that tax fight had been lost. <br> Points on the board for the White House. <br> Now the evil "sequester" -- the forced budget cuts -- looms. And the president proposes what he calls a "balanced" approach: closing tax loopholes on the rich and budget cuts. It's something he knows Republicans will never go for. They raised taxes six weeks ago, and they're not going to do it again now. They already gave at the office. And Republicans also say, with some merit, that taxes were never meant to be a part of the discussion of across-the-board cuts. It's about spending. <br> Here's the problem: The election is over. Obama won, and he doesn't really have to keep telling us -- or showing us, via staged campaign-style events like the one Tuesday in which he used police officers as props while he opposed the forced spending cuts. <br> What we're waiting for is the plan to translate victory into effective governance. <br> Sure, there's no doubt the president has the upper hand. He's right to believe that GOP calls for austerity do not constitute a cohesive party platform. He knows that the GOP has no singular, effective leader, and that its message is unformed. And he's probably hoping that the next two years can be used effectively to further undermine the GOP and win back a Democratic majority in the House. <br> Slight problem: There's plenty of real work to be done, on the budget, on tax reform, on immigration, climate change and guns. A second-term president has a small window of opportunity. And a presidential legacy is not something that can be kicked down the road. 
 This week the president faced the American people to talk about, among other things, the budget. He said the right things. During his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, he drew a link between responsible fiscal policy and the important issues of jobs, the middle class and economic growth. He emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility. <br> He acknowledged that compromise will have to drive negotiations and that no one will see a deal come together exactly as they would choose. But when it comes to specifics, the president continues to take the easy way out, instead of using the platform that he alone has to help the country understand both what's at stake and what it will take. It's relatively easy to talk about things like scaling back tax loopholes for corporations and the well-off, asking the rich to pay more as part of Medicare, and providing fewer subsidies to drug companies. But it will take more than that. <br> Instead of just replacing or retooling the blunt sequester, we do need to find savings from defense. We also need to put Social Security on a path toward solvency and the sooner we do it the better. We should protect those who depend on the program, and running from the financial imbalances it faces does just the opposite. <br> The bottom line is deficit reduction is difficult, the president knows that, and he should start an honest dialogue with the American public about what it will take to help move the issue forward. <br> The emphasis he put on the issue this week was encouraging, but the proof will be in how he leads going forward. In recent fiscal negotiations, we have been locked in a game of you go first, no you go first between the two parties when it comes to how they would get specific on entitlement and tax reform. The risk is that both will find it too politically convenient to hide behind the easy pieces of taxing the rich and discretionary spending caps--both of which have been enacted, and neither of which are sufficient to fix the problem—instead of focusing on the real issues of entitlement and tax reform. <br> Only the president can start this honest dialogue. If he steps forward and starts putting real specifics on the table for some of the hard choices and uses his platform to explain to the country why it is so important not to duck from these issues as we work to get the economy back on track, his speech will have been a great start to a serious effort. Otherwise, it will be just a lot of empty words. 
 CNN asked for views on President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night, which was dominated by domestic issues such as the economy and need to reinvigorate the middle class, gun control, minimum wage, early education and immigration. Afterward, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida delivered the Republican response. <br> After Barack Obama's speech and Marco Rubio's rebuttal, we should have heard from Kim Peters. <br> The 47-year-old single mother, who has been more or less unemployed since the start of the Great Recession, wore fuzzy Shrek slippers as she watched the president's State of the Union address Tuesday night from the middle of an empty living room south of Atlanta. <br> You would think that in the shadow of a general election dubbed "Year of the Woman," the last thing any Republican in Washington would want to do is tick off women. <br> And while the Violence Against Women Act passed in the Senate by a healthy bipartisan majority a few hours before President Obama's State of the Union address, the fact that 22 senators -- all Republicans, all men -- voted against it should be troubling to GOP leaders. <br> And perhaps the most troubling aspect of that is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the so-called savior of the Republican Party, was one of those Republican men. <br> As exasperated appeals for an obstructionist Congress to get off its duff, the exhortations provided emotional catnip for Democrats. For the rest of us, however, they were sobering reminders of what governing liberalism has deteriorated into: content-free calls to take action for action's sake. <br> It is sometimes said of a great actor that he could hold an audience spellbound while reading a laundry list. This is essentially what President Obama tried to do on Tuesday night. As State of the Union addresses go, his was artless. It lacked inspired phrases or compelling narrative. Save for the energy he gave it at key moments, it was pedestrian. <br> It was also very important. <br> Sen. Marco Rubio was ready for his close-up, and he got it. Now you know what all the fuss is about. <br> Rubio, a rising star and possible 2016 GOP presidential hopeful, was picked to deliver the official Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union sddress. <br> The hallmark of the 2013 State of the Union address was progressive pragmatism. <br> Time and again, President Obama punctuated his proposals with the refrain: "We should be able to get that done." After his call for "bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit," he said: "We can get this done," and later, "That's what we can do together." <br> President Obama's State of the Union address predictably focused on his domestic priorities. <br> As in years past, foreign policy made up only about 15% of the speech, but even within that usual limited attention, Tuesday night's address pointed to few new directions. <br> "To report the state of the union." Within the first few seconds of President Barack Obama's address Tuesday night, he quoted the late President John F. Kennedy, who 51 years ago used those words to describe a president's annual duty. <br> As Obama spoke, citizens around the country were tapping away at keyboards, posting and sending messages -- public and private -- characterizing their own view of how the union, and its president, are faring. 
 Time and again, President Obama punctuated his proposals with the refrain: "We should be able to get that done." After his call for "bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit," he said: "We can get this done," and later, "That's what we can do together." <br> When he proposed the addition of three more urban manufacturing hubs and asked Congress "to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America," he added: "We can get that done." <br> When he described his new "Fix-It First" program and a Partnership to Rebuild America to put people to work on our most urgent infrastructure repairs and to attract private capital to the cause, he said, "Let's prove there's no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let's start right away. We can get this done." <br> In other places, such as his appeal for comprehensive immigration reform, the president exhorted the nation: "let's get it done." <br> But his repeated insistence on what we can get done bespoke a step-by-step approach to solving the nation's most critical problems, a list not of grand initiatives but of pragmatic steps to make concrete progress. <br> At the same time, he was holding a mirror to Congress, reminding them of the disgrace they bring upon themselves in the eyes of the nation and the world when they fail to get these eminently reasonable and doable things done. <br> Obama's approach to foreign policy was much in the same vein. Instead of calling for the completion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, which has been stalled for decades, he announced his intent to complete negotiations on a "Trans-Pacific partnership" with a limited number of North American and Asian nations and to "launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union." <br> He justified both initiatives in terms of creating "good-paying American jobs." The focus on the Atlantic was actually the most novel and striking of his foreign policy proposals, given the administration's widely heralded "pivot to Asia." But he chose to play down any fanfare and instead present the clear pragmatic case for expanding trade in both directions. <br> Similarly, instead of talking about his commitment to "Global Zero," a vision of a world without nuclear weapons that he committed to in his first inaugural address and his Prague speech in April 2010, he again focused on a set of smaller steps. <br> "We'll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands." He also reiterated his administration's commitment to prevent Iran from "getting a nuclear weapon," but focused on achieving a "diplomatic solution." No grand doctrines, no global visions, just a list of concrete, doable steps. <br> That is the context in which we should understand the most powerful and passionate part of his speech: His insistence that all the victims of gun violence, from Gabrielle Giffords to the children of Newtown to the moviegoers of Aurora, "deserve a vote." His point was to cut out the political grandstanding, the filibustering, the huffing and puffing and bluffing. Bring it to the floor. Stand up and be counted. Vote it up or down. <br> That is how government is supposed to work. Make a proposal. Assemble a coalition. Put it before the country's elected representatives. And vote. <br> President Obama was daring Congress, and the country, to get to work and get it done. 
 "What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick it any further. ... We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else's." <br> So said President-elect Barack Obama at a Washington Post editorial board meeting in January 2009, just days before taking his first oath of office. He was talking about the importance of dealing with the long-term deficit and debt. <br> The rhetoric hasn't met the record -- debt has exploded under Obama's watch. Reasonable people can forgive the president for expenses incurred while confronting the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression -- and, let's be honest, alternative paths of austerity have not worked that well across the Atlantic. But now is the time to get serious about reigning in our long-term debt, which now exceeds an unsustainable 70% of gross domestic product. <br> At this moment of maximum political capital, Obama is perfectly positioned to act on his original impulse in the State of the Union on Tuesday night. <br> But there is a dangerous bit of hubris sweeping the Democratic Party, which says that dealing with deficits and debt is a sucker's bet, best left to the next Republican president. <br> This would be a major mistake and a costly lost opportunity. <br> With an eye toward his legacy, Obama should follow his original instincts and put the power of presidency behind a balanced long-term plan to deal with deficits and debt -- including spending cuts, tax reform and, most importantly, entitlement reform. <br> This is the time for Obama to pull a Nixon in China. <br> Just as only a committed anti-communist such as Nixon could establish relations with communist China, Obama is perfectly positioned to do what he knows is necessary to preserve the long-term strength and solvency of the social safety net: Medicare and Social Security. <br> Formula adjustments such as these can save billions of dollars over the next 10 years, keeping these popular programs solvent. Other solutions, such as raising the Social Security payroll tax cap to more than the current income cutoff of $110,000, are worth consideration as part of a package. This is an idea that liberals love because it extends the progressivity of the tax code to the wealthiest Americans. <br> Alternatively, we could means-test Social Security to make sure it serves primarily as a safety net -- or (gasp!) raise the retirement age. When the Bowles-Simpson commission suggested raising the retirement age to 69 in 2075, it was met with howls of outrage from unions in particular. This makes no sense, especially if common-sense exemptions are made for manual labor. <br> Beltway cynics say that the bipartisan deficit and debt reduction plans that are often cited have no chance of passing Congress. When you look at the pathetic support for Bowles-Simpson when it was actually put to a vote in the House last March -- 16 Republicans and 22 Democrats supported it -- you see why cynicism is always a safe bet in Washington. <br> Of course the devil is in the details, and politicos will point out that when confronted with tough medicine to deal with deficits and debt, even alleged tea party supporters balk (hence the classic "Government Get Your Hands Off My Medicare!" sign that I saw at one 2009 rally). <br> But strengthening America to remain competitive in the 21st century will require getting our long-term debt under control along with other important but less poll-prioritized policies such as comprehensive immigration reform and a public-private infrastructure bank to fund nation-building "here at home." <br> The State of the Union is a chance for the president to put forward a balanced bipartisan solution that contrasts with radical conservatives who believe that increased tax revenues from closed tax loopholes can't be part of a big deal to bring down our debt. Wall Street lawyers will fight to protect every loophole they embedded in our tax code, but their argument doesn't begin to make sense to people on Main Street. <br> Obama will probably point out Tuesday night that economic growth is the essential X Factor to reducing long-term deficits and debt. On this point at least, he and some conservatives might agree. But dumb meat cleaver cuts such as the looming sequestration could push our economy back into recession. <br> That's why a smart balanced alternative plan is necessary. But it will require presidential leadership and putting some Democratic sacred cows on the table. <br> This doesn't just make practical sense in a divided government (a reality some Democrats seem to forget) -- it makes compelling political sense as well. By seizing the mantle of fiscal responsibility -- in contrast to fiscal conservatism -- Obama will build on his post-election bump among centrists and some independents. <br> The more Machiavellian Democrats might argue that this outreach could only serve to isolate Republicans more. Nonpartisan strategists might argue that this approach would drive a wedge between reasonable Republicans and the House radicals. <br> But the real reason for Obama to address the need to reduce long-term deficits and debt directly is because it's the right thing to do for our country -- and he is uniquely positioned to achieve it. Just as Nixon could go to China, a Southern Democrat such as Lyndon Johnson was needed to pass civil rights legislation and Bill Clinton was able to sign welfare reform after decades of Republicans talking about it, Obama can put our country on a balanced path of long-term economic growth and fiscal responsibility. <br> Bottom line: Obama has the political opportunity, but does he have the political will? We'll all find out in real time if he decides to lead on this issue or just be the latest in a long line to kick the can further down the road. 
 Phil Mickelson, aka Lefty, is thinking of leaving California and perhaps America because, according to his own reckoning, he is facing tax rates of 62% or 63%. Mickelson, probably the second-most-famous professional golfer in the world after Tiger Woods, later backed off from his initial comments about making "drastic changes." <br> It does bear noting that Mickelson is doing something to earn his $60 million. Whoever is paying him that much believes that he is worth it. Who are we, really, to argue? <br> But that is not the problem in the story. Lefty faces such seemingly inescapably high tax rates that he might just pack up his golf bags and leave home. Mitt pays so little tax that he has to ignore the law to pay a higher rate for appearance's sake. <br> How can this be? <br> The Mitt-Lefty paradox has a simple explanation: In America, we tax work. And highly. We do not tax capital or wealth much at all. Indeed, if you have wealth already, taxes are essentially optional under what I call tax Planning 101, the simple advice to buy/borrow/die. <br> In step one, you buy assets that rise in value without producing cash, such as growth stocks or real estate. In step two, you borrow to finance your lifestyle. In step three, you die, and your heirs get your assets, tax free, and with a "stepped up" basis that eliminates all capital gains. That's it. <br> Romney, with a personal fortune estimated at $250 million (his five kids have another $100 million) has figured this out. When he pays taxes, at all, he does so at the low capital gains rate. <br> Not so with Lefty. <br> It's a "poverty trap" that works just like the severe marriage penalties for the lower-income classes. But the working poor do not have the options of going to Canada, Russia or France. <br> Lefty has a point -- high tax rates create disincentives. If the rates are high enough, people react by moving. This should not surprise us: American companies have been fleeing our shores for years, in droves. Ask Mitt. <br> But this should worry us, for two reasons. <br> One, the fact that the high incomers do flee jurisdictions, or flee from the productive activity of working, is a bad thing for the U.S. <br> Two, the very risk that the rich and famous might leave, aided by the appearance that some do, holds tax reform hostage. We have struggled to raise rates at all on the rich, blocked by the mostly mythical Joe the Plumber as much as by the realities of Mickelson or the Rolling Stones. When we do finally raise rates, as we did at the fiscal cliff, we do so on the wrong rich, in the wrong way. Lefty's taxes went up, Mitt's need not. <br> The problem -- and it is the same problem as with Mitt's taxes -- is that we are taxing the wrong thing, in the wrong way. In sum, we tax work, not wealth. This is backward. <br> We should be taxing the act of spending, not the socially beneficial ones of work and savings. Then we could raise tax rates without fear of ill effects. <br> Mitt's taxes would go up, for he is surely spending more than $14 million a year, as by running for president, and we wouldn't need any special capital gains preference under a consistent spending tax. Lefty's taxes would go down to the extent he saves some of his $60 million, helping us all by working and saving. When and if Mickelson or his kids spend, we could tax him or them then. <br> And if Lefty is really insisting on both earning and spending $60 million a year? Well, I figure he can buy a lot of borscht in Russia with that. 
 Who is Grover Norquist? He's a private citizen, a conservative lobbyist, the author of the Taxpayer's Protection Pledge and president of Americans for Tax Reform. His idea of tax reform is no more tax increases ever again. And no closed loopholes unless matched by cuts in government spending. <br> Norquist says the pledge was made to the American people. But Norquist is the sole enforcer of the pledge, which he keeps in a fireproof safe in his office. No one has dared to challenge his self-appointed role as enforcer on behalf of American voters. Until this past week. <br> These declarations from Republican leaders are like political dynamite. And like well-placed dynamite, they might begin to break the logjam preventing effective leadership and legislation in Congress. <br> Norquist, of course, doesn't think so. <br> King replied that Norquist was "being a lowlife," words that caused almost an audible gasp among Republicans. You see, Norquist's pledge isn't about money; it's about loyalty. <br> Next to Mitch McConnell's pledge to defeat Obama in 2012, Grover Norquist is the man most responsible for Republican lockstep voting and gridlock in Washington. <br> That top Republicans are willing to openly defy Norquist's pledge and that any are willing to buck McConnell and Boehner are seminal events in recent American history. It means some Republican office holders are actually listening to what the voters said in the 2012 elections: Help the middle class, work together, stop the finger-pointing. <br> But McConnell and his collaborators are proceeding as if the 2012 election never happened. He and other Republican "leaders" apparently intend to extend the Republican campaign, disregarding the election and the people's mandate. They intend to push the Republican agenda that voters overwhelmingly rejected at the voting booth and in post-election polls. <br> Boehner claims that Congress received its own mandate. But Republicans lost seats in the House and the Senate that they had expected to win. Besides, as Harry Truman used to say, "The president is the only elected official who represents all the people." <br> The Peter Kings, Lindsey Grahams and Tom Coles of the Republican Party get it. There aren't enough cuts to offset $1 trillion in lost taxes from the excessive tax breaks the wealthy were given. The alternative is to harm our national security, weaken our defenses and cause some Americans to literally go without food. The Republican budget that passed the House, but not the Senate, before the election would cut food stamps as excess spending for unemployed parents. <br> Extending the lesser tax breaks for 98% of all Americans is, indeed, a first order of business. Or as Cole said, "It's the right thing to do." <br> There is money for these things. First, though, Republicans must break Norquist's insane hold on their party. More Republicans must put their country before someone else's agenda, and their Pledge of Allegiance before "The Pledge" to Norquist. 
 Fewer and fewer Republicans, thankfully. <br> Add Southern Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Lindsey Graham to the growing list, along with Reps. Peter King, Steve LaTourette and Scott Rigell. <br> Chambliss kicked off the most recent outbreak of common sense by telling a Georgia TV station, "I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge." He added, "If we do it (Norquist's) way, then we'll continue in debt." <br> On ABC's "This Week," Graham doubled down by saying, "I agree with Grover, we shouldn't raise rates, but I think Grover is wrong when it comes to we can't cap deductions and buy down debt. ... I will violate the pledge, long story short, for the good of the country, only if Democrats will do entitlement reform." <br> King agreed with Chambliss on NBC's "Meet the Press," saying, "A pledge you signed 20 years ago, 18 years ago, is for that Congress. ... For instance, if I were in Congress in 1941, I would have signed a declaration of war against Japan. I'm not going to attack Japan today. The world has changed, and the economic situation is different." <br> This post-election outbreak of pragmatism is welcome and needed. These senators and congressmen are profiles in courage for speaking out against the stranglehold that one self-appointed activist and lobbyist has had on bipartisan governing. <br> The signature item for Americans for Tax Reform is a pledge that commits signers to oppose any tax increases at all, for all time -- not just tax rate increases, but any increases in tax revenue. <br> This distinction makes a real difference in the current deficit and debt deal negotiations. Going back to the Bowles-Simpson Commission, the obvious common ground for negotiations has been for Democrats to compromise on spending cuts and entitlement reform and Republicans to compromise on increased tax revenue. This can be done -- as the Bowles-Simpson Commission demonstrated -- by potentially even lowering some tax rates but closing loopholes to raise revenue. This is what's known as a win-win. <br> The biggest stumbling block for tea party conservatives has been Norquist, who says any new revenue violates the pledge and promises to invite a primary challenge to any member of Congress who puts revenues on the table. Given the number of safe seats carved up in the rigged system of redistricting, a primary challenge from the wings is what most members of Congress fear most. The result is gridlock: an inability to reason together and make a long-term deal for the good of the country. <br> It is an ironic problem in some ways: Tea party congressmen rose to power on a promise to deal with deficits and debt. Putting anti-tax absolutism ahead of that goal may play well with special interests, but it undercuts the ability to govern in the national interest. That's what is at stake. <br> These pronouncements from Chambliss, Graham Co. put them in the company of party leaders like John Boehner, John McCain and Jeb Bush, who have publicly dismissed the pledge as a distraction from the business of governing. <br> This pragmatic statement in the summer of 2012 helped break the fever of groupthink. Norquist called Bush's comments an "insult." <br> Comparing Coburn to Hiss -- a convicted traitor and KGB agent -- was both ugly and revealing: This is what happens when partisan politics starts to look like a cult. <br> The real fault line for Republicans is between Norquist-style radicals and Ronald Reagan, who presided over the bipartisan 1986 tax simplification deal by closing loopholes to raise revenues. As Reagan said at the time, "We're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share." In addition, the "sainted" Reagan oversaw some 11 tax increases during his administration. To be sure, his overall goal was to slash rates and simplify the system -- but he was not nearly as absolutist as his activist acolytes who do not have to deal with actually governing. <br> Norquist's hold on the GOP has been loosening as congressional leaders recognize that this extreme, unelected activist is helping to hold a balanced bipartisan deal hostage. The election is over. The time for hatred, ideological obstruction and overheated rhetoric has passed. Reasonable Republicans and Democrats need to take on their respective special interests to get a long-term deficit and debt deal done. <br> It's foolish to be afraid of Norquist. The only pledge members of Congress should take is the Pledge of Allegiance. 
 In the horse race coverage of political campaigns, we sometimes forget that elections are just exciting preambles to the main event -- governing. <br> Now's the time when the parties return to Washington and try to implement the people's wishes as expressed in the election. And unlike 2008 and 2010, neither party is likely to misinterpret the results as an ideological mandate. <br> This is a good thing. But it's also a mistake to read the election results as simply an endorsement of the status quo. Despite the fact that Americans returned President Barack Obama to office while keeping Democrats in control of the Senate and Republicans in charge of the House, this was no seal of approval on the political division we've seen in Washington for four years. Instead, it was a decided endorsement for balanced bipartisan plans. <br> Obama won the election with a 16-point margin among moderate voters. Republican Senate candidates who represented the ideological extremes of their party -- Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin, specifically -- were soundly rejected even in states that voted for Mitt Romney by double digits. Polarizing voices such as Rep. Allen West were also retired from Congress. The hate and hyper-partisanship that has disfigured our civic debates in recent years was decisively defeated in this election. <br> The broad outlines of a balanced bipartisan plan are well-known -- cut spending, change entitlements and raise revenue. That's the ground defined by the Bowles-Simpson commission, the Gang of Six and the Obama-Boehner grand bargain. <br> In all cases, the problem came to selling such a plan to right-wing Republicans, who refused to consider any revenue increases, as well as left-wing Democrats who don't want to see long-term changes to entitlements. That's why congressional members of the Bowles-Simpson commission such as Paul Ryan on the right and Jan Schakowsky on the left refused to support its recommendations, even while conservative and liberal senators such as Republican Tom Coburn and Democrat Dick Durbin did. <br> But according to the Main Street survey, 54% of Republicans, 50% of Democrats and 49% of swing voters support the Bowles-Simpson plan -- while just 10% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats oppose it. <br> And despite the strenuous opposition by adherents to Grover Norquist's no-tax pledge, 35% of Republicans say they would be more likely to vote for a member of Congress who broke the anti-tax pledge to find a long-term solution to the deficit and debt mess -- while 31% said it would make them less likely. <br> The opportunity and obligation of Obama's second term will be to depolarize the nation and the Congress. That will require leading on issues such as entitlements as part of a balanced plan to deal with the deficit and the debt. <br> It seems possible that with the right bipartisan style and substance, the president can also achieve comprehensive immigration reform and some aspects of his jobs bill, such as a public-private infrastructure bank. <br> Republicans now realize that they cannot antagonize the Hispanic community and win elections. President George W. Bush tried to pass immigration reform co-sponsored by John McCain and Ted Kennedy in the Senate but was defeated by an outcry from the right in 2007. Obama could achieve that elusive goal by picking up that legislation again. <br> Also, the president's jobs bill, composed almost entirely of policies that had bipartisan support in the past, was dead on arrival in the last Congress for reasons little more profound than election-year hyper-partisanship. But with the economy slowly improving and the election over, there is little reason to prolong the painful charade. <br> Ideas such as a public-private infrastructure bank could boost employment while increasing the structural strength of our nation, a clear win-win while the Northeast rebuilds from Superstorm Sandy. Best of all, it can be done with comparatively little cost to taxpayers by simply leveraging government investment with private funds, benefiting private employers rather than creating new bureaucracy. <br> There will be stubborn hyper-partisans who refuse to work in good faith with the other party, pretending that their unwillingness to compromise is political courage. They are the problem in our politics, angry conformists who put partisanship ahead of patriotism and problem-solving. <br> We have urgent problems to confront in our country. We have the capacity to solve them, and we know the broad path forward. What's been missing is the political courage to stand up to the extremes in our own parties and reach across the aisle. That is specifically what voters want to see in our next Congress -- a spirit of constructive compromise and principled problem-solving that defines the common ground on any given issue and then builds on it. <br> This is the time to redeem the promise Obama passionately articulated on Election Night: "We are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and forever will be, the United States of America." 
 When Washington gets back to work, the situation will be difficult. President Obama won a sound re-election victory, doing very well in the Electoral College and winning the popular vote by more than 3 million votes. He trounced Mitt Romney in almost all the battleground states and he will return with a larger and more energized Senate majority. <br> Yet President Obama likely understands that elections don't remake the political system. The parties remain as polarized as ever, and the political process will be as difficult as it has been since the first day he took office. Republicans retained control of the House, where they can make it hard for the president to move his agenda forward and can place immense pressure on him to curtail spending. <br> While Democrats control the Senate, with 54 votes, Republicans control the tools of the Senate minority -- namely the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass any major piece of legislation. Exit polls showed that the public is not satisfied with the status quo, many voters opposed the idea of an activist government to solve problems, and President Obama struggled with some key constituencies, including older and suburban voters. <br> In general, second-term presidents, even those with landslide victories, have trouble with Congress (think of FDR after 1936), and President Obama must spend much of his political capital making sure that existing programs, like the Affordable Health Care Act, are implemented effectively. <br> Despite these challenges, political incentives for both parties could inspire legislative breakthroughs in several areas. President Obama does not have to remain content with the domestic agenda he has already achieved. He could succeed like Ronald Reagan in 1986, when Congress passed, with bipartisan support, a major tax reform bill that closed many loopholes and lowered rates. <br> In the short-term, deficit reduction offers the greatest potential for such a breakthrough. The process toward reducing the deficit will begin even if the president and Congress take no action. <br> The 2011 Deficit Control Act will require $100 billion in spending cuts starting in January. At the same time, the current income tax rates are set to expire on December 31, along with the Social Security payroll tax holiday. By making progress on a "grand bargain" over long-term deficit reduction, one that both parties could live with, President Obama could steal this issue away from the Republicans, positioning himself as the guardian of fiscal discipline just as President Clinton was able to do in the 1990s. <br> There are also policy issues that grow directly out of the election results. President Obama has been promising Latino voters that he would reform immigration policies. He has pledged to renew his push to pass the DREAM Act, a bill that has been stopped by Republicans, which would help almost 1.7 million young immigrants become citizens. <br> The huge Latino vote for the president, which played a critical role in battleground states like Colorado and Nevada, should bolster his resolve to take on this issue. And many Republicans will understand that the GOP's hard-line anti-immigration elements have become extraordinarily costly to the party. For more than a decade, those in the Republican Party who favor liberalized immigration policies, including George W. Bush and much of the business community, have been stymied by their colleagues. <br> Finally, there are long-term issues that might be on the radar as a result of crisis. The storms that have devastated sections of the country have given climate change more attention than ever. The impact on wealthier suburban communities has created more political support for addressing an issue that was largely ignored throughout the 2012 campaign. By producing legislation that deals with this grave problem, such as limits on domestic oil and gas drilling and more investments in solar and wind energy, each party could make progress toward solidifying support in key middle-class constituencies that are still struggling to dig out from the storms. <br> Nothing is inevitable in American politics. The history of Washington is filled with moments when something should have happened but didn't. Politics has a way of sidetracking progress on almost any issue. Talk about compromise that often follows an election is cheap, frequently leading to nothing. <br> The potential for some important breakthroughs, however, is there. The election's outcome gives both parties reasons to make deals with each other so they can each make gains with voters in 2014 and 2016. Sometimes, when politics and policy converge, progress in Washington is possible. 
 The lame duck Congress should depart town quietly and leave the governing to President Obama and the newly elected Congress in January. <br> Tuesday's election results did nothing to change two critical issues. First, the soon-to-be-outgoing 112th Congress has been among the least productive in history. Second, Washington must address the so-called fiscal cliff of expiring tax cuts and hefty automatic across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration. <br> This lame-duck Congress should behave responsibly, play to its strength and once again kick the can down the road. It should try to avoid economic calamity that might result from total inaction, but the heavy lifting must be left to the newly elected 113th Congress. Very little good comes out of post-election lame duck sessions; rather, there are a lot of opportunities for legislative mischief. <br> The current fiscal cliff is quite dangerous. The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts -- those that benefit the well-off and less-well-off -- expire when the ball drops in Times Square. A whole passel of small-bore tax breaks for everything from rum tax rebates for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to NASCAR track expensing -- the so-called extenders package -- awaits extension. At the same time, a "patch" to prevent millions from facing the alternative minimum tax and a routinely extended increase in the Medicare doctor payments will expire. Additionally, there will probably be a need for more disaster relief funding as well as federal flood insurance program borrowing to approve. <br> On January 2, the across-the-board cuts of sequestration kick in, lopping off more than $100 billion in fiscal year 2013 spending in defense and non-defense budgets. After that, the debt ceiling looms. <br> To get everything done, more will have to happen in the last two months of 2012 than was substantively done in the entire 112th Congress to date. And that is precisely why the current members of Congress shouldn't even try. <br> Many in the House and Senate will not be coming back in the 113th Congress. Eighty-six lawmakers are retiring, lost or ran for a different office. They should not be the ones setting policy for future years. <br> For this reason, Congress and the president need to step back and identify the minimum amount of small changes that will enable the nation to retreat from the fiscal cliff and give new policymakers breathing room to enact meaningful changes in 2013. <br> The minimum action would be not simply turning off sequestration but delivering a down payment in one- to two-year savings that delays the onset of cuts rather than some pie in the sky 10-year number that will never happen. <br> The president and Congress should wrestle over taxes, with short-term extensions that set the stage for comprehensive tax reform in the 113th Congress. To that end, alternative minimum tax should be "patched," but with budget offsets. Finally, if FEMA or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers needs extra resources to conduct disaster relief and recovery, that should be considered. <br> What the lame duck Congress should absolutely not be doing is enacting legislation that inhibits future spending and tax reform. <br> This is not the time for a new legislative agenda and parochial projects and programs like a new trillion-dollar farm bill (extend expiring provisions with offsets and repeal permanent agriculture law dating from the 1940s and '50s instead). <br> Lawmakers' shopping lists go on and on, with wasteful changes to water project financing scheduled for a hearing in November and a massive tariff relief package with 2,000 earmarks for parochial interests championed by the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means Committees, and other lawmaker priorities circulating as possible business to address in the lame duck. <br> We don't know what will be stuffed in the last legislative trains leaving the Capitol Hill station. Policymakers had their legislative chances in the past 22 months. Now we need a legislative freeze for the next two months to concentrate on getting the fiscal cliff resolved. <br> Let's give the next Congress a chance to make real progress. 
 Both parties have received an electoral politics wake-up call, courtesy of a diversifying America. <br> President Obama won re-election thanks in part to a 52-percentage-point spread among Latino voters, the nation's fastest-growing electorate, according to election eve polling. <br> In the America coming over the horizon, it is practically impossible to overcome such a number and win the race for president. <br> Even in Florida, with its large, Republican-leaning Cuban population, the Latino Decisions poll found that Latinos overall favored the president 58% to 40%. <br> While these trends worked to Democrats' advantage on the ground on Tuesday, that's not entirely good news: A demographically challenged Republican Party is bad for America. <br> As a nation, we are at our best when both parties work together to address difficult policy issues. And, in the case of immigration -- an issue of great concern to Latinos -- a bipartisan roadmap is good politics and great policy. <br> Bringing the country together around a common-sense immigration process is not a bridge too far. In fact, while partisan politics dominated the national debate, faith, law enforcement and business leaders have worked with immigrant leaders across the political spectrum to forge a new consensus on immigrants and America. <br> Post-election talk will focus on the president's mandate. Immigration is different from other issues because the mandate for reform is clear, and it's not only because of his vote margin among Latinos. <br> "Immigration is the most important thing to focus on if you're concerned about America as an economic power. It's not only good policy to have more immigrants to the United States ... (and) a path forward for those people who are here; it's also good politics." <br> When it comes to crafting a 21st century immigration process, Bibles, badges and business are ready to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reach a consensus. <br> Americans are ready for a just immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect. Our leaders in Washington -- of both parties -- can and must deliver. <br> As we saw Tuesday, their electability may depend on it. 
 Finally, the results are in, and contributors to CNN Opinion weigh in on what they mean: <br> Julian Zelizer: Challenges of second term will be immense <br> President Barack Obama comes away with a victory, but it won't allow him to rest easy. He pulled off the Electoral College votes that he needed, securing wins in states that Republicans once thought to be secure and preserving Democratic strength in other areas. <br> Mitt Romney failed to carry most of the key battleground states that were essential to his victory. The Republican failure to appeal to key constituencies, such as Latinos, has proven to be more costly with each election. <br> But the challenges of Obama's second term will be immense. Polls show that the electorate is unhappy. The House will remain under the control of Republicans, and Romney ran a competitive race. This is not what any incumbent hopes for, especially with a Washington that is so gridlocked. Presidents want a commanding victory, hoping for another 1936, 1964 or 1984. <br> Obama will quickly need to find areas of possible compromise on issues such as deficit reduction and immigration reform, where Republicans may see an incentive to negotiate. This is what Ronald Reagan did with tax reform in 1986. <br> Such breakthroughs have the potential to steal some of the thunder from the GOP, even if they anger members of the president's own party, allowing him to enjoy some policy victories that will strengthen his historical legacy. <br> Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and the new book "Governing America." <br> Paul Begala: Obama overcomes the odds <br> It is hard in the moment to find the proper perspective for President Barack Obama's re-election. Political strategists like me fall back on the strategic and the tactical: This ad worked, that debate performance soared, that state's get-out-the-vote effort failed. Such analysis is inadequate to the task. <br> Obama's 2012 re-election was infinitely more difficult than his first historic election. With a stagnant economy, a bitterly determined and zealous opposition, and the risk of sagging enthusiasm among his true believers, the odds against the president were nearly insurmountable. The economy alone would have sunk nearly any other politician. But Obama has always beaten the odds. <br> The president kept his party united and avoided a primary challenge, Job One for any incumbent. He assembled a remarkable team, from the high command in Chicago to the farms of Iowa and the factories of Ohio. He even reached out to his golden-tongued predecessor and a raspy-voiced rocker: Elvis and the Boss. His funny, feisty, fiery vice president was an underrated asset. And so was first lady who never stooped to the level of the critics and awes all of us who struggle to raise good kids in tough times. <br> The Republicans have a lot of soul-searching to do. But for now, let me congratulate our president and his brilliant team for a victory that was as hard-fought as it is well-deserved. <br> Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, is senior adviser to Priorities USA Action, the biggest super PAC favoring President Barack Obama's re-election. Begala was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. <br> Anne-Marie Slaughter: Good news for rest of world <br> Obama's re-election was good news for the world. And judging by the congratulations and jubilation coming in on my Twitter feed from all over the globe, the world knows it. Aziz, my Moroccan hairdresser, told me Wednesday morning that his entire family (proud new members of Morocco's emerging middle class) was as jubilant as his neighbors in New Jersey. <br> The most important implication of Obama's victory, at least in the short term, is continuity. Given the fragility of the global economy and the number of ongoing crises and conflicts, this is no time for a sharp change in America's course. <br> Change is coming in China, Japan and undoubtedly a number of European countries as part of the fallout from the euro crisis; governments are new or in transition across the Middle East and North Africa; speculation continues about the health of Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Erdogan. A steady hand at the helm in the White House will be more important than ever over the next four years. <br> Equally important, a newly elected Obama will be in a position to do a number of things that the world badly needs. <br> First is to get serious about the U.S. approach to climate change. The combination of his re-election, the devastation inflicted by Hurricane Sandy and the dawning awareness among even very resistant Americans that weather patterns really are matching climate scientists' predictions, and the possibility of raising much needed revenue from a carbon tax or cap-and-trade schemes all augur well for serious federal legislation at last. <br> Next is immigration reform, which was on Obama's 2008 agenda but now must come to a head. Republicans staring at U.S. demographic changes over the coming decades, changes that were already visible in this election, would be suicidal to block it. <br> Finally, the president will return to his global zero agenda, working decisively to put the world onto a clear path toward a future without nuclear weapons. <br> Countless additional issues, crises and conflicts await the president and his new foreign policy team. But for today, Obama's campaign slogan has actually won the day -- forward. <br> William Bennett: Four more years of the status quo <br> The American people have chosen, and they chose, rather than change, four more years of the status quo -- Barack Obama as president, a Democrat-controlled Senate and a Republican-led House. <br> The result is surprising. Many, including me, thought the country was tired of the last four years of partisan gridlock, economic malaise and mounting debt and would pitch back to the right. <br> That did not happen. However, fewer Americans supported the president this election than in 2008. According to the latest tallies, Mitt Romney was behind in Florida, and lost Ohio, Virginia and Colorado by fewer than 400,000 votes for the four states combined.  <br> But a narrow loss is still a loss, and the results tell us several things. First, it is incredibly difficult to beat an incumbent, especially after a brutal and costly primary fight. Second, it appears that Obama's negative advertisement blitzkrieg over the summer defined Romney in a way he could not overcome. Third, if the economy was the key issue in the election, which the exit polls indicate, then clearly voters blame Republicans and George W. Bush for the state of the economy more than Obama. <br> But perhaps the biggest takeaway from this election is the state of American culture. A majority of Americans reaffirmed Obamacare, Obama's foreign policy, high unemployment, bigger government and more dependency on government services. There is an alternative, but people must learn what it is. <br> For this we can point only to the education system and character-forming institutions. So while Republicans must broaden their coalition to include minorities and young adults, which they can do with future leaders such as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, it is more important and consequential that they fight to take back schools, families, communities and the culture because those institutions cross all demographic barriers. <br> Republicans can no longer be the party of only business and individualism. Otherwise, they will be grasping for a shrinking, narrowing electorate and coming up short again in future elections. <br> William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of "The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood." He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush. <br> Donna Brazile: A mandate to move America forward <br> Does President Barack Obama's impressive victory give him a "mandate?" That he won re-election itself seems to be a sufficient answer; how he won doesn't matter. Those who say, "yes, but..." are carping. An election victory is what you make of it. <br> Overwhelming results occur only once in a presidency: FDR's second term, LBJ in '64, Reagan's second term. One could argue that Obama '08 was such a landslide. Landslides require three elements: an extraordinarily charismatic leader on one side, a non-consequential candidate on the other and historical circumstances that overshadow the common political dialogue. <br> Besides, the last three "mandates" -- or "landslides" -- happened before the advent of the Internet, the unfettering of corporate money in politics and the removal of the Fairness Doctrine, which required a measure of real balance in reporting. <br> What constitutes a "mandate," anyway? By any standard, Obama's re-election was not only convincing, but also significant. This election was a test of the truth as no other -- keeping track of Mitt Romney's misleading statements was head-spinning. It was also a test of patience and investment -- hallmarks of Obama's first four years. There will be much more to say about the nature of the president's leadership, his style, in the weeks to come. <br> After all, Obama's campaign went negative, too. But a look at how Obama won tells us he indeed has a mandate. Obama won Latinos, blacks, the young, and especially single women (unmarried, divorced or widowed) by overwhelming, historic proportions. He lost the white male vote, but not by a degree greater than one should have expected, given the candidates and the electorate. <br> His mandate, then, is to continue -- to "forward" -- the policies that support diversity, inclusiveness, empowerment, choice and opportunity (we are the "land of opportunity"). His mandate is also to find a way through the right-wing noise machine and reach the middle-aged and elderly whites who see an economy shifting and a country growing in unfamiliar ways and are scared they will be left behind or lose out. <br> Obama indeed has a mandate: to move our country once again toward that "more perfect union." That is the best way forward. <br> Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of "Cooking With Grease." She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000. <br> Bob Greene: As one campaign ends, others begin </strong> <br> And so begins campaign 2016. <br> Those words are intended not as satire or as whimsy. The purported finish line represented by Tuesday's re-election of Barack Obama is someone else's starting line. The phrase "permanent campaign" has evolved from winking hyperbole to irrefutable reality. Presidents come and presidents go; the never-ending campaign endures. <br> The demise of the long 2012 presidential race is replaced by the instantaneous birth of new ambitions in each major party, even as the candidate who came up short (Mitt Romney, this year) is beginning to grieve for what might have been. <br> There are people and entities -- partisan websites all along the ideological continuum, news-oriented television channels, radio talk shows, campaign strategists-for-hire, political consultants, pollsters -- whose livelihoods depend on the presidential contest that never ceases. To them, Election Day itself is little more than a signpost along the road and certainly no reason to slow down. <br> The public may have grown weary of this year's politics, but the professionals are already picking sides and players for the next one. Governing can be dreary; campaigning always promises exhilaration. Legislators doing their jobs seldom hear the cheers that are the soundtrack of the campaign trail. And there will forever be an audience; people, whatever their protestations, like to watch a fight. <br> So, even as the newspapers Wednesday morning, with their banner headlines, declare that President Obama is heading back to the White House for the next four years, other men and women are hearing a proclamation that, although literally silent, is to their ears as distinct and loud as a blaring announcement over the public-address system in some vast sports stadium: <br> "Will the runners please report to the starting blocks. . . ." <br> Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Obama should thank Latinos <br> If President Barack Obama wants to thank one group of voters for holding the line -- especially in the critical battleground states of Colorado, Florida and Nevada -- he should say "muchas gracias." <br> According to exit polls, Obama won an impressive 71% of the Latino vote. In many states, the percentage was higher. <br> Romney couldn't keep up. Having joked at a campaign fund-raiser that he should have been born Latino so he'd have a smoother path to the White House, even that kind of transformation might not have been enough to have done the trick. <br> Now Latinos have a marker. And Latino activists were quick to make clear how they expect to have it paid. They want Obama to do what he didn't try very hard to do in his first term: deliver immigration reform. <br> Eliseo Medina, a Latino union leader, cut to the chase. "As we congratulate President Obama for winning re-election," Medina said in a statement, "we also send him and the new Congress a message: 'We expect passage of comprehensive immigration reform next year. We don't want promises; we don't want debates. We expect action.' " <br> Good luck with that. <br> The presidency didn't change hands in this election. Nor was there any change in the political reality that has kept immigration reform on the back burner all these years. <br> Latinos need to keep the heat on and demand what they have coming. <br> LZ Granderson: Romney, in the end, had no anchor <br> Some Republicans are going to try to sum up President Barack Obama's re-election this way: black people. Mitt Romney lost because all of the black people voted for Obama. I heard it in 2008 and heard it repeatedly this year. I sum up the president's victory this way: Michigan, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. <br> Just as I felt Al Gore was undone by not winning his home state of Tennessee, Romney was defeated because the man didn't win three states to which he is supposedly connected. Not the state where he was born and raised. Not the state where he's lived and served as governor. Not even the state where he kicked off his campaign. <br> There is something to be said about a politician who has no place to call his political home, no core constituency. And when you think about it, Romney being defeated in this fashion makes all the sense in the world. With his cynically shifting positions, he'd been accused of having no moral anchor, and he lost every state that was supposed to be his physical anchor. Adding insult to injury, his running mate, Paul Ryan, didn't win his home state either. <br> Republicans of the bitter variety -- the kind who like to deface Obama campaign signs with racial epithets -- can say Romney lost because of blacks. But the truth is, when the voters who know you best don't support you, it should come as no surprise when strangers don't either. <br> Maria Cardona: GOP must turn attention to Latinos <br> America makes history yet again by re-electing the first African-American president after a hard-fought and often nasty campaign. So much will be debated from here on out about what happened to Mitt Romney, where he went wrong, and where he goes from here. Now will be a time for soul-searching for my Republican friends about the direction of their party and how they talk to women, young people and minorities. Especially Latinos. And for President Barack Obama, it will be a time to map a path to deliver on the promises he made to the coalition of voters who gave him a second term. Especially Latinos. <br> I have written many times about the power of the Latino vote and how it would be decisive in this election. And the question I would always get is: Will they come out to vote? They did. In fact, I suspect that the Latino demographic will be central in many Republican conversations about where they are going wrong as a party. <br> It is not as though Mitt Romney didn't know the challenge that faced him with Latinos: Some very smart people in his own party continually said that the GOP and Romney needed to take a different path when it came to Latinos. Romney showed no interest in doing so, and it seemed clear that he had written off the Latino vote early on. Instead, this would have been the time and place to employ his shape-shifting ways to woo them. <br> The numbers don't lie. Neither do demographics. The country has changed, and Republicans had better change with it or risk being in the minority for their own lack of minorities. <br> Obama, for his part, will need to work with and for the coalition of Latinos, women, young people and African-Americans that held together for him. He must deliver on the issues they care about, which are the issues he has talked about throughout the campaign and that will be a big part of his second term. <br> He will also need to find willing Republicans interested in working with him to solve the nation's greatest problems, among them, the need for comprehensive immigration reform. This moment of necessary GOP introspection and attention from Obama to solve the immigration issue may present the perfect storm needed to actually get something done. 
 Finding our footing in the new Arab world <br> Obviously this election was about the economy first, second and third. But the world intrudes. Our election campaign did not keep terrorists from killing American diplomats in Benghazi, nor did it stop the violence in Syria. When all the ballots are counted and the parks swept clean of the debris from election night rallies, President Obama will have to figure out what is happening in this very volatile part of the world and what, if anything, we do about it. <br> We intervened in Libya to get rid of an awful dictator, but so far we have not intervened to get rid of the awful dictator in Syria. As the violence escalates and the Syrian president wreaks ever more death and destruction on his people, will we be drawn into an intervention there too? After 9/11 we went to war with Iraq over a mistaken fear of nuclear weapons. Is Iran developing nuclear weapons or are we wrong to be concerned? Will we go to war with Iran too? <br> Preventing the fiscal cliff <br> While President Obama has been crisscrossing the country looking for votes, the people left behind in Washington have been wringing their hands over the dangers posed to the fragile economic recovery by the severe combination of spending cuts and tax increases that are due to kick in on New Year's Eve. This so-called "fiscal cliff" was the result of politicians kicking the can down the road a few years ago. Will they do it again? Or will there be a grand bargain that actually puts the country on the path to smaller deficits? <br> There are plenty of plans on the shelf waiting, including those put together by the big deficit reduction commissions such as Simpson/Bowles and Rivlin/Domenici. And there's the plan almost put together by President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner. The problem isn't the lack of plans; it's the lack of courage. The outlines of any deal have been clear for some time now: Democrats have to give up some spending, especially on entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, and Republicans have to allow for some new taxes. Each side has to hold it's nose if a deal is to be done. Which brings me to the next issue facing President Obama: <br> Dealing with the Republicans <br> Obama must figure out how to deal with a Republican Party in Congress that has become dysfunctional. In 2010 a relatively small group of voters calling themselves the Tea Party launched a surprise attack on the leadership of the Republican Party. Under President Bush, the Republican Party had gotten a little too fond of world domination and a little too dismissive of the party's traditional concern for fiscal discipline. Frankly, they deserved a trip to the woodshed. <br> But once their new majority in the House of Representatives was won, the leadership overreacted, and rather than forge a majority that could perhaps make some progress, they cowered before their new members like frightened children. The result? No progress. If the Republican leadership continues to tremble before their most radical members, the entire party risks a rightward slide off the face of the earth. And President Obama will have to figure out how to work around them. <br> Cutting a deal on tax reform <br> It's been 25 years since a Democratic Congress and President Reagan cleaned out the tax code and achieved lower rates and fewer loopholes. But tax loopholes grow back like dandelions in the garden. The current tax code is a mess. It rewards some sectors of the economy and not others. It distorts business decision-making and it makes sure that those who don't need it have plenty of tax deductions. It's time to weed that garden once again. <br> Amazingly enough in this era of extreme polarization, both presidential candidates have expressed support for lowering the corporate tax rate to 25% and simplifying the corporate side of the code. It's possible that they could agree on the easy stuff on the corporate side and move to the harder stuff on the individual side. Tax reform will be part and parcel of a long-term deficit deal. Tax cuts for the oil and gas industry are a favorite target of President Obama, and they are just one example of many industry-specific tax breaks that might get swept up in a big tax deal. <br> Climate change <br> And finally I come to the issue that was not mentioned in the presidential campaign: climate change. The Democrats' one attempt at climate change legislation died in 2010, a victim of the recession and also of the fear that confronting it would increase energy costs on a public still reeling from the meltdown. The failure of the climate bill began, however, the issue's long, slow slide into oblivion; a slide so complete that both candidates spent their debates falling all over themselves to prove they were friends of coal. <br> But coal is the big culprit in climate change, a fact conveniently ignored when the votes of Ohio are at stake. How fitting then, that in the very last week of the campaign, a gigantic hurricane would destroy the Jersey shore and close down lower Manhattan. The seas are rising after all; there is something happening after all. What, President Obama, are you going to do about it? The options are plentiful, from taxing carbon to pouring more money into green energy. They just haven't been very palatable. Maybe hurricane Sandy can change that. 
 Mitt Romney spent weeks battling Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich for the Republican presidential nomination, and he faced blistering attacks from Rick Perry and other GOP rivals along the way. And now he is paying the price. <br> Romney's failure to surpass Barack Obama this summer stems in no small part from his reluctance to make any bold moves on policy, and this reluctance is a direct product of the beating he's taken from conservative critics for much of the last year. <br> The basic rap on Romney -- who represented, let us not forget, the conservative alternative to John McCain during the 2008 race for the Republican presidential nomination -- was that he wasn't sufficiently conservative. To reassure conservative primary voters, Romney embraced positions on a wide range of issues, from immigration to taxes, that are more popular among reliable Republicans than among swing voters. <br> As the political analyst Sean Trende, author of "The Lost Majority," has argued, the central dilemma facing the Romney campaign is that it has essentially secured all of the low-to-medium hanging fruit for a Republican presidential candidate by condemning Obama's economic record. Yet this hasn't been enough to give Romney a lead over the incumbent president. <br> Indeed, there is at least some reason to believe that the Romney campaign is losing ground. This strongly suggests that the GOP needs a more positive message with crossover appeal. The trouble, of course, is that Romney's efforts to inoculate himself against charges of squishiness have made it very difficult for him to pivot to the center. <br> What might a more daring Romney campaign have looked like? <br> A more populist Romney campaign would spend time and money bashing the big banks. While Romney has called for repealing the Dodd-Frank Act, the centerpiece of Obama's fitful efforts to reform Wall Street, he hasn't provided much in the way of detail regarding how he'd address the too-big-to-fail problem. Given that anger against taxpayer-funded bank bailouts helped fuel the rise of the tea party movement, and in turn the Republican congressional victories of 2010, this constitutes a serious strategic mistake. <br> Sebastian Mallaby of the Council of Foreign Relations, a market-friendly centrist perhaps best known for his exhaustive history of the hedge fund industry, "More Money Than God," has even argued that investors might welcome a bank break-up. <br> Leaving aside the substantive merits of this and other proposals designed to curb the too-big-to-fail phenomenon, this is an accessible idea that would help Romney play against type. So it has come as a disappointment to many on the right that the Romney campaign has been dismissive of the idea. <br> This could reflect a conviction on the part of the candidate that Wall Street is not in need of a radical overhaul. Or, more cynically, the Romney campaign might be reluctant to alienate influential Republican donors in the financial services industry. Yet the decision to tread lightly on financial malfeasance might cost Romney the election. <br> Romney's evolution on tax policy is also telling. <br> The idea was that this would be a prelude to a larger tax code overhaul. But when Romney feared that Rick Santorum might defeat him in Michigan's crucial Republican primary, he released a far more ambitious, and far more expensive, tax cut proposal that is being criticized as pie-in-the-sky. <br> Rather than campaign on a deep tax cut that would benefit high-earners, the Romney campaign might have instead championed a revenue-neutral tax reform that cut taxes dramatically on families with children while effectively raising them on childless high-earners. <br> In choosing to embrace the Journal's view, Romney may have sacrificed an opportunity to connect with cash-strapped middle class parents, including many independents and Democrats. <br> Right now, the Romney campaign seems to believe that it can defeat Obama by running a conventional and cautious campaign. But as the weeks go by and the president's lead remains frozen in place, this is starting to look like a bad bet. 
 Taxmaggedon is coming. Unless President Obama and Congress act, Americans will be hit with what would be in total dollars the largest tax increase in history in little more than five months. <br> Income taxes will go up on every single taxpaying American. The Alternative Minimum Tax, designed decades ago to ensure that 154 wealthy Americans paid income taxes, would hit an additional 27 million Americans with a $92 billion tax hike. The death tax will come roaring back -- hitting farmers, ranches and businesses. <br> And there's a clear difference in vision for how to address this fiscal crisis. <br> I and other Republicans have proposed stopping these tax increases for all Americans. As the top Republican on the Finance Committee, I've put forward a proposal to prevent the largest tax hike in history from taking place and to pave the way for comprehensive tax reform in 2013. <br> If Congress doesn't agree with President Obama's plan to raise taxes on one of the most productive segments of our economy by allowing the top two marginal tax rates to expire, Washington Democrats' default position appears to be to let everyone's income tax rates skyrocket. <br> Taxmageddon is real, and the uncertainty caused by it is contributing to the lackluster economic recovery. That's not a Republican talking point; that's based on comments from job creators across the country. <br> It's based on people like Brent Gines from Sandy, Utah, who said that "Any increase in expenses or outlay always has a big decrease on our ability to do business." <br> The only solution is to provide job creators and working families the certainty they need by extending all the current tax rates for another year, as we did in 2010, and then work next year to fundamentally reform our broken, costly tax code. <br> The president and his allies need to listen to what Americans are saying. They need the certainty of an extension of current tax rates for another year, and they need Congress to move forward together to reform the tax code to spur economic growth and job creation. <br> What does fundamental tax reform look like? <br> It means lower marginal income tax rates that would lead to more hiring, greater capital formation, better returns on our investments and a stronger economy. <br> A simpler tax code means that many of the resources currently poured into complying with the tax laws could be put to other uses -- investing in new businesses, paying for our children's education, and giving money to charitable causes, to name a few. <br> This is not a time for political games, divisiveness and vilifying business and industry. Businesses continue to sit on the sidelines because they don't know what Washington is about to throw at them. The uncertainty is holding them back, and it's stifling our economy. <br> The president and his liberal allies in the Senate need to stop holding America's economy hostage in order to get what they want -- which is higher taxes that would hit small businesses and the workers they hire. <br> Let's extend current tax rates for a year to give job creators and working families some certainty, then roll up our sleeves and pass meaningful tax reform to ensure America remains the leader we know it to be. 
 Earlier this week, President Barack Obama proposed to extend the Bush-era income tax cuts, which expire at the end of this year, for one year for people with income below $250,000. People with higher income would continue to receive all of the benefits of lower taxes on their first $250,000 of income, but the tax rate they face on income above that amount would rise. <br> One might wonder why we need more tax cuts, given that the Congressional Budget Office just released a study showing that tax burdens as a share of income for almost all households were the lowest in 2009 that they have been in decades and given that we face a long-term deficit problem that will require more revenues over time. <br> The answer, of course, is that taxes are slated to rise at the end of this year, an increase that if allowed in full, along with scheduled spending cuts that came out of the debt limit budget deal in 2011, would hurt an already weakly recovering economy in the short-term and possibly push it back into recession, if not counteracted. The president's proposal would substantially reduce the extent to which taxes are slated to rise. <br> The president's unwillingness to keep Bush-era tax rates for households with the highest income has been criticized on grounds that it will hurt job-creation efforts and in particular small businesses. These criticisms can be overstated, however. <br> First, in our current economy, with significant number of unemployed workers, job creation will depend much more on creating an economic stimulus -- that is, by cutting tax levels and by boosting spending by federal, state and local governments and by the private sector -- than a slightly lower marginal tax rate. <br> Second, the net tax rate businesses actually pay on new investment and new hires, not the tax rate listed in the tax law, is what should drive business choices. The "effective tax rate" takes into account that small businesses can generally write off all of their investment as a deduction in the year the investment is made. This is sometimes called section 179 expensing. <br> This provision reduces the effective tax rate on new investment financed by the business owner to zero. Yes, zero, because any tax on future investment returns will simply pay the government back for the cost of the deduction. This is true no matter what the tax bracket is for the taxpayer. <br> Indeed, if they can finance the investment with tax deductible debt payments, small businesses will face an effective tax rate that is actually negative. <br> Likewise, the calculus of hiring a new worker should take into account the fact that wage payments are deductible for businesses. Hence, if the law imposes a higher statutory tax rate on higher incomes, while it will raise the tax that has to be paid on the proceeds from new investment and new hiring, it also will raise the value of the deductions that most small businesses can take from the new investment and new hiring, and in a way that exactly balances out. <br> Third, much of the income for small businesses comes in the form of capital gains, which would continue to face a much lower rate than ordinary income. <br> Fourth, the vast majority, 97%, of people who receive most of their income from business sources are not in the top two tax brackets. Small businesses are essentially used sometimes as a "poster child" by those who wish to avoid higher taxes on other income at high income levels. <br> Still, while the president's proposal recognizes the need to avoid running straight off the fiscal cliff next January, it could be improved. <br> First, it does not do enough to promote economic growth in the near term. The economy would still be facing tax increases (due to the end of the temporary payroll tax cut) and government spending cuts (due to the budget deal). <br> In an economy that is struggling to reduce unemployment, these restrictive measures will not help. European countries have seen the failure of austerity policies and the effects would have the same impact here too. <br> Rather, the economy needs a bigger stimulus, with a bigger bang for the buck. This could take the form of payroll tax cuts, infrastructure investments and federal aid to states and localities, which have had to cut back on jobs and education and other forms of spending. <br> Second, the president's proposal prolongs highly partisan debates about the Bush tax cuts and which should be extended and for how long. <br> A better way to stimulate the economy and move the broader debate forward would be to let all of the Bush tax cuts expire as scheduled and be considered as part of a broader tax reform and medium-term deficit reduction effort, and institute instead an explicitly temporary cut, again a payroll tax cut comes to mind. <br> Regardless of the fate of the president's proposal, policy makers need to address the weakly recovering economy and build toward a sustainable long-term tax and fiscal solution. 
 Welcome back to work, Congress. Hope you enjoyed your fourth full week off this year. Now find a way to work together to help get America back to work. <br> Experts all say not to expect any constructive action from Congress until after the election. There is a reason that cynicism passes for wisdom in Washington. But with economic clouds from overseas depressing our own recovery, there is an obligation to act now. And, in fact, there is a handful of bipartisan bills that could help get the U.S. economy moving again if they were enacted. <br> These are not Democrat or Republican ideas -- they are simply good ideas. And unlike bipartisan pork barrel bills, they cost taxpayers comparatively little to enact. <br> Let's take a look at three proposals with bipartisan support that could pass this summer if given a chance. <br> Public-Private Infrastructure Bank <br> It would create a public-private bank to seed investment in America's aging infrastructure, improving our resilience and competitiveness over the long term while spurring the economy in the near term. <br> "In a time of budgetary crisis, the American Infrastructure Bank pays for projects with private money now sitting on the sidelines," attests Michael Likosky, director of NYU's Center on Law Public Finance. "Every country uses private capital to build projects except for the United States. We are an island." <br> "We are poised for a new era of prosperity if we could gain consensus on the fact that our infrastructure needs to be rebuilt," agrees John Hofmeister, the former CEO of Shell Oil. "It was designed for a time in the past when our country had a different population." <br> President Obama has backed this bipartisan infrastructure bank bill as more feasible than a version his administration pushed earlier. "President Obama is the biggest proponent of public-private partnerships to hold office to date," argues Likosky. "The Infrastructure Bank is a rare case of a popular bipartisan idea, born in the Beltway, that has been adopted by governors and mayors." It is trickle-down policy-making. It's also smart policy-making that business and labor, Republicans and Democrats, should all be able to agree on. <br> The Start-Up 2.0 bill -- co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Jerry Moran as well as Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Chris Coons -- would allow Ph.D. or master's graduates in science, technology, engineering and math to receive green cards to work in the U.S., while also lifting the per-country cap on skilled worker visas. <br> In addition, it would create new tax incentives for investments in start-up companies and reduce taxes for businesses in the start-up phase. It's precisely the kind of smart incentive that is key to expanding the American dream, while keeping the United States a magnet for the best and the brightest from around the world. <br> Small Business Assistance <br> The Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act of 2012 -- backed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and pushed by Sen. Chuck Schumer, both Democrats -- is expected to be brought up for a vote this month. <br> It deserves bipartisan support because it builds squarely on a traditionally Republican idea: Use tax incentives to spur job creation, investment and expansion. Specifically, the bill would offer a 10% tax credit for any new hiring or raises this year as well as allow the complete write-off of new capital investments like machinery or equipment consistent with expansion. <br> Much like the forgotten American middle class, small businesses are the backbone of America, and they receive far less government attention than big business, despite the fact that they actually employ more people. There is a competing House bill which would double the tax credit -- and therefore, the cost -- of the bill, but which would also apply to hedge funds and the like. The differences can be bridged, the common ground defined and then built upon. But the focus should be on helping the people on Main Street rather than on Wall Street right now -- objectively, they need the help more. <br> These are all relatively modest measures. (We centrists always try to balance idealism with realism.) Unfortunately, the larger opportunities for broad tax reform or a grand bargain on long-term deficits and debt are unlikely to come until after the election -- and there's no rational reason to expect that the hyperpartisan politics will end then. But that is no reason not to take action on specific targeted bills with bipartisan support right now. <br> The enemies of action include lobbyists who want to keep special treatment for their respective industries embedded in the current tax code, or unions that oppose immigration reform for high-skilled foreign workers. Big ideas with bipartisan support like lowering the corporate tax rate can't get traction for these reasons. <br> Most poisonously, there are extreme partisans in both parties who want to stop progress before the election for fear that the other party might get some credit. Republicans don't want Obama to get visible wins on the economy. And some Democrats are concerned that passing bipartisan bills now will make it harder for the president to run against an obstructionist Republican House of Representatives. "The American people are held hostage to the selfish political interests of partisans on both sides," says Hofmeister, the former Shell chief executive. <br> There is an old joke among congressmen that every bill is a jobs bill, because it is your job on the line. These three bipartisan bills present a win-win on the jobs front -- an opportunity to do well by doing good. Every member of Congress should feel urgency to prove that they can in fact work together on the economy, or face the anti-incumbent wrath of all voters. <br> The political courage that is needed comes from looking out for the national interest instead of being driven by special interests. Governing is not a zero-sum game and just as a rising tide lifts all boats, a growing economy is good for everyone. After all, we Americans are all ultimately in the same boat. 
 Tuesday is tax day, and the only thing more frustrating than paying taxes is Washington's refusal to fix the tax code. <br> Aside from entitlements, no policy debate highlights the dysfunctions of American politics more than taxes. Instead of viewing the tax code as a way to raise revenue and enable government to perform its essential functions, politicians on both sides of the aisle use the tax code -- and the debate about taxes -- as tools to keep themselves in power and to reward their friends and interest groups who put them there. <br> First, liberals like to argue that taxing the rich will solve our debt and deficit issues. They ignore one major problem. There simply are not enough rich people to tax to make a difference. <br> Even taking every last penny from every individual making more than $10 million per year would only reduce the nation's deficit by 12% and the debt by 2%. There's simply not enough wealth in the community of the rich to erase this country's problems by waving some magic tax wand. <br> Fortunately, the Senate voted down the Buffett Rule Monday night. Yet the Senate once again wasted America's time to make a political point. <br> Republicans, on the other hand, have desecrated the limited-government legacies of Reagan, Goldwater, and our founders by embarking on spending orgies with borrowed money -- a form of deferred taxation and financial repression -- while hiding beyond false pledges of tax purity that have made tax reduction and simplification much more difficult to achieve. <br> For instance, some Republican tax lobbyists, such as Americans for Tax Reform's Grover Norquist, say eliminating any credit or deduction -- what economists call "tax expenditures" or "spending the code" -- is a tax increase. For instance, when I tried to eliminate a tax earmark for Hollywood movie producers in President Obama's stimulus bill, Norquist alleged that I was trying to raise taxes. <br> In other words, Norquist would demand that Republicans and conservatives walk away from a deal that was $9,000,000,000,000 (that's $9 trillion) in budget cuts and $.01 (one cent) in new revenue. That's pure stupidity and, fortunately, no one serving in Congress agrees with him. I know all the major negotiators on the Republican side and, regardless of what their public statements suggest, not a single one would automatically walk away from a deficit reduction deal that included revenue. <br> Congress has not tackled fundamental tax reform in more than 25 years. In 1986, President Reagan signed a comprehensive tax reform plan that closed loopholes, lowered rates, simplified the code, and sustained what was then the longest economic expansion in peacetime since World War II. Reagan called the tax reform act "the best anti-poverty bill, the best pro-family measure and the best job-creation program ever to come out of the Congress of the United States." <br> Using Reagan's approach would be a win-win for taxpayers. President Obama's own deficit reduction commission, on which I served -- the Simpson-Bowles commission -- followed this template of lowering tax rates and broadening the base by getting rid of spending in the code. The commission recommended lowering individual rates to 8, 14, 23% and corporate rates to 26%. I would push rates even lower, but the commission report, which was supported by conservatives and liberals, showed that it is possible to lower rates, stimulate growth, generate additional revenue and reduce the deficit. <br> Congress has done bold tax reform in the past. It can and must do so again if we are going to survive in the 21st century. <br> <em> 
 Last week we learned that Barack and Michelle Obama's effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5%. They had adjusted gross income of $789,674. We also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than President Obama's secretary, who had about $95,000 of income. <br> Ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. In a true progressive rate system, Obama would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. <br> We also know that Mitt and Ann Romney have a projected effective tax rate of 15% for 2011. They have requested an extension so we don't have their actual returns. Their household income was just shy of $21 million. In a true progressive tax system, the Romneys would never pay a lower tax rate than the Obamas. <br> We do not have a progressive tax system. The notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long. <br> First, not all income is taxed the same. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. That rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the Bush tax cuts. <br> Most of the Romneys' income comes from stock ownership. Stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system. Income from stock is taxed at a flat 15% rate. <br> Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate. Of that minority, very few benefit the way the Romneys do. <br> An analysis of IRS statistics show that for households up to $200,000, no more than about 5% of their income is eligible for the flat 15% rate. Those households combined represent well more than 90% of American households. <br> The Simpson-Bowles commission included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same. While some would say that is a radical step, it is precisely what we did in 1986. <br> Second, not all deductions are treated the same. Two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction. So, as a result, most Americans do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code. <br> In addition, under a progressive tax system, the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed. That is referred to as your marginal tax rate. <br> The more income you have, the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction. <br> For example, if your marginal tax rate is 35%, then for every dollar you spend, you save 35 cents. If your marginal tax rate is 15%, then for every dollar you spend, you save only 15 cents. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes. <br> Third, all of this is supposed to be a secret. <br> The only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it -- either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor Warren Buffett. The IRS statistics do a great job of masking this information because the real problem lies within the top 1% of taxpayers, and the data are not presented in a way that isolates that group. <br> Congress decides to enact a tax law, and the president signs the bill. While presidents voluntarily release their tax returns, members of Congress do not. The first step toward real tax reform would be for every member of Congress to release his or her tax return. We can see which tax provisions benefit them, and we can compare their effective tax rates with our own. <br> Achieving meaningful tax reform will require very few steps. <br> First, tax all forms of income at the same rate. Second, repeal the progressive tax system and enact a flat tax. If a flat tax is good enough for Mitt and Ann Romney, it should be good enough for the rest of us. <br> Most flat tax proponents, however, want a flat tax, but they want to exempt income from stock completely. That would mean Mitt and Ann Romney's already low 15% effective tax rate would be cut even further. That would be wrong-headed tax reform. <br> Finally, most deductions should be eliminated. Most taxpayers do not itemize, so this change would only affect about one-third of taxpayers -- and their accountants and tax lawyers. <br> Whenever Congress enacts a deduction, it creates winners and losers. That must stop. To be sure, every special interest group will oppose even the hint of this suggestion. But we outnumber them. <br> I don't think it's fair that the richest Americans pay taxes at a lower rate than most taxpayers and neither should you. <br> <em> 
 It turns out that Richard Nixon was a hippie. <br> Here's Tricky Dick's wisdom on taxation, always worth dusting off this time of year: <br> "We shall never make taxation popular, but we can make taxation fair." <br> See -- he's talking about "fairness" -- and we all now know that's code for social justice straight out of Saul Alinsky. And it was especially socialistic for him to invoke the concept back in a time when the top tax rate was 70%. <br> Meanwhile, back in reality circa 2012, we are having a typically overheated election-year debate about taxes -- and both teams in Washington have a point. <br> Republicans this side of Ronald Reagan finally found a way to out-promise Democrats. After decades spent griping that the New Deal's electoral power came from liberal's limitless ability to promise public goodies, conservatives have realized that they can tap into American's anti-tax impulse by promising to lower taxes all the time, regardless of whether our nation is at war or running a long-term deficit. Liberals have always had a hard time appreciating that the American Revolution was founded in part on a tax revolt. <br> But historic perspective is the enemy of partisan ideologues, and on the flip-side, conservatives who idealize the past conveniently ignore that tax rates at the heart of the American Century were almost double what they are today. That was an outrage; by comparison, today's debates are about rounding errors. <br> Essentially, we are debating whether the top tax rate should go back to where it was during the Bill Clinton presidency -- 39.6%, up from the Bush tax cut level of 35%. And this would apply only to households making more than $250,000 a year. <br> I happen to think using that threshold is a mistake. A family making 250k with two earners doesn't deserve to be lumped in with the super-rich at the top tax rate. At the same time, someone such as Mitt Romney, who makes $56,000 a day off passive income from investments, shouldn't be taxed at just 14%. <br> Obama has a real weakness in this year's debate, however. Read through his play-to-the-base budget, and you'll see the term "fairness" advanced over and over again. Fairness is a noble goal and contributes to societal stability in the long-run. But the real argument for raising taxes is directly related to balancing budgets and reducing long-term deficits and debt. And that argument is rooted in rhetoric about the "shared sacrifice" needed to restore national greatness. After all, the world's largest debtor nation cannot remain the world's sole superpower for long. <br> Obama's fairness rhetoric bypasses that rational argument in favor of something fluffier -- namely, closing the growing gap between rich and poor via the tax code. This might excite the liberal Democratic base, but it also serves to confirm negative stereotypes about wealth redistribution and the left that alienates independents and swing voters. <br> On balance, I think policy arguments about moving the top rate to people making more than a million dollars a year makes good sense. <br> Republicans will balk out of deference to philosophy and big campaign contributors, but even 52% of self-identified tea partiers support that benchmark. It is an additional irony that many conservatives are fine with raising taxes on those 47% of Americans who don't make enough money to pay federal income taxes, as long as top rates are lowered enough to make the overall shift revenue neutral. This isn't tax policy as much as it has become a shell-game masquerading as ideology. <br> Both Obama and congressional Republicans have campaigned on tax reform and tax simplification in the past. The Bowles-Simpson Plan and the sadly abandoned Obama-Boehner Grand Bargain imagined lowering rates and raising revenue by closing loopholes. The real tragedy is that such an agreement should be within reach -- but the 80% agreement keeps getting eclipsed by the 20% disagreement, that signature, stubborn hyperpartisan insistence on all or nothing. So we get nothing. <br> That brings us back to Nixon's aphorism: "We shall never make taxation popular but we can make taxation fair." It's about the last piece of useful wisdom on the subject that we've heard out of Washington. <br> <em> 
 In the early 1980s when I served on the staff of the Joint Economic Committee, we invited the Republican deficit scourge, Peter G. Peterson, to testify on Reaganomics, but he wouldn't come. Somewhat understandably, he declined to sabotage his own team. This week, when I was asked to comment on President Barack Obama's proposed "Buffett Rule," I had a similar urge to duck. But it passed. <br> The Buffett Rule would increase taxes on a handful of Mitt-Romney-like figures in today's America, raising a few billions of dollars in new revenues each year from the very rich. It is perfectly tailored to the Obama political style, which is to nod symbolically leftward while reserving big concessions for banks, venture capitalists and insurance companies. <br> Symbolic gestures have their place. In this case, the proposed rule states an important principle of tax fairness. It calls attention to the larger issue of income inequality. It could be the start of a larger push for tax reform. No political progressive should sneer at an idea that helps bring these issues into focus. And especially not, if the direct effect might be to cost Romney, personally, millions of dollars. The image of him writing the check will, no doubt, give universal pleasure. <br> Another virtue of the Buffett Rule is that it exposes the craven hypocrisy of its opponents. This is, after all, a very small tax increase. It is exquisitely targeted on a few individuals with large investment incomes. As drafted by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, it would provide a useful spur to their charity. There is no serious argument that the rule would make the tax code more inefficient than it already is. The grounds for opposing it can only be, well, craven and hypocritical. <br> And yet, at the same time, by itself, the Buffett Rule solves no significant economic problem. It will not create any jobs, raise any wages, reduce the crushing debts of the middle class, slow the wave of foreclosures, conserve energy or reduce the price of gas. Nor will it restore confidence in the banks. And it is directed, at least in principle, toward a notorious nonproblem, namely the deficit and the public debt, on which we waste far too much ink as things stand. <br> According to the Economic Policy Institute, Harkin's proposal would raise the incomes of 28 million American workers. It would make a big difference in the South, where wages are lower. It would especially help younger workers, minorities and women. It would not add to the deficit -- since federal workers all make more than that anyway -- and would likely spur the economy and increase tax revenues -- by a lot more than the Buffett Rule. <br> The Buffett Rule would zing a few thousand high fliers, which is not bad. But maybe Obama should go beyond symbols and grab this idea while it's hot. 
 The budget proposal introduced by House Republicans on Tuesday is much more than a series of numbers on a spreadsheet -- it's a vision for reforming the key pillars of the American social contract in the 21st century. In that regard, it's very different from the vision put forward by President Obama in his budget plan from a month ago, which emphasized preserving the status quo with another round of tax hikes. <br> The central economic problem of coming years is how to update the nation's largest entitlement programs so that they are sustainable and available to future generations of Americans. <br> In Medicare, the GOP budget preserves today's arrangements for those in or near retirement. But for future entrants into the program, Medicare would change into a "premium support" model. The government would provide a fixed level of premium assistance to the program's enrollees, and they would use that assistance to pick from among competing insurance options, including the traditional fee-for-service federal program. <br> Obama's vision for Medicare is very different. He wants an unaccountable board of bureaucrats to cut fees to those caring for Medicare patients. But cutting fees isn't real cost control. Low reimbursement rates will just force doctors and hospitals to stop taking care of Medicare patients and thereby impair their access to care. <br> For Medicaid, the GOP plan would shift power and financial control to the states so that they can reform their programs in ways that best suit the needs of their residents. <br> In addition to mending entitlement programs, the GOP plan calls for top-to-bottom reform of the federal bureaucracy, with an emphasis on cutting programs of low or marginal value so that more money can be invested in what truly matters. Most importantly, the plan does not adopt the deep reductions in defense spending that would cripple the military just as threats around the world are expanding and intensifying. Over the next decade, the GOP budget would cut federal spending by $5.3 trillion, compared with Obama's proposal. <br> The American people now have before them two clear and very different approaches for how to address the nation's fundamental economic challenges. One vision would preserve the status quo, with growing entitlement commitments, steady hikes in tax rates and more centralized control of the economy from the government. The other vision would bolster a vibrant private sector with sensible taxes; reform of entitlements and other programs that emphasize limited but effective government; protection of the most vulnerable among us; and the power of free markets to promote prosperity. These competing plans give voters a real choice when they go the polls in November. And whatever they decide, the consequences will be lasting. 
 Compare and contrast the economic plan Mitt Romney released in September with the speech he delivered Friday in Detroit. <br> "We need taxes to pay for the operations of government. But they should be collected by a system that is simple and fair, and that causes the least possible disruption to the productive economy. <br> "While the entire tax code is in dire need of a fundamental overhaul, Mitt Romney believes in holding the line against increases in marginal tax rates. The goals that President Bush pursued in bringing rates down to their current level -- to spur economic growth, encourage savings and investment, and help struggling Americans make ends meet -- are just as important today as they were a decade ago. Letting them lapse, as President Obama promises to do in 2012, is a step in precisely the wrong direction. If anything, the lower rates established by President Bush should be regarded as a directional marker on the road to more fundamental reform. " (Italics added.) <br> By contrast, the Detroit speech seems to have been written on the back of an envelope. The only thought that went into it was: How do we rev up the base so that we can win the next primaries? <br> Romney said: <br> "First, I will make an across-the-board, 20% reduction in marginal individual income tax rates [tax brackets]. By reducing the tax on the next dollar of income earned by all taxpayers, we will encourage hard work, risk-taking, and productivity by allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn. <br> "The businesses that pay taxes through the individual income tax system account for more than half of all private sector jobs in the United States. So this tax cut will encourage businesses to hire, raise wages, and grow the economy." <br> No effort is made to corroborate these claims for the economic benefits of a further 20% tax cut. Corroboration is not needed in a speech intended narrowly for the pre-convinced. <br> But wait -- won't such a big tax cut, piled atop the previous commitment to renew the Bush tax cuts when they expire in 2013, greatly add to the deficit? Especially when joined to new promises to permanently abolish the Alternative Minimum Tax and estate tax? How will the federal budget be balanced? <br> Not with cuts to current Medicare beneficiaries, the speech hastens to assure. <br> "Tax hikes are off the table, and there will be no change for those at or near retirement." Medicare and Social Security reform will not begin until 2022. Yet the tax cuts are supposed to go into effect right away. How to close the gap? <br> Growth, of course, will help. But mostly, the speech suggests that the gap will be closed with big cuts to programs for the poor, such as "food stamps, housing subsidies, and job training." <br> What about the social costs of imposing such big cuts on a population that has by no means recovered from the economic catastrophe of 2008-2009? Do the numbers even add up? <br> One might cynically answer: Who cares? The speech is not intended as policy. It's intended to corral Republican primary voters. If Romney wins the election in November, that will be the time to think seriously about economic plans. <br> Yet cynicism is not always as sophisticated as it thinks it is. However short-term the motivations behind it, Romney's speech in Michigan will have heavy consequences for at least four reasons: <br> • Even if the speech does not strictly qualify as a flip-flop, it does continue the pattern of Romney yielding under pressure from the GOP base. Winning candidates look for ways to demonstrate independence from party dogma. In 2008, Barack Obama did it by praising Ronald Reagan and preaching the importance of fathers. George W. Bush did it with his October 1999 speech repudiating claims that the U.S. was "slouching toward Gomorrah." Bill Clinton of course had his Sister Souljah speech. Romney instead is following the Walter Mondale approach of knuckling his forehead to every interest group in the party. Each succeeding act of submission makes him look weaker. <br> • Romney has now wholly identified himself as the candidate of the rich and the old. Nothing is to be asked from those over 55. Much is to be given to upper-income earners. All the burden of fiscal adjustment is to be piled on the poor and the young. When Republicans invoke the memory of Ronald Reagan, they ought to remember how powerfully Reagan spoke to the aspirations of young Americans -- and how the support of young Americans in turn made the oldest of American presidents appear exciting to voters in every age group. Today's Republican party goes out of its way to show contempt and hostility to the young -- an attitude that will have consequences for a long time to come. <br> • It's not impossible that Romney may win this election. If he does, he'll find that his speech in Detroit surrendered the initiative for his first year in office to the Republicans in the House. They will want to pass the tax cut first. Romney has now endorsed it, so how can he say no? They will want to do some version of the Paul Ryan budget next. Ditto. And whoosh, there goes his first year -- and all the priorities that his September plan and his own book suggested he regards as more important: tax reform, trade, etc. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist will be proved right: Romney will have reduced himself to a signing machine for a government whose real power is centered in Capitol Hill. <br> • If Medicare, Social Security and defense are off the table -- and if the rest of the government is not to be obliterated entirely -- then hopes of deficit reduction after Romney's big tax cut will rest on the country zooming to Chinese levels of economic growth. What if that growth does not appear? It's one thing to incur dreadful deficits during the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. The Romney plan threatens to institutionalize those deficits even during the period of recovery ahead. <br> Compassionate conservatism has been dead for a long time. Romney's Detroit speech cremated the remains. As a man, Romney remains far and away the most capable of the presidential candidates seeking the Republican nomination. But he has now finally eliminated the policy differences separating him from the radical congressional wing. If Romney should win the Republican nomination, moderate and independent voters nationwide will be forced to decide: If they vote for Romney, who is it they're truly voting for? 
 Mitt Romney's victory in Florida is big but still leaves much to be desired. <br> His win comes partly from substance and partly from a substantial advantage in resources. Romney is now a much improved candidate. His tactics and message are sharper, particularly defending his wealth. <br> In the two debates before the Florida primary, Romney outperformed Newt Gingrich, showing a smarter, tougher, more forceful demeanor. And he had an obvious advantage in resources. Romney owned the airwaves in Florida, outspending Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul more than five to one. <br> Should Romney be the Republican nominee, he will not have this luxury against President Barack Obama. Romney must be able to win on issues and substance; he has yet to prove that he can do that. Conservatives, in particular, still have serious questions about his core credentials. If Romney repeals "ObamaCare," what will be his alternative? Will he put forward a bold tax reform plan? <br> In the coming weeks, Romney needs a hard-hitting, conservative speech, one that reaches deeper than his traditional stump speech. We know Santorum's and Gingrich's vision for the country; Romney's isn't so clear. He needs a lucid, Reaganesque plan for the country; it's not enough for him to run as a businessman. He also needs to be gaffe free. His locution Wednesday morning on CNN -- "I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs a repair, I'll fix it." -- is inept at best for a very successful man. <br> Coming off his surge in South Carolina, Gingrich underperformed in Florida. Granted, he was the primary target of Romney's barrage of negative ads, but he was noticeably rattled and distracted from his message. Gingrich is at his best when he takes on the media and Obama, not when he stoops to ugly, personal fights with Romney and Santorum. <br> The lack of debates between now and March will hurt Gingrich more than any other candidate. As Byron York of The Washington Examiner told me on my radio show Wednesday morning, "Gingrich has scored most of his points against the press, not against his fellow candidates." He must find effective ways to engage Romney on the issues and rise above the muckraking. Americans like big ideas; he should return to those. Gingrich has come back from the dead twice; he should not be counted out or underestimated after Florida. <br> In spite of skipping Florida, Santorum is right to remain in the race. With the remaining caucus states and the new proportional delegation rules, Santorum has as much of a shot as Gingrich. <br> Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, pointed out on my show Wednesday that more delegates will be elected in February than in January and Gingrich isn't even on the ballot in Missouri. "Santorum has a shot to replace Gingrich as the alternative to Romney," Kristol said, adding that in his view Santorum is "more electable" and "more compelling" than Gingrich. <br> Santorum is, after all, the most conservative candidate left in the race. His credentials are much needed in the national dialogue. As iron sharpens iron, he will force Romney and Gingrich to focus on the issues. Yet, somehow, Santorum needs to gain momentum and take votes from Gingrich. Look for him to target Gingrich's record heavily, especially on health care, in the weeks ahead. <br> The shift from South Carolina to Florida proved once again that one week can change a lot in American politics. It's not likely we will know the Republican nominee until March. The larger question now becomes whether conservatives will coalesce and unite around one candidate based on substance and message -- or electability. 
 It also suggests that the main argument made by Romney and others for this highly unequal state of affairs -- that it's essential to spur job creation and economic growth -- is false. <br> Romney is fabulously wealthy because he is a hard worker and a smart businessman, to be sure. (Being the child of a smart businessman certainly doesn't hurt either.) Yet there's also no question that Romney has benefited enormously from the growing tilt of the tax code toward the nation's highest earners. <br> The code used to impose higher and higher rates all the way up the income ladder. Today, the very richest generally pay no more than the modestly well-to-do. And indeed, many of the superrich are paying lower rates. Warren Buffet has said he pays less in taxes as a share of income than the people who work for him. <br> The issue isn't just declining rates at the top. Just as crucial, politicians have also shifted the code away from taxing income from assets. Payroll taxes are up; capital gains taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, dividend taxes -- all way down. <br> On the other hand, targeted tax-cutting for the rich has certainly spurred one form of innovation and investment: ever more creative strategies by lawyers and lobbyists to rewire the tax code and reshuffle rich people's incomes so that their earnings show up as lightly taxed capital gains, not the wages and salaries on which the rest of American workers rely. <br> When Romney was at Bain Capital, for example, he and his associates would aggressively load companies up with debt and then reap big short-term gains that depended on tax provisions allowing investors to write off interest on company debt. <br> Even more telling, Romney is taxed so lightly in part because of a longstanding bug in the tax code that deep-pocketed lobbyists have managed to preserve. Unlike most finance professionals, he and other hedge fund and private equity managers get to treat a big part of the fees they earn from managing other people's money as "carried interest," subject to the capital gains rate, not the much higher income rate. <br> This egregious loophole didn't matter when private equity was rare and capital gains were taxed more or less like other income. Now, as Romney can attest, it matters a lot. With carried interest accounting for a quarter of his income over the last two years, Romney saved about $2.5 million from this tax break alone. <br> Actually, Romney's own business career makes the point better. No one seems to have noticed it, but Romney worked those long hours and made those risky bets mostly during a decade-long period when capital gains were taxed at the same rate as labor income. For a brief shining moment, the 1986 Tax Reform Act that Romney's icon Ronald Reagan supported interrupted the steady decline of capital gains taxes and restored the simple idea that all income should be taxed equally. That is to say, Romney's own success suggests that low capital gains rates aren't necessary to encourage the kind of entrepreneurship that Romney now celebrates. <br> <em> 
 One of the lessons of modern American presidential history is that there is nothing more devastating than turning a candidate's supposed strength into a weakness. Karl Rove masterfully made John Kerry's distinguished military service a liability through a series of Swift Boat attacks in the 2004 campaign. <br> Mitt Romney's fumbling response to questions about his tax returns similarly threatens to destroy the central premise of his candidacy that his business acumen will help him lead the country out of its current economic troubles. <br> For someone who has been running for president for six years, Romney is surprisingly ill-prepared to discuss his tax returns. <br> Romney's current position, that he will eventually release his returns for an an unspecified number of years, but not until April, is transparently political since, if things continue to go well for him, he presumably would have the Republican nomination wrapped up by then. <br> All of this raises the question: Why is Romney so defensive about the tax issue? After all, this is the man who told his landscaping company in 2006 that he would have to fire them unless they stopped employing illegal immigrants in order to maintain his future political viability. <br> Romney surely had his future political viability in mind as he arranged his financial affairs and prepared his tax returns over the past half-dozen years. So why hasn't he led with his chin and gone on offense with his tax returns? <br> One front could be on the charitable generosity he presumably has exhibited through his Mormon faith. If he and his wife have followed the Mormon practice of tithing 10% of their income to the church, his tax returns would stand in vivid contrast to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who gave meager amounts to charity, especially in the years before they knew they would be making their tax returns public. <br> These facts fit perfectly with the Republican meme of limited government augmented by private charity, with Democrats the party of compassion with other people's money while they personally do little to help the less fortunate. <br> Romney could open a second front in the tax war by using his tax return to press for tax reform that embraces the capitalist spirit reflected in his work for Bain Capital. Instead, Romney appears defensive about paying only a 15% tax rate since most of his income presumably is in the form of interest, dividends, capital gains, and carried interest. Romney is playing on Obama's turf in his timid proposal to cut taxes but only on those earning less than $200,000 per year. <br> Romney could contrast himself with Warren Buffett -- Obama's favorite tax adviser -- who publicly calls for higher taxes on the wealthy (while continuing to arrange his own business affairs to pay the lower tax rate enjoyed by Romney). <br> The Obama-Buffett world view is that you solve the problem of secretaries paying higher tax rates than their millionaire bosses by raising tax rates on the millionaires. The Romney response should be that you solve the problem by lowering tax rates on the secretaries. And he should insist that Buffett follow his lead and release his tax returns as well. <br> Romney should scrap his 59-point economic plan and mount a full-throttled cry for tax reform that lowers tax rates on everyone to the level reflected in his tax returns. <br> If Romney is unable or unwilling to wage this tax war in the relatively friendly trenches of a Republican primary, the party should think twice about whether it wants him as its standard bearer when the front moves to the stiffer territory of the general election. 
 Small business is not to be trifled with. President Barack Obama's announcement last week of a proposal to temporarily elevate the Small Business Administration to Cabinet rank is a move in the right direction. <br> In the United States, we know that firms less than 5 years old create the vast majority of net new jobs. It is mom and pop shops, garage start-ups and fledgling companies with good ideas that generate growth. <br> So, on its face, the president's move appears to reflect the importance of entrepreneurial companies to the U.S. economy. <br> But his announcement came with a mixed signal. The president gave SBA Cabinet ranking at the same time that he proposed merging six government agencies into one department focused on commerce and trade. Is the political theater in an election year? Because actual policy to support small business growth matters much more, particularly since the engine of small business growth is not what it used to be. <br> What happens when small businesses launch but don't "scale?" We are left with an economy short of 13.1 million jobs. <br> It is an urgent national priority to help small firms grow. This is of much greater importance than Cabinet reshuffling. And while a presidential announcement gives the appearance of focus, it doesn't guarantee legitimate change. <br> Today, U.S. businesses are constrained by burdensome regulation related to health care, the Dodd-Frank financial reform act of 2010, labor issues and environmental issues. Political as well as economic uncertainty makes it difficult for business owners to hire for future growth. <br> The good news is that 2012 started with an economic uptick. In December, the economy added 200,000 jobs, and the jobless rate fell to 8.5%. To accelerate recovery, we must further remove impediments for small businesses to perform. <br> Small and new companies require key policy changes to jump-start growth. We need visa reform to welcome foreign-born entrepreneurs who have graduated from U.S. universities and who want to create new enterprises here. We need to advance trade and further open global markets for U.S. goods. Ninety-five percent of the people we want to sell to live outside of the United States. <br> We need to strengthen K-12 education and improve training programs to ready our work force for the jobs of the future. Further, we need comprehensive tax reform to encourage the creation of new businesses. We cannot continue to maintain one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world and expect entrepreneurs and investors to not move abroad. <br> What does it mean if, as Obama proposed in his news conference, that the Commerce Department's core functions will be coalesced with those of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency and the Small Business Administration. If this reorganization occurs, the SBA will immediately lose its newly awarded Cabinet rank. <br> So which is it? Is Obama genuinely elevating the SBA or seeking to integrate it into a larger bureaucracy? The president's message raises questions about the White House's true commitment to small business concerns. <br> In an election year, politicians pay lip service to topics that pull at America's heartstrings. Small business does something more important: It quickens the nation's pulse. 2012 is a year for urgent action on the economy. Small business matters not only for political headlines, it is our best hope for putting America back to work. 
 The debate in Congress this week about whether to pay for extending the payroll tax cut by imposing a new tax on millionaires will have nothing to do with solving our nation's economic challenges and everything to do with election-year politics. Senate Democratic leaders have already signaled they will use the debate as a purely partisan exercise designed to embarrass Republicans into opposing tax cuts for the poor while defending tax cuts for the rich. <br> I intend to offer an alternative. Instead of punishing the rich with higher taxes, I will give Congress the option of helping pay for extending the payroll tax cut by ending welfare to the wealthy. <br> Every year, politicians on both sides engage in a process of reverse Robin Hood in which they steal $30 billion from low- and middle-income Americans and provide handouts to the rich and famous. <br> Millionaires receive tax earmarks and deductions crafted by both parties that allow them to write off billions each year. These write-offs include mortgage interest deductions on second homes and luxury yachts, gambling losses, business expenses, electric vehicle credits and even child care tax credits. <br> Meanwhile, direct handouts for millionaires have included $74 million in unemployment checks, $316 million in farm subsidies, $89 million for preservation of ranches and estates, $9 billion in retirement checks and $7.5 million to compensate for damages caused by emergencies to property that should have been insured. Millionaires have even borrowed $16 million in government-backed education loans to attend college since 2007. <br> The goal of highlighting these excesses is not to demonize those who are successful. Instead, by highlighting the sheer stupidity of pampering the wealthy with lavish benefits through our safety net and tax code, I hope to make a moral and economic argument for real entitlement and tax reform. <br> The most troubling gap in America today is not an income gap. It is an integrity gap -- and even intelligence gap -- between Washington and the rest of the country. <br> Families are struggling to make ends meet and are making painful economic choices as politicians in Washington borrow billions to provide welfare to the wealthy. Politicians on both sides refuse to fix big problems and defend stupid policies because changing those policies would involve upending a comfortable political status quo. <br> It's important for taxpayers to understand that these distortions are not accidental loopholes in the law. To the contrary, these provisions are intentional efforts to get all Americans to buy into a system where everyone appears to benefit while the poor and middle class are being robbed. <br> In the case of entitlements such as Social Security, progressives have argued for decades that a program for poor people will be a poor program. Yet, Warren Buffett hardly needs the same retirement check as his secretary. Ending welfare handouts to millionaires will strengthen, not undermine, the safety net for people who need it most. <br> Even Canada has adopted means testing in its retirement program by limiting benefits for high-earners. That fact is we can't afford the system we have today. Only by adopting common-sense reforms can we sustain a safety net for those who truly need assistance. <br> On the tax side, both parties have been reluctant to alter tax earmarks and deductions, such as the mortgage interest deduction. These are considered sacrosanct. <br> Yet, it's hard to understand how limiting the mortgage interest deductions for yachts will hurt working families. Defending spending in the tax code is not conservative. Providing tax earmarks and deductions to millionaires is a tax increase on everyone who doesn't receive the benefit. The only way we will enact real tax reform, and grow the economy, is by lowering tax rates and broadening the base by scaling back these egregious handouts. This is precisely what President Ronald Reagan did in 1986. <br> Even though the super committee failed to reach an agreement on broad deficit reduction, there is no reason why the other super committee -- Congress -- should drag its feet. Change in Washington tends to start with small steps. There is no better place to start than scaling back ludicrous handouts to millionaires that expose an entitlement system and tax code that desperately need to be reformed. 
 The Gingrich campaign has now confirmed a longstanding business relationship that enabled his consulting group to receive between $1.6 and $1.8 million from mortgage giant Freddie Mac. But it wasn't for "lobbying," Newt Gingrich insists. It was for "strategic advice on a wide range of issues." <br> OK, but then doesn't the payment, AP's Tom Beaumont asked the former House speaker, just remind people that "your background comes from being a Washington insider?" <br> "It reminds people," Gingrich corrected Beaumont, "that I know a great deal about Washington." And as he continued, "If you want to change Washington, we just tried four [sic] years of amateur ignorance and it didn't work very well, so having some-body who knows Washington might be a really good thing." <br> Newt Gingrich is certainly right about that. There is no candidate for president who has had more experience in changing Washington than Gingrich. Indeed, there may be no American since James Madison who has had more of an effect in making the institution of Congress what it is today. <br> For as far too few remember, more than any other living American, it is Newt Gingrich who gave us the current version of our hopelessly dysfunctional Congress — an institution which, according to a New York Times/CBS poll, now has the confidence of 9% of the American people. That monster is his baby, and no one should deny him his parental bragging rights. <br> The question for Gingrich now, however, is whether he wants to change that institution — again. For nothing in his campaign so far has either explained what went so wrong in the practices that he helped birth, or how we might possibly reform them. And it is this, I suggest, more than anything else that Americans need "reminding" of. <br> The Framers of our Constitution meant Congress to be a great deliberative body. It has become an embarrassment. Congress doesn't deliberate to resolve important national issues. Congress fundraises, and postures to fundraise, to support the next fight for control. <br> The transformation to this "Fundraising Congress" began in 1993. Newt Gingrich was its leader. After claiming Republican control of both houses of Congress in 1995 — for the first time in 40 years — Gingrich launched his new army of reformers on a project to secure permanent control of that institution, and of government. <br> Fundraising was the key to that strategy of control. The Republicans came to power raising a then unheard of amount of money: $618.42 million in the election cycle ending in 1994, compared to the Democrats' $488.68 million. <br> In the four years between 1994 and 1998, Republican candidates and party committees would raise over $1 billion. Never before had a party come anywhere close to raising that amount of money, because never before had any party's leaders so effectively focused the energy of their members on this single task: fundraising. <br> Gingrich concentrated the "work" of Congress into a three-day "work" week. He sent his caucus home for the rest of the week, in part so that they had time necessary to launch cross-country fundraising missions. <br> He exploded the number of committees, radically increasing the number of fund-raising targets. He ended any idea of bipartisanship. Instead, as Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tennessee, has described, the focus of Congress after Gingrich's reforms became the "majority of the majority," (i.e., the majority of the Republicans) polarizing the institution to the end of assuring ever more loyal and energized troops. <br> Members of Congress now spend between 30%-70% of their time raising money to get re-elected to Congress or to get their party back into power. And not just the Republicans: The Democrats quickly followed the lessons of Professor Gingrich. And in the almost 20 years since he came to power, practically everything about that great institution has changed. <br> Gone is any semblance of deliberation, or the idea that there is a business of the nation to be done, as opposed to the business of the party in power. Instead, the institution that Gingrich inherited — the one in which Democrats worked with Republicans to pass the most important tax reform in modern history (Reagan's), and in which Republicans led Democrats to break a filibuster in the Senate and pass the most important social legislation in a century (The Civil Rights Act of 1964) — was gone. What replaced it is the completely dysfunctional institution which practically no American has confidence in today. <br> More important to the right, as the business of Congress became the business of fundraising, the ideals that had brought Gingrich to power quickly got compromised. Fundraising demands pushed the Republican leadership to give up on its stated goal of shrinking the size of government, so that it could better use the power of majority status to raise campaign cash. As the Washington Post's Robert Kaiser reported in his 2009 book, "So Damn Much Money": <br> "Republicans took over ... determined to cut the government down to size. [But] their ambitions were soon compromised. ... Gingrich initially supported ... efforts to impose discipline on spending.... But in the face of perceived political necessity, the leadership wavered. Cutting spending was good, but Gingrich, (Dick) Armey, (Tom) DeLay, and others quickly realized that 'we have another aspect to our existence here, which is that we must use the Appropriations Committee as a resource to protect our vulnerables, because once we got into power, we wanted to stay in power.'" <br> The job of Congress was no longer the work of the nation. The job of Congress was to help its majority "to stay in power." <br> This is the legacy of Speaker Gingrich. It has been followed by Republicans and Democrats alike. It is a legacy that has done the nation great harm. And much more important than the question of how Gingrich might have profited personally from the economy of influence that he helped build is the question of whether, and how, he now intends to "change" it. <br> So it is perfectly true, Mr. Speaker, that you have the most "change" experience of any candidate for president. So would you use it this time to do good? Or would you continue to defend the practices that have destroyed the crown jewel of the Framers' Republic: Congress. 
 The 12 members of Congress on the deficit reduction committee have my deepest admiration and respect. They face probably the greatest challenge they've ever faced or ever will, at least in political life! <br> When my pal Erskine Bowles and I testified before the committee earlier this month, we did not spend much time going over the specifics of what needs to be done. They all know in their gut what has to be done. They know all of the policy options for dealing with the deficit. And by now they are just as painfully and vividly aware that every single program or policy they look at has an entrenched constituency that will raise a perfect hell if they dare to touch it. <br> Instead we offered them our full support, and told them that from our experience it can be done. We told them that if they step up and agree to a big, bold and smart plan to truly bring our nation's debt under control, they will have the true respect and support of the American public. <br> I loved to take on the ideological extremists on both sides when I was in the Senate and took a helluva lot of grief from the special interests passionately defending the sacred cows I dared to brand. But I never lost an election. That is an important lesson that I shared with the committee members. People admire guts and courage. They may fight you. They may vilify you. But they will admire you. <br> When Erskine and I go around the country speaking about our nation's budget, we don't give them BS or mush. We give them some simple facts: Our nation faces the most predictable economic crisis in history. We borrow $3.56 billion every day. We borrow 36 cents for every buck we spend. You don't need fancy charts and graphs to show anyone that is a problem. <br> Wherever we speak, whatever the audience may have thought about our plan beforehand, we get a standing ovation when we're done. And when people see us as we travel the country we get far more thumbs up than any other digit. <br> We can't spending-cut our way out of this, we can't tax our way out of it, and we can't grow our way out of it. You need to do all three. Anyone who says with a straight face that we are going to deal with our debt in a serious way without touching revenue, defense spending, Medicaid and Medicare and addressing the solvency of Social Security is either goofy or a radio talk show host. <br> Some people say to us, "It's easy for you to propose all this tough medicine, you and Erskine have nothing to lose." Well, that's true. But other commission members like Sens. Dick Durbin and Tom Coburn had a lot to lose, and they stepped right up to the plate and supported the original commission plan. <br> When Dick Durbin announced that he was supporting our plan he said he was doing so even though it contained items he "hated like the devil hates holy water" and he knew his vote for it would deeply disappoint many of his friends and allies. <br> Tom Coburn well knew he would be demonized on taxes by the zealous enforcers of ideological purity like Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. But both Tom Coburn and Dick Durbin, and a supermajority of our commission, were willing to give up something they like to protect the country they love. <br> Our nation simply cannot afford to have our elected leaders fearfully bow and scrape to the likes of Grover Norquist and the AARP. We need real leaders, courageous leaders who will place the national interest ahead of special interests. The members of the super committee as well as congressional leaders and the president must do just that. Pray for 'em! 
 In the Republicans' Las Vegas show this week, the headliner turned out to be Mitt Romney. <br> That was a surprise. Many pundits assumed it would be businessman Herman Cain, a wild card who has recently led the field in polls of Republican voters. While media elites and politicians mock Cain's 9-9-9 tax reform plan, everyday voters give him credit for at least having a plan -- and extra credit for the fact that it is easy to understand. <br> By contrast, Romney's economic plan has 59 points. Should Americans really need to hire a team of accountants to understand a candidate's sales pitch? <br> But Romney's major challenge isn't his communication strategy. Instead, it's the same thing that plagued the former Massachusetts governor in the 2008 election: Many Republican voters don't like him, trust him or relate to him. It's not, as some political observers suggest, that they don't think Romney is sufficiently conservative. Rather, it's that they don't think he's sufficiently anything. What does it matter if they agree with what he espouses about issue X or topic Y if they don't believe a word he says? <br> In the CNN debate in Las Vegas, his opponents tried to draw attention to Romney's character by accusing him -- one after another -- of being inconsistent, dishonest and untrustworthy. <br> -- Cain accused Romney of deceptively "mixing apples and oranges" when Romney, seizing on a point made earlier by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, slammed Cain's 9-9-9 plan as adding a tax burden on Nevadans or anyone else who already pays a sales tax. That state tax has to be paid anyway, Cain explained, regardless of what happens at the federal level. Romney seems to have gotten the better of Cain in that exchange, with his joke about how Americans would have a new tax -- and a bushel of both apples and oranges. But the idea that Cain pushed back against Romney's characterization probably also helped reinforce the accusation that opponents direct at Romney -- that he misleads. <br> -- Newt Gingrich tore into Romney for suggesting he had gotten the idea of an individual mandate to buy health insurance from Gingrich. "That is not true," the former House speaker said in a stern voice. The idea actually came from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. Gingrich forced Romney to walk back his comments, and the former college professor seemed to relish his role in teaching Romney a lesson: Don't exaggerate the facts. Gingrich supported the idea of a mandate, but it wasn't -- as Romney claimed -- his idea originally. Gingrich forced Romney to walk back his comments, and the former college professor seemed to relish his role in teaching Romney a lesson: Don't exaggerate the facts. He even tweaked Romney a little, commending his revised version of events with: "That's a little broader. Keep going." <br> Add it all up and you'll see that some of Romney's fellow presidential hopefuls are frustrated and fed up with his tendency to shade the truth. Most politicians do that, of course, but not all of them are equally good at it. Romney excels at it. What he's not so good at is smoothly shifting from one position to another on controversial issues such as abortion or legalizing undocumented immigrants. <br> Romney's inconsistencies grate on his opponents. They see him up-close, on stage and in their face. Look at the Las Vegas debate again and read the body language. It's clear that Romney's opponents would not buy a used car from this man. <br> While some in the media cling to the narrative that Romney "looks presidential," the message sent by some of his opponents this week was simple and direct: buyer beware. <br> To some of the practitioners in his trade, Romney is the worst kind of politician, the kind who will say anything and pretend to be anything to get elected. Remember, it's the view of many Republicans, from conservative radio talk show hosts to members of the tea party, that the current occupant of the White House is untruthful and inauthentic. Plus, many of these people probably don't see the point in replacing Obama with more of the same. <br> That would go a long way toward explaining why Romney -- despite substantial resources, a first-rate campaign organization, head-start in running for president, and the experience of having done it before -- isn't performing better in the polls. He can't seem to get much beyond 25 percent in most surveys, with three-fourths of Republicans opting for the ABR camp: "Anybody But Romney." <br> If Romney ultimately turns out to be the Republican nominee, before he can even begin to convince the American people that he can be president, he'll first have to convince them that he's authentic and that he can be trusted. <br> Good luck with that, Mitt. 
 Rick Perry is calling for a flat tax to stop his campaign from flatlining. But it might be just what he needs to revive his presidential ambitions. Because a flat tax is not just a big idea; it could prove to be both good politics and good policy. <br> After all, tax simplification is both needed and polls well, and the flat tax promises a simpler approach to paying taxes. And at a time when President Obama is campaigning against the fact that Warren Buffett and his secretary pay different rates, the flat tax idea might just have met its moment for broader-based appeal. <br> Its virtue is its simplicity. The current tax code contains more words than the Bible, and Americans spend 6 billion hours each year trying to comply with the code. That's time that can be more productively spent elsewhere. In contrast, a flat tax could be calculated during the seventh-inning stretch of a ballgame. <br> Perry's flat-tax plan, the details of which will be announced this week, may help him regain the enthusiasm of his initial tea party supporters who lately have flocked to Herman Cain. <br> Dick Armey, a former congressman and chairman of FreedomWorks, has been a longtime advocate of the flat tax, and his organization has helped fund many of the tea party rallies and given shape to the movement. This policy move will, in turn, help convince many tea partiers that Perry really is their man. It might also help reignite a spark of support from center-right think tanks that have long supported such a tax-reform but had growing doubts about Perry's commitment to fiscal conservative policy ideas outside bumper-sticker bromides. <br> Cain deserves credit for moving forward the policy debate in this presidential field. His 9-9-9 plan, a flat tax combined with a national sales tax, captured the imagination of the primary electorate and catapulted him to the top of the poll rankings. <br> In turn, it created pressure on other candidates to propose fiscal plans of their own, providing at least some details in place of play-to-the-base bumper-sticker slogans. Ron Paul put forward a trillion-dollar deficit cut, Rick Santorum proposed eliminating corporate taxes on manufacturing companies, and now Perry has gotten into the game with plans to unveil his own bold proposal. <br> The flat tax is certainly more tried and true than the 9-9-9 plan and avoids its most regressive elements, like the 9% national sales tax. The flat tax as proposed by one-time presidential candidate and Perry supporter Steve Forbes contains a family exemption for the first $36,000 for a family of four, effectively exempting the poorest Americans. <br> This doesn't need to be a polarizing idea on partisan grounds; it was advocated by California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, in his 1992 presidential campaign. And while more Americans would pay taxes under this plan, by broadening the base, we would stop the potentially destabilizing dynamic under which nearly half of Americans don't pay federal income taxes. <br> Making ideological peace with the idea of broadening the tax base could also help some conservatives move from anti-tax absolutism to a broader conversation about tax reform that could help get crippling long-term budget imbalances under control. We could lower rates to stimulate economic growth while remaining revenue neutral at a roughly 19% flat tax rate, and if it was pegged slightly higher, we could start putting a serious dent in the deficit and debt. <br> The fact that the flat tax has been backed by a prominent presidential candidate will help shape the national debate and perhaps provide some urgency to the idea of tax reform. Obama talked about tax simplification on the '08 campaign trail, and Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan have long advocated it as well. <br> Even famed Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville said on "OutFront with Erin Burnett" on Wednesday that he'd be fine with a progressive flat tax with three rates and allowances for a few core deductions while closing most loopholes. <br> Even if Perry's plan is only a base-pleasing opening bid in a larger round of tax reform, it is a step in the right direction. We need to have a serious national conversation about tax simplification that can spur economic growth. By taking the risk of putting forward a big idea, Perry just might agree: Good policy is also good politics. 
 Herman Cain claims that brainwashing explains why so few blacks support conservative Republicans such as himself. He is wrong. The thinking, sentiments, and policy preferences he supports give good cause for rejecting him. <br> In his new campaign manifesto, "This is Herman Cain: My Journey to the White House," the candidate states repeatedly and without qualification that "Our Founding Fathers did their job ... a great job." He makes no mention of the blacks who fled George Washington, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson during the Revolutionary War in search of their freedom, or the Constitution's protection of slavery, or that the initial Constitution forbade Congress from prohibiting American participation in the international slave trade for 20 years and indeed made that provision unamendable. <br> Cain evinces no recognition of the Founding Fathers' role in erecting a cruel pigmentocracy that continues to poison virtually every aspect of American political, social and cultural life. This is not an abstruse or academic matter. The president nominates federal judges. An important theory of constitutional interpretation vying for ascendancy is originalism: the notion that the Constitution should be read as originally understood by its framers. Justice Clarence Thomas is the most militant originalist on the Supreme Court. A President Cain would seek to fill the federal judiciary with more Clarence Thomases -- a prospect that most blacks rightly view with dread. <br> Asked about his impressions of the Occupy Wall Street dissidents, Cain declared: "Don't blame the big banks. If you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself " -- a statement that overlooks the desperation with which millions, a disproportionate number of whom are black, strive to stave off impoverishment and unemployment. Later, when Cain perceived the impolitic character of his comment, he tried to minimize it, asserting that he was only referring to the protesters and not to the impoverished or unemployed in general. That attempt at damage control rings false, however, especially in light of his further comment: "It is not a person's fault if they succeeded, it is a person's fault if they failed." <br> Largely located on the lower rungs of the American socioeconomic ladder, most black Americans appreciate sources of opportunity and power that Cain despises: unions, governmental support for the needy, a robust, government-supported full-employment policy, the public provision of health care. His worry, remarkably, is that America is too egalitarian. His signature policy -- the 9-9-9 tax reform proposal -- would institute a regressive consumption tax nationally and starve Social Security and Medicare. It would redistribute income upward. No wonder blacks overwhelmingly repudiate him and his tea party allies. <br> Cain also recently declared: "I don't believe racism in this country today holds anybody back in a big way." If there were any doubts before that he was bereft of the knowledge and sensibility required of a significant political figure, much less president, then this egregious statement should remove them. <br> A library full of careful, rigorous studies shows clearly that invidious racial discrimination and, perhaps even more consequentially, the perpetuation of disabilities inflicted by racial mistreatment in the past hurt blacks and other people of color in a broad array of domains: from commercial transactions like buying a car or purchasing a home, to dealing with police, to electoral politics, to wellness and life expectancy. <br> Of course, there has been remarkable, positive change in American racial attitudes. But recall the miserable baseline against which we mark that progress. In 1958, the Gallup Organization asked whether Americans would be willing to vote for a qualified black presidential candidate nominated by their own party. Three in five white Americans answered "no." <br> The election of Barack Obama is a vivid illustration of the extent to which racial attitudes have evolved. But neither Obama's residency in the White House, nor Herman Cain's current surge, nor the emergence of an African-American affluent class negates the fact that fresh racism and the unhealed wounds of racial injuries inflicted in the past give rise to conditions, observable everywhere, that dishonor the best of American ideals. It is because of Herman Cain's denial of these realities that most blacks will continue, understandably, to view him as unfit for high political office. 
 Here's one idea that could unite Main Street voters with Occupy Wall Street protesters -- raise taxes only on individuals making more than $1 million a year and use that revenue to pay for President Barack Obama's jobs bill, which is made up of bipartisan policy proposals to get the economy moving again. <br> It is an audacious idea, brewed first by Sen. Charles Schumer and backed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as preferable to the president's repeated call to roll back the Bush tax cuts on any household making more than $250,000 a year. <br> There are several reasons that this new millionaire's tax is both smart politics and smart policy. <br> First, an astounding 75% of Americans back raising taxes on individuals making more than $1 million a year, according to an October 5 Washington Post/ABC News poll. This includes 89% of Democrats, 75% of independents, 57% of Republicans and 55% of Tea Party supporters. This isn't subtle -- it's a slam-dunk. <br> The reason this resonates is because it focuses exclusively on the super-rich rather than lumping them in with upper middle class voters who might be called the working wealthy. A household income of $250,000 per year is far from jet set, especially in more expensive areas of the country, where some two-parent working families could find themselves taxed at the same rate as the local billionaire. <br> The best option of all in my book would not be a targeted surcharge but broad-based tax reform that could actually lower all rates to spur growth while closing some (but not all) loopholes to raise revenues. This is the broad goal set out by the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson commission, a vision championed by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and even once campaigned on by a candidate named Barack Obama. But expecting this divided, dysfunctional Congress to tackle anything as comprehensive as tax reform without tearing each others' throats out seems naïve in the extreme. Still, I'll keep hope alive for a simpler, fairer, flatter tax code. <br> But in its absence, we need a way to pay for a jobs plan so that it doesn't put our nation deeper into debt. A surtax on people making more than $1 million a year is one way to do it. Conservatives will claim that any such proposal is class warfare, but that reflexive attack is in danger of losing its sting because of overuse. Small business owners might have been able to identify with a $250,000 threshold, but creating a populist spin in defense of those who make more than $1 million a year will be a tougher sell. <br> Fifty-eight percent of Americans think the president's jobs plan will help the economy, according to that Washington Post/ABC News poll. And while Obama's job approval is at historic lows, he is still three times more popular than members of Congress. More to the point, the president is perceived to be more concerned about middle class Americans than the congressional GOP by a margin of 52%-32%, while the GOP is seen as more focused on the rich, by a deep margin of 70%-17% -- not a great ratio in a time of populist anger. <br> Those professional cynics who parade under the term "Washington insiders" are confidently claiming that Reid's proposal is dead on arrival, just like they did with the Bowles-Simpson and "Gang of Six" plans before it. These pronouncements help create conventional wisdom, but they are not conclusive. After all, the political impetus of this new plan is clearly related to corralling votes -- swing-state senators who would have faced greater pushback on the $250,000 rollback of the Bush tax cuts. Any Democrats who are resisting this proposal in favor of the full $250,000 are the real class warriors, supporting tax hikes out of general redistributive principle even though regions with a high cost of living would suffer. <br> With economic anxieties again increasing, taking action on at least large swaths of the jobs plan seems like a political and policy imperative, especially since the plan itself was built on proposals that have gained bipartisan support in the past. <br> Cutting corporate taxes in exchange for closing loopholes, retaining payroll tax cuts and creating a public-private infrastructure bank should retain broad support -- but real deficit hawks should recognize that these efforts need to be paid for, and cutting discretionary spending alone to deal with the deficit right now would be deeply counterproductive in terms of overall economic growth. <br> A surtax on the super-rich is the least painful way to do that in the short term -- it's not class warfare as much as a call for additional sacrifice from those who can most afford it to help get our country moving again. 
 They just don't get it. <br> Two months after playing partisan chicken with the debt-ceiling limit and leading directly to a U.S. downgrade, our dysfunctional divided Congress was at it again -- carelessly bringing the country to the brink of a government shutdown. <br> This time the debate was over disaster-relief spending. Republicans wanted to ensure that any extra money needed for FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Irene would be matched by cuts in spending elsewhere. The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the House bill as a form of extortion and so the stalemate continued through the weekend, bringing FEMA within days of being insolvent. Ultimately, the two parties came to an agreement that funded FEMA but simply kicked the prospect of a government shutdown to right before Thanksgiving. <br> It used to be that at least a disaster could unite Congress to think beyond party politics. But we are living in a time where extreme measures are used every day. The threat of a government shutdown is seen as negotiating leverage. Threat of filibuster has gone from a rare event to a routine parliamentary procedure. <br> There is no question why Washington is broken. The two parties have become so polarized they seem unable to reason together. Special interests threaten to eclipse the national interest. <br> Hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from being able to solve the serious problems we face. <br> That was the unambiguous message Standard Poor's sent the United States with its downgrade in August that specifically cited an atmosphere of partisan gamesmanship. It was echoed by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- a Bush and Obama appointee -- in remarks at the Jackson Hole conference in Wyoming. We have a political crisis, which is compounding the fiscal crisis. <br> This is not an elite concern, but a problem increasingly recognized by everyday Americans far away from the Beltway. <br> "Members of Congress are intelligent but they have no common sense," Darlene Swithers of Pennsylvania recently told The New York Times. "They fight too much. They should be put in a corner and take a time out and start working together as a team. I'm so sick of hearing Republicans this and Democrats that." <br> This is the articulation of the impulse that led 77% of Americans to tell CNN that Congress acts like "spoiled children" rather than responsible adults. <br> This latest flirtation with a government shutdown just shows how tone-deaf Congress has become. House Republicans played politics with disaster relief and felt that they would be rewarded by their base if they do so. Their all-or-nothing mindset leads them to the logic that Democrats will be to blame for a shutdown if they simply refuse to do what Republicans demand. <br> What's doubly dumb about this particular battle is that it is over relatively small change -- some $2.5 billion in disaster relief at a time when a bipartisan joint super committee is struggling to find a minimum of $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction. President Obama and Speaker John Boehner and 35 senators have encouraged the super-committee to go bigger -- to $4 trillion in deficit and debt reduction -- the amount almost achieved by so-called grand bargain that failed to materialize in August. Bipartisan committees like Bowles-Simpson and the Gang of Six -- as well as a plan proposed by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan -- also set out different paths to a $4 trillion savings, bringing us to a more sound fiscal footing. <br> We know what such a step will require: spending cuts and some revenue increases, best achieved with tax reform and entitlement reform. The far right opposes any tax increases while the far-left opposes any entitlement reform. But there should still be room to reason together. For example, one solution would be to cut tax rates but close select loopholes, allowing higher revenue to be raised from lower rates. Unfortunately, some folks on the far-right have decided that raising revenue at all will be considered a tax-hike and a violation of the anti-tax pledge. That all-or-nothing logic threatens to doom the deliberations that democratic republics depend on. <br> It doesn't have to be this way. For most of the 20th century, congressional voting patterns were clustered toward the center -- the presence of conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans allowed for creative across-the-aisle coalitions. But in the past two decades, as the parties have become more ideologically and geographically stratified, the capacity for coalition building has decreased. The rigged system of redistricting and closed partisan primaries have helped further polarize the process as centrists are pushed out of both parties. <br> Likewise, in the past divided government has not meant dysfunction. America accomplished the Marshall Plan and the National Highway System under divided government during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. The achievements of the Reagan era came with liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill at the helm of the House of Representatives. The two men disagreed deeply on political philosophy, but they had the capacity to disagree agreeably, sit together and tell stories at the end of the day. (And not incidentally, Reagan and O'Neill were able to form a bipartisan commission to help fix social security in the 1980s by requiring both parties to jump in together). Even Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich found ways to work together despite intense personal dislike, achieving welfare reform and turning deficits into a surplus. <br> But now, politics is increasingly seen as ideological blood sport and a zero-sum game. The parties are willing to politicize disaster relief and bring our nation to the brink of default. They oppose even bipartisan plans for fear that the other side might gain politically. Trust is eroded and replaced with the demonization of disagreement. This approach is fundamentally incompatible with the facts of divided government, which requires some degree of compromise based on defining common ground and then building on it. <br> Some hyper-partisans in Washington are simply looking to the next election to solve these problems. But the problem of extreme partisanship is bigger than one election. During this cancer in our body politic will require a cultural change. It will require actively supporting responsible voices in both parties. It will require pushing for policies like redistricting reform and open primaries. There need to be procedural reforms in congress as well -- for example, ending the special interest weapon of "secret holds" and requiring that filibusters be conducted in person. <br> In a larger sense, we need to rediscover some forgotten wisdom from the founding fathers. As Thomas Jefferson said in his first inaugural address, after a bitterly hard-fought campaign, "every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle." We need to remember what President Lyndon Johnson used to say: "I am an American, a Texan, and a Democrat -- in that order." <br> We have been through much tougher times as a nation before and emerged stronger. The danger today is that this crisis is self-inflicted and self-indulgent. The parties need to remember that they are not the purpose of our politics -- and even though they might be polarized, the vast majority of the American people are not. 
 There is a popular misconception in politics today that the American political system is broken because Washington can't accomplish anything meaningful. This is not true. The system is working entirely as intended -- bumps, bruises, and all. <br> One must not confuse broken government with slow government. Washington is stalled. It's being pulled in opposite directions by competing visions of government. In 2008, the American people elected a liberal president, House and Senate. What resulted was anything but gridlock. Democrats passed an unprecedented stimulus package, Obama Care, and the Frank-Dodd bill. In 2010, the country revolted, swung back to the right and elected a conservative House, the likes of which has not been seen before. <br> As a result, we are in the midst of a serious philosophical battle over the future of this country -- a battle between a small, limited government system and a big government entitlement state. The nature of our Constitution requires that the American people decide the direction of this country, not Washington. And until the American people decide, there will be arguments, division and gridlock. <br> Our country does not undergo dramatic changes in political philosophy, for better or for worse, overnight. It is a slow, painful process and has been throughout our history. Our Founding Fathers foresaw this. <br> In Federalist No. 10 James Madison wrote, "The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man. ... A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power ... have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good." <br> For this reason, the Founders constructed a democratic republic that requires national dialogue in order to form consensus on crucial issues. At stake today are two serious debates: one over a nationalized health care system that will fundamentally change the direction of this country, and a second over record levels of government spending sure to redraw our political landscape for many years to come. <br> The arena for that debate is not always pretty and the results are not always good, but the American people get it right over time. As Charles Krauthammer recently wrote, "This is the future of government-worker power and the solvency of the states. It deserves big, serious, animated public debate." <br> Much of the ire of this debate is directed at the tea party, a grass-roots conservative populace whose arrival has put a restraining order on Washington's spending and growth. Since the historic Republican victories in the 2010 elections, the tea party and Democrats have locked horns over every major policy decision, from taxes to spending to health care. <br> Critics of the tea party lay the blame on them as the do-nothing obstructionists. But unlike the events we saw in Madison, Wisconsin, the tea party has slowed and even reversed the course of Washington all within the bounds of the political system. Other critics of the tea party have gone so far as to label their resistance to President Obama's agenda as racist, most recently actor Morgan Freeman. Those accusations do nothing to help improve the national debate and "fix" Washington. It is odd, too, when the tea party just helped Herman Cain surge to victory in Florida's latest straw poll. <br> Moreover, there are steps that both parties can take to improve the status quo in Washington. Bipartisan agreements are on the table, such as free trade agreements and corporate tax reform, which can, and should, be passed. But the real debate over spending, entitlement reform and health care will not be settled anytime soon. <br> Without this debate, which is sure to get uglier and nastier, we wouldn't be having a national discussion about the long-term sustainability of ballooning entitlements. We wouldn't recognize the crisis of our exploding federal deficit. And we wouldn't acknowledge the need for fiscal restraint and responsibility. <br> Don't mistake broken government for the growing pains of a democratic republic. In the end, a slow, restrained government is a more thoughtful, careful, and hopefully good, government. 
 In a call to action on the American economy, President Obama entered a deeply divided U.S. Capitol on Thursday to propose a decidedly bipartisan package of policies backed with an urgent message: "Pass this bill now." <br> The address before a joint session of Congress was greeted with now-routine hyperpartisan skepticism, even before its contents were announced. But this was not a windy inspirational speech; instead it was a direct policy appeal full of specifics. <br> The biggest takeaway is that all the major policies the president proposed were rooted in past bipartisan support. That good faith effort to bridge the deep partisan divides in Washington deserves something more than predictable spin -- and, in turn, the American people deserve some concerted action on the economy from Congress. <br> There were flashes of clear common ground. Among the policy proposals greeted with rare bursts of cross-aisle applause were proposals to form a public-private infrastructure bank, cut the corporate tax rate while closing loopholes, pass free trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, and institute tax incentives for corporations to hire veterans returning home from war. <br> The Infrastructure Bank is emblematic of the opportunity at hand. There is already bipartisan legislation introduced in the Senate, backed by Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry and Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. Its supporters include such unlikely allies as the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. By leveraging $10 billion in federal money as seed loans -- not grants -- the bank is expected to generate up to $600 billion in economic activity, putting people to work at projects that will strengthen communities for decades to come. Critics might cry crony-capitalism, but this is as close as Washington gets to a win-win. <br> To be sure, there were plenty of areas of difference, where Democrats applauded while Republicans sat on their hands, and vice-versa. The president promised that the plan would be paid for by further cuts and a combination of tax reform and entitlement reforms. The devil will be in the details. The Joint Super-Committee was challenged to increase its own savings mandate from $1.5 trillion as part of that effort, but President Obama also announced that his administration would be putting forward an ambitious deficit reduction plan as a way of encouraging action and framing the debate. <br> He'll need to put forward an equally bold and bipartisan deficit reduction proposal, because the American Job Creation Act's estimated $450 billion price tag will provoke some rote "Stimulus II" criticism, and independent voters in particular have wised up to the fact that throwing federal money at a problem doesn't solve it. <br> Significantly, the president also spoke of the need to reform Medicare spending as a way of preserving the long-term strength of the system -- a necessity he acknowledged might alienate liberals, but in the process echoing conservative arguments to such an extent that Sen. Lindsey Graham was moved to stand up and applaud. <br> Any observer of the debt ceiling dysfunction over the summer would not get over-excited about the possibility of rational cooperation breaking out in Congress. Nonetheless, it was hopeful and heartening to hear both House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor acknowledge in interviews after the speech that there was room to work together on some of these proposals. <br> The current atmosphere is so poisonous and polarized that some Democrats were wondering whether Republicans would even oppose extending payroll tax cuts simply because they came from this president, a concern that Obama even joked about. But that level of cynicism will end up backfiring on Republicans. As weak as the president's poll numbers are, he is still much more popular than either Republicans or Democrats in Congress. <br> The audience for this speech wasn't just the assembled members of Congress -- it was the squeezed middle class and struggling small businesses that feel forgotten by Washington and frustrated by the overwhelming influence of special interests. Their anger at both big business and big government is one of the defining dynamics of our political time. A fired up President Obama persuasively made the case that inaction in the face of such economic uncertainty was itself an unacceptable cost. <br> "The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy," the president asked. The answer will be determined by the follow through in this divided government. The common ground has been defined; now it is the obligation of Congress to build upon it. Their willingness to do so will be determined by whether they hear from frustrated constituents wielding a simple message: Stop fighting and start fixing. <br> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon. <br> <em> 
 Pakistan, and Pakistani-American relations, confront their worst crises in recent memory. <br> Pakistan's economy is in free fall, and its major cities are wracked by political violence, while Pakistani attitudes toward the United States have never been worse -- a legacy of the CIA contractor who shot and killed two Pakistanis in the city of Lahore this year, the campaign of drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal regions and the unilateral American raid to kill Osama bin Laden in northern Pakistan in May. <br> On the U.S. side, there is considerable anger about Pakistan's unwillingness or inability to constrain Taliban groups based on its territory that are killing American soldiers in Afghanistan and a perception that while U.S. aid flows in large amounts to Pakistan, it continues to harbor enemies of America. <br> As a result, the rupture in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship may be the most serious ever. Some members of Congress are calling for the freezing of U.S. aid to Pakistan, while the Pakistani government has demanded that U.S. Special Forces troops who have been training elements of its armed forces return home. <br> A further rupture in relations between the two countries would mean placing crippling constraints on American aid, ending dialogue and curtailing cooperation on attacking terrorists. <br> Pakistan is the second most populous nation in the Muslim world and is armed with nuclear weapons. The United States cannot allow such an important country and an ally of the past three decades to become an enemy. <br> In fact, the two nations have many interests in common. The U.S. counterterrorism program in South Asia would be crippled without Pakistan's help. And fostering a stable and prosperous Pakistan would reduce the risks of a nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan, which has been a central goal of American statecraft since the late 1990s. <br> The general consensus in Washington, in fact, though not endorsing more extreme calls for an outright divorce, appears to hold that the only realistic strategy for rebuilding U.S.-Pakistan relations is gradual, long-term and qualified. Such an argument is hardly unreasonable, given the mutual antagonism and distrust that exists today. <br> Yet we do not agree. Waiting on events, we fear, could invite new crises and a more fundamental break in the relationship. <br> Instead, we propose a new basis for a revised yet lasting U.S.-Pakistan partnership: a collaborative agenda for Pakistan to take its place as a major power in a modernizing South Asia. <br> This concept, which we developed together with a study group of Pakistani economists, journalists and former government officials as well as their American counterparts with considerable experience in Pakistan, calls for actions within Pakistan to build the social, political and economic basis for this vision, as well as a U.S. commitment to support this agenda with critical actions -- on trade, peacemaking and technical support. <br> One important step would be a shift from a relationship in which the U.S. sends aid to Pakistan to one in which the emphasis is on trade that benefits both sides. <br> Textiles constitute 60% of Pakistani exports, half its manufacturing output and a third of its industrial employment. Yet Pakistani textiles make up less than 4% of U.S. textile imports. <br> We recommend a new effort to reduce the disproportionately high American tariffs on Pakistani textiles — as well as parallel programs to enhance U.S. and international foreign direct investment in a range of Pakistani industries — as an alternative to most U.S. civilian aid, which theoretically could amount to as much as $1.5 billion a year if all the aid available to Pakistan was actually disbursed. <br> Efforts to lower taxes on Pakistani textiles have foundered in the past because of opposition in Congress and from U.S. manufacturers, but if this effort was tied to reduced U.S. aid, it might have a better chance of being implemented. <br> On security matters, extremism and terrorism threaten both nations. Yet there is a tendency for both sides to operate in secret, from Pakistani support for militant groups who are killing American soldiers in Afghanistan to U.S. covert operations in Pakistan and drone strikes in the Pakistani tribal regions. <br> This only sets the stage for public outrage when secret activities are revealed without being grounded in the fundamental strategic justification, the shared threat that warrants working together. <br> So the time has come for the two governments to move toward joint, sustainable actions — against terrorism, militancy and insurgency — that can be agreed upon and defended in the public sphere. <br> Pakistani concerns about civilian casualties and infringements of their national sovereignty caused by American drones could be addressed with a more transparent drone program, perhaps involving the public release of some drone video footage, as well as more public explication about why certain individuals have been targeted by drones. all done more clearly under Pakistani government guidance. <br> After all, the war against the militants in the tribal regions is Pakistan's more than America's, and polling in those regions indicates that if the Pakistani military were seen as more directly responsible for the drone program, opposition to it would subside dramatically. <br> Pakistan must also get its own house in order. Economic growth has fallen to less than 3%, and inflation has run in double digits for years, reaching a peak of over 20% in 2008-09, while Pakistan has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world, with less than 2% of the population paying income tax. <br> Pakistan needs to make good on long-delayed tax reform that would boost state revenues and to pursue steps to improve the climate for foreign investment. The motivation for Pakistan to do that is the parlous state of its economy; if it maintains a 3% growth rate, given its high birth rate, the economic conditions of the Pakistani people, which are already bad, will steadily worsen. <br> We also recommend initiatives to accelerate trade throughout South Asia. Improved trade with India represents a natural source of potential growth for Pakistan and a way to ease tensions between the two states. <br> Just as after World War II former enemies France and Germany created the coal and steel common market that spawned the European Union, the more India, Pakistan and other regional players collaborate along economic lines, the more troubling political issues will be seen as nuisances in the way of an emerging regional prosperity. <br> A number of short-term initiatives could jump-start this process: allowing multiple-entry visas for businesspeople, easing restrictions on direct shipping and on rail and air links, and allowing Indian and Pakistani banks to open branches in each other's countries. <br> This will take political will in Pakistan amongst its politicians and the military, which retains a veto over all matters relating to national security. <br> Political will also have to be exercised on the U.S. side to sustain faith in a challenging but essential partnership with Pakistan. The relationship has certainly had its bad patches, but it's one that neither side can live without. <br> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. <br> <em> 
 By now, you’ve heard “fairer, flatter, simpler” repeated over and over. It was our goal with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to reform an outdated tax code that – over the last three decades – had become absurdly complicated and no longer worked for our economy. <br> We wanted to rebuild confidence in our private sector. We wanted to bring back America’s competitive edge by giving job creators freedom from punishing high taxes – and we did just that. This is the most optimistic the business community has been since the financial crisis. <br> Democrats are claiming that our bill was a giveaway to the wealthy, but if you look at some of our nation’s largest companies, they are rewarding their employees with the dollars saved by tax cuts. <br> Our nation’s largest employer, Walmart, raised wages by $2 for hourly employees working full time, along with cash bonuses and new benefits. In Tennessee, Advance Financial increased its 401(k) match from 3 to 5 percent for every employee and increased its charitable giving by 8 percent. FedEx is investing $3.2 billion in new projects, higher wages, bonuses and retirement funding. <br> Those are some nice “crumbs,” as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., likes to say. <br> Headquartered in our own Franklin, Tennessee, Acadia Healthcare announced that it will add new jobs, expand existing facilities and open new health centers nationwide to fight the opioid crisis and treat mental illness. <br> We also implemented a 20 percent deduction applying to the first $315,000 of earned joint income that will carry forward, if not used in the first year, and can be applied to reduce taxes down the road. These stores belong to our families and our neighbors – they are the lifeblood of our communities. <br> In my home state of Tennessee, this not only has economic ramifications, but cultural ones as well. Farming is not simply an occupation – it’s a lifestyle that moves day in and day out, 365 days a year. <br> Our tax cut includes a 100 percent expensing measure for new and used depreciable assets placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023. Farmers and ranchers also have the ability to immediately write off the entire cost of their new equipment, giving their productivity a boost and giving them more confidence in their future. 
 Though it took nearly seven months to be realized, the confirmation of President Trump’s inspired pick of Richard “Ric” Grenell to serve as the U. S. ambassador to Germany is now a fait accompli, and deservedly so. <br> After a delay seemingly as interminable as the fruitless Russia probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, obstreperous Democrats finally folded Thursday when the Senate voted56-42 to make Grenell our ambassador to Germany. <br> Grenell also happens to be gay, and a longtime member and supporter of Log Cabin Republicans. His confirmation marks a major milestone: Grenell has now become the highest ranking openly gay official in any Republican administration in American history. <br> The vote happened not a moment too soon, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to visit the White House Friday. A rudderless U.S. Embassy in Germany would have been a national embarrassment. But the fact that Grenell’s confirmation was allowed to languish this long is a national embarrassment unto itself. <br> In his confirmation hearing, Grenell emphasized issues of importance to the Trump administration such as strengthening security, addressing trade imbalances and boosting investment in the United States. Furthermore, he exhibited his willingness to strike a balance between the priorities of the Trump administration and constructive engagement with Germany. <br> With the exception of Stuart Milk, co-founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation, the only LGBT advocacy organization that stepped up in support of Grenell’s nomination was Log Cabin Republicans. <br> The question, of course, is rhetorical. With Grenell’s confirmation, the left loses yet another arrow in their quiver to assail President Trump with their tired accusations of anti-gay animus. <br> As a conservative Christian who happens to be gay, Grenell’s position as ambassador to Germany could well serve to bridge the divide between depressingly polarized LGBT and religious communities – in both Germany and the United States. 
 For a long time, the Democrats have been successful by scaring people into voting for them. It’s a tactic used when you can’t persuade people on policy. Americans were recently reminded of the Democrats’ usual refrain when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declared President<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Trump’s tax cuts as “Armageddon.” Mrs. Pelosi went there, relying on contrived drama, comparing a tax cut to a fight between biblical armies during the end times. <br> When the Senate GOP was discussing<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s health care bill, the Democrats’ response? “Hundreds of thousands of people will die,” delivered again by Nancy ‘We’re all gonna die’ Pelosi. <br> Keith Ellison, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was handed the Grim Reaper baton when he said this to the Progressive National Candidate Training gathering last week: “Women are dying because we are losing elections,” Mr. Ellison said, Fox News Insider reported. “We don’t have the right to lose a damn election. We have to win.” <br> And what is their argument really based on? The infantilizing of women. Underscoring Mr. Ellison’s remarks is an argument that women are so fragile, so vulnerable, that if Democrats don’t win and government doesn’t control more of your life, you’ll die. That is an inherently sexist argument, promoting the fraud that women can’t control their own lives and need a Big Brother to help them along. <br> Imagine what we could accomplish if we rejected the political class’ attempt to divide women and pit us against each other? Instead of using women’s lives as fodder for a stump speech, what if we actually committed to working together to determine what policies improve women’s lives, their health and their longevity? <br> The “Women’s March” group, arguably the main and absolutely the most visible organizing group for the Democrats, recently bemoaned the shuttering of the sex trafficking website<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/backpagecom/" target="_blank">Backpage.comand arrest of its leadership. <br> Mr. Paxton’s office noted, “As the largest online sex trafficking marketplace in the world,<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/backpagecom/" target="_blank">Backpagefacilitated the sex trafficking of innocent women and children through sites it ran for 943 locations in 97 countries and 17 languages. It was involved in 73 percent of all child trafficking cases reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.” <br> During Barack Obama’s two terms as president, “women suffered steeper declines in take home pay than men. Women also experienced sharper declines in employment and a faster rise in poverty. … On Mr. Obama’s watch, 2 million more women slipped into poverty. The poverty rate among women reached 16.1 percent — the highest level in the 20 years prior to his disastrous presidency,” economist Stephen Moore reported in this newspaper. <br> Hadley Heath Manning, the director of policy at Independent Women’s Forum, noted, “It’s very interesting that the maternal mortality rate has increased as the number of women giving birth on Medicaid has also increased. We should take a very serious look at the low quality of care some American women receive when they are shuffled into government programs rather than empowered to buy their own affordable, private health insurance.” <br> In fact, it’s poverty and women not being financially independent that keep us from being able to make the choices that best suit us. Like him personally or not, it’s undeniable that<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s policies have already improved the quality of women’s lives across the spectrum. Women’s unemployment is the lowest it’s been in 20 years. Unemployment of African-Americans is the lowest in history. <br> • 9.4 million businesses in America are owned by women. <br> • Women are graduating from college at a faster rate than men. <br> • Women make up 47 percent of the workforce and 40 percent of the family breadwinners. 
 Filing taxes is something that fills most of us with dread. We do the costly, complicated chore and can’t wait to move on. It’s usually not a day to celebrate. <br> But this year, for a change, there is good news. Thanks to the recently enacted“Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” this is the last time you will have to file your taxes under the old, outdated system. <br> For starters, it means the next time you file your taxes, you will benefit from a nearly doubled standard deduction:$12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. This change alone means greater simplicity that will allow nearly nine out of 10 people to do their taxes on a short, simple, and straightforward form next year. <br> Right now, eight of 10 Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck, leaving them one medical emergency, home repair, or other crisis away from being unable to make ends meet.Under the new system, the average tax cut for a median family of four is $2,059.For these families, more money in each paycheck isn’t crumbs—it’s a huge deal. Average families at every income level will see their federal taxes go down. This is meaningful relief for those who need it. <br> This new taxcode also makesfamilies a priority. It doubles the child tax credit so parents are getting more help with the costs of raising a family.It also provides more support for families as they plan for their futures by improving savings options for education. Under the new law, families can use 529 accounts to save for elementary, secondary, and higher education, whether that means college or a vocational school. <br> There’s a lot to look forward to, but thereality is the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” has already started to improve the lives of American families. The law has been a boon to the American economy. Unemployment is at a 17-year low, consumer confidence is near a 17-year high, and the manufacturing sector reached its highest hiring level since the recession last month, adding 380,000 workers. 
 The economy has responded well to the tax cuts that became law in January. Growth is up, as is take-home pay. But there was a glaring omission in the tax bill that President Trump signed into law: there was no cut in the capital gains tax rates that act as a brake on more jobs and investment. <br> President Trump’s appointment Wednesday of supply-side economist Larry Kudlow as head of the National Economic Council could change that. There is no more passionate advocate of having the president issue an executive order to index capital gains for inflation. Unlocking frozen assets and stimulating investment, such a move would further turbocharge the U.S. economy. <br> Eliminating the tax on inflationary capital gains makes sense on the grounds of both growth and fairness. Back in the 1980s, President Reagan included in his tax reform the indexing of much of the federal tax code for inflation, so wage earners wouldn’t be automatically bumped into higher tax brackets. <br> Larry Kudlow was then the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration. He notes that the horse-trading that led to the omission of capital gains indexation from the Reagan program “has bedeviled economists who consider it bad policy to levy a tax on inflationary gains.” <br> In other words, the capital gains tax paid on such investments can easily exceed 100 percent once inflation is factored in. <br> Kudlow quoted Robbins’ prediction that indexing capital gains for inflation starting last year would, by 2025, create an additional 400,000 jobs and boost our gross domestic product by roughly $500 billion. That would translate into an additional $3,600 for the average American household. <br> McIntosh, a former Republican congressman from Indiana, says that key White House players have recognized the pro-growth elements of such a move. He notes that his successor in Congress was Mike Pence, now the vice president, who introduced a bill to index capital gains for assets held for more than three years. One of the co-sponsors of the Pence bill was Mick Mulvaney, the current head of President Trump’s Office of Management and Budget. <br> Prior to that, President George H.W. Bush was stymied in his efforts to get capital gains reform by a Democratic Senate. Boyden Gray, President Bush’s White House legal counsel, told me that the president had extensive research done into whether he could fix the problem through an executive order. <br> At the last minute, objections were raised by Justice Department lawyers who questioned if President Bush had the legal authority to reinterpret the section of the Internal Revenue Service Code covering the definition of the word “cost.” <br> Since then, the legal case for the president’s authority to act has grown. Charles Cooper, who headed the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under President Regan, and attorney Vincent Colatriano wrote in 2012 in the Harvard Journal of Law Public Policy that jurisprudential developments over the last two decades have confirmed ... that Treasury has regulatory authority to index capital gains for inflation. <br> A 2005 case affirmed the right of a federal agency to interpret an ambiguous provision of the law, while a 2011 case made clear that Treasury Department regulations could be interpreted in this way. <br> Ryan Ellis, the former director of federal tax policy for Americans for Tax Reform, said Kudlow understands that “now is the time, and now is the moment” for President Trump to act. 
 President Trump’s style has dismayed many on the right as well as the left. But when it comes to actions, conservatives find much to delight them. <br> While the 2016 presidential elections were underway, policy analysts at The Heritage Foundation (my employer and one of the nation’s leading think tanks) compiled a six-volume series of conservative, research-based policy recommendations for the next president. <br> At the end of 2017, we reviewed all 334 recommendations presented in our “Mandate for Leadership” series and found that the Trump administration had embraced fully 64 percent of them. That’s nearly two out of three – and that’s very good indeed. <br> Most Americans are already familiar with some of the conservative agenda items adopted in the last year. <br> And many are aware of how Congress acted on another key recommendations to exercise its authority under the long-ignored Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn ill-considered rules implemented by regulatory agencies. During the first few months of its session, Congress used CRA resolutions to eliminate 14 major rules finalized by the Obama administration in its waning days. <br> By year’s end, the Trump administration had withdrawn or delayed 1,500 proposed regulations. It has made a difference. On Dec. 14, the administration reported that the regulatory rollback had saved the American economy $8.1 billion, and would save another $9.8 billion in fiscal 2019. <br> By the end of 2017, the Senate had confirmed 12 circuit court of appeals judges – the largest number ofappellate judges confirmed during the first year of any president in history. Why does that matter? Because most federal cases stop at the appellate level. Only one of every 700 cases heard by these courts goes on to the Supreme Court. <br> From pulling America out of the unaffordable and unworkable Paris Protocol on Climate Change to ending the damaging Obama era regulations on net neutrality, the Trump administration has advanced a broad conservative agenda on dozens more fronts in 2017. 
 On Wednesday you could hear howls of misery and disbelief coming from Democrats and Never Trumpers. What now, you may ask? <br> After all, the power and popularity of the president’s tax cuts has already hit. His rolling back of regulations and the killing of the ObamaCare mandate has already fueled an economic renaissance. What else could have made the morose even less amiable? <br> It was actually the most debilitating news of all: The Trump campaign announced that 2016 campaign digital guru Brad Parscale is the 2020 campaign manager for the president’s re-election bid, confirming the happy likelihood that people will be saying the words “President Trump” until early 2025. <br> But for those who have been living in the 24/7 Never Trump fantasy universe – working on their fake Russian dossiers and “insurance policies” to derail President-elect Trump from becoming President Trump – this fresh proof that he’s not going away dealt a blow like no other. <br> The frantic attempts during the past year by the president’s opposition to nullify the election were meant to achieve his removal from office, one way or another. Nope, didn’t happen. <br> Remember the idiotic obsession with the 25th Amendment to the Constitution? Thinking the Cabinet would declare the president “incapable of performing his duties” and remove him from office? Yeah, good for a laugh, but nope, didn’t happen. <br> And the Michael Wolff book would be the death knell to Trump’s presidency. Well, someone did leave the White House after that dumpster fire, but it wasn’t President Trump. <br> For those who thought they could make Donald Trump and his family miserable or afraid, the president’s commitment to another four years confirms they continue to underestimate the man and still don’t understand what the revolution of 2016 was all about. <br> Instead of the government celebrating a strong economy, the Obama administration touted driving Americans onto food stamps, and boasted about how many people were forced into ObamaCare, making even access to health care a pipe dream. <br> The Washington Examiner reports: “With unprecedented speed, the Trump administration has already implemented nearly two-thirds of the 334 agenda items called for by the Heritage Foundation, a pace faster than former President Reagan who embraced the conservative think tank’s legendary‘Mandate for Leadership’ blueprint.” <br> Paraphrasing Binion, the Examiner article also states that the president “hasn’t just focused on one agenda area, but he and his team has pushed through administrative moves on foreign policy, deregulation, immigration, tax reform and health care, moves often ignored by the media.” <br> Even some Democrats are beginning to understand the extent of the Trump sea change. From the liberal magazine New Republic: “Last year, it seemed certain that he would be a one-term president – if he even lasted that long. But he has a plausible path to victory in 2020.” 
 While the nation's capital is at its most divided, a cadre of Republicans and Democrats -- refugees from earlier administrations -- is quietly reaching over political divides to get the nation's work done. <br> Despite the loud rhetoric from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, there are a core group of us who have served in multiple administrations, who hail from industries outside of Washington, who hold different points of view, who find ways to collaborate. <br> I am by no means unusual among a strata of people who line up on one side of the aisle but find ways to work with the other side. <br> In 2009, 16 CEOs from consumer goods companies joined me as members of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation. Working collaboratively with public health agencies and the Obama administration, the conservatives and liberals among us joined forces to implement the largest voluntary food and beverage industry marketplace initiative, ultimately removing 6.4 trillion calories from the American diet by reducing the sugar and fat content of hundreds of products. In 2005, as U.S. Commissioner General I worked alongside governors – from both parties -- and the private sector. We overcame our ideological differences and many challenges and together launched the US Pavilion at the Aichi World EXPO, formerly known as the World’s Fair. <br> “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it,” Mark Twain wryly noted. His observation is shared by many across the political spectrum with whom I have worked. <br> We politely keep commentary to ourselves unless it’s relevant to the discussion at hand. We focus on fixing the problem--no rat holes are allowed. Tension may reign at the beginning of each relationship as battle lines are quickly drawn and cynicism prevails, but soon data-driven progress brings a continuity of results, a collegial environment and a celebration of success. Over dinner or on the Acela, good humor prevails as we find ourselves sharing stories and learning about each other’s children, grandchildren, lives and challenges. We agree to disagree but commit to the facilitation of success. We become friends. 
 When the Republican-controlled Congress first approved its tax bill in December, most Democrats believed it would be a political loser for the GOP. Indeed, a New York Times poll found that just 37 percent of Americans approved of the plan. “To pass a bill of tax cuts and have it be so unpopular with the American people is an amazing achievement for the Republicans — it’s never been done before,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.)<a href="https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/943566295571804162" target="_blank" title="twitter.com">crowed. <br> He’s not crowing any more. In January support had risen to 46 percent, and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/business/economy/tax-overhaul-survey.html?mtrref=undefinedgwh=BE9F87CA13BE95CC196994BC3E60A702gwt=pay" target="_blank" title="www.nytimes.com">this weekit reached a 51 percent majority. Meanwhile, disapproval has dropped from 57 percent in December to 45 percent today. That is a swing of 26 points. <br> It is taking time for voters to figure this out. In 2001, when President George W. Bush<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/president-bush-signs-tax-cut-into-law-june-7-2001-223868" target="_blank" title="www.politico.com">passedhis across-the-board tax cuts, his message was simple: Every American who pays taxes will get a tax cut. But in 2017, Republicans overhauled more of the entire tax code. They cut tax rates and<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/?utm_term=.9e0309d16b05" target="_blank" title="www.washingtonpost.com">doubledthe standard deduction but also eliminated many traditional deductions for those who itemize. As a result, a lot of taxpayers didn’t know whether they would end up winners or losers. <br> Now, more Americans are starting to discover that they are winners. Millions are starting to receive their Trump tax cuts as employers lower their tax withholdings, leaving more money in their paychecks. And the bill will become more popular as more people learn the good news. Even now,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/business/economy/tax-overhaul-survey.html?mtrref=undefinedgwh=D117CDC919EB81A438C5665C45D1BEDFgwt=pay" target="_blank" title="www.nytimes.com">only one-third of Americansthink they will see an income tax cut. Many voters are going to be pleasantly surprised when they discover their taxes are being reduced thanks to President Trump and Republican lawmakers. And that does not take into account the bonuses and raises that many Americans are receiving from their employers because of the corporate tax cuts — or the wage increases they will get from the economic growth that tax reform unleashes in the months and years ahead. <br> Democrats are in a bind because they voted against that increase in take-home pay. The growing public support for tax reform is especially a problem for the five vulnerable Senate Democrats running for reelection in states that Trump won<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/?utm_term=.c3f404f42a06" target="_blank" title="www.washingtonpost.com">by double digits. All of them will have a hard time explaining why they sided with the “resistance” and opposed giving their constituents a tax cut. 
 The mainstream media is cynically using a lot of traumatized teens from Parkland, Fla., in their latest shameful attack on President Trump and the National Rifle Association. <br> <b>Tired of Facebook blocking Conservative Conversation? Click here for a free subscription to Todd's weekly newsletter; a must-read for Conservatives!</b> <br> You sicken me, said one child on CBS. President Trump, you control the House of Representatives, you control the Senate, and you control the executive [branch]. You haven’t taken a single bill for mental health care or gun control and passed it. And that’s pathetic. We’ve seen a government shutdown, we’ve seen tax reform, but nothing to save our children’s lives. Are you kidding me? You think now is the time to focus on the past and not the future to prevent the death of thousands of other children? <br> Another student threatened to dismantle the NRA and others hurled vile profanities at President Trump and law-abiding gun owners. <br> Honestly, we can't fault the kids. They have been through an unimaginable ordeal, and long before that, their minds were poisoned by liberals who believe there's something wrong with the Second Amendment. <br> And now CNN and MSNBC are using the kids as political pawns. 
 Last week President Trump’s tax cuts started to get personal as people across the country logged into their bank accounts and began to find increases in their paychecks. The doom and gloom tax cut scenario the Democrats tried to sell the American people started to become exposed as nothing more than highly charged rhetoric. This from a party desperate to justify why not a single one of them voted in favor of letting people keep more of their money. <br> As people’s wallets began expanding this week it just got real. More money back in the hands of people of every income level - brought to you by President Trump and the Republicans in Congress. <br> In an interview with the Washington Post, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was asked what keeps her up at night. Her answer: the tax cuts. Specifically, she calls them a “dark cloud.” <br> Mrs. Pelosi is worth $29.35 million and ranked the 15th richest member of Congress out of 541 rankings, but what keeps her tossing and turning on her high thread-count sheets all night is letting the American people keep more of their hard-earned money. Let that sink in. <br> It’s worth pausing for a moment to remember how far we’ve come since President Obama’s promises of hope and change, which proved to be nothing more than a clever campaign slogan. He left office with our country needing the hope and change he promised more than ever. <br> For four straight years — 2012-2015 — the number of people on food stamps didn't drop below 45 million; one out of every seven people in the United States. In President Trump’s first year in office, before the tax cuts even took effect, that number was down to 42.2 million. <br> Unemployment for women is at an 18 year low, and the overall unemployment rate is the lowest its been since 2000. <br> It’s becoming clear that Democrats have a messaging problem, as they continue to tell people that getting back more of their money is bad, even as people across the country are starting to see more of their money in the paychecks. But damn the cognitive dissonance, full speed ahead. <br> Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., is also on message, having dismissed $1,000 in bonuses as not going “very far” for most people. 
 President Trump discussed many important issues in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but left out one of the most important – the need for major reforms in two giant entitlement programs for senior citizens, Social Security and Medicare, that account for most mandatory federal spending. <br> With control of both houses of Congress and the White House, Republicans have the opportunity now to make the reforms needed to prevent these two critically important programs from running out of money in the decades ahead. <br> Republicans in Congress have shown that when they stand together they can do big and necessary things – witness their passage of tax cuts at the end of last year. Now with a new year and an administration that has found its footing, it’s time for a moonshot to save America’s entitlement programs before they go broke and bankrupt us all. <br> I understand as well as anyone that many politicians believe that the mere mention of reforms to Social Security and Medicare will raise the ire of senior citizens. <br> Seniors are tired of being manipulated on these issues by organizations claiming to speak for them. Mature Americans are smart enough to understand that the dire risk to our entitlement programs will not only hurt them, but their children and grandchildren who depend on their sustainability. <br> After years of deficit spending – especially considering the excesses of the Obama administration – these programs still remain the top contributors to our rising national debt and deficit, with $2.9 trillion of the debt held by the two Social Security Trust Funds. Washington’s worst-kept secret is that Social Security will soon be insolvent. <br> There are four straightforward action items that Congress should take this year to set Social Security on a path of sustainable future solvency: <br> 2) Gradually lower Social Security benefits for high-income earners, while keeping low- income earner benefits the same. <br> 4) Provide all earners the ability to save more with Early Retirement Accounts (ERAs), which provide tax-deductible savings and allow future retirees to begin accessing funds in their ERAs at age 62. <br> House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has made it clear he intends to tackle entitlement reform this year, and he has already entered into discussions on the issue with President Trump. This is a brave and responsible position, but he will need all the help he can get to persuade more timid politicians in the United States Senate to follow his lead. <br> The chamber that calls itself “the world’s greatest deliberative body” can actually live up to its name by buckling down and working together with the president and committed colleagues in the House to fix these entitlement programs for future generations. But they will need courageous and visionary leaders like President Trump and Paul Ryan to show them the way. <br> Along with cutting taxes, one of President Reagan’s major successes on the domestic front was his landmark Social Security reform, which he signed into law in 1983 after working closely with Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill of Massachusetts. 
 The future of President Trump’s first term—and prospects for a second—hinge on the forthcoming immigration battle; so he shouldn’t say anything in Tuesday night’s State of the Union Address that locks him into a bad deal. <br> And that is what’s on the table now: a bad deal. <br> The president’s “deplorable” supporters love him for unapologetically pointing out obvious truths long-since abandoned in Washington: the rule of law matters, borders should be enforced, immigration policy should be rational, and patriotism should be the centerpiece of unity. Their love for him is even stronger today than on Election Day, but that support, and ballot box enthusiasm, could be shaken by a bad deal on immigration. <br> Many supporters of the president declared the framework a brilliant negotiating tactic. Democrats, they say, would be foolish to reject a deal that affords amnesty to three times more illegal immigrants than President Obama ever did; and if Democrats do reject the deal, it proves they don’t actually want to solve immigration and are the obstructionists the president says they are. <br> But don’t we already know that? When will Republicans finally realize Democrats won’t work with this president? And if some Senate Democrats eventually do cross the aisle, the reason matters greatly—electoral imperatives are good, political giveaways are not. Democrats have staked their entire future on resistance, Russian collusion/obstruction, and eventually impeachment—not policy. This deal should not be about revealing Democrats for the hypocrites they are, but about securing our borders. <br> I believe strongly in the latter approach—not because I don’t trust President Trump to make a good deal, but because I don’t trust Congress to implement that deal. If Trump could wave a magic wand for the future, even with the current proposed framework, we would get permanent security measures and immigration restrictions in exchange for amnesty for 1.8 million illegals. Not a good deal, but defensible. However, future administrations and unaccountable bureaucracies will be left to implement any such deal—an untenable situation based on the history of previous immigration deals: amnesty always happens, security never does. 
 Opinion poll after opinion poll shows that a Democratic wave is building. If the November midterm elections were held today, Republican control of the House and the Senate would be in jeopardy. <br> Make no mistake about it, conservatives should not underestimate what a complete and total disaster it would be to lose one or both houses of Congress. Not only would President Trump’s conservative agenda come to a screeching halt; we could look forward to two years of non-stop partisan witch hunts by Democrats thoroughly committed to destroying President Trump. All is not lost. Ten months is an eternity in politics. The truth is, however, that there is only one person who can turn back this impending blue wave – President Trump himself. We have been in this predicament before. Months before the 2016 election, the polls showed Donald Trump would lose and that the Republican Senate majority might go down in flames with him. President Trump proved the pollsters and the pundits wrong last time and he can do it again. The president didn’t defy the odds and capture the White House (and save the Senate) by following the failed establishment playbook – and he won’t save Republican majorities in Congress by following the establishment playbook this year either. To save Republican majorities in both chambers, President Trump must rally the coalition that swept him into office. To do so he must refocus on the issues that motivated his working-class base – and he can start with his State of the Union address Tuesday night. First, and most importantly, the president must deliver on immigration. If you asked Trump voters to name just one of his campaign promises they would say “build a wall.” <br> The president needs to make it clear that there will be no deal to allow the roughly 700,000 illegal immigrants brought here as children – and are now protected from deportation under DACA – to stay in the U.S if it doesn’t include funding for the wall. Period. Secondly, the president must focus now on infrastructure. President Trump’s tax reform package was a tremendous victory for conservatives and for American workers, and its long-lasting positive impacts on the economy cannot be understated. However, if the president really wants to deliver on his promise to Make America Great Again then he absolutely must prioritize an infrastructure plan to rebuild American roads, bridges, railways and airports. Investing in America’s infrastructure is an investment in the working-class voters who are the backbone of the Trump base. <br> For far too long, the battle over infrastructure has been between Democrats who propose spending mountains of federal dollars and Republicans who simply oppose the effort. There is another way forward, which President Trump should embrace – free-market approaches that will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure without bankrupting us. <br> Take, for instance, airport infrastructure. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/321811-lawmakers-push-to-lift-cap-on-passenger-fees-for-airport-upgrades" target="_blank">has a proposal in the Housethat would remove the federally imposed cap on the passenger facility charge (PFC), thereby allowing airports to raise the revenue necessary to meet<a href="http://www.aci-na.org/content/aci-na-infrastructure-needs-study" target="_blank">more than $100 billion in infrastructure needsand creating tens of thousands of new jobs. <br> Third, President Trump should remind voters that he has broken from the disastrous Bush-Obama foreign policy approach. The president should remind Americans that his foreign policy isn’t about “isolationism” and it doesn’t represent an abdication of America’s responsibility. At the same time, it does end the failed foreign policy adventurism of his predecessors.</i> <br> The very people who opposed President Trump in the general election, who refused to vote for him, and who ridiculed him and his voters are now pushing him to do the bidding of the establishment on issues like dismantling our public lands. 
 Liberal billionaire George Soros grabbed headlines at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday by attacking internet giants Google and Facebook. Conveniently ignoring his own investment in these companies, Soros branded them a “menace to society.” <br> “They deliberately engineer addiction to the services they provide,” Soros said. “This can be very harmful, particularly for adolescents. There is a similarity between internet platforms and gambling companies. Casinos have developed techniques to hook gamblers to the point where they gamble away all their money, even money they don’t have. Something very harmful and maybe irreversible is happening to human attention in the digital age. Not just distraction or addiction: social media companies are inducing people to give up their autonomy.” <br> But let’s remember: it’s money he made off the backs of the poor and the working class. Soros’ gambling happens to have wrecked the lives of millions of working people, not least in the United Kingdom, where his manipulation of the currency markets in the early 1990s caused a deep recession and untold misery for millions. <br> Soros claimed that President Trump is attempting to turn America into “a mafia state,” and – really amping up the hyperventilation (was it the mountain air?) – he argued that “not only the survival of open society but the survival of our entire civilization is at stake. The rise of leadership such as Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States have much to do with this.” <br> In this one absurdly overblown sentence, the ludicrous hysteria of the Trump-hating elite is revealed. What on Earth is Soros talking about? <br> It is particularly upsetting to me personally to see Soros, a fellow Hungarian, make these over- the-top-claims, given our shared history. My father was a contemporary of Soros in Hungary, where both experienced an actual assault on the open society in the form of Soviet-backed communism. 
 With a successful first year under his belt and the wind in his sails, President Trump is set to outline the record-setting accomplishments of his inaugural year and priorities for his second year in office when he delivers his first State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday night. <br> Whether it’s a record stock market, 17-year low in unemployment, 17-year low in illegal border crossings or growing American optimism, the president has many successes to tout. <br> According to senior White House officials familiar with the president’s prepared speech, President Trump will cast an inspiring vision for building “a safe, strong and proud America” for years to come. <br> Advanced excerpts of the president’s speech show that he plans to say: “We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work, we want every child to be safe in their homes at night, and we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.” <br> Senior staff suggest that President Trump’s first State of the Union address will be “hopeful, visionary, patriotic, strong and unifying,” but they also say that America will see a softer side of the president. He intends to speak to the American people directly from the heart. <br> On policy issues, expect to see President Trump take a victory lap on the American Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He plans to tout the windfall in employee bonuses – estimated by USA Today to be worth at least $1.7 billion for more than 1.3 million U.S. workers. The president is also expected to call attention to pledges by businesses to return manufacturing to America and new hiring that has followed his tax reform plan’s passage. <br> Looking forward, President Trump will also push for $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. He intends to spotlight the need for rebuilding our depleted infrastructure to help America compete globally and create jobs, improve productivity, and keep Americans safe on roads and railways. <br> The president will also address illegal immigration and DACA head-on. He will share his intention to help the so-called “Dreamers” – immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children through no fault of their own. But in exchange, he will require reforms to immigration and border security that will protect the jobs, safety and wages of American workers. The president will also continue his push for a wall along the porous southern border of the U.S. <br> Fresh from his trip to Davos in Switzerland, President Trump will also talk about trade, putting the world on notice that from now on, the U.S. will insist upon “fair” and “reciprocal” trade. 
 Democrats are expecting to retake control of Congress in the November midterm elections, and anti-Trump political “experts” and their media allies are predictably jumping on the Democratic bandwagon. &nbsp; <br> “History is on our side,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicts. <br> FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-wave-could-turn-into-a-flood/" target="_blank">recently suggestedthe “Democrats’ wave could turn into a flood.” <br> While the November elections will certainly be a challenge for Republicans,<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/01/09/republicans-will-keep-control-congress-this-year-heres-why.html" target="_blank">as I recently explained, Democrats shouldn’t be too overconfident. <br> But suppose the Democrats are right and the anti-Trump media get their way. What would a Democratic takeover of Congress mean for Americans? <br> Public Citizen, an anti-Trump advocacy group,<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/donald-trumps-properties-reveal-unprecedented-conflicts-of-interest-warns-public-citizen-report.html" target="_blank">recently accusedPresident Trump of “unprecedented conflicts of interest.” Why? Because Republican candidates and other individuals stayed at properties linked to the president. <br> At the same time, more than 100 Democrats have<a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/more-than-100-democrats-demand-house-investigation-of-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations/article/2643254" target="_blank">joined togetherasking the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to launch an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against President Trump. <br> Stock market slump <br> Much of the Trump boom can be traced to consumer confidence, which remains at a<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/27/news/economy/us-consumer-confidence/index.html" target="_blank">17-year high. And tax reform certainly hasn’t hurt. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/details-analysis-2017-senate-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/" target="_blank">increase America’s gross domestic product by nearly 4 percentover the long term, while creating almost 1 million full-time jobs. <br> Imagine the market shock if Democratic leadership makes it a top priority to investigate and impeach President Trump, while obstructing his pro-growth agenda of lower taxes and fewer regulations. <br> Open borders on overdrive<u> President Trump continues to take the lead on border security and is seeking $25 billion from Congress for a wall along our southern border. 
 The disconnect between what congressional Democrats are saying about the recently enacted tax cut and what is happening in the real world is so wide that it is getting difficult to see across the chasm. <br> House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who as the 15th richest member of Congress has a minimum net worth of nearly $30 million, referred to the millions of dollars in bonuses and pay hikes announced by more than 100 companies in the wake of the new tax law as “crumbs.” <br> But Pelosi is far from the only Democrat who voted against tax reform while arguing that it would be an economic “Armageddon” for everyday Americans. Behind her stands a long list of Democrats in states that Donald Trump won, in some cases by large margins, who will have to explain how they could have been so wrong. <br> Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri called the benefits of tax reform “scraps,” which sounds even worse than “crumbs.” Those “scraps” include $1,000 bonuses for all employees at the Bank of Advance in Advance, Missouri. Central Bancompany and BancorpSouth are also giving four-figure bonuses to Missouri-based employees. <br> Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota at first tried to persuade her middle-class constituents that they were facing a $10,000 tax increase. When that distortion was exposed, she quietly backtracked, although she still has not publicly acknowledged her dishonesty or apologized to state residents. <br> Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said he “introduced multiple amendments that could have put real money in the pockets of Ohioans. Instead Washington chose to cut taxes for millionaires and corporations.” But Ohioans in every tax bracket will get a tax cut, and the typical family of four with the median income will get a tax cut of more than $2,000. <br> Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana <a href="https://www.donnelly.senate.gov/newsroom/press/donnelly-bill-hikes-taxes-on-many" target="_blank">proclaimed that “instead of providing a tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the middle class, this bill cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans while raising taxes on a majority of families making less than $75,000 in the coming years.” Again, simply not true. A Tax Foundation analysis shows a tax cut for all income groups, “with some of the largest changes in after-tax income accruing to moderate-income families with children.” <br> Not only will those families be getting a tax cut instead, but Wisconsinites will also benefit in other ways. Green Bay-based Associated Bank, the state’s largest, is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour and giving employees a $500 bonus. Stevens Point-based Copperleaf Assisted Living will hand out $60,000 in bonuses to employees -- equal to the company’s entire savings from tax reform. <br> But reality is catching up to them – the reality that America’s economic future is brighter, and it’s no thanks to them. According to a recent New York Times<i> survey, “support for the law has grown significantly over the past month, and more Americans believe that they will receive a tax cut.” 
 During last Saturday's “Greg Gutfeld Show” (named after me, oddly), I went over the accomplishments made during Donald Trump’s first year -- and there were prominent ones -- from the defeat of ISIS, to the explosive economy.&nbsp; <br> I've done this summarizing before, and every time I do it, I notice that it doesn't feel as great as it should. It's as if these achievements count less because it's coming at some emotional cost that I've felt over these last 13 months. <br> Yet every day, things seem to turn out fine. Sure, we live the Trump presidency in a day by day fashion, but each day seems to be working out for the American people. Hell, even his adversaries are having to admit the guy’s tax plan has kicked the economy into a higher gear. I'm watching bonuses getting doled out by the millions, and thousands of new jobs created, thanks to his policies. <br> He's like a drunk walking home during an earthquake. Both effects (booze and seismic shakes) cancel each other out, and he makes it home in a straight line, without a scratch. <br> But this emotional fallout still exists. <br> But this is how it feels with Trump, for me -- until I slow down and see what's really going on. <br> And good news. <br> No. But in good times, we'll put up with almost anything. <br> Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years! <br> Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years! <br> Whether you like him or not, you have to credit him for targeting so much good-natured tomfoolery at a group of people who might tear him to shreds if given the chance. <br> And by responding to that tweet with anything but a smile, you're on the other side of fun. You're part of the non-fun. <br> But if you slow down and take a step back you realize that the tweet isn't reflecting unease at all -- but reveals a country operating at full steam -- so productive and peaceful that its boss can tweet out his cheerful thoughts just for kicks and giggles. <br> For the overwhelming message his tweets convey is that, hey pal, things are great, lighten up, we can have fun here. <br> Fact is, you can learn to embrace the appearance of chaos, and the churning emotional unease it causes, by taking these steps: <br> 2. Admit that there is a cost to Trump -- that such a personality/force like him will create disruption, and highly vocal animosity that can be jarring 
 Much has changed since President Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2017. But one thing has remained constant – the anger and vitriol directed at the president from the left, many Democrats, many in the media, and even some folks who call themselves Republicans. Few presidents have been so demonized and denounced. <br> The president has been accused of being incompetent, a racist, mentally ill, senile and corrupt. Investigations of his alleged collusion with Russia to win the election go on and on and on with no end in sight. <br> light reminder that being president of the US means nothing anymore, if you support Trump you should have your children taken away, etc etc <br> Now that we’ve arrived at the one-year mark of the Trump presidency, I’ve done some soul-searching regarding my support of the man elected by the American people to lead our nation. As a black woman, a mother and a veteran, am I doing the right thing to continue backing President Trump? Is he really as awful – even evil – as his critics claim? Are his ideas half-baked and dangerous? Is he harming the nation I love? <br> When I looked at the president’s policies and not just his tweets I decided that yes, I could be pro-Trump and still live my life with integrity. <br> Let me tell you why. <br> Like many people who joined me in voting for Donald Trump in 2016, I’ve attended several of his campaign rallies. I have never been more warmly welcomed. My children had surrogate parents, uncles, aunts and cousins for a night, and were enveloped in the excitement and pride of being an American. <br> Additionally, the spread between black and white unemployment, measured as the black rate minus the white rate, fell to 3.1 percent, also the lowest on record. Would I like the black jobless rate to drop to the level of the white jobless rate? Of course I would! I have no doubt that President Obama wanted this as well. But under President Trump we are moving in the right direction, and I hope the unemployment gap between the races continues to shrink. <br> All of this makes for a strong economy that is good for everyone. As one old saying goes, “you can’t have employees without employers” and as another saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats.” </b> <br> There are over 20 million veterans. Tragically, an average of 22 commit suicide every day. As a veteran, this horrible statistic is very painful for me. While we have done our fair share of haggling over health care and tax reform, the VA has not been stymied. <br> The G.I. Bill has become the “Forever G.I. Bill,” allowing veterans to now pursue educational opportunities with government financial aid with no timing restrictions. <br> Finally, as mother, I believe President Trump’s impact has been positive for my children. <br> I’ve read President Trump’s 70-point immigration plan. As a mother, I do not understand what is so un-American about terminating the outdated catch-and-release of those who have been charged with a crime that resulted in the death of another person. <br> I’ve spoken to a mother who lost her only child in a fatal car accident involving an illegal immigrant who had prior drunk driving convictions. As a mother, I do not have a child to spare. So I feel no shame in supporting President Trump’s plan to expand the grounds on which an illegal immigrant can be deported to include those convicted of multiple drunk-driving offenses. <br> Remember, we don’t lock our doors at night because we hate the people on the outside of our home. We lock our doors at night because we love the people on the inside of our home. To do anything less is to be derelict of our first duties – protecting the family and preserving our nation for the next generation. 
 A couple of months before the 2016 election, and in the crucible of then-candidate Donald Trump’s contretemps with a Muslim Gold Star family, I wrote a piece headlined “Five Reasons a Sane Person Might Still Vote for Trump.” <br> Here we are, a year into the Trump presidency, and those five reasons still explain why I would again vote for President Trump. He is on the right side of these critical issues and is actually moving forward on promises he made on the campaign trail. That is rare. <br> Federal agencies have withdrawn or delayed 1,579 planned regulatory actions. Rules already rescinded – impacting restaurants, communications companies, power plants, finance, health care, oil drilling and many other sectors – are estimated by the White House to be saving nearly $600 million annually. That number is sure to grow. <br> The Trump agenda has boosted business optimism, which has led to an upturn in capital investment. Spending by companies, which had been flat during most of the Obama era, grew 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of last year. As even the unfriendly New York Times has reported, increased capital spending is linked to rising productivity, which is essential to higher wages. <br> Two: ObamaCare. Democrats have fallen in love with ObamaCare now that the GOP has to manage it. In reality, while the health-care law has made insurance accessible to millions who could not afford it otherwise, middle-class Americans are increasingly finding that health care coverage is unaffordable. <br> Notably, ObamaCare did not rein in the steady increase in health-care costs. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that last year the average worker paid $5,714 for afamily health-insurance plan – 30 percent of the total $18,764 cost. Five years earlier a family shelled out $4,316, or 27 percent of the total $15,745 cost on average. Bottom line: health-care costs have continued to rise faster than incomes. <br> Democrats know the current system is unsustainable; their answer is to double down and give the government an even greater role. That is exactly the wrong approach. I count on the Trump White House and Republicans in Congress to pursue free-market solutions that could meaningfully alter the trajectory of spending. <br> High school is supposed to prepare kids for college. In 2016, ACT results indicate that just 38 percent of students who took the test were “college ready” in at least three out of the four subjects included: math, science, reading and English. That’s an appalling statistic, and only covers the 64 percent of the country’s young people – presumably the most able – who took the test. That’s not good enough. <br> Four: The Supreme Court. </b>The death of Justice Antonin Scalia imperiled the moderate balance of the Supreme Court. For conservatives alarmed by President Obama’s overreach and the leftward drift of judges placed in lower courts over the past eight years, the appointment of a conservative on the court was essential. Neil Gorsuch was a brilliant choice. It is highly likely that another opening will occur in the next few years. We look to the Trump White House to again choose a capable and responsible candidate. <br> State and local governments fared better in the Gallup Poll. Indeed, in 2016, 62 percent of Americans said they trust state government to handle problems and 71 percent said they trust local government to handle problems. <br> These are all critical issues. President Trump is on the right side of every one. Would I vote for him again? In a heartbeat. 
 President Trump’s frustration with congressional gridlock led him to make a bold suggestion last week:bring back congressional earmarks. But while the notion that earmarks help grease the lawmaking process is not without merit, Congress should not return to the corrupt free-for-all we banned in 2010. <br> The end of earmarks is when it became difficult to pass a federal budget without threatening to shut down the government. In 2010 Republicans, including me, ended the practice of congressional earmarking – in which individual members would agree to take a tough vote in exchange for getting a big spending project in their home district. By passing out the candy, leadership was able to shore up faltering support and build bipartisan coalitions. <br> Congress has lost that spoonful of sugar that made the tough legislation go down. While a legitimate argument can be made that Congress – and not the executive branch – should direct spending, the earmarking process had become ripe with abuse. <br> Here’s how it worked: When a tough vote was looming, leadership would routinely ask members what they wanted in exchange for their vote. In other words, what pet project would it take to get you to vote yes on a bill you don’t fully support? Need a road? Want to expand the military base in your district? Vote aye and earmarked funding for your pet project is available. <br> Earmarks also included commitments by the federal government to buy unneeded equipment, supplies, weapons, or even ships that were manufactured in a member’s home district. Leadership on both sides of the aisle greased the system with earmarks to get bills passed and to give members an accomplishment to brag about back home. <br> With the candy went the prime tool that leaders in the House and Senate used to get tough legislation to the president’s desk. <br> In 2010 – the last year earmarks were permitted – members of Congress sought earmarks for 39,000 projects totaling $130 billion, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. The two Republican senators representing my home state of Utah did well that year – with Sen. Orrin Hatch seeking 256 earmarks valued at $1.2 billion. Sen. Bob Bennett submitted 321 earmarks worth $1.36 billion. This was multiplied in each state. <br> Congress eventually grew tired of embarrassing itself, a new wave of Republicans were swept into office, and the practice was rightly ended. <br> Behind the scenes members of Congress make a valid argument that Congress has the legitimate constitutional responsibility to direct spending. They’re not wrong. But if they really want to resurrect this practice, they’re going to need to do a much better job policing abuse. 
 As President Trump nears his  first anniversary in office, he  faces an unforgiving political  landscape. Every word he says and every action he takes will either help him keep a Republican Congress or hand control to Democrats. <br> And if Dems get the gavel, impeachment could be the result. <br> Despite his denial<a href="https://nypost.com/2018/01/11/trump-blasted-for-shithole-comment-about-haiti-africa/" target="_blank">that he used the words “s---hole countries,”most of the media instantly branded him a racist. After a few days of saturation coverage, polls will show a disapproving public and the ritual beatdown will be complete. <br> That’s been the pattern for a year, and the president has managed to keep his head above water. But past performance is not a guarantee of future results — especially in an election year when passions against him are already overheating. <br> Consider that a potty-mouth president is hardly a new phenomenon. John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon said far worse things, not to mention the words Bill Clinton must have used during his Oval Office trysts. But Trump is in a unique position. <br> Not because of what he says or does, but because of the reaction to it. With over half the country needing no more reason than his election to demand his removal, and with many Democrats promising impeachment if they gain power, every mistake is potentially fatal. <br> Yet while a biased media hyperventilating is no virtue, Trump’s great flaw is that he keeps giving them ammunition. One minute he’s riding high, the next he’s running for his life. <br> Still basking in the afterglow of getting tax reform passed, Trump confidently convened a bipartisan group of congressional members for a televised meeting Wednesday on the “Dreamers” and related immigration issues. <br> The next day, the president boasted about the compliments — and then acted as if he were beloved from sea to shining sea. At a follow-up meeting, he unleashed the furies with his derogatory remarks. <br> For my money, “s---hole countries” is not by itself a racist remark. It’s certainly crude and shouldn’t be said by a president, but those countries are a total mess. Central America is the murder capital of the world, and Haitians have been fleeing their country for years because they’ve given up hope it can be fixed. <br> You don’t have to be a racist to conclude that isn’t sound immigration policy, and that America should pick the immigrants who can contribute to its prosperity and security. Indeed, there is a growing bipartisan consensus on that point, which is why chain migration and the visa lottery were on the table. 
 There was a time when the Democrats were the party of working Americans. They seemed to understand and fight for the interests of the working class and people living in poverty. Republicans, by contrast, struggled for decades with the perception that they were “for the rich.” <br> Well, how things have turned around. Just look at the latest economic pronouncements of leading establishment Democrats. <br> It’s almost unbelievable – but true. De Leon (who is also the leading challenger to Sen. Dianne Feinstein in her primary battle as she seeks re-election this year) has proposed setting up a new so-called charity that would enable the Silicon Valley and Hollywood elite to claw back their losses from the Trump administration’s new tax reform law. <br> That tax reform law, let’s remind ourselves, actually means that some of the richest people in the richest parts of America will pay more in taxes, thanks to drastic cuts in deductions for state and local taxes they pay. <br> Who would benefit from this bit of creative accounting? Californians earning over $1 million a year, mainly. <br> Another prominent California Democrat also revealed her true colors this past week over taxes: our old friend, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. She dismissed $1,000 worker bonuses given in response to the GOP tax cuts as “crumbs.” <br> You can see the new left elitism in their attitude to immigration too. Their total rejection of any effort to clamp down on the out-of-control low-wage immigration that harms American workers shows that establishment Democrats’ sympathies now lie with big business, not working people. <br> In a 2105 interview Sanders said: “Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have to do everything we can to create millions of jobs. You know what youth unemployment is in the United States of America today? If you're a white high school graduate, it's 33 percent, Hispanic 36 percent, African American 51 percent. You think we should open the borders and bring in a lot of low-wage workers, or do you think maybe we should try to get jobs for those kids?” 
 Tax reform legislation signed into law by President Trump in December, which will lower taxes for most Americans this year, unfortunately did nothing to stop billions of dollars in new taxes under ObamaCare from hitting millions of Americans in the wallet. <br> This is because while the tax reform law weakens part of ObamaCare – by basically ending the mandate requiring individuals to buy health insurance coverage – important parts of the health-care law still remain in effect. These include: a big expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health program serving the poor; federal regulations on health insurance markets; and several taxes to finance the health-care law. <br> The ObamaCare taxes being targeted by opponents are: the so-called “Cadillac tax” on some high-value health insurance policies; an excise tax on medical devices; and a 4 to 6 percent tax on some insurance policies when they are sold. While the “Cadillac tax” hasn’t gone into effect, both the health insurance and medical device taxes became effective Jan. 1. <br> The health insurance tax is troubling because it’s paid for directly by consumers, in the form of higher premiums. So millions of us will take a direct hit, even though most people who will be paying for the tax increase don’t even realize it. <br> In addition to the taxes imposed by ObamaCare, there are a number of factors that influence how much consumers generally pay for health insurance. <br> The new health insurance tax applies to so-called “fully-insured” health insurance plans. It will be paid by: consumers who purchase their coverage on the individual market (including ObamaCare’s health insurance exchanges); many employees of small businesses that furnish coverage; and even some people who get their health insurance through large employers. <br> The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax will raise about $13 billion in revenue in 2018 alone, and about $145 billion over the next 10 years. But these numbers don’t tell the full story of how the health insurance tax impacts families, small businesses and taxpayers across America. <br> These increases will accelerate in 2019 and beyond. So over the next 10 years, the study concludes that individual market beneficiaries will pay over $2,000 more in premiums; families getting their coverage through small employers will pay over $6,000 more; and Medicare Advantage members will pay over $3,000 more. <br> As insurance premiums rise – in part because of the health insurance tax – healthier consumers are more likely to forego health insurance. This concept, known as adverse selection, will leave only sicker consumers – particularly in the individual and small-group marketplaces. 
 The formula is simple: When the economy accelerates, employers compete for employees and wages increase. I experienced this during my 17 years as CEO of a national quick-service restaurant chain. The stronger the economy, the harder it was to get good employees. Conversely, when growth is weak, as it was during most of the Obama presidency, employees compete for jobs and wages stagnate. <br> President Trump’s regulatory rollback is driving an economic surge few anticipated. Tax reform promises to accelerate that growth by encouraging business investment and eliminating the perverse incentives that drive companies, jobs and investments to other countries. The true test for these pro-growth policies is whether they result in a more participatory economy, in which workers’ incomes meaningfully increase over the long run. The early results are promising. 
 What happens when small business regains the spring in its step? Let’s hope we’re about to find out; 2018 could be a historic year for the half of our economy that has always made America great. <br> In 2017, small-business owners returned to their characteristic optimism, reversing years of discouragement with a level of cheer and hopefulness that can only be found in American entrepreneurs who feel free, and who feel appreciated (or at the very least not persecuted) by their government. <br> I used to work with Dunkelberg; he’s very smart and very diplomatic. I think what he meant was: Small business owners like Trump, and his policies, a lot more than they liked Obama. They sense that Trump “gets” them – he’s a business owner himself, so he understands the realities of being a risk-taker, an employer and a jack-of-all-trades (from marketing to personnel, from regulatory and tax compliance to sales, independent business owners wear an incredible number of hats and bravely shoulder an enormous amount of responsibility). <br> What will determine the success of small business in 2018? Sentiment will matter, just as it does on Wall Street and with consumers. Fortunately for our economy, those feelings of freedom and appreciation that entrepreneurs have been experiencing of late are likely to be bolstered by the reality of public policy, and presidential leadership, in 2018. <br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes (which they find to be too high, too complicated and too many); <br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health care (which, for them, is so expensive that the price of premiums can make them re-think their decision to be self-employed). <br> Regulatory relief should be real for small firms in 2018 as well. President Trump’s commitment to reducing the number of federal regulations is likely to continue – it is already one of his most prominent accomplishments as president. <br> The shrinking of the community banking sector is another potential limitation on small business births and growth, and there is cause for concern about cultural shifts – younger generations claim to aspire to business ownership, but also display an aversion to risk which is antithetical to starting and running a business. 
 It’s become nearly impossible to turn on the TV or scroll through your newsfeed without seeing some sort of political fretting or fuming. Never in my memory has the partisan fighting in our nation been so intense. <br> Problems that should concern everyone – hurricane relief, sexual harassment, even library book donations – have been turned into platforms for our partisan grandstanding. I hope that 2018 can be different. Each January, I see remarkable feats of human innovation as tech companies from around the world gather in Las Vegas to showcase the daring and dynamism of the human imagination at the world’s biggest tech show, CES, which begins this week. <br> International leaders put their heads together and brainstorm new strategies for partnership. Businesses actively seek out ways to source top talent and fund exciting concepts. CES is a global show. But its success evokes America’s deeply-rooted, entrepreneurial spirit. Our unique values and culture, our remarkable legal framework, our diverse population – all combine to create an environment where innovation can flourish. 
 With the retirement of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, it is almost certain that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney will be running for and likely win Hatch’s seat in November. <br> Recent polling has shown that Romney has an over a 69 percent approval rating in the state, including over 81 percent among Republicans, and would defeat the presumptive Democrat in the general election by over 50 points. <br> Nonetheless, I think a voice like Romney’s is also very valuable for both the GOP and our country as a whole. Romney’s brand of aspirational and internationalist conservatism is one that is greatly needed now, due to the major policy challenges our nation faces on the economic and foreign policy fronts, as well as pressing political problems for the GOP. <br> Romney’s expertise on international affairs is undoubtedly one reason why President Trump seriously considered making Romney his secretary of state. <br> Romney’s diverse experiences and perspectives in business also are needed at a time when our economy is experiencing extraordinary transformation. Romney has been not only a governor but also a successful businessman, whether at the Olympics or in venture capital. He was exposed to the frontier strategic questions facing many different companies across all sectors. <br> Furthermore, Romney’s successful turnaround of the 2002 Winter Olympics demonstrates an efficiency-oriented financial mind very much needed when voting on our federal government’s budget and structure. We see massive federal waste and a big deficit that continues to increase our national debt. <br> However Romney’s reputation has taken a sour turn these past two years among many Republicans as he emerged as one of the most vocal anti-Trump voices during the 2016 presidential primaries and general election. <br> However since Trump was elected, Romney has changed his tone significantly. While Romney has remained critical of President Trump frequently and very ruthlessly at times, such as after Charlottesville, nonetheless Romney has also praised President Trump on issues that Romney seems to believe are in agreement with the aspirational and internationalist conservatism Romney espouses. <br> The primary reason for my belief that Romney would be even-handed to President Trump, as he has been since the election, is that I believe Romney is truly a man of integrity. <br> Furthermore, we need more people of character in politics after what’s been a very disgraceful year for public virtue, due to the revelations about sexual misconduct in Hollywood, the media, Congress and elsewhere. 
 As President Trump’s first year in office comes to a close, media hysteria about the grave harm he will cause to the nation and the world continues unabated – even though predictions of disaster he would supposedly cause in the past year never came to pass. <br> Since Donald Trump’s upset election victory in November 2016, commentators, anchors, reporters, columnists, editorial writers, op-ed writers all manner of experts have been opining on the horrors his presidency would bring about. <br> While the prophets of doom have not recanted their claims – and in fact have continued making them – the reality of President Trump’s time in office so far speaks volumes about what never happened. <br> The stock market is booming. In 2017, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest gains ever, with the most closing highs for the index in a single calendar year. Volatility diminished to historic lows and many global stock markets finished the year at or near record highs. <br> There’s no evidence of collusion available to the public that shows Russia worked with the Trump campaign to help Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. &nbsp; <br> Tax reform has become law. The new law will increase take-home income for a large majority of Americans and has dramatically cut the corporate tax rate. This should increase American competitiveness on a global scale, create more American jobs and strengthen our economy. <br> We have not entered a new war. While tension exists in many corners of the globe, the Trump administration has avoided new military conflicts, despite provocations from North Korea and Iran. And U.S. forces and our allies have decimated ISIS in Iraq and Syria, liberating most of the territory in those two nations seized by the terrorist group. <br> We have an effective National Security Strategy. The report describing the strategy that was issued by the White House late in 2017 clarifies the national mission and unerringly deals with Russian threats and the need to defend Western Civilization. <br> The New World Order is out. By making U.S. sovereignty – America First –the foundation of our foreign policy, President Trump has abandoned the foolish idea of a New World Order espoused by President Obama. <br> This historic divide is palpable between what many were convinced would occur and what has actually happened in President Trump’s first year in office. <br> But the end of history has not occurred in President Trump’s first year. Apocalypse was not on the calendar. Our Constitution remains intact, preserving the idea presidential authority is limited. 
 What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago, the country was ending one of the most fiscally irresponsible presidencies of the modern age. Now we’re wrapping up a year of bold fiscal leadership from President Trump and conservatives in the U.S. House of Representatives. <br> I became chairman of the House Budget Committee one year ago and have been proud to serve in that role along with our new president. He has pushed an agenda of action – responsible budgeting, repealing ObamaCare’s worst mandates, and aggressive tax-cutting to get our economy going. This has been exactly the kind of work I came to Congress to do and we have done it. <br> When I was elected to Congress in 2010, I had three main goals: repeal ObamaCare, reform the tax code and start attacking the growing federal debt and deficits. In just one year, the Budget Committee has taken significant steps to achieve all of these goals. <br> While the House of Representatives passed the AHCA, the Senate let us all down. <br> Since the Senate’s initial failure, we successfully repealed ObamaCare’s individual mandate in our tax reform bill, to reduce this burden on middle-class Americans. This provision is the foundation of ObamaCare’s entire flawed scheme. With its repeal, the rest of the law will now be much simpler to dismantle. The House is ready to do just that, so let’s hope Republicans in the Senate muster the nerve to join us. <br> Some in my own party counseled that we skip the hard work of budgeting and merely pass a meaningless legislative placeholder, but I refused and insisted that our Budget Committee show real leadership. <br> We paved the way for historic tax cuts for the American people. And we led the House to endorse the largest cut to mandatory spending programs, which make up about two-thirds of all federal spending, in the last 20 years. <br> The budget produced by my committee launched us toward tax relief. When we began writing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we focused our attention on the middle class. This focus was particularly important to me – I was once a single mom with three children. I worked the night shift as a nurse so I could be home during the day and take care of my kids, and every dollar was important. <br> Our law cuts taxes for the middle class, giving an average family about $1,400 back. On top of that, we cut taxes for job creators, which will help them hire more workers, raise wages, and invest in research and technology. We’re already seeing results, with companies like ATT, Boeing and Comcast announcing that they will raise wages, give employee bonuses and invest in job creation. 
 <b>Editor’s note:</b>The following column first appeared in The Hill newspaper and on<a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/366398-juan-williams-gop-will-suffer-for-tax-giveaway" target="_blank">thehill.com. <br> Republicans say the big news on Capitol Hill last week was that they passed tax cuts. <br> The bigger news on Capitol Hill was that Americans now trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle taxes and the economy, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. <br> Now, the Journal poll has voters favoring Democrats by 33 percent to 29 percent on taxes, and by 35 percent to 30 percent on the economy. <br> This is a total 180-degree, world is upside down, hell just froze over reversal. <br> How can this be happening when Republicans are lining up to praise the president and the tax cuts? <br> That sycophantic acclaim for a president who just destroyed voters’ trust in the GOP’s ability to deliver good economic results is strong evidence the party has lost its identity as the standard-bearer of fiscal conservatism. <br> With his tax plan now signed into law, the curtains are finally pulled back on the Wizard of Trump Tower. <br> Cutting corporate taxes — from 35 percent to 21 percent — is “probably the biggest factor in our plan,” and not tax reform to benefit the middle class, the president admitted as the bill made its way to his desk. <br> And what about creating new jobs? <br> The man who did the survey of corporate leaders, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, told CNN Money that Trump’s claim that tax cuts will result in more jobs is “a lot of smoke and mirrors.” <br> Not a single Democrat voted for Trump’s tax cuts. <br> “By the end, the<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GOPTaxScam?src=hash" target="_blank">#GOPTaxScamwill… raise taxes on 86 million middle class households, hand 83% of the benefits to the wealthiest 1% of Americans. This will go down as one of the most scandalous, obscene acts of plutocracy ever,” Pelosi tweeted. <br> With so much money concentrated in the hands of so few Americans, it is no wonder that polls show this law is wildly unpopular, with support ranging in major polls only from 26 to 32 percent. <br> And now for the political fall-out: <br> Look for those numbers to sink even lower when Trump voters realize they’ve been had. They were sold a bill of goods by his party when they voted for Trump-style economic populism in 2016. <br> The Trump party argues they have to make the cuts to keep the deficit from ballooning. 
 There’s lying like a rug and lying like the media. In the former, the person just collapses motionless. In the latter, the person actively seeks to distort the truth and convince people that a tax cut is actually a hike. <br> That’s the script of almost every major media disaster in 2017. Journalists misrepresent the details and try to convince their audience with a mix of invective and shouting. It’s precisely what happened with the GOP’s tax cut vote. <br> NBC “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie seemed shocked that Republicans thought the tax cut would help employees. She even asked House Speaker Paul Ryan: “Are you living in a fantasy world?” <br> The attacks were almost nonstop, with news reports and pundit talking points indistinguishable. ABC hyped: “The biggest tax cuts will go to the wealthy, corporate America.” MSNBC host Rachel Maddow mirrored that spin, whining about how corporations were getting an “embarrassing amount of money.” <br> In the end, only 17 percent of those surveyed thought they would get a tax cut, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey. But the reality is that 80 percent of taxpayers are scheduled for a cut. <br> Scott’s response was a slam dunk and called out the obvious racism of his accuser. “Uh probably because I helped write the bill for the past year, have multiple provisions included, got multiple Senators on board over the last week and have worked on tax reform my entire time in Congress. But if you'd rather just see my skin color, pls feel free.” <br> Utilizing her characteristic class, O’Donnell responded with an obscene expression directed at Shapiro. <br> The broadcast networks censored the news story for three straight days. After all, who wants to know when a president ignores the efforts of terrorists to fund their operations by selling drugs in America? Author Josh Meyer appeared on Fox News Channel to defend his story, making the point it wasn’t a grand conspiracy. “Their policy of rapprochement with Iran and their effort to get the nuclear deal created a political climate where that result was a derailment of this policy.” <br> The Times decided “he does not need to be fired,” but it is removing him from the White House beat where his left-wing reporting made him a flashpoint. Vox had written a damning piece about Thrush that set in motion the suspension. “If Thrush is acutely aware of what young women face in the business of political journalism, he should also know it’s because he himself is one of the problems women face,” wrote Laura McGann, adding details of her own issues with him. <br> This story has been floating through social media for weeks. Yet Rolling Stone has seemingly ignored it. <br> It was a bad week for the “sports” network. Liberal CEO John Skipper, who the Washington Post called a “gangly, Southern hippie,” also resigned due to substance abuse. <br> Only it wasn’t the Post that broke that story. It was The New York Times. Back in May, the Columbia Journalism Review showed how angry Times staff were about it in “Hell hath no fury like The New York Times scorned by Hollywood.” <br> That hasn’t stopped the Post from going Hollywood about its movie, writing more than 3,300 words about itself. All of those ego-inflating sentences were meant to push one agenda item: “It couldn’t be more timely.” Hint, hint: It’s about Trump. Add to it that the film was produced by lefty Participant Media, which also produced former Vice President Al Gore’s “Inconvenient Truth” quasi-documentaries. <br> Mediaite sums it up quite clearly that President Trump “regularly starts his day watching” the show. “Since they have captured the President’s attention – which often then gets tweeted and covered by the media – the topics they cover essentially set the national agenda for the rest of the day,” it wrote. President Trump even tweeted congratulations. 
 An important provision of the tax cut legislation passed by Congress this week allows the American people to finally benefit from abundant petroleum resources that experts predict will be found in a very small area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) on Alaska’s northern coast. <br> The legislation directs the Interior Department to hold at least two lease sales over the next 10 years, for a maximum of 2,000 acres opened to drilling. Analysts say the sales could fetch as much as $2.2 billion. <br> The narrow coastal plain affected by the legislation contains an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil, says Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who chairs of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This could produce about 1 million barrels of oil each day, amounting to about 20 percent of daily U.S. oil production, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. <br> The U.S. Geological Survey and Congressional Research Service say it’s 95 percent likely that there are 15.6 billion barrels of oil beneath ANWR. With today’s prices and fracking technology, up to 60 percent of that oil may be recoverable. <br> At $50 a barrel, all that oil represents $460 billion that we will not have to send to other countries to buy foreign oil. It also represents tens of billions of dollars in royalty and tax revenues to Alaska and the U.S. government. And opening up a tiny part of ANWR for our energy industry will create thousands of jobs in oilfield, manufacturing and many other sectors. <br> Companies that extract oil from federal onshore and offshore leases pay royalties of up to 18 percent of wellhead prices. They then pay corporate taxes on profits and sales taxes at the pump. Workers pay income taxes, instead of receiving unemployment and welfare checks. <br> As they have for some four decades, activists continue to claim drilling would destroy the entire ANWR area’s wilderness character and threaten its caribou, polar bears, birds and other wildlife. That is a completely false narrative. <br> The potentially oil-rich area of ANWR is actually flat, treeless tundra, 50 miles from the beautiful Brooks Range mountains that feature so prominently and deceptively in Sierra Club and other anti-drilling campaigns. <br> The harsh winter conditions mean drilling can be done using airstrips, roads and drill pads that are all constructed with ice and snow. Come spring, all of this will melt, leaving only puddles, little holes and a few permanent facilities. <br> In fact, the Prudhoe Bay oilfield’s Central Arctic caribou herd has over 20,000 of the animals today, compared to just 5,000 in 1975. Arctic fox, geese, shore birds and other wildlife also return each spring, along with giant mosquitoes. <br> Coupled with the ability to fracture rock formations and stimulate them to produce far more oil and natural gas liquids than previously possible, this accuracy means that the 2,000-acre footprint could produce up to 15 billion gallons of petroleum annually. <br> Inuit natives who live in or near ANWR have supported drilling by an 8-to-1 margin. They no longer want to live in poverty – after having given up their traditional land claims for oil rights that Congress, greens, presidents and courts have repeatedly denied them. <br> Drilling in ANWR will also ensure sufficient production to keep the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in operation. Right now, declining North Slope production threatens to reduce oil in the pipeline to a point where it cannot stay sufficiently warm to flow under months-long winter conditions. 
 In 2016 American voters revolted against an entrenched political class that built a system designed for its own self-aggrandizement, to the detriment of much of the rest of America – particularly the working class. Think I exaggerate? Well, consider that the five richest counties in America all surround our nation’s capital. <br> Lobbyists, government contractors and entrenched bureaucrats in Washington and its suburbs aren’t curing cancer or figuring out cold fusion. Instead, they’re acting a lot like the “Capital” in “The Hunger Games” and leeching off those of us in the “Districts.” <br> The sweeping tax reform passed this week fulfills that promise through a combination of material tax reductions for small and medium-sized businesses and massive incentives for all companies, large and small, to again invest in American workers rather than in financial engineering. <br> Our monetary and fiscal policies almost compelled companies, especially giant multinationals, to pursue practices antithetical to the prosperity of American workers. <br> Artificially low interest rates, combined with confiscatory business taxes, encouraged the worst kinds of corporate strategies. These included massive buybacks and dividends that rewarded top executives and wealthy investors, but ignored the plight of hard-working wage earners at those very companies. <br> ATT and Comcast immediately promised $1,000 cash bonuses to over 300,000 workers combined. Boeing, which has seen its stock more than double since President Trump’s election, promised $300 million in employee-related investments. Wells Fargo pledged a voluntary $15-an-hour minimum wage. It’s almost as if incentives work in a free market! <br> Long-term, increased capital expenditures in American workers, plants, and technology will return our country to the kind of broad growth we experienced in the 1980s and 1990s. <br> If necessary, the “stick” factor can also be employed. The president should use his bully pulpit to boldly proclaim that being a corporate citizen of America carries the same privileges and obligations that we embrace as individual citizens. 
 Analysts, historians and scholars will look back on this week as the moment the Trump administration became truly historic. <br> The publication of the National Security Strategy report on Monday, followed by the passage of the largest change to the tax code in 31 years, guarantees that President Trump's first year in office will be seen as a remarkable success. <br> The hostile and bitter news media have been – and continue to be – relentless in their mission to mislead the American people about the progress President Trump and Republicans are making. <br> Similarly, the media have spent the last few months misconstruing reports about tax reform. They have lied about policies and gone out of their way to emphasize anything about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that they view as negative, while skillfully avoiding covering the cuts, credits, and reforms that will benefit hard-working Americans. <br> Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have been as relentlessly hostile as the news media. The Democratic leaders have also been more focused on escalating anti-Trump pressure and “resistance” than working with Republicans and the president to pass positive reforms for the American people. <br> Two very big, long-term projects came to fruition in a three-day period. One had taken almost a year. The other could be traced back to House Speaker Paul Ryan's call for tax reform in December of 1998 – before he was even sworn in as a freshman House member from Wisconsin. <br> Both of this week’s historic achievements reflected candidate Trump's campaign pledges. <br> The new National Security Strategy report is an extraordinary break with the globalist elite model of a New World Order that had defined U.S. foreign policy from the early 1990s, when the collapse of the Soviet Union made the Reagan Doctrine outmoded – because it had worked. <br> The definition of a sovereignty-based – or America First – approach to alliances and relationships is a recognition that ensuring our nation’s safety and preserving America's role in the world depends on a strong, prosperous American economy. <br> It is symbolically appropriate that the tax cuts designed to once again make America productive and prosperous passed the same week that the new National Security Strategy report was released. <br> The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is designed to make America greater by making America more competitive. The two goals of this legislation are to lower individual taxes so that working Americans have more money in their pockets and to lower business taxes so that businesses are incentivized to invest in the U.S. economy and create jobs. <br> If Moore is right, the American people will have clear, undeniable proof that Trumpism works – while the left’s anti-Trump deterrence strategy of spreading lies continues to fail. 
 In November 2016, middle-class Americans sent a clear message to Washington, D.C. <br> They were frustrated with stagnant wages. They were fed up with shrinking opportunity. They were tired of watching America lose ground to our competitors overseas. <br> The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which passed the Senate on Tuesday and which President Trump will soon sign, is the most sweeping overhaul of our nation’s tax code in more than 30 years. It includes a host of hard-fought conservative victories that will help families next year while making America stronger for decades to come. <br> Our primary goal was to cut taxes for American families. Ten years ago, middle-class Americans in Kentucky and across the country were hit hard by the Great Recession. Job opportunities dried up. Take-home pay stopped growing. It became difficult for families just to get by, much less to get ahead and save for their children’s futures. <br> Helping them was our first priority. That’s why the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cuts tax rates across the board, doubles the standard deduction, and significantly expands the Child Tax Credit. Thanks to these and other changes, a typical family of four earning the median family income gets to keep more than $2,000 that they would have otherwise had to send off to the IRS. <br> The bill goes even further to help families by repealing the unfair individual mandate tax at the very heart of ObamaCare. Under ObamaCare, if Americans didn’t buy the kind of health insurance that Washington thought they should buy, they were punished with a tax penalty. But if the plans available under ObamaCare are not affordable or not desirable, the blame lies with the failing law itself. The last people who should be fined or penalized are the working Americans whom ObamaCare is letting down. <br> In addition to cutting workers’ taxes directly, the law puts America on a trajectory towards higher wages and better job opportunities by making our country a better place to do business. It cuts taxes on job creators and Main Street businesses, eliminates incentives for shifting manufacturing abroad, and makes America a more attractive destination for jobs, profits, and investment from around the world. <br> And that’s not the only part of this historic law that will give pause to our international competitors. <br> American families have waited long enough. They cannot afford to be burdened any longer by an outdated, unfair, inefficient tax code that takes too much money out of their paychecks. That’s why it was so important that President Trump and Congress seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity. <br> It’s unfortunate that Republicans had to do this on our own. In the past, including as recently as the Obama administration, prominent Democrats claimed to support many of the pro-growth, pro-worker ideas at the heart of our reforms. 
 Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is furious after a provision that would have expanded 529 savings accounts to cover homeschool expenses was removed from the Republicans’ tax reform plan. <br> <b>Click here for a FREE subscription to Todd’s newsletter – a must-read for Conservatives!</b> <br> Under the Cruz plan, homeschool families would’ve been able to deduct the cost of homeschooling their kids. A provision allowing parents to save for private or religious schools remained in the bill. 
 For the first time in more than 30 years, Congress has enacted comprehensive tax reform, which provides middle-class tax relief and a much-needed boost to our economy.This will lead to more jobs, higher wages and increased investment at home. <br> After nearly a decade of stagnant economic growth, this historic tax overhaul will restore America’s position as the center of the world’s global economy. <br> Repealing the individual mandate tax is the beginning of the end of the ObamaCare era, which has been marked by skyrocketing premiums and shrinking choices, making America’s health-care system untenable and unsustainable. <br> ObamaCare and its mandates put our nation on a fast-track to socialism. If the federal government can force you to buy health insurance, where does the government’s power stop? <br> Repealing the individual mandate tax restores liberty to the nation’s health-care system. Once again, the American people will be back in charge of their health care – not Washington bureaucrats. <br> Additionally, the individual mandate tax is regressive and punitive, disproportionately hurting low-income households. According to the IRS, nearly<a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-historic-table-2" target="_blank">80 percentof households that pay the penalty make less than $50,000 annually. Those families paid more than half of the individual mandate tax collected by the IRS. <br> I have fought long and hard to repeal the individual mandate tax. In fact, I was the<a href="https://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/releases?ID=3E883BE5-5E3A-4F43-8B52-EF7D0FBF92FE" target="_blank">firstmember of Congress to introduce legislation to repeal the individual and employer mandates. And I am proud that the tax reform bill that passed out of the Senate Finance Committee included the individual mandate tax repeal and that this provision was included when the bill crossed the finish line. 
 Editor's note: The following column first appeared in the Washington Times. <br> You know journalism is in a sorry state when a New York Times columnist makes news simply by admitting the truth that President<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Trump’s leadership crushed ISIS. <br> As a conservative columnist at The Times, Mr. Douthat’s approach was similar to that of many previous<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Trumpskeptics — he peppered his commentary with a variety of reasons he thinks<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Mr. Trumpis still an oafish boor. Sure, he defeated ISIS and the media ignored it, but it’s<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s fault. He’s a scandalous, controversial president, and if he was just more normal, then the media wouldn’t be so distracted. <br> In his column, Mr. Douthat sets a tone at the start so no one should mistake his eventual admission as recognition of<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s masterful foreign policy approach. He starts by blaming the president for media malpractice: <br> “There is nothing more characteristic of the Trump era, with its fire hose of misinformation, scandal and hyperbole, than that America and its allies recently managed to win a war that just two years ago consumed headlines and dominated political debate and helped<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Donald Trumphimself get elected president — and somehow nobody seemed to notice.” <br> Provisionally. Sure. <br> “But this is also a press failure, a case where the media is not adequately reporting an important success because it does not fit into the narrative of Trumpian disaster in which our journalistic entities are all invested. I include myself in this indictment.” <br> On one hand he feels compelled to admit media reports only what it sees through its Hillary-colored glasses, and in the same breath begs the question by delivering the tired and usual media indictment of how the president is a bumbling court jester who stole the throne. Moreover, Mr. Trump is a scandal machine, forcing the media to miss all the real, important news. <br> While Mr. Trump was crushing ISIS by allowing our military to do their job, the media’s obsession with fake “Trump narrative” news prevailed. Viewers of legacy news were drowning in false stories such as former FBI Director James B. Comey preparing to tell Congress Mr. Trump was under investigation, and a CNN story that Anthony Scaramucci was under investigation for Russia ties. That little, contrived gem led to the resignation of three journalists. <br> Earlier this month, David Harsanyi at the Federalist provided a reminder of what else the media’s “Trump narrative” created while the president was getting this nation back on her feet: <br> “ABC reported that Trump had directed Michael Flynn to make contact with Russian officials before the election. He didn’t (as far as we know). The New York Times ran a story that showed K.T. McFarland had acknowledged collusion. She didn’t. Then CNN topped off the week by falsely reporting that the Trump campaign had been offered access to hacked Democratic National Committee emails before they were published,” he noted. 
 The left’s hysterical attacks against the GOP tax bill, which was passed by the House Tuesday and was expected to win Senate approval, tells you something big is going on. Democrats have knowingly lied that the reform effort will hurt middle-class Americans, earning an unusual dressing-down from the Washington Post, and have aggressively flayed individual Republicans who support the bill. <br> The New York Times, in one last death rattle fit of umbrage, declared in an editorial that there was “cynicism and mendacity underlying the Republican tax bill.” The newspaper also published another outrage special from columnist Paul Krugman, who suspects that Republicans are supporting the legislation because it is “good for them personally” and ran a lengthy piece on how the bill would significantly burden the Internal Revenue Service. As though we care. <br> Let’s be honest: the GOP tax plan is the Democrats’ worst nightmare. After a year of “resistance” against a duly elected president, stalling on Cabinet confirmations, slow-walking the exodus of Obama appointees, issuing purposefully damaging and often untruthful rumors about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia, attacking each and every initiative of the incoming administration, wailing about Congress moving forward on a partisan basis (as though ObamaCare didn’t follow the same path), threatening impeachment and detailing gleefully every misstep and foolish tweet made by President Trump, Democrats are about to face an emboldened adversary. <br> Throughout this past year, Democrats and elites have mocked President Trump for rookie mistakes, sneered at his exaggerations, and expressed horror when he followed through on campaign pledges, such as bowing out of the Paris Climate Agreement.&nbsp; <br> But the Democrats’ most telling and harmful critique was that President Trump, a political neophyte, was not able to deliver. They claimed his inexperienced team was ill-equipped to carry out his agenda, and they were not entirely wrong; the ill-fated ban on immigrants from Muslim countries comes to mind. More damaging, Democrats also said that because of candidate Trump’s toxic behavior during the primaries, he had so alienated fellow Republicans that he would never get Congress to enact his agenda. <br> They were wrong. The GOP – led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. – moved forward with renewed vigor on tax reform. Unlike the ObamaCare effort, this push included the White House. For many months the Gang of Six worked feverishly towards a tax bill that would make U.S. businesses competitive again, and lower taxes for most Americans. That’s what this final bill does. That’s what Democrats are screaming about. <br> But here’s what should worry Democrats; that poll indicates that the public’s dislike of the bill is because they don’t really think their taxes will go down. What happens when they find out that Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who called the bill a “punch in the gut for the middle class,” or House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, R-Calif., who has called the bill a “scam” and “Armageddon,” are lying to them? <br> The liberal media has also scoffed at the notion that lower taxes could inspire businesses to increase investment and hiring. I heard the CEO of a cement company interviewed the other day on Bloomberg; the reporter was openly hostile to the manager’s claims that yes, he would be expanding as a result of the proposed tax changes. Almost 95 percent of those responding to a recent National Association of Manufacturers poll said they were optimistic about their prospects – an all-time record. More than 60 percent said the tax overhaul would likely lead them to invest more. As businesses gear up hiring and investing in new plant and equipment, won’t people feel even better about their job prospects? 
 It’s beginning to feel a lot like Christmas, everywhere we go, from the sight of inflatable reindeer on the neighbor’s lawn to the thought of Cousin Eddie in a dickey, drinking egg nog and talking politics at Christmas dinner. <br> Every family has a Cousin Eddie and every family’s holiday gathering holds forth the possibility of awkward or tense moments. But out of all the Christmas anxieties—overextended budgets and calendars, overcooked turkey and undercooked ham, inebriated cousins and argumentative uncles—nothing seems worse than having to “mix it up” politically with the odd assortment of people in our extended family. <br> But I’m here to tell you, “It’s OK. Don’t worry your elastic-waisted britches about it.” <br> How? Here are a few tips: <br> Set the tone. <br> Consider telling a personal story. <br> Refuse to be baited. <br> Admit it when you’re wrong or have overstated your case. <br> If needed, steer the conversation in a different direction. <br> Go ahead, mix it up. <br> For many Americans, having family conversations in today’s toxic political environment feels like having a bowling alley inside of our brains, with each family member hurling their own 13-lb. ball of opinions at our neural duckpins. 
 I’m not in the habit of giving stock tips or making market calls. I’ve never claimed to be an investment strategist. But after spending years reporting on business and finance, I was convinced on the night of Nov. 8, 2016, that the conventional market wisdom was way off target. <br> As the night wore on and equity traders began to grasp that Donald Trump would become president, stock markets around the world started selling off. In the U.S., trading in SP 500 futures would eventually be halted after a 5% decline. After midnight, Paul Krugman of the New York Times<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/paul-krugman-the-economic-fallout" target="_blank">opined: “If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never.” 
 Roy Moore, the Republican defeated Tuesday in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama, turned out to be a deeply flawed candidate and one who traditional Republican voters – including people of faith and suburban men and women – could neither muster enthusiasm for nor support. <br> Moore had a well-established track record for controversy, low approval numbers in polls and was portrayed in the media as a dirty old man at best and a pedophile at worst. So his election loss should not come as a big surprise. <br> Moore drew so much opposition for some of his extreme positions and sexual misconduct allegations, it would be wrong to read his narrow defeat as a repudiation of President Trump or the Trump agenda. <br> And the victory of Democrat Doug Jones does not signal that Democrats have solved their own deep-seated problems and are about to capture control of the House and Senate in the 2018 midterm elections. That’s wishful thinking by Democratic partisans – not a sober assessment. <br> On top of this, the mainstream media worked hard to make the Alabama Senate election a referendum on President Trump, on Steve Bannon and on the future of the GOP in an effort to hurt the president and the Republican Party with Moore’s unpopularity, arising out of his alleged sexual misconduct. <br> If the Republican Party fails to show results when it controls both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, there will be hell to pay at the ballot box in 2018, no doubt about it. <br> Virginia has been trending Democratic for almost two decades, especially in areas where turnout will always be greater than in rural parts of the state. And the Republican candidate for governor did not fully embrace President Trump. <br> When President Trump has been invited in to campaign for a Republican candidate, where his message is welcomed and received, and where the candidate and President Trump are aligned, good things have happened. But bad things happen – as took place in Alabama – when the president and the candidate have been opposed by the Republican establishment. 
 The agreement in principle announced Wednesday by House and Senate Republican leaders on a tax cut bill – heralded by President Trump at the White House – is good news for the American people. But it’s certain to upset Democrats, who just can’t ever be happy by anything the president or congressional Republicans do. &nbsp; <br> Democrats react to tax cuts like Chicken Little in the children’s story – with screams that The Sky is Falling! <br> First, the tax cuts will be good for the stock market. The market is up a record 30 percent since Election Day, benefiting not just the wealthy but small investors and most people with retirement accounts. Yet, wherever you go, you still see Democrats grieving … they can barely read their bulging brokerage account statements through their tears and their anguish at too much winning. <br> The Trump tax cuts reduce corporate taxes as well as taxes on individuals – an evil plot, right? Unfortunately for the Democrats, the corporate tax cuts will strengthen our economy and prompt businesses to start hiring more employees – regardless of political affiliation – and enable employers to pay higher wages and salaries. <br> Third, on top of these “calamities,” President Trump has supercharged the economy by getting rid of costly, cumbersome and counterproductive regulations that force companies to waste billions of dollars, raise prices to consumers and ship jobs to foreign countries. <br> The arguments that Democratic partisans make against Republican tax cuts make no sense. <br> In today’s world, “fairness” is in the eye of whoever shouts the loudest. <br> Can Republicans tweak the tax plan further to satisfy the left and perhaps gain some bipartisan support before Congress votes on the bill next week? <br> So here’s a “modest proposal” if I may borrow a term from Swift – Jonathan, that is, not Taylor. <br> Since, as Hillary relentlessly points out, she received 3 million votes more than President Trump did, we’ll take in a UGE amount of taxes on this one-time basis. Half of the gains in the market, or about $2.7 trillion, will have been earned by all those Trump non-voters. And 39 percent of that? More than $1 trillion. That will allow Congress to lower taxes on everyone else without raising the deficit beyond acceptable levels. <br> Next, no more liberal guilt about a sky-high stock market and all the money the fat cats are putting in their pockets. <br> If people had to actually sell their shares, that would be a terrible thing for the stock market, of course. So I have a solution for that as well. <br> And I’m confident that all those Goldman Sachs alums in and around the White House will find a way to sell those shares at just the right time. <br> And Democrats will have nothing to complain about – after all, they still get to keep almost two thirds of the “dirty money” they’ve gained under the president they despise. 
 Despite the slight differences in the House and Senate tax reform bills, overall both are good for American innovation. <br> We need a new tax plan to support American innovation, because our history and success as a nation derive from our primacy in this area. Our relatively young nation has excelled because of our scrappy, can-do entrepreneurial culture and diverse immigrant roots. We’re all attracted by – and based in – bedrock of strong constitutional freedoms. This alone makes us unique. <br> The scorecard judges each nation on a total of 27 indicators across 12 categories. It lays out a strategy that says innovation is tied to having an environment that embraces disruptive technologies, promotes civil and economic liberties and fosters a diverse and talented population. Spoiler alert – the U.S. does well, but not by every measure. Our country’s worst score is in the tax category. <br> Simply put, our tax laws today – along with our immigration policies – incentivize American companies to shift jobs abroad. Our rates are so high that there is a perverse incentive for American companies to be acquired by foreign companies that enjoy a lower tax rate. By lowering corporate taxes and shifting to a territorial system of taxation the rest of the world uses, U.S. companies will have a level playing field and be able to invest in and hire more American workers. <br> Last year, for the first time in 30 years, more U.S. manufacturing jobs were created or returned from overseas than left our country. Technology drives the U.S. economy, supporting 15.3 million U.S. jobs and accounting for ten percent of gross domestic product in 2015 alone. Imagine a tax system that can further unleash America’s strongest industries to compete more vigorously. <br> As a matter of long-standing policy, CTA does not lobby or ask the federal government for money specifically for our industry. We have not sought, nor are we receiving in the tax bill special deals for innovators and the technology industry. But our corporate leaders believe the growing federal debt is an existential problem threatening our nation and our children’s future. 
 <b>Editor's note: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-know-this-tax-is-an-abomination-so-why-is-it-still-in-their-bill/2017/12/08/49fd75c4-db96-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html?utm_term=.b9b47240a140" target="_blank">The following column first appeared in the Washington Post.</i> <br> The phones of House and Senate leaders are ringing off the hook right now, as CEOs and wealthy donors lobby them furiously to lower the top income tax rate and insert costly carve-outs into the GOP tax bill to protect their business tax preferences. Too bad regular taxpayers don’t have a direct line to the conferees hammering out the final bill to plead their cases. Because it seems as though they have been forgotten. <br> But what about individuals? Who is championing AMT repeal for them? <br> Burr is right. Congress created the AMT in 1969 after the Treasury Department<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/senate-would-keep-individual-amt-turn-it-very-different-tax" target="_blank" title="www.taxpolicycenter.org">reportedthat 155 high-income<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/27149.pdf" target="_blank" title="www.finance.senate.gov">filerswere using tax breaks to avoid paying any income taxes. In 1970, it affected<a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/31886/411703-the-individual-alternative-minimum-tax-historical-data-and-projections.pdf" target="_blank" title="www.urban.org">only 20,000 very high-income taxpayers. But today, the number of people impacted has<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/how-would-repeal-state-and-local-tax-deduction-affect-taxpayers-who-pay-amt/full" target="_blank" title="www.taxpolicycenter.org">ballooned to 5.2 million. Most of those who currently pay the AMT are not from the highest-income households for which the tax was intended, but the middle and upper-middle class — folks who have enough money to be a ripe target of revenue raisers, but not enough to have influence on Capitol Hill. They are mostly two-earner households with mortgages to pay, who give to charity and have children. The AMT also hits the families of our fallen warriors. According to Burr, children who receive an annuity from the Uniformed Services Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)<a href="https://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/sen-burr-introduces-bill-to-relieve-tax-burden-for-families-of-fallen-servicemembers" target="_blank" title="www.burr.senate.gov">can see the AMT eat up as much as 26 percent of their benefit. No Republican tax bill should punish individuals like these — especially not to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest among us. <br> Members of the Trump administration know that the AMT is a horrible tax. In 2006, Kevin Hassett — now chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers — called the AMT<a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/want-to-fix-the-amt-here-are-two-simple-steps/" target="_blank" title="www.aei.org">“an economic abomination”and urged Congress to “erase it from the tax code completely.” Yet instead of erasing it, Republicans are retaining it. 
 After months of fits and starts, it looks like comprehensive tax reform is nearing the goal line. <br> This would be an ideal holiday present for the American people, who have had to live with an outdated, onerous and inefficient tax system for far too long. <br> Polling suggests that many Americans are dubious about the current tax reform proposal. That’s understandable, since so much of the discussion has centered on cutting corporate tax rates, which are slated tofall from 35 percent to 20 percent. Unfortunately, there’s been much less discussion about why this rate cut matters for middle-class Americans. <br> America now has the<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-world-2014" target="_blank">world’s higheststatutory corporate tax rate – over 39 percent for combined federal and state, as compared to the current worldwide average of 25 percent. <br> Even France, certainly not known as the bastion of free-market capitalism, recently announced plans to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-reform/french-government-outlines-gradual-corporate-tax-cut-plans-idUSKCN1BA2HX" target="_blank">lower its corporate rate from 33 percent to 25 percentover the next few years. <br> Here at home, William Randolph from the Congressional Budget Office released a preliminary working paper in 2006 that found<a href="https://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/75xx/doc7503/2006-09.pdf" target="_blank">domestic labor routinely bears 73 percent of the corporate tax burden. <br> These increases are significant, tangible results for working families. More recently, the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent would increase average household income by somewhere<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/81f819be-b21c-11e7-a398-73d59db9e399" target="_blank">between $4,000 and $9,000 per year. <br> According to the nonpartisan<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-passed-senate-finance-committee/full" target="_blank">Tax Policy Center, Americans of all household income brackets would get a tax cut in the first year. <br> In addition, the Senate Finance Committee<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/11.20.17%20Real%20World%20Examples.pdf" target="_blank">estimatedthata family of four earning a median income of $73,000 would see a tax cut of nearly $2,200. 
 Ever get the feeling that President Trump, and by extension his closest staff, can do nothing right in the eyes of the Washington press corps? It sure seems that way when they pick apart even sweet traditions like serving our troops on Thanksgiving or the decorations chosen by the first lady for Christmas. But let’s be honest, aside from the president, his female staff receive the harshest and most dishonorable treatment. <br> Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Press Secretary of the Trump administration, innocently baked a pie for Thanksgiving and posted it to Instagram. It looked delicious. It shouldn’t have been controversial – it’s a pie – but leave it to the media to stoke conspiracy, ridiculously accusing Sanders of posting a stock photo and labeling it #piegate. <br> Liberal Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, who makes a career of pettiness and the denigration of conservative women (to the point of being obsessive and creepy), wrote, “And so, at Monday’s off-camera briefing, she stood on the podium, frequently cocking her left eyebrow and raising the left corner of her lips to convey displeasure at the line of questioning. Then, as frequently, she opened her mouth and, with a heavy Arkansas twang, said a lot of nothing.” Most recently, he railed against the “Trump mouthpiece” for her “infantilizing of the press corps” by asking them to say what they are thankful for before submitting a question. The tone of the article went downhill from there. <br> A piece earlier this year by Pulitzer prize-winning Los Angeles Times’ columnist David Horsey was so nasty they were forced to take down. In it, he called Sanders a litany of things I’d rather not write here. <br> And do I even need to mention the childish, expletive-packed rant by Wonkette Senior Editor Evan Hurst, who apparently has never met an F-bomb he didn’t like? <br> Beyond bad form. <br> The job requires calm under intense pressure. I have yet to see Sanders lose her cool, even when faced with difficult, ridiculous, or from-left-field questions posed by members of the press over and over again. She’s also funny, exclaiming, “Christmas had come early” when alerted to the fact that CNN was boycotting the White House Christmas party. <br> Dana Perino, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, was only one of two female press secretaries in history (Sanders is the third). She wrote an open letter to Sanders at the beginning of her tenure, urging her to be the “most knowledgeable person in the room” and to “take a moment of gratitude” when walking into the West Wing. <br> One would think that the feminist members of the media would be thrilled to see a courageous woman place another crack in the glass ceiling of power and influence but not so much. Sanders has faced a barrage of negativity from the very people who handled the Obama administration with kid gloves. 
 For many Americans the legacy of the Obama economy is sluggish growth, stagnant paychecks and missed opportunities. A lost generation of workers still struggle with the consequences of the Great Recession and find it nearly impossible to get ahead. One of the biggest obstacles to their success has been our nation’s complex and outdated tax code. For too long it has dragged down our economy and taken too much from their paychecks. <br> That’s why the Republican-led Senate passed a critical tax reform bill that will help make America an economic powerhouse again. We did that by putting more money into the pockets of hardworking families and small businesses, creating more jobs and economic opportunity, and taking steps to ensure that jobs and business stay in America. This was a once-in-a-generation opportunity that we could not let pass. 
 Tax reform should reward individual risk-taking and initiative. The investor who puts the fruits of her labor on the line should not be straitjacketed by accounting rules that are better suited for measuring the value of corporate inventory, or sticking a price tag on a pile of widgets. Yet, this is exactly where one provision of the Senate version of tax “reform” is headed. <br> In the course of giving many taxpaying Americans a rate cut in one hand, the Senate proposes to punish them with the other. As things stand now, the Senate’s version of tax reform would impose rigid accounting standards on the sales of securities by individuals, which rules would effectively deprive small investors and American workers of their well-deserved profits. Specifically, under the Senate bill, individual stock sellers would be forced to use what accountants call the “first-in-first-out” or FIFO method of pricing stock when calculating what they owe to Uncle Sam. <br> Unfair and unreasonable? Yes, on both counts. <br> But beyond favoring professional managers over individual investors, this ill-conceived legislation would actually amount to a tax hike. Let me explain. <br> Right now, the Tax Code grants individual investors the right to choose how they wish to account for their disposition of their securities. But if the Senate provision becomes law, individual investors would be compelled to sell off the first-purchased block of stocks regardless of costs and economic realities. <br> For example, an American worker who invested in his employer through automatic payroll deductions would likely face a heftier tax bite if he were compelled to first pay taxes on stock gains arising from his 2009 stock purchases than if he were permitted to attribute his gains to securities purchased at a later date. Against this backdrop, the Senate bill’s FIFO methodology can only be viewed seen as a disguised tax. 
 Not many years ago, an ad for a newspaper warned that, “If you miss a day, you miss a lot.” <br> Now you don’t need a day to miss a lot. Mere seconds of inattention can get you behind the curve. What, you didn’t hear about the latest predator to fall on his sword? <br> Then there’s the White House, where the dynamics of upheaval are entering a crucial phase. Although many deplorables believe they finally have a government looking out for them, much of Washington and the American left are preparing to dance on the grave of Donald Trump’s presidency. <br> That is one way to look at Flynn — if you assume he has beans to spill. He was close to Trump but it’s worth noting that Flynn pled guilty to a single count of lying to the FBI, including about a phone conversation he had with a Russian official last Dec. 29 — seven weeks after the election. <br> That’s the same call that got Flynn fired after less than a month as Trump’s national security adviser because he lied to the vice president about whether the conversation covered sanctions. <br> “No collusion,” Trump said Saturday. “There was absolutely no collusion. So we are very happy.” 
 Democrats have a lot to say about the Republican tax-reform plan, including that it is a “middle class con job” and is going to cost the GOP its congressional majorities. That’s quite the bold claim, coming from the party that is in fact in uncharted tax-politics territory. <br> Americans have short political memories, which means it is no longer possible to remember a world in which Democrats didn’t hate tax cuts. And in the mainstream media—which shares the left’s penchant for class warfare—it’s also no longer possible to read an analysis that doesn’t assume Democrats are on the right side of history, that these tax cuts are “unpopular,” and that this reform holds grave political risks for Republicans. <br> Based on what? Democrats certainly have no modern evidence of these propositions, since they’ve never uniformly opposed tax cuts. In fact, it’s been 16 years since the party even engaged in a big tax brawl, during George W. Bush’s first year as president. What’s striking is just how many Democrats enthusiastically signed on to Mr. Bush’s tax bill, and just how far off the political rails the party has gone in the intervening years. <br> While the Bush tax package was hardly as sweeping as today’s reform, it contained similar provisions. It cut marginal rates across the board, even knocking nearly 5 points off the top marginal rate for the 1 percent. It cut capital-gains taxes and lowered the estate tax to zero in 2010, before the reductions expired. These are all cuts that House and Senate Democrats today uniformly decry as giveaways to the rich and powerful. 
 <b>Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on The Resurgent. <br> UPDATE: This piece has been updated to reflect Senator Jeff Flake is now embracing the GOP's tax plan. <br> It actually looks more like they wanted to derail anything that could help President Trump and, consequently, derail anything that might help Republicans mitigate the damage that will otherwise be inflicted next year. If that is the case, I think Guy Benson is right that they risk setting up the GOP for a real purity test on support for President Trump's agenda. If Republican voters see people like Flake and Corker, supposedly Republicans, derail the President's agenda when even John McCain supports it, they'll be demanding blood oaths in primaries that candidates support Donald Trump. <br> As of this writing, Senator Corker is still a hold out, though he says the plan will pass. Senator Flake has agreed to the concessions made by the Senate GOP leadership. They are, to put it bluntly, cosmetic changes of no major value. But they are enough so Senator Flake can show he got a concession and also show he is a team player. The question now is whether Senator Corker will want on the team or go it alone. 
 Democrats are desperate to derail long-overdue tax relief that is heading to the Senate floor for a vote this week – even if by doing so they take money from the pockets of their own constituents. <br> There are no good arguments against allowing hardworking Americans to keep more of their money. But that hasn’t stopped Democrats, who are intent ondenying President Trump a victory at any cost – including lying about the Senate tax bill’s impact in an attempt to block its passage. <br> MYTH 1: The tax bill is a tax increase on the middle class. <br> Recognizing the popularity of a middle-class tax cut, Democrats are trying to use the Bizarro-world argument that the tax cut bill is actually a tax increase. They cite a Tax Policy Center report claiming the bill would raise taxes on 87 million middle-class families. <br> What the Democrats don’t mention is that the Tax Policy Center is a project of the left-wing Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, funded by donors like George Soros who want to disrupt President Trump’s agenda by any means necessary. <br> In reality, the tax bill would provide significant relief for the middle class by doing the following: doubling the income threshold under which families pay no taxes at all to $24,000; doubling the child tax credit to $2,000; and eliminating the 15 percent tax rate in favor of an expanded 12 percent rate, among other provisions. <br> MYTH 2: The majority of the tax bill’s benefits go to the top 1 percent of earners. <br> Democrats are trying to distract from the bill’s middle-class tax relief by claiming most of the benefits go to the super-rich. But in reality, the bill is targeted at the middle class. <br> This 20 percent tax deduction would allow small business owners to keep more of their earnings, helping them to compete with their big business and international competitors – as well as hire more employees, raise wages and expand. <br> But who would see little-to-no relief from it? The top 1 percent, with annual incomes of roughly $500,000 and higher. <br> However,<a href="https://www.jobcreatorsnetwork.com/new-job-creators-network-national-small-business-poll-gives-ammunition-to-tax-cut-fight/" target="_blank">surveyand<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Tax%20Reform%20and%20Wages.pdf" target="_blank">economicevidence demonstrates that corporate tax cuts benefit the middle class in the form of higher wages, better workplace benefits, new job opportunities and lower consumer prices. <br> MYTH 3: The tax bill will grow deficit by $1.4 trillion. <br> Democrats are suddenly pretending to care about the nation’s fiscal state by pointing to the tax bill’s $1.4 trillion of lost revenues on a static basis over 10 years. What isn’t said is that this is only a 3 percent drop from the $43 trillion Congressional Budget Office (CBO) revenue projection over this timeframe. <br> According to the CBO, every 0.1 percent increase in the gross domestic product adds over $250 billion in revenue over 10 years. This means that even returning to 2.5 percent economic growth – still well below the U.S. historical average – would more than pay for the tax cut. <br> Sen. Cantwell: “No, I don’t think (the tax bill) will grow (the economy).” <br> The tax cuts enacted under Presidents Coolidge, Kennedy and Reagan, among others, all generated several years of supercharged economic growth. The principle is simple: More money in the wealth-creating hands of the private economy – and less in the wealth-destroying hands of government – creates economic growth. <br> MYTH 5: The tax bill will cause 13 million people to lose health insurance. <br> Given this scare tactic worked so well to kill health-care reform, Democrats are trotting it out in an attempt to do the same to tax reform. But the facts are very different this time around. 
 Ever since Republican Sen. Rand Paulsaid hewas blindsided and seriously injured byhisneighbor while mowing the lawn of his home in Kentucky on Nov. 3, media speculation has abounded as to what sparked the attack. Some of it has been quite nasty. <br> Paul’s neighbor, Rene Boucher, has been charged with misdemeanor assault and has pleaded not guilty. <br> I sat down with the senator at his office in Washington this week for his first exclusive interview since being attacked. I gave him a chance to set the record straight about what happened, why it happened and how he is recovering. <br> Nevertheless, I couldn't help but notice that the senator – who is also a physician – did not in any way draw attention to his obvious pain, discomfort or injury. He is tough and does notwant sympathy. <br> What Paul did emphasize was the detail of what it takes to overcome an injury like the one he suffered. He also showed me a dexterity of thinking that enables him to range from discussing a complex injury as a doctor to discussing taxes as a senator. <br> “I think people see someone on TV andtheythinkyou are not real, that youdon’t deserveany sort ofcompassionand that maybe you don’t hurt like a normal person,” Paul told me. “I think my wife said it best when she saidI sort ofgot assaulted twice, you know,once in my yard somebody attacked me from behind and then themedia, who thought it wassort offunny or gleeful, orthatmaybe I deserved it somehow.” <br> “I was working in my yard withmyear muffson, you know,to protectmyhearing from the mower,” Paul said. “AndIgot off the mower facing downhill and the attacker came running full blown. I never saw him, never had a conversation.In fact,the weird thing is Ihaven’t talked to him in 10 years.” <br> The senator explained to me the nature of his injury. <br> Paul continued: “You can run pretty fast down a hill. He speared me in the back,and theyeitherarebroken (ribs) then or as I hit the ground, his shoulder probably plowed into meas I hit the ground. But it was on impact,theinitial impact, or as we probably went through the air 10 to 12 feet, and then hit the ground againandso it happened withthe initialimpact,but it wasfromtheforce of his head and shoulderssort ofspearing me in the back.” <br> I asked Paul if he knew what was going on in his neighbor’s mind. He replied: “I didn’t beforethe attack because we had no conversation. After my ribs were broken,thenhe said things to me totry toindicatewhyhe was unhappy.” <br> There has been speculation, Paul said, that he was attacked in a dispute over yard clippings, but he dismissed that. Paul said he doesn’t know if the attack was motivated by hatred of President Trump, hatred of the senator, or because the attacker was angry at the senator for opposing ObamaCare. Or, maybe, there was something about the yard that motivated him. <br> How badly was he hurt? <br> Paul added: “Iknew Icouldn’t lift my hands over my head to take my shirt off, andsoI knew something had happened. I didn’t know how bad it was untiltheX-rays came back. It was also one of those things where the initial pain, the initial shortness of breath,wasn’t the full extent oftheinjury.” <br> What happened with the pneumonia? <br> However on the plane ride home, while on ibuprofen, his fever hit 102.6 and he says he realized it was time to get treatment. Paul says hegot pneumonia in the area with the bruising of the lung, but is now on the mend. <br> How long to completely heal? <br> Message to America 
 Vice presidents don’t often get a chance to change history, unless they become close advisors to the man in the Oval Office (Al Gore, Dick Cheney), or succeed him following death or resignation (Andrew Johnson, Gerald Ford), or get elected to the presidency themselves (George H.W. Bush). <br> But Vice President Mike Pence may be in a position to be not only the most important person in the Trump administration but very possibly the most important man in America right now. <br> How President Trump decides to utilize this unique human asset to bridge the transition will determine whether his presidency is a success or failure. <br> The New Politics is driven by visceral distrust and hatred of the Old Politics. It thrust Donald Trump into office against all expectations; it may do the same with Judge Roy Moore. Its home is not Washington but the nation at large, and what drives it is social media and their attendant apps. <br> That power should not be underestimated. Right now we have seen social media’s power to polarize and inflame. But over the long haul its real impact will be empowering individuals to connect and act together to address issues of genuine national concern, not just the ones that appear on the front page of the New York Times. In that sense, Trump’s Tweets are actually the wave of the future as social media becomes a tool for taking away the mainstream media’s ability to define the national agenda, whether it’s kneeling during the national anthem or the deep state’s reluctance to prosecute wrongdoing when it’s a Democrat or one of their own. <br> Freedom will be an app we literally hold in our hand. The New Politics based on the sovereign individual, and crowdsourcing the sovereignty of the people, will spell the end of Old Politics as we know it, and the birth of a new America. <br> No doubt Trump imagined his formal status as president would be enough to overcome their opposition, especially within his party. It hasn’t happened. &nbsp;Instead, Trump needs a spokesman who has the trust of both the Old and the New Politics, and who can negotiate the dark dangerous currents that run between them. &nbsp; 
 One of the fundamental problems in Washington is the attitude that the money that people make belongs to the government. That’s why you hear arguments about how much a tax cut “costs,” or big government advocates disingenuously and breathlessly complaining about the people who pay taxes getting a tax cut. <br> I believe it is the other way around. Our default position should be that the money you earn belongs to you, and government has to justify why it should take it from you. <br> This is absurd, and so is the fact that government will collect over $3 trillion from taxpayers next year but still is not satisfied. <br> One of the main differences between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans, in general, favor less government and more tax cuts. That’s why I’m pleased to see us moving forward on a plan for tax cuts, and why I hope to vote to pass such a cut in the coming weeks. <br> I’m also pleased to note that, in part by my urging, the Senate tax-plan writers have included repeal of the ObamaCare individual mandate in the tax plan. The mandate is clearly a tax, a fact that was established by the Supreme Court when it upheld ObamaCare. So including it in the tax bill only makes sense. In addition, with CBO scoring it as a $350 billion savings, repealing the mandate helped pave the way for increased middle-class tax cuts, like an expanded child tax credit. <br> This bill is not perfect. I would prefer a larger cut. I would prefer that the Senate bill match the House bill and keep some form of state and local deductions so that no one gets caught in the trap of losing too many deductions at once and failing to benefit from the tax cuts. Lastly, I’d like to see more permanence on the individual side. <br> The good news is — we can do this every year. Want a bigger tax cut? Urge your legislators to do one every single year. I’ll sponsor it. Want them to be permanent? Well, one good start is to keep extending them, every single year. 
 It’s been more than three decades since Congress has worked with the White House to modernize the nation’s outdated tax system. But that is all about to change. <br> Over the last several months, lawmakers in both chambers have laid the groundwork for historic tax reform. And it all started with the budget process, within the Budget Committee that I chair in the House of Representatives. <br> However, it wasn’t until both chambers agreed to the same budget that conservative tax reform could begin in earnest. For that reason, I often called passage of the budget the “golden key” to unlock tax reform. Without the budget, we couldn’t advance or expand on the tax reform framework that received praise from President Donald Trump when it was unveiled earlier this fall. <br> The good news is that things are steadily moving along. Following agreement to the same budget in both chambers at the end of October, we swiftly rolled out comprehensive tax reform legislation in the House: the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” Earlier this month, the House Committee on Ways and Means, of which I am also a member, was hard at work getting the bill ready for the floor. After four full days of productive dialogue and fine-tuning the text, I was proud to see it approved by the committee. I was even prouder to see it passed on the House floor. <br> In our tax reform plan, we help low and middle-class Americans see more of their hard-earned paychecks by lowering tax rates and doubling the standard deduction for individuals and married couples. For an average middle-class family of four, that translates to nearly $1,200 off their taxes. We also establish a new Family Credit that raises the Child Tax Credit and introduces new credits for family members and other dependents. The tax code also becomes less confusing and less cumbersome, making it possible for most Americans to file their taxes on a simple post card. 
 Occurring largely behind the scenes, President Trump’s most significant contribution to a more prosperous America is also his least understood: his assault on the administrative state. <br> The administrative state is the manifestation of a form of government that invests power in an unelected bureaucracy that can write the rules, enforce the rules and sit in judgment on the rules – essentially combining the power of three branches of constitutional government into one. <br> De Tocqueville wrote that excessive regulation by government “compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.” <br> A little more than 40 years after the Federal Register’s creation, former U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy, D- Minn., quipped that “the only thing that saves us from the bureaucracy is inefficiency. An efficient bureaucracy is the greatest threat to liberty.” <br> In the last full year of President Obama’s term, the Federal Register contained more than 185,000 pages of regulations. Many of these regulations can, if not followed to the letter, lead to imprisonment and financial ruin. Moreover, bureaucrats lacking accountability to the voting public wrote these rules. <br> We are funding an army of 220,000 highly trained people, many of them lawyers, to develop new and more complicated ways to tell the rest of us how to work and live our lives. Were these regulators an actual army, they’d outnumber the army of France. <br> Employing progressive rates, loopholes, and credits, the tax code rewards some financial behavior while discouraging other behavior. The tax code thus guides economic decisions in the same way the road network channels vehicle traffic. <br> While regulators, their rules, and a complex tax code take their toll on jobs and prosperity, excessive federal spending also plays a part in misallocating scarce resources. <br> Combining the four previously discussed factors can give a sense as to the soft tyranny exerted on society by the federal government. 
 The American people are anxious for our elected officials in Washington to end their rancor and dysfunction and start accomplishing things. <br> A recent Gallup Poll asked whether Americans preferred leaders who compromise to get things done, or ones who stick to their principles – even if little gets done. The problem solvers were favored over the obstructionists by 54 percent to 18 percent. <br> The House recently passed its version of a tax cut bill and the Senate is aiming to do the same as soon as Thursday. The Senate bill, however, is being tied to the thorny issue of health care, looking to repeal the mandate for individuals to have health insurance. <br> In May, members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, which features 46 members – half from each political party – announced their willingness to work on a bipartisan deal combining tax reform with infrastructure investment. <br> What’s best for the country is not a tax reform effort that mirrors this year’s health-care “debate,” in which one party (the Republicans) tried repeatedly to ram through a repeal with only GOP votes. Democrats were mostly content to sit on the sideline throwing stones. That’s not leadership by either party. <br> If leaders on either side are really interested in governing – as opposed to posturing and futile gestures – there is actually an opening for a broad bipartisan and transformative tax plan that reflects favorably on both parties and most importantly helps grow the economy and creates jobs. <br> Among the countless problems with the current tax code: It’s complex. It’s unfair. Most of the deductions and loopholes benefit upper income individuals and businesses. And, it’s uncompetitive, with a corporate tax system that actively discourages investment in the U.S. <br> Done right, tax reform could bring a big share of this money home for investment here. The new tax revenue could be used to fund major infrastructure investments in new roads, better air travel, an updated power grid and other priorities, which according to the same Harvard-Harris poll, enjoys 84 percent public support. <br> It isn’t just the Problem Solvers Caucus that has endorsed this idea. In 2015, House Speaker Paul Ryan and now Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were reportedly closing in on a deal that would have combined tax reform and infrastructure investment. <br> So, what’s standing in the way of this deal happening? Nothing, other than bad habits and blind partisanship. <br> Hatch would know. He is one of the few members of Congress who was there in 1986, when Congress last passed a comprehensive tax reform package. That bill passed 97-3 in the Senate, an almost unimaginable margin in today’s bitterly divided capitol. 
 Should the government borrow against the future? Should it guarantee higher taxes for your children and grandchildren in return for lower taxes for you? <br> If government’s moral legitimacy depends on the consent of the governed, as Thomas Jefferson argued in the Declaration of Independence, can the federal government morally compel those who haven’t consented to its financial profligacy -- because they are not yet born -- to pay higher taxes? <br> In fact, with the exception of a few courageous senators, such as Rand Paul of Kentucky, and representatives, such as Justin Amash of Michigan and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, most in Congress in both parties think the only limit on the government‘s taxing power is what it can politically get away with at any given moment. <br> The numbers are chilling. <br> The federal government collects about $2.5 trillion in revenue and spends about $4 trillion, annually. The difference between what it collects and what it spends is made up in borrowing. But it doesn’t borrow money as you or I do or any business does -- with a planned schedule to pay back the principal it owes plus interest. Rather, it goes deeper into debt to pay its debts. <br> Since the presidency of Woodrow Wilson 100 years ago, however, with two then-novel revenue-generating tools -- the personal income tax to produce cash and the Federal Reserve to print cash -- the federal government has rolled over debt but has never retired it. Stated differently, the feds have always made timely interest payments, but when principal has come due, they have simply borrowed more money to pay the principal and of course thereby incurred more debt. <br> No household, no business, no bank, no government can long survive by doing this. <br> The Republican House tax changes -- they cannot be called a “reform,” because they reform nothing; they just redistribute wealth and add debt -- would lower taxes for some and raise taxes for many and add $1.5 trillion in debt for all. <br> But you won’t hear any of this debated in Congress because there -- and in the White House, as well -- we have insufficient political courage to address this problem prudently. <br> The bubble, soon to consist of $1 trillion in annual federal government interest payments on $25 trillion in debt, has been characterized by no less a warrior than the current secretary of defense and by his colleague the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the greatest contemporary threat to national security America faces -- greater than Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korea and all the terrorist crazies who wish us ill combined. <br> Happy Thanksgiving. 
 Last week the Trump Administration put plans in place to reverse a ban blocking the importation of elephant trophies back into the U.S. from Zimbabwe and Zambia. The true motive behind the move was cleverly disguised by its proponents as a feel-good story designed to benefit conservation efforts as new data, allegedly provided by Zimbabwean officials, indicated increased hunting would actually help the threatened species. <br> As someone who spends time behind the scenes supporting projects focused on protecting elephants in East Africa, I can tell you that I have been scratching my head all week wondering what idiot in our government thought this was a good idea in the first place. Who thought that they could actually sneak this one in and the American people would just whistle past it? Well we didn’t. <br> The facts of poaching are very clear: there are more elephants being killed every day in Africa than are being born. If the killing of the species continues at current rates, it won’t be long until we are taking our children to see them in the Smithsonian museum and having to explain why they can no longer go see them alive in their natural habitat. <br> What this new decision sounds like is a bunch of bored, rich guys got together to tell hunting stories and bet each other that they could get a guy in Washington to pass a law for them that helps fill empty space on their walls. This has good old boys club written all over it. What we are seeing is an abuse of power. President Trump should have the head of whoever was behind this new policy. <br> What surprised me even further was that the Department of the Interior seemed to stand behind the ban reversal based on shoddy research. The unlucky U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official who was given the task of defending the decision publicly stated that “new data” received from Zimbabwe supported reversing the ban, that well-regulated sport hunting as part of “sound management” conservation program can benefit certain species. <br> Let me be clear, this is not about bashing hunting. I am no stranger to the world myself. I grew up hunting in Texas. I spent most of my career in U.S. Army Special Ops community – you should have seen the guns I had access to. At one point in my career you could even argue that I hunted and killed people for a living. But there is a significant difference between hunting as a legal practice in the U.S. and the hunting of designated endangered species in countries that have proven track records of corrupt conservation practices. So when someone tells me that promoting the hunting of endangered species is a great way to protect them and also put money back into the cause, I have a hard time not laughing at their complete ignorance of it all. 
 Dan Mitchell has been waiting a long time for tax reform. In 1986, he was a young free-market economist working for Senator Bob Packwood, the Finance Committee chairman who helped carry Ronald Reagan’s bold tax reform across the finish line into law. The lower rates and simplified tax code embodied in that law set the stage for the economic growth of the 1990s. <br> Since then, the tax code has once again become encrusted with special interest barnacles and higher tax rates. <br> The House bill will now go over to the Senate, which has to pass its own version and then reconcile it with the House bill before anything reaches President Trump’s desk for his signature. That’s a lot of moving parts and much can go wrong, but it looks as if we are on the cusp of real tax reform. <br> The three major elements of both the House and Senate bill are: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharp reduction in the amount of double taxation of business so as to enable more saving and investment. <br> The reason why those goals have been so difficult to achieve in the last 30 years is that special interests are very good at guarding their own part of the tax code turf. <br> Campaign contributions will flow to opponents of reform. If the opposition to tax reform were a movie it would be dubbed “Revenge of the Swamp Creatures.” 
 Now that both the House and Senate have versions of the Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act that provide a $1.5 trillion tax reduction for Americans, the doomsayers will be out in full force to declare that tax reform is too difficult to achieve. No reason for pessimism yet. With one smart amendment, the Republicans could have their cake and eat it too. <br> The Republican task seemed to get much harder with the Congressional Budget Office release of an estimate that the tax bill would cause an estimated $1.7 trillion revenue loss for the government over the next decade. &nbsp;As a result, the CBO predicts that U.S. federal debt will grow from 91.2 to 97.1 percent of GDP over that period. <br> But there is a way. Many countries, including Canada and Britain, traditionally install business tax rate reductions over several years rather than moving quickly to a target rate. Republicans should do the same. <br> Not only would delayed rate reductions reduce the revenue cost but it would also help spur growth more. Here’s why. <br> The House plan recommends a 15-point reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 per cent in one swoop, at a CBO-projected cost of $1.46 trillion in ten years.&nbsp; The Senate’s one year delay in the rate cut would squeeze that down to $1.33 trillion over the same period. <br> Suppose instead, however, that the federal corporate income tax rate of 35 per cent is reduced annually by 3 points to the 20 per cent plateau. I calculate that the ten-year loss in revenues would be at least $250 billion less than that predicted by the House Tax Cut and Jobs Act—cutting the projected House bill cost to $1.21 billion. The proposed savings on the Senate bill would be more than double the amount saved by a one-year delay. <br> This effectively results in lower taxes on new investment compared to reducing the corporate rate immediately to 20 per cent or with a one year delay. <br> The Republicans could also reduce costs of their reform by doing the same thing with business income earned by sole proprietorships and partnerships.&nbsp;These are the kind of business vehicles used by small business owners and professionals. Not only would this method reduce the costs of the reform, it would spur new investment as users looked forward to increased future tax gains. 
 Leave it to the Senate to take a flaming hot Trump economy and throw swamp water on it! The booming stock market speaks for itself. President Trump has our economy rolling and now the Senate comes along with business as usual tactics to mess things up. Free-market lovers will never stand for this! <br> The version of tax reform legislation unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday is another indication that the swamp is alive and well. This is a repeat performance of the failure of Congress to get health care done. <br> Effectively, the Senate tax bill calls for a slightly lower top tax rate for individuals of 38.5 percent, versus the 39.6 percent in the House bill. The Senate measure also would double the estate tax exemption, but not repeal the tax, as House Republicans proposed. <br> The duration of real estate depreciation will be reduced from 39 years to 25 years. This initiative alone will create another real estate asset bubble like the 1980s, where the rush to invest in real estate was not matched with economic demand. This in turn created a supply-side bubble – not enough tenants to fill the buildings and a subsequent mortgage default, followed by the savings and loan crisis. <br> The scoring of the proposed Senate tax bill shows this will cost the federal government $5.8 trillion in reduced revenue over 10 years, adding to the national debt. <br> Once again, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., capitulated to the needs of a few American taxpayers. Once again, the special interests win, not the American voter. <br> The increasing pressure to deliver a bill the President Trump can sign illustrates just how purposeful Congress is at enabling gridlock. Congress fails to understand that the voter is engaged and is already mobilizing and supporting candidates for the 2018 election cycle who support the president’s agenda. 
 I ran into a woman at the grocery store a while back. With her cart full of groceries and her hand full of coupons, she looked at me in line and said: “When will it get better, Kristi? The cost of these groceries, of health care, of child care – they’re all going up, but I haven’t gotten a raise in years.” <br> She’s not alone. Many American families in every state are asking that exact question: When will it get better? When will the pinch stop? <br> What’s more, those savings are targeted toward our priorities: maybe most importantly, building strong families. <br> Our bill also gives people a boost during those milestone times in their lives, such as when they buy a home or save for retirement. On top of it all, the legislation significantly simplifies the tax code, so many busy families can file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. Think of the stress that would save come tax time. <br> And while we offer support to the families raising our next generation, this tax reform package is also designed to help job creators thrive from one generation to the next. <br> One of the hallmarks of the House GOP plan is a historically low 25 percent tax rate on small businesses that is accompanied by reforms to level the playing field and reduce compliance costs. Additionally, we fully and permanently repeal the Death Tax by 2024, doubling the exemption levels between now and then. <br> A few months afterward, we got a letter from the IRS telling us we owed the Death Tax. We were still reeling from the loss of the powerhouse in our family, and already, the government was reaching out its hand to take part of our American Dream. We had a tough choice: sell off a portion of our family farm or face a decade in debt. We took a decade in debt and struggled to keep our heads above water. <br> By eliminating the Death Tax, we’ll eliminate one of the most unfair, un-American taxes on the books – a tax that has threatened second- and third-generation businesses for far too long. 
 In the world of conservative thought, few issues are as popular as tax reform. It's an accepted truth, by nearly anyone on the right, that the tax code is too complicated for an average citizen to understand and too laden with loopholes to be fair. <br> Beyond the structure of the code itself it's a fairly standard conservative view that taxes themselves are unjust, that government should not be confiscating a large chunk of our hard-earned pay and they certainly shouldn't then be helping themselves to additional taxes after that first take. <br> The marriage tax benefit, for example, is there to encourage people to get married. The electric vehicle credit exists to encourage people to reduce their oil consumption. The American Opportunity Tax Credit encourages people to go to post-secondary school such as colleges or trade schools. And so on. <br> The plan does absolutely nothing to simplify the process. No matter how many times Republican leadership promises that we’ll be able to do our taxes on a postcard, that’s not what the reality will be for nearly anyone. Credits and deductions will still exist though some have been targeted by this plan seemingly at random. <br> One such nonsensical target is the adoption tax credit. Where is the ideological sense in getting rid of a credit to ease the financial burden of adoption? Conservatives always suggest adoption as an alternative to abortion. But adoption is incredibly costly and the credit has been a boon to families looking to adopt, so why cut it? <br> Why get rid of the write-off for medical expenses? It’s practically an admission that single-payer is coming and Republicans don't plan to stop it. Why else not work to defray the costs of people paying for medical care out of pocket? How is that conservative? <br> The mortgage interest rate deduction will drop from $1,000,000 to $500,000--an amount seemingly aimed specifically at people in blue states and the upper middle class. <br> This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills. The free-market organization Club for Growth put out a statement noting that the bill “effectively punishes success and caves to the Democrats’ class warfare rhetoric.” 
 American industry has always been a primary source of strength and jobs in our nation. But today, a great industry that has played a vital role in building and defending the United States – the steel industry – is in crisis. <br> Surging steel imports, largely subsidized by foreign governments, have hammered prices, forced some steel mills to close, and cost thousands of steelworkers their jobs. Since 2000, more than 60,000 steelworkers have seen their jobs disappear, including 14,000 in 2015 and 2016 alone. <br> Foreign steel producers continue to find every way possible to circumvent trade laws and dump products in our market. <br> But there is a solution to this crisis. In April, President Trump recognized both the importance of steel to U.S. national security and the crisis facing the industry. He announced that his administration would begin an investigation pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The law authorizes the secretary of Commerce to conduct investigations to determine what effects imports of any product have on U.S. national security. <br> Launching the investigation was an important signal that the Trump administration would not tolerate further erosion of the steel industry. <br> Despite the urgent need for action, reports now are that a decision on trade violations will be delayed until after Congress deals with tax reform. <br> Steel is used to build the ships, armored vehicles and weapons that keep our troops safe. It is used to build the roads, bridges, railways and airports that keep our economy running. And the steel industry provides jobs that support steelworkers and their families. 
 House Republicans have unveiled tax reform and reduction legislation that is also an amazingly powerful job creation bill. <br> After eight years of the slowest “recovery” in modern American history, we are now poised to create millions of jobs and move from our Obama-era 2 percent economic growth rate to our historic average of 3 percent growth and beyond.President Reagan’s growth rates were over 4 percent. We will match and likely surpass that. <br> Every decision was focused on “what creates the most jobs and income increases for Americans” and “how do we make this permanent,” so we do not have a repeat of the 2012 disappearing tax cuts, when the Bush-era tax cuts expired. <br> It would double the standard deduction from $12,000 for a married couple to $24,000.This makes the claim by Democrats that this legislation raises taxes on middle-income Americans look foolish. Heck, even the Washington Post “fact checker” called out the Democrats for faking the numbers to suggest this is not a tax cut for the vast majority of Americans, in a story headlined: “Senate Democrats falsely claim GOP tax plan will raise taxes for most working-class families.” <br> The tax bill would also cut rates for all Americans.The new rates would be 0 percent, 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. Yes, the top rate would still be the same as what we have now (all the others would be reduced), but it wouldn’t kick in until an income of $1 million for a couple. <br> The alternative minimum tax would be abolished.That was imposed in 1969 to hit 115 people and now hits several million. <br> Manufacturing would rebound because the tax bill would allow businesses to expense all new business investment in the first year, rather than over a decade or more.That drops the cost of new investment in job-creating, income-enhancing technology. <br> The next step is to move the legislation through the House Ways and Means Committee, which should happen quickly because the members were part of writing the bill, and then through the full House. <br> The president called the tax legislation “a great bill” when it was unveiled Thursday and said his administration is “working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas.” 
 Women in public office oftenmakewomen and their families a focus of their work. They put aside partisanship to support positive ideas that are meant to help women in the home, school, workforce, and the economy. <br> Now is an important moment to unite across the aisle and to encourage their male colleagues to make good onpast promises of tax relief to American families. Instead, ahandful offemale senators on the left -- who once bemoaned our byzantinetax codeandclaimed tochampiontax relief for working-class families -- are intentionally trying to block tax reform efforts.Not one of the 16 female Democratic senators voted to pass the Senate’s fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, which creates a procedural path for tax reform and tax cuts. <br> In 2014, New York’s Kristin Gillibrand introduced legislation to triple the<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__wrvo.org_post_gillibrand-2Dagain-2Dfighting-2Dchild-2Dcare-2Dtax-2Ddeductionsd=DwMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=dEMkuFbk9SsONdA4l8dEASNBIHqf2gAiC1OrBl6ivQYm=EYLSFnYuM8c3yjBigDJzfBDInXkNY7eNzI_rQe-VIWQs=1MrXBAvNb_TAXg-J3qzcCszr4iWlJZ5ZO82vl1JqUBYe=" target="_blank">child care tax credit,<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.nydailynews.com_news_politics_gillibrand-2Dcalls-2Dincrease-2Dchild-2Dcare-2Dtax-2Dcredit-2Darticle-2D1.1716136d=DwMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=dEMkuFbk9SsONdA4l8dEASNBIHqf2gAiC1OrBl6ivQYm=EYLSFnYuM8c3yjBigDJzfBDInXkNY7eNzI_rQe-VIWQs=CYG3-GbBD9E9lRfFBAeZQz7tujXXqM3Ujmiie5zflEge=" target="_blank">pleading“If you can’t afford child care, your choice is to leave your job to take care of your children.

Lifting tax burdens are especially important to women-owned businesses because they are more likely than male-owned businesses to rely on personal forms of financing such as savings over traditional loans. 
 The growing momentum behind federal tax cuts has defenders of high taxes worried. Witness their decision to start badmouthing Kansas tax cuts. <br> Tax-and-spend liberals and their media allies are trying to tie President Trump’s tax reform framework tothe 2012 tax cuts in Kansas, which browbeaten Republicans largely reversed earlier this year.<br /> “Kansastried a tax plan similar to Trump’s. It failed,” reads a recentNew York Timesheadline. “A warning to Washington fromKansas,” reads another from CNN. “Kansasabandons massive tax cuts that provided model for Trump’s plan,” saysThe Guardian.</i><br /> A closer look atKansas’ tax cut experience reveals this argument is more style than substance. That’s not to say Republican tax reform advocates in Congress and the White House can’t learn fromKansas– just not the lesson that pro-tax activists are trying to impart.&nbsp;<b> Some background: In 2012,KansasGov. Sam Brownback signed a bill cutting taxes for all state income earners and eliminating them for small businesses that had previously been subject to individual rates. Brownback wanted to give some relief to hardworking taxpayers and boost tepid economic growth.<b> The fallout, according to media accounts, was near apocalyptic: a “spectacular failure” (Los Angeles Times) that caused “hemorrhaging government revenue” (New York Times).<b> But looking at objective government figures, the results are far more positive. According to Census Bureau<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/KSTOTLTAX" target="_blank">data,Kansas’ total tax revenues actually rose in 2012, the year the tax cut<a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/" target="_blank">took effect, to $7.4 billion – a 9 percent increase from $6.8 billion in 2011. Revenues grew further to $7.6 billion in 2013.&nbsp;<br /> How can reality be so different from rhetoric? Well, it’s true thatKansas’ total tax revenue dipped to $7.3 billion in 2014, largely due to the commodity price crash and fiscal cliff federal tax hikes that reduced revenues in several states. <br> Meanwhile, the tax cuts allowed all employees in Kansas to keep a little more of their earnings, which helped Kansas’ real median household income to increase by 15 percent between 2011 and 2016. This income growth was four times faster than the Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma average, and noticeably outpaced the national rate of 11 percent. <br> This isn’t to say thatKansas’ income tax cut could not have been designed better. Rather than eliminating the small-business tax rate entirely, policymakers should have simply cut it deeply, so it could still capture revenue from ensuing economic growth. Similarly, eliminating deductions, credits, and loopholes – part of Brownback’s original plan – would have broadened the tax base to make the tax code fairer and more efficient. <br> The proposal Republicans in Congress are working on would do both these things, cutting the small business rate to 25 percent from about 40 percent, and eliminating deductions like the one for state and local taxes that force people in low-tax states to effectively subsidize high-tax states.&nbsp; 
 President Ronald Reagan wisely said:<i>“You can’t be for big government, big taxes, and big bureaucracy andstill befor the little guy.” <br> The Tax Reform Act of 1986 stands as the single greatest example we’ve known of bipartisan federal income tax policy. Once it was enacted, our nation had a simpler tax code with fewer tax exemptions and loopholes, and significantly lower rates. This brought relief to American families and businesses. <br> The Trump administration and Congress have an opportunity to build an economic legacy. By enacting comprehensive tax reform, they would spur economic growth and ensure American prosperity far into the future. Both Democrats and Republicans can be heroes to their constituents by passing tax reform and kicking off economic growth similar to what we experienced three decades ago. <br> Additionally, homeownership was encouraged by increasing the mortgage interest deduction. Americans kept more of what they earned and were incentivized to invest. The economy soared. <br> This is a far cry from our income tax code today, with the highest rate at 39.6 percent. The previous four administrations have reversed much of the progress made in 1986 and have managed to vastly increase the national debt from $2 trillion to more than $20 trillion. <br> Bipartisanship is required for this overhaul. This can be encouraged by demonstrating one basic economic principle that both Democrats and Republicans understand: incentives. Technically speaking, we’re talking about the behavioral effects of a tax cut. <br> The proposed tax bill would also simplify individual income tax brackets from eight to four (including the “zero” bracket). Individuals earning less than $12,000 a year – or couples earning $24,000 and filing jointly – would pay no tax, essentially doubling the standard deduction. <br> While reducing the number of brackets is a definite positive, adding deductions and credits removes people from the tax rolls and reduces the impact and strength of the tax bill. However, the overall implications of this tax bill are extremely positive. If passed today, it would surely incentivize the Reaganesque economic growth that this country needs. <br> Lowering the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent would encourage existing businesses to grow and invest in the United States, and would reduce barriers for new businesses to form. After all, entrepreneurs are an essential ingredient to our economic growth. You can’t love jobs and hate job creators. <br> How do we learn from that experience and lay a foundation for long-term prosperity in future generations to come? The best way is to each our children and grandchildren that incentives matter. Most children already build an understanding of this principle by achieving good grades, earning an allowance and competing in sports. <br> Today’s fifth-grader will vote for the first time in 2024. When we commit to raising economically educated children, we prevent readdressing economic policy every four to eight years. Talking with kids about how incentives work in their daily decision making, and then demonstrating how this applies to government policy, is the bridge we need to bring about long-term tax reform and prosperity. 
 Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult. <br> While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive. <br> Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more. <br> About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women. <br> This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.” <br> On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent. <br> Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible. <br> This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality. <br> As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Because they knew that what was toxic for Republicans would be even more toxic for vulnerable Senate Democrats running for reelection in states President Trump won by double digits. Democrats are deeply worried about the fates of Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia (which Trump won by 42 points), Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota (which Trump won by 36), Jon Tester of Montana (20), Claire McCaskill of Missouri (19) and Joe Donnelly of Indiana (19). If Trump can pick off some or all of these seats, then he could finally have what he needs to pass key legislation with GOP votes alone.

Donnelly doesn’t approve it . . . we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe,” adding “I think we’ll have numerous Democrats come across because it’s the right thing to do.” All good. <br> But after this initial burst of activity, it looks as if Trump may be giving up. “It’ll be hard getting the Democrats because they are obstructionists and they vote in blocs,”<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/10/18/vulnerable-democratic-senators-want-more-details-gop-tax-plan/" target="_blank" title="morningconsult.com">he told the Heritage Foundation last week, “but if we get the Republicans we need, which is virtually every single one of them . . . you will see things happen like have never happened before.” <br> If he turns up the pressure, he wins, no matter what. If the Democrats capitulate, tax reform will almost certainly pass — giving Trump the major legislative victory that has so far eluded him. If they vote against him in spite of such a campaign, then Trump has teed up the GOP for big gains in the Senate. 
 Let the Congressional Budget Office howl. It’s time for Republicans in Congress to understand what Reagan understood, what JFK understood, and what our friend and mentor Jack Kemp definitely understood: Big tax cuts produce big returns, and the more widespread the cuts, the larger the number of Americans who benefit from them. <br> If Republicans take off the self-imposed straitjacket of Congressional Budget Office revenue estimates based on unrealistically low growth rates and embrace bold, across the board tax cuts, they will trigger the economic growth that past cuts have produced. Tax cuts are simple - if you want growth, jobs, and a balanced budget, go big. <br> Tax cuts have worked everywhere, around the world. Look at what happened to Singapore after they reduced taxes to incentivize growth. Its economy reached staggering heights and is still going strong. <br> There will be no vigorous growth without huge tax cuts, both for investment and consumption. Congress needs to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent - not 20 percent - and remove taxes on overseas profits. Depending on whose numbers you believe, there is anywhere from $2 trillion to $3 trillion in U.S. corporate profits locked away offshore, held hostage by shortsighted tax policies that discourage companies from reinvesting their gains in domestic ventures. That has to end. Congress should also cut or slash the tax rate “for so called pass throughs” – partnerships, S -corps and the like – to 20 percent rather than the proposed 25 percent. This covers most small businesses which are big job creators and sources for innovations. <br> Why is there no discussion of reducing the capital gains levy? After all every time that rate has been reduced, revenues go up immediately. This is a great twofer: more investment and more revenue. <br> Stop taking things away from people; give them something. This way everyone sees their paychecks go up even if they don’t pay federal income tax. <br> These dramatic reductions would boost economic growth to 4 percent or higher. Contrary to the CBO and to root canal, eye shade Republicans, federal revenue growth would easily eliminate the federal deficit within 10 years. 
 Of all the tall tales told about taxes, the tallest is that the rich don’t pay their fair share. <br> The Internal Revenue Service this month released its latest numbers and they show that not only do the rich, along with the middle-class, pay the most in income taxes, but their burden has been going up, not down. <br> The top ten percent of earners, those making more than $138,000 in 2015, made 47 percent of the nation’s income, but they paid 71 percent of the nation’s income tax. The top 1 percent, the people former President Obama decried the most, made 21 percent of the nation’s income in 2015, but they paid 39 percent of the nation’s income tax. <br> Roughly half the taxpayers in the U.S. pay no income taxes. As a practical matter, most taxpayers need to make around $39,000 before they’re hit by the income tax. All taxpayers pay the payroll tax, but according to a recent study by the Urban Institute, when workers retire, Social Security and Medicare give taxpayers their money back. The less money you make, the more likely you are to get all your payroll taxes back, and then some. <br> Income taxes are different. You don’t get them back. They pay for the military, nuclear weapons upkeep, environmental protection, food stamps, housing assistance, welfare, Medicaid and a myriad of other services and transfer payments. <br> When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes. And it’s been that way for a long time. <br> The proposed tax reform pending in the Congress will likely continue this trend because the doubling of the standard deduction and the increase in the child credit mean more people will pay no taxes, shifting the burden even more to the few people who do. As for upper income people, so long as their share of the tax cut is in proportion to their share of the taxes they pay, it’s hard to argue that the tax cut is unfair. <br> The system is incredibly progressive. According to the IRS, in 2015, the top 1 percent paid an average tax rate of 27.1 percent, the top 10 percent paid an average rate of 21.4 percent, the top 30 percent paid an average rate of 17.4 percent and the top 50 percent paid an average rate of 15.7 percent.&nbsp; The bottom 50 percent paid an average rate of 3.6 percent. <br> Not only do middle-income and upper-income Americans pay the most, they make it possible for their fellow Americans to receive quite a bit of government largesse. According to a study from the American Enterprise Institute, 60 percent of U.S. households, those making less than about $51,000, receive more in transfer payments than they pay in federal taxes. 
 The U.S. Senate is sometimes referred to the most deliberative body in the world. And maybe that's justified: it is smart to deliberate over the consequences of serious legislation before passing it. <br> Although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell turned deliberation into an art form, he may have met his match earlier this week when he was called to the White House for a little chat about getting things done. Just last week, while the House of Representatives, the federal government, and every state and local government were busy working, McConnell’s Senate found it necessary to stretch Columbus Day into Columbus Week. But that’s not to say the rest of his weeks are much more strenuous. Everybody likes a three-day weekend. <br> It’s not as if they have nothing to do. A new president nominates candidates to fill the Executive Branch departments and agencies and under the Constitution’s Advise and Consent clause the Senate confirms them. In most cases the nominees go through the process without much controversy and go on their way to do the nation’s business. Not this time. <br> President Trump has sent 455 nominees to the Senate for confirmation. But McConnell’s Senate has confirmed only 182, leaving a staggering 273 nominees twisting in the wind, and 273 empty chairs waiting to be filled. By this time in Barack Obama’s administration, 358 of his nominees – nearly twice as many as Trump’s -- had been approved and were at their desks. <br> It would be easy to say that Chuck Schumer, the Democrat Minority Leader, is the culprit. To be sure, the Democrats have slowed up some, and even stopped a few others. But since Republicans did away with the filibuster, Democrats can slow the process down, but don’t have many tools to stop nominations any more. Instead, it is Republicans who find it inconvenient to stay in Washington. Not having people in place to run those executive branch agencies and departments is even more inconvenient for the taxpayers. <br> Or ask people from Houston, Florida and Puerto Rico who are desperately waiting for the federal government to help them rebuild their lives after three devastating hurricanes. Much of that help comes from the Department of Health and Human Services, where nominees for three of the most important positions, including the General Counsel, are waiting action by the Senate. 
 If a metaphor could be used for this White House, it might be a two-sided coin with President Trump the head and Vice President Mike Pence the tail. <br> The president tends toward the bombastic to get people’s attention and make his points, while his vice president is calm and measured in his response to questions, sometimes resembling a contemplative monk. In many ways they complement each other. <br> Why the optimism? Because, he says, “there is broad-based and more than a little bipartisan support for tax relief to get this economy growing again.” Pence thinks the “failure to repeal ObamaCare in 2017 has created (an) even greater sense of urgency. There’s a great sense of anticipation among the American public. I think members of Congress are very aware of that.” <br> What about ObamaCare and the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace it, leading to a number of executive orders (issued Thursday) to address what the president feels is the harm caused by that law? <br> What about Iran and the decertification of the nuclear deal made during the Obama administration? Pence said the president considers the deal a “disaster agreement for the United States.” From the White House on Friday, the president announced he was decertifying the deal, imposing new sanctions and asking our allies and Congress to address the deal’s “serious flaws.” <br> I ask if a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and getting Kim to stop production of nuclear weapons can be achieved without war and get the standard answer the president has given: “We remain hopeful we’ll be able to achieve it by economic and diplomatic means, but all options are on the table.” <br> Would he care to comment on the Harvey Weinstein story everyone is talking about? 
 Editor's Note: This first appeared in The Hill. <br> An old proverb says a leader with no followers is “onlytaking a walk.” <br> A Morning Consult poll released last week found Trump losing support in states he easily carried last year. He is down 23 points in Tennessee since his inauguration in January, down 21 points in Mississippi, down 20 in Kentucky, down 19 in Kansas and down 17 in Indiana. <br> On Capitol Hill, House and Senate Republicans are also walking away from Trump. <br> In part, this is due to his attacks on Senate Majority Leader<a href="http://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker<a href="http://thehill.com/people/paul-ryan" target="_blank">Paul Ryan, R-Wis. <br> Bannon said last week he plans to challenge incumbent Republican senators in seven states, including Arizona’s<a href="http://origin-nyi.thehill.com/people/jeff-flake" target="_blank">Jeff Flake, Mississippi’s<a href="http://thehill.com/people/roger-wicker" target="_blank">Roger Wicker, Nebraska’s<a href="http://thehill.com/people/deb-fischer" target="_blank">Deb Fischer, Nevada’s<a href="http://thehill.com/people/dean-heller" target="_blank">Dean Hellerand Wyoming’s<a href="http://thehill.com/people/john-barrasso" target="_blank">John Barrasso. <br> Speaking on Sean Hannity’s radio show, Gingrich stated the obvious: It would be better for the GOP if the president and his allies spent their time trying to beat incumbent Democratic senators. <br> Corker denied that, shooting back that it is a “shame the White House has become an adult day care center.” He added that Trump has hurt U.S. foreign relations with his impetuous tweets on world affairs, including “things that are not true.” <br> Corker was not “set up” by the Times. A transcript showed the senator stating, “I understand we’re on the record.” <br> “Last time I checked, you are the president of the United States, so tweeting out these tacky insults just seems beneath you,” Neil Cavuto of Fox News said on his show last week. “You are running out of friends faster than you are running out of time. You might not like Bob Corker, but a lot of senators do, and you need those senators, sir.” <br> Thomas Barrack told The Washington Post he was “shocked” and “stunned” by Trump’s recent comments. <br> To win back some followers, Trump needs a win. <br> But once again he is strutting with no one behind him as he abandons tax reform. He is focused on tax cuts for the rich. <br> The New York Times analysis of the tax cut plan concluded it would be a “huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans” and “not directly benefit the bottom third of the population.” Polls show Americans oppose tax cuts for the rich. <br> Trump has also failed to deliver on his campaign promise to build a southern border wall and have Mexico pay for it. He continues to say it will get done. But, again, polls show voters don’t want a wall. <br> Instead, having failed to win a full repeal of the health care law from the Republican majority in Congress, he signed an executive order allowing low-cost insurance to be sold across state lines. <br> So it’s no wonder Trump now walks alone. He remains a celebrity figure for his hardcore base. But10 months into his presidency, Republicans are starting to drift away as he fails to deliver on nearly every major campaign promise he made. 
 As President Donald Trump redoubles his efforts to fulfill campaign promises on tax reform, a critical part of his program is in jeopardy of being discarded, as a result of the efforts of uninformed or self-interested business lobbies. <br> The measure under attack is a proposal to increase taxes on importers of foreign goods and reduce taxes on exporters of American goods. It must be restored if tax reform is to achieve its objectives of stimulating investment, preventing American companies from continuing to off-shore RD and manufacturing, and avoiding increases in the deficit. <br> Companies that do stay home get to keep such a small share of returns on their capital that they cannot afford to make investments that would be good for everyone. <br> According to the National Science Foundation, business RD spending is now three times as large as government RD, but since 2010 the basic research share of RD has declined.&nbsp; Basic research is the place where innovations start, and needs the most encouragement. <br> Lowering tax rates would improve the profitability of all long-term investments, and the payoffs from RD are among the most long-term of all. <br> Another tax reform proposal, to eliminate the deductibility of interest paid by corporations, would level the playing field for high-tech companies with large RD budgets, because these high-risk investments cannot be financed with loans. &nbsp;Failures are as common as success in the early stages of innovation, and require investors to spread those risks across a portfolio of projects rather than lenders who require collateral and assurance of repayment. <br> Finally, the RD tax credit is one of the two current business tax credits retained in the reform proposals. <br> What the measure sought to redress is the fact that other countries try to attract RD centers by offering extremely low tax rates on income generated by RD activities, including income from patents and licensing of new products as well as income from manufacturing them. <br> When U.S. companies relocate overseas in response to these inducements, they avoid almost all taxes by hiring workers and keeping profits overseas while exporting manufactured goods back to the United States. <br> The border adjustment was intended to fix this by eliminating the opportunity to deduct payments for imports, including payments for foreign patents, from business income. <br> The whole package of lower taxes, a level playing field in capital markets, continued RD tax credits and the border adjustment would provide powerful incentives to invest in RD within the United States and to produce here the new and better goods that are the fruits of RD. <br> Executives from Walmart, Target, and other big retail chains and off-shoring manufacturers like Nike descended en masse on Republican senators of the states in which they had headquarters to extract promises to oppose the border adjustments. <br> The damage had been done by the time Chairman Brady and a number of economists correctly pointed out that the brunt of the import adjustment would be borne primarily by foreign companies which would have to adjust their prices downward in order to maintain market share for the foreign-made products they sell into the United States. <br> In other words, no real increase in consumer prices would be likely to occur. <br> We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform the tax code in a way that will stimulate innovation and productivity growth for decades to come. 
 While we glorify football players for their accomplishments on the field, they are not heroes. I recently visited with a real hero – a young Army sergeantfrom my congressional district who still gets body tremors when he stands. Bombs bursting in the air exploded over his unit in Afghanistan, leaving shards of metal stuck in his skull. <br> When I entered his room at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he proudly stood at full attention, brimming with nervous energy. I had come to thank him on behalf of a grateful nation, and the sergeant was as respectful as he was inspiring in his patriotism. Although he winced with pain, he would not take the meeting lying down. <br> The teacher and the sergeant are the regular folks who make up my North Florida district, which boasts of more military bases than Starbucks, and more veterans than pelicans. These are the folks who do not understand why NFL players would disrespect our anthem or our flag or why the NFL Commissioner's office has embraced this unpatriotic conduct. <br> Our nation is increasingly diverse in thought, values, and background. Yet throughout our history, America has given proof through many nights that our flag is still here, and that freedom still reigns. <br> It is bizarre to see the NFL attacking an America that has treated it so well over the years. Taxpayers pay over 70 percent of the cost of stadiums. Our citizens pay more and more for tickets, and valuations of professional sports franchises have skyrocketed. Player compensation keeps growing. But the NFL Commissioner’s office can choose at any point to stop paying taxes altogether.Only in America, baby! <br> As for the NFL Commissioner’s office, why do they get special treatment in the tax code in the first place? Why do any professional sports leagues enjoy tax advantages unavailable to regular folks or small businesses? Special loopholes in the tax code for pro-sports leagues will shortchange the U.S. Treasury by over $150 million during the current budget window. <br> President Trump has called for massive tax reform to get our economy moving again. We must cut taxes for hard-working Americans, while ending the swampy loopholes crafted by special interest groups. Ending the exemption for pro-sports leagues is an obvious place to start — and President Trump agrees with that, too. 
 We’re more than two weeks from Halloween, yet the mainstream media is already itching to give the American people a mighty good fright, spinning President Trump’s desperately needed tax reform<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.treasury.gov_press-2Dcenter_press-2Dreleases_Documents_Tax-2DFramework.pdfd=DwMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=zPCRl7zn3fwNXu2CRlz8uhIbaQDLe4pv5YJCS1yKHzos=pKDh8N6egXScB0klEoUBzY9BhvgfA36WPz40qzTMNcse=" target="_blank">framework as rash, ill-conceived and even dangerous. <br> At the same time, the president has been barnstorming across the rust belt and his tax reform plan has been met with enthusiastic approval by energized audiences. This show that our country’s elites still – nearly on year after the election – don’t have a darn clue what matters to real, hardworking Americans. <br> Republicans in Congress have to get off their duffs and start supporting the leader who was elected to remake Washington. They blew the opportunity (several times) to eliminate one of the most egregious violations of personal liberty in modern history – ObamaCare. Their failure dissipated a lot of the momentum that could finally make the federal government responsive to its citizens. <br> President Trump’s tax reform framework contains several major provisions, all of which bring a much-needed quality to The Swamp: simplicity. <br> Forking over our money to the IRS just so it can be flushed down into an opaque, bottomless pit of bureaucratic ineptitude is infuriating enough. On top of this, the Tax Foundation estimates that Americans collectively spent $147 billion last year to prepare business income tax returns and $99 billion preparing individual income tax returns. The IRS estimates that we spent a total of 8.9 billion hours complying with tax-filing requirements. <br> Another perfectly sensible proposal is killing the death tax, which unceremoniously celebrated its centennial last year. A Gallup<a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/190067/americans-react-presidential-candidates-tax-proposals.aspx?g_source=Election%202016g_medium=newsfeedg_campaign=tiles" target="_blank">polllast year found that 54 percent of Americans want it eliminated. The tax has a devastating impact on the economy by increasing costs on small businesses. <br> The president’s tax reform framework further aims to help American businesses regain their competitive edge in a globalized economy increasingly stacked against them. It advises considering methods to reduce corporate double taxation, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, and lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. <br> Fortunately, President Trump is brave enough to clutch third rails with both hands. Having a president ready and willing to buck convention means the chance for the GOP to pivot finally – and go big. <br> “Kicking the can down the road” doesn’t adequately express the continual unwillingness of our elected officials to tackle the systemic problems of Social Security. A can might get dented from being kicked, but its weight doesn’t change. 
 The American people are frustrated and rightly so. Tens of millions of Americans came together and elected the ultimate political outsider Donald Trump president of the United States in 2016. This was a continuation of the message sent by voters in 2010 and again in 2014 that Washington, D.C., is broken.&nbsp; <br> Now nine months into the reform-minded Trump administration, that feeling of frustration is palpable and growing with each day.&nbsp; It’s growing because Republican leaders in Congress can’t seem to get their act together to keep their promises to the American people and pass the president’s conservative reform agenda. The Republican majority is Congress is not enormous but it’s large enough to pass the big ticket items that virtually every member of the House and Senate caucuses has supported and campaigned on over the years. <br> I sincerely hope that history does not repeat itself with tax reform. Republican Senator Bob Corker has long supported tax reform for his overtaxed constituents in Tennessee. His constituents sent him to Washington to now deliver on the conservative agenda that eluded them during the Obama years. Tennesseans delivered their electoral votes to Donald Trump with an overwhelming 61 percent of the vote. 
 While there is far more to be done, President Trump has the right idea on health care reform. The low hanging fruit is strategic deregulation, specifically rolling back the ACA-imposed requirements on health insurance that not only directly raised insurance premiums but furthered the inappropriate construct that insurance should minimize out-of-pocket payment for all medical care. When insurance covers nearly everything, patients have little incentive to consider price of care, so doctors and hospitals don’t need to compete on price. The consequences are the overuse of health care and unrestrained costs. <br> The president’s directive will allow more insurance choices for millions of people who don’t want to buy bloated coverage filled with mandates for care they do not value and will not use. Part of this is the opportunity to buy insurance from other states and without the burden of ObamaCare’s “essential benefits” that increased premiums by almost 10 percent, and many of the 2,270 state coverage mandates for everything from acupuncture to marriage therapy. This will generate cheaper insurance. <br> Could people consider price for medical care? Yes - almost 60 percent of all expenditures by privately insured adults under age 65 is for elective outpatient care, and these are amenable to price-conscious purchasing. Even for the top one percent of spenders who spend for more than 25 percent of all health spending, a full 45 percent is for outpatient care. <br> For patients to effectively seek out the best value for their money, more reforms must also occur. <br> First, the visibility of information that patients require for assessing value must be radically improved. We know that price transparency encourages price comparisons by patients for outpatient care like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outpatient surgery. Doctors and hospitals would certainly post prices and qualifications once they are competing for price-conscious patients empowered with control of the money. <br> Third, introduce the right incentives into the tax code and eliminate the harmful, counterproductive incentives of<i> </b>the current tax code. Today’s unlimited income exclusion from taxes for employer-provided health benefits encouraged higher demand for care, regardless of cost, while distorting insurance into covering almost all services. Likewise, artificially propping up high insurance premiums for bloated coverage that minimizes out-of-pocket payment via subsidies or tax credits prevents patients from caring about price. This reduces incentives for doctors to compete on price. Any new tax reform should cap health care deductions and limit eligibility to catastrophic premiums and HSA contributions to incentivize patients to consider prices.<i></b> 
 Fixing our broken tax code is a foundational step to building a healthy economy, creating more jobs and ensuring more take home pay for hardworking Americans. <br> To that end, Congressional Republicans are working to reform our tax code – which today includes more than 70,000 pages of laws and regulations – to make it fairer and simpler. We recently released our tax reform framework, which will be an outline for Congress in the months ahead and can be viewed<a href="https://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/Tax%20Framework.pdf" target="_blank">here.&nbsp; <br> As for the myths, folks like to hastily equate our tax reform effort in Washington to the 2012 Kansas tax cut package. I’ve seen several headlines with variations of equation - which is either lazy analysis, or analysis based on assumptions that lack substance. The only real similarity is that they are both called “tax reform.” <br> As for our federal tax framework, Congress wants to lower rates for ALL taxpayers: individual, corporate, and pass-through. As the top corporate rate drops from 35 percent to 20 percent, the pass-through rate drops similarly from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. Kansas went to a zero rate, not 25 percent. <br> Let me say this again: we are not zeroing out the pass-through rate as Kansas did. Instead, American businesses, both small and large, will be paying a tax rate firmly in line with our other global competitors, rather than one of the highest of any first-world country. Further, the pass-through rate and the corporate rate will remain relatively similar to each other, meaning there is little incentive for businesses to reclassify for tax avoidance purposes. Business owners can instead just focus on creating jobs.&nbsp; <br> Finally, in addition to lowering rates, the federal tax reform plan calls for broadening the base. This is shorthand for closing tax loopholes. When tax loopholes are closed, more business and personal income is subject to taxation, so we are able to raise the similar revenue at lower tax rates. This allows us to cut tax rate for individuals and businesses without blowing a hole in the budget, since revenue neutral reform is our goal. 
 A month ago, liberals were celebrating a<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/09/05/sessions-trump-administration-to-end-daca-program/" target="_blank">sudden deal on “Dreamers”that President Trump made with congressional Democrats. Chuck Schumer, the senate minority leader, was downright giddy when a hot mic later<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/09/14/schumer-insists-hes-still-buds-with-trump/" target="_blank">caught him gloating that Trump “likes me.” <br> Now the wedding is off, the bromance kaput, and<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/10/08/trump-seeks-border-wall-in-exchange-for-dreamers-deal/" target="_blank">a new deal will have to be made. Blame it on the wall. 
 Will Senator Bob Corker torch tax reform? That is the speculation of the New York Times, the Washington Post and other liberal outlets. Pundits suggest that Trump’s recent Twitter battle with Corker might drive the offended Tennessee senator to vote against the White House’s proposed tax package. <br> That says a lot more about Bob Corker than it does about Donald Trump. <br> On the campaign trail in 2006, Corker promised to “ensure that government works with entrepreneurs and businesses, rather than against them. By reducing the burden of taxation, litigation, and regulation, American entrepreneurs will be better able to create exciting new businesses and good-paying jobs.” <br> Trump is not the first to fall short of Corker’s expectations. He spent the past decade blasting President Obama’s lack of leadership, eventually writing an op-ed for the Washington Post entitled “Obama is an Unreliable Ally.” In that 2014 piece Corker wrote about Obama’s wavering on Syria, Libya, our “tepid response to Russian aggression in Ukraine” and elsewhere, concluding, “This U.S. president, despite his bold pronouncements and moral posturing, cannot be counted on.” He took Obama to task for issuing “plenty of tough statements” about Russia, but failing to follow up. <br> In short, he echoed Trump’s disdain for Obama’s weak-kneed overseas engagements. But now he has shifted gears, alarmed by Trump’s bellicose warnings to North Korea and threats to topple the Iran nuclear accord. Those positions are surprising in light of his 2006 campaign statements that “Iran and North Korea pose exceptional dangers because of their possession of nuclear materials and our relations with these nations should be a top foreign policy priority. We must be firm in our insistence that Iran and North Korea renounce any nuclear weapons programs and we should stay focused on solving this problem in the near term.” <br> Meanwhile, the only progress made in hemming in North Korea has taken place recently, under President Trump. Helped by his assertion that all options are on the table, including military, the White House has bullied the world into jointly enacting, for the first time, serious sanctions. His missile strike on Syria, carried out while entertaining Chinese President Xi Jinping, unsettled the Chinese and drove them to take his bluster seriously. Key to any success, the Chinese finally appear to be pressuring their rogue neighbor. <br> We shall see. In the meantime, Corker’s dim view of Trump’s aggression towards our enemies and erratic management style should not deter him from voting in favor of much-needed tax reform. Proposals to lighten the tax burden on corporations and small businesses are an important step towards accelerating our growth and creating more jobs. <br> Given that there will be widely divergent estimates of how lower taxes will impact the economy and the budget deficit, Corker will have cover for however he votes. Democrats can be counted on to discount any additional growth to come from reduced taxes, which will drive up estimated revenue shortfalls. Others will forecast a more positive impact from simplifying and reducing taxes, and from encouraging corporations to invest more in the U.S. <br> Maybe that is why another poll showed 77 percent of Tennessee Republicans trust Trump, but only 40 percent have confidence in their senator. 
 Donald Trump’s war on Senate Republicans continues unabated. Sunday, Trump took to trashing Sen. Bob Corker on Twitter. In a series of dyspeptic tweets, the President blamed Corker for the Iran Deal, and berated the senator from Tennessee for announcing that he would not seek a third term. <br> Yes, Corker had earned Trump’s ire by complaining of the chaos that surrounds Trump, but Corker is not a club-of-one. Trump has lashed out at other senior Republican senators for saying far less. More ominously for Trump, his tantrums could even earn him a primary challenge, something no president wants. <br> To be sure, little good can come from these attacks by Trump on members of his own party. At a minimum, they will not help advance Trump’s legislative agenda. On the other hand, they could help make New York’s Chuck Schumer the next Senate Majority Leader, and kill any chance of a tax cut, not exactly desired outcomes for the GOP. <br> With Korea, the Iran Deal, and tax reform all hanging in the balance, a different approach would have been in order. As a matter of political self-preservation, the president should not treat Corker as he does North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Unlike “Little Rocket Man,” Corker is legally eligible to challenge Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. <br> Already, Corker has let everyone know that he, like Trump, is someone who won’t back down, and for the record, Corker gave as good as he got. Responding with a Tweet of his own, Corker intimated that Trump was addled, saying “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” <br> As Corker put it, “Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we’re dealing with here,” adding that “of course they understand the volatility that we’re dealing with and the tremendous amount of work that it takes by people around him to keep him in the middle of the road.” <br> And while Trump and Steve Bannon gloat over Corker’s refusal to run again, they would do well to remember that Breitbart’s own Joel B. Pollak, the website’s executive editor, has already threatened Trump with the prospect of a primary if he did not toe the line on immigration and populist orthodoxy. Pollak’s words, not mine. <br> If -- and it’s a big if -- Corker takes a flier on the White House, he would do well to remember Davy Crockett, another Tennessean who stood his ground back in the day, the day being 1834. Crockett, then a congressman, confronted President Andrew Jackson, another Tennessean and a Trump favorite, over the continued removal of the Cherokee Indians from their homes. 
 Tax-cutting fever is in the air again and many of Washington’s talking heads are citing the tax policy of Ronald Reagan but with many of them getting the Gipper wrong. Typical. For Reagan, it just wasn’t about the economy or jobs but about the more deeply important expression of the assignment of power. At one point in 1981, Reagan told a group of conservatives his belief that cutting taxes was really about reordering man’s relationship to the state. Reagan, the libertarian, Reagan, who embraced Federalism, saw Washington as an illicit power grabber and wanted to re-address the imbalance. He wanted to take power away from the corrupt government and give it back to the citizenry. <br> “The Era of Reagan” or “The Age of Reagan” sounds sweeping, epic, and generational. And it was. And it is. It sounds like a time similar to the Pax Augusta of Ancient Rome, spanning centuries of peace and prosperity. The Era of Reagan did not last three hundred years, but still it was impressive, world altering and many believe we are still living in the shadow of the 40th president. After all, who is more cited? Obama is gone and forgotten, as are the Bushes. Reagan never compared himself to other presidents but all succeeding presidents have compared themselves to him. <br> One of this plethora of ways America prospered under the Gipper was through massive tax cuts and the economy. Reagan was not a late comer to tax cuts, having returned to California’s taxpayers the largest rebate in years, $500 million, in 1970. But the GOP was pretty much the green eyeshade party in those days. Even more ironic, during Nixon’s first term, Senators Walter Mondale and Ted Kennedy proposed huge cuts in personal taxes as a means of jumpstarting the economy, but the Nixon Administration objected, advocating instead massive federal spending as a means restarting the languishing economy. <br> But supply-side economics was something else, and it was Dr. Arthur Laffer, Jude Wanniski of the Wall Street Journal, and conservative activist Jeff Bell who first introduced the radical (and hugely successful) economic theory to Governor Reagan (though they later flirted with the possible 1980 candidacy of Jack Kemp), who first talked it up in September of 1976 in a radio address. <br> Reagan defeated Carter in November of 1980 in one of the biggest landslides in presidential history. His philosophy of individualism, smaller federal government, and American optimism reverberated with a Carter “malaise” pessimistic public. Famed journalist Hedrick Smith of the New York Times said only four months after Reagan took office that he “has managed to tap and nurture a budding mood of national self-confidence even before his major policies have had enough time to achieve real practical impact or to be properly tested.” <br> Both his ’81 and ’86 Tax Acts made it fairer for the American worker, closing loopholes and simplifying the tax bracket. The Economic Recovery and Tax Act of 1981, called Kemp-Roth, reduced income tax rates by 25 percent, and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 significantly lowered tax rates. On the economy, the effects in only eight years were significant from the recession during Carter’s run. By 1988, the GDP went from a negative growth to an astonishing 4.1 percent. Annually, the average GDP during the Reagan years was 3.5 percent. Inflation dropped by nearly 10 percent. “It was the equivalent of adding the West German economy to the U.S. one,” wrote Kyle Smith in Forbes in 2014. Burton Yale Pines at the Heritage Foundation, in the spring of 1988, had a much more poignant and contemporary opinion, writing that “we have had the longest period of economic growth in peacetime in American history-probably world history. A record number of new American businesses have been created; a record number of new jobs have been created (and, in fact, experts now worry about a labor shortage in America); we are producing more new products and new ideas and are doing so more efficiently than at any time in our history.” <br> The economy spiked so much, that there was a net increase of about 21 million more jobs in eight years. Labor participation went from 63.9 percent in January 1981 to a whopping 66.5 percent in January 1989. The median income of a family grew by $4,000, from $37,868 in 1981 to $42,049 in 1989. By comparison, it did not grow at all during Carter’s administration, and income actually shrunk during Bush 41’s years. 
 Just a week ago President Trump released his proposal to reduce tax rates on corporations and individuals, and already the administration and its critics are talking past each other. The White House says its overall goal is to accelerate economic growth, while detractors reply that the tax plan will benefit the wealthy. But since when is tax relief for high earners and private sector job-creators at cross-purposes with a faster-growing economy? <br> In 1961 a reporter asked President Kennedy why he supported a tax cut. “To stimulate the economy,” Kennedy replied. “Don’t you remember your Economics 101?” The economy Kennedy inherited from President Eisenhower was still expanding but the pace slowed in the second half of the 1950s. There had been three recessions during Eisenhower’s two terms, and the last one was still in progress when Kennedy took office. 
 In school, I liked math the least and history the most. Both can be useful in the coming debate over President Trump’s proposed tax reforms. <br> The one thing I learned in math class is that if the formula is wrong, the answer will be wrong. In history class I learned we are not the first people to occupy the planet and that the experiences of those who came before us can be helpful when considering contemporary issues. <br> There is another formula which, when tried, has succeeded. It worked for John F. Kennedy, who cut taxes; ditto for Ronald Reagan (yes, he also raised taxes but by then economic growth was such that they did not have a negative effect). <br> In Robert Sobel’s biography, “Coolidge: An American Enigma,” these quotes from the 30th president are highlighted: “I am convinced that the larger incomes of the country would actually yield more revenue to the government if the basis of taxation were scientifically revised downward.” <br> That was Reagan’s belief long before “supply-side economics” acquired its name. <br> About public debt, which has just passed $20 trillion and would have appalled him, Coolidge said: “Public debt (is) a burden on all the people.” Coolidge left office with a surplus. <br> President Trump should start reading the indecipherable tax code aloud at public events and say, “This is what your Congress has done to you.” He should bring people on stage to tell their stories of how high taxes have harmed, even ruined, their businesses. These should include people who have lost family farms handed down through generations because of the estate, or “death tax,” which forced them to sell the land in order to pay the government. 
 With the November 2020 Presidential election over three years away, it may seem strange to be discussing the prospects for President Trump to be re-elected. <br> Yet, even at this early stage, some things are clear if he is around and runs again. His biggest problems are his inability, despite majorities in the House and Senate, to pass any major legislation. He has not built the famous wall, torpedoed ObamaCare or done tax reform. He has repeatedly battled senior members of the Republican Party (Mitch McConnell and John McCain), tweeted frequently at three in the morning and even spoken about consequences for those who fail to salute the American flag at NFL games. <br> President Trump has already started campaigning for 2018 congressional elections and the 2020 presidential and congressional elections. He has visited so many red states so many times (like Mississippi, Alabama, Iowa, Indiana and West Virginia) that Real Clear Politics calls him the President of the Red States. <br> President Trump has a reasonable chance of being reelected. Historically, 70 percent, or twelve of seventeen 20th century incumbent presidents seeking a second term have won re-election. Fully six of seven Democratic presidents and six of ten Republican presidents have been re-elected. <br> The likely Democratic candidate, as reflected in the 21 people most frequently mentioned as possible nominees, have their own problems. Overwhelmingly the great majority are either lawyers (12) or billionaire business entrepreneurs (5), people whose wealth and working places are far removed from those of the average American. This is reinforced in the fact that almost half of them (9 of 21) graduated from Ivy League schools, which account for only 1 ercent of college or professional graduates. The early leaders are white and wealthy which puts them far away from the large middle and working-class elements and the powerful Democratic base in the African American, Latino and Asian American identity groups. <br> Also, they are overwhelmingly from the West or East Coast, areas that any Democratic candidate is likely to carry. Only a handful come from the middle of the country’s red states and working class/middle class elements that Trump carried so well in 2016. 
 The press corps is busy quizzing the president, the speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader on their plans for tax reform. The question is why they aren’t chasing after the three people who actually hold all the power. <br> If the past eight months have proved anything, it is that all the 24/7 news coverage of Donald Trump’s antics, all the millions of words devoted to Paul Ryan’s and Mitch McConnell’s plans, have been a complete waste of space and time. In the end, control of the entire policy agenda in Washington comes down to three senators. Three senators whom most Americans have never had a chance to vote for or against. Three senators who comprise 8% of their party conference. Arizona’s John McCain, Maine’s Susan Collins and Kentucky’s Rand Paul. Forget Caesar, Crassus and Pompey. Meet the Never-Trump Triumvirate. 
 With the failure of Republicans to address health care, the GOP Congress hasn’t landed a single major legislature acccomplishment on President Trump’s desk yet. No wonder Trump was in Indiana Wednesday launching his effort to reform the tax code by reducing tax rates and inhibitors to job creation. <br> There is no doubt that the notion of tax reform is popular with the American public. A recent poll found 68 percent of Americans agree our tax laws should have a major overhaul. That number included 77 percent of Repubilicans, 70 percent of Independents and 62 percent of Democrats. <br> The Trump tax plan would dramatically simplify the tax code by cutting the number of rates from seven to three - ranging from 12 percent to 35 percent - and getting rid of deductions such as those for state and local taxes. The standard deduction for couples would be doubled to $24,000 a year, making it possible for many Americans to have no tax liability at all. <br> Companies would be allowed to immediately write off investment expenses, though only for five years. That is of advantage to existing businesses, but much less so to new firms struggling to get started. Look for Congress to be under pressure to make expensing permanent. 
 The GOP tax plan is, to quote Joe Biden, a “big f***ing deal.” For Republicans, it is a chance at redemption, having failed miserably to follow through on their number one campaign promise: repealing and replacing ObamaCare. For Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, it is an opportunity to demonstrate the leadership that was lacking in the health care battle. For President Trump, passing comprehensive tax reform would show supporters that he can navigate the swamp, and that their votes meant something. For the country, the proposed changes rolled out Wednesday could be a major shot of B-12, energizing investment and spending. <br> Most important to that end is the suggested 20 percent tax rate for corporations, down from 35 percent, the resolution of our one-off treatment of overseas-earned income and lower taxes for so-called “pass-through” entities. The latter include many millions of small businesses whose owners have historically filed as individuals and paid a top rate of 39.6 percent; under the plan, their rate declines to 25 percent. Since small firms (defined as having fewer than 500 employees) account for well over half of job growth, providing tax relief for that sector will boost hiring and investment. <br> Those measures are welcome. Donald Trump was elected because millions of working people were discouraged by our nation’s sluggish growth and miserly income gains. During the Obama years the economic cylinder that failed to spark was business investment. The torrent of regulations, White House hostility to the business community, anxieties left over from the financial crisis and excessively high taxes combined to staunch spending, resulting in below-par growth and reduced productivity. That under-investment hampered wage increases, and makes this effort at tax reform critical. <br> On the individual side, the news is mixed. The plan calls for a modest hike in the lowest tax bracket (from 10 percent to 12 percent), but claims that, Typical families in the existing 10 percent bracket are expected to be better off under the framework due to the larger standard deduction, larger child tax credit and additional tax relief that will be included during the committee process.” Elsewhere, rates are lowered, and the near-doubling of the standard deduction will help most Americans. <br> In addition, getting rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax will be celebrated by those caught in its ever-expanding and unintended web. As Mercatus Center fellow Veronique de Rugy once wrote, “The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was created in 1969 to prevent 155 wealthy taxpayers from using deductions and credits to avoid paying any federal income taxes.” Last year it ensnared over four million taxpayers. <br> Rather than provide tax relief to people with high incomes, the Group of Six legislators and White House participants who crafted the plan decided to ditch the inheritance tax. Prepare to hear howls from Democrats, who will charge that the program is a big give-away to the rich. In fact, they are right; only people who die with an estate valued at more than $5.49 million will owe any inheritance tax. Taxing income rather than wealth, in my view, is a questionable priority but doing away with the inheritance tax has long been a priority for the GOP, and rightly so. <br> Much of the details of the plan will be hammered out in committee. There, legislators will have to stare down the harsh glare of Nancy Pelosi et al, and endure the inevitable demagoguery from the liberal media. They will have to show some fortitude, and some cohesion, which they failed to do in the health care battle. 
 As President Trump travels to Indiana this week, stumping to reduce a corporate tax rate that is the highest in the world and a full 10 points higher than the global average, predictable critics on the far left have dusted off the tired “corporate welfare” refrain. The class warfare page in the their playbook is getting a little dog-eared, and it’s holding our economy and our workers back. It’s past time for Congress to put aside rhetoric and partisan bickering and work together to strengthen America’s ability to compete globally. <br> It’s true that taxes are necessary to fund the services we expect from government. But excessive taxation kills innovation, economic growth, and job creation while holding back wages. <br> As the author of Indiana’s corporate tax reforms, I can tell you with confidence that the Hoosier state’s experience stands as an instructive example as we enter the national debate. During the depth of the Great Recession, legislative leaders in Indiana engaged in a thoughtful, bi-partisan dialogue about ways to strengthen our economy, encourage job creation and attract investment. We recognized that Indiana’s comparatively high corporate tax rate hurt efforts to attract new business growth, and, to make matters worse, much of our corporate tax burden was being shouldered by thousands of small and mid-sized Hoosier businesses that lacked the legions of accountants and lawyers to shelter income and lower effective rates like the big names of the Fortune 100. <br> While Indiana lowered business taxes by nearly 50 percent, our neighbors in Illinois increased them. The predictable result – as of 2017 more than 50 companies have relocated operations from Illinois to Indiana, bringing jobs and enhancing our state tax revenue so that we can invest in improving our roads, schools and other priorities. Indiana’s unemployment rate remains among the lowest in the Midwest, below the national average, and a dramatic 1.5 percent lower than Illinois. Hoosiers’ personal income growth is strong, our budget is balanced, our credit is rated AAA, and we have a rainy-day fund reserve that approaches $2 billion. It’s a formula that the nation could and should emulate. <br> As Indiana lowered rates, we have also reduced or eliminated many tax incentives, allowing our low flat rates to be our strongest selling point. Recently, our tax incentive review process was recognized by the Pew Foundation as one of the best in the nation. For our colleagues at the federal level, Indiana’s experience suggests cleaning up the code, eliminating excessive breaks and loopholes, and using the savings to dramatically lower rates is a winning formula. 
 As we prepare to roll out our unified framework for tax reform this week, I decided to push my principles forward in hopes to start building momentum to get this much needed reform on its way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. <br> I get that most Americans are frustrated with Congress and its lack of progress on reforming our tax code. Politics and posturing continue to complicate what should be simple process and in an effort to combat those Washington roadblocks, I’ve been taking additional steps to push Congress into action on this critical issue. <br> The last meaningful reform of the tax code was in 1986 under President Ronald Reagan -- 31 years ago. In its current version, our tax code is nearly 2.4 million words in length. Not only does this make it incredibly complicated, but also very time consuming and expensive to comply with. Americans spend an estimated $409 billion dollars and 8.9 billion hours each year to file their taxes in compliance with the law. By any measure, that’s ridiculous. Hard working Americans need to be able to keep more of that time and money and spend less of it determining how to hand it over to the IRS.&nbsp; <br> Below are the ten core principles I believe are essential to bring our tax code into the 21st century: <br> 1. Make taxes simple, fair, and easy to understand <br> 3. Create cuts that touch all individuals and leverage higher rates of economic stimulus <br> 5. Make America the best place in the world to hire, invest, and grow <br> 7. Retool the tax code to give American workers a level playing field with their foreign competitors <br> 9. Encourage following regular order to ensure the greatest likelihood of success 
 Tax reform is the one legislative victory Republicans must have if they are to hold the House and pick up five to seven Senate seats in November 2018. And tax reform is also the one legislative victory that looks increasingly likely. <br> Tax reform is a must-win for two reasons. First, to kick-start strong economic growth and job creation. Second, to demonstrate that President Trump and the Republicans in Congress can get things done. <br> The Democratic failures include higher taxes on everyone, (including eight ObamaCare taxes directly on the middle class), an explosion of regulatory costs, a new unending entitlement and lousy job numbers. <br> Even coming out of a deep recession, the Obama administration averaged growth of only 2 percent a year.President Reagan battled recession and inflation and managed 4 percent growth, creating 4 million jobs in the first year of his recovery. <br> Donald Trump was elected president because he promised jobs, jobs, jobs.He and the GOP Congress know they have to deliver in such a way that even MSNBC will have to note from time to time that in the first six months of 2018 the economy is in fact demonstrably stronger. <br> Long depreciation schedules will be replaced by full and immediate business expensing – at least for a few years. And history suggests that any such pro-growth measure will be extended again and again (just as the research and development tax credit was) and eventually be made permanent. <br> The biggest winners of tax reform will be the millions of Americans who enter or return to the job market when we unleash America's business investment through lower taxes, expensing and repatriation. <br> Finally, passing tax reform without a single Democratic vote will remind Americans that there are two teams in Washington. One works for government and the other works for them. Democrats refer to tax hikes as income. Republicans know taxes area cost imposed on American families.Pick your team. 
 No matter how persuasive President Trump is, it’s unlikely he can round up enough Democrats to get 60 votes in the Senate for tax reform. That means Republicans will need to use the Senate’s reconciliation process, which avoids the filibuster, to pass their plan with 51 votes. But first the House and Senate must pass a budget resolution—and soon. <br> A budget resolution sets spending levels and authorizes congressional committees to prepare bills fulfilling the blueprint. With the reconciliation plan in mind, this year’s resolution would set the size of the tax reform and then instruct the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to flesh out the provisions. 
 President Trump is not looking for bipartisanship; he’s looking for insurance. If your agenda hinged on support from the likes of John McCain, you’d want insurance too. <br> Trump’s reported DACA deal with Democrat leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi has unhinged conservatives, who were already alarmed by the president’s agreement with the same duo to raise the debt limit and provide relief to the victims of Hurricane Harvey. Gleeful media types have characterized these overtures as Trump “pivoting” to Democrats; they are playing it for all that it is worth. The New York Times ran a recent front-page story titled “Agenda Increasingly Set by Democrats.” The Washington Post weighed in with: “A new strategy’for Trump? Democrats cautious but encouraged by fresh outreach.” What could be more incendiary to Trump voters? What could be more delicious to the president’s enemies? <br> That was the upshot of recent polling done for Democrat operatives trying to devise a strategy for the 2018 Congressional elections. As reported by Politico, strategists on the left are shocked that people are “still impressed with Trump’s business background and tend to give him credit for the improving economy.” Voters also like the fact that he’s shaking things up, and are “inclined to give him a chance to succeed.” In other words, Trump’s low overall approval ratings do not tell the whole story. And, Democrats’ full-on “resistance” is helping their cause not at all. <br> Trump’s opponents finally see an opening, pouncing on the president’s recent bargain-hunting with Democrats to paint Trump as caving on campaign promises. They figure his base will not tolerate his maneuvering with “Chuck and Nancy,” two figures detested on the right. And, there certainly has been some outrage among conservatives as he negotiates on controversial matters like resolving DACA’s future. But, as confirmed by Politico, people see Mr. Trump as a deal-maker, someone who wants to get things done. They also see members of his own party obstructing his agenda. The GOP’s failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and the perfidy of John McCain, provided a teaching moment for the president and for the country. <br> That Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was blindsided by his long-time colleague McCain reveals not only the depths of the Arizona senator’s disloyalty but also his personal animus towards Donald Trump. He’s not alone. Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse are only some of the Republicans in the Senate who have opposed Trump on one issue or another. Can Trump rely solely on McCain and his colleagues going forward? Would you? <br> On DACA, the president is similarly taking a realistic approach. Fully 73 percent of the nation, and 68 percent of Trump voters, favor allowing the so-called “Dreamers” to stay in the country. Republicans in Congress would likely work towards codifying the DACA program, in exchange for beefed-up border security. But, there is a worse scenario in which the dysfunctional fissures in the House blocks any attempt at resolving the issue, and the GOP again is embarrassed. If the president can exact from Democrats significant measures to strengthen our borders, is that not a reasonable outcome? 
 President Trump has called getting tax reform signed into law a “once in a generation opportunity” and he’s exactly right. That’s why the White House and Congressional Republicans must keep their eyes on the prize in the critical days and weeks ahead. After a tough seven months of working hard to reform our broken health care system before it collapses only to come up one vote short, leaders on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue are frustrated and rightly so. They’re frustrated that they haven’t done an adequate job corroborating on policy implementation or combating Democrat obstruction and a hyper-politicized mainstream media. But with every challenge in politics comes opportunity. President Trump, Senator McConnell, and Speaker Ryan need to make the most of this opportunity by plotting a successful strategy and then executing on it. <br> The mainstream media is driving the narrative that the Trump-McConnell-Ryan relationship is too far gone to right the ship. This is a false narrative that can be demonstrably proven wrong by working together and communicating to achieve a goal. I believe the media’s deceptive narrative will ultimately be debunked because Republicans are aware that they made promises, were put in charge to enact those promises, and have a responsibility to keep the promises. The American people are starving for something good to come out of Washington. The stakes are high and it’s time to deliver. I’m optimistic that Republicans will make it happen. <br> Now that we’re past the debt ceiling and government funding issue (for the time being), President Trump and Vice President Pence need to convince House and Senate Republicans to put aside their differences and come together for the greater good, that is, their fellow countrymen. First a budget, and then robust tax reform, must be debated, passed, and signed into law now so it can take effect immediately. It simply has to happen this year. Republicans must be able to tell voters that tax reform is the law of the land when they start to campaign next fall. <br> Next year at this time members of Congress will go home and face the fire. Voters in their states and districts will be asking why Republicans should be re-elected and remain in charge of Washington. It’s imperative for Republican leaders to come up with the answer to that question now and a big part of the answer must be tax reform. 
 What just happened? President Trump cut a deal with Democrats to pay for hurricane damage relief and raise the debt ceiling without getting anything in return, except the temporary avoidance of a government shutdown. How to describe this? Was it a sellout, or a pragmatic act? <br> It’s football season again, so let’s call this deal the “option play.” It isn’t used much by today’s professional players, but the play is designed to give a quarterback the option of running the ball, or, if he sees he can’t make it through the defensive line, toss it to a player trailing behind him in an effort to gain yards. <br> President Trump might consider these options in an effort to push through his agenda. <br> The second option might be to embarrass Republicans sufficiently to force them to unify and pass a true Republican agenda. That used to include lower taxes, smaller government and reducing the debt through less spending and economic growth. I’m not betting on this option. <br> There’s also an option the Republican majority hasn’t tried. Rush Limbaugh mentioned it on his radio program: “If just at any time in the past six months, or any time in the next six, if for just three months Ryan and McConnell would work with Trump to advance his agenda, they would own everything for who knows how long. If they would have repealed and replaced ObamaCare, if they would have then moved on to tax cuts and … real tax reform, and if they had built the wall. … If those three things had serious action with an appearance of unity within the Republican Party on those issues, the Democrats wouldn’t stand a prayer for 25 years.” <br> Trump’s deal with Democrats excluded the children of “undocumented” immigrants. Perhaps the president could allow DACA kids to remain in the country in exchange for money to build the wall. But why should Democrats compromise when they get what they want anyway? <br> The deal Trump made with Democrats expires in 90 days. Will Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi use an option they have successfully employed in the past to win more concessions from the president? It’s called the Christmas option and it is designed to smear Republicans as “heartless” politicians who would harm children by not giving in to Democrats’ demands. 
 Raising the debt ceiling brings out the worst in Republicans. It sets the stage for endless posturing, with GOP legislators railing about budget deficits as they confront the inevitable outcome of the spending bills they themselves have passed. I don’t mean to jump on the GOP, but let’s face it: Democrats don’t even pretend to care about our national debt. <br> This time round, Republicans in Congress are just livid that Donald Trump has done a deal with Democrats to quickly raise the debt limit, even though they have only themselves to blame. Conservatives in the House, especially, have been a pain in Trump’s backside for months. <br> The GOP leadership had to pander to Rand Paul, Mark Meadows et al as they tried to repeal and replace ObamaCare, hardening the proposed legislation to the point that it drove away critical moderate votes in the Senate. <br> As a result, the country watched Republicans engage in one of the most embarrassing legislative defeats in history, prompting many to question whether the party had the chops to govern. <br> To remind: the only way this country can possibly pay for its ever-expanding entitlements programs, which none in Congress has the guts to challenge, is by speeding up our economic growth. And, the most obvious way to do that is through tax cuts. <br> The Freedom Caucus didn’t care; it was their way or the highway. Now, they are working to present their own tax bill, which from every indication will be as impractical and useless as their insistence on abolishing all government-sponsored healthcare insurance. But at least they will be able to pretend to their backers that they tried their best. <br> The hypocrisy is stunning. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, a member of the right-wing Republican Study Committee, objected to a “clean” hike of the debt ceiling, suggesting he wanted to tie any increase to reduced Medicaid spending. Where was he when Republicans were trying to push through their health care bill? You know, the bill that would have resulted in substantial cuts to Medicaid -- the bill that been described as “the most significant welfare reform in decades?” He was nowhere to be found. <br> Americans who elected Donald Trump are frustrated with Republicans in Congress. The president came to the White House dependent on the GOP majorities in the House and Senate, which he helped create, to enact his widely popular agenda. <br> Most Republicans want simpler, fairer taxes, and lower rates for job-creating small and large businesses. <br> Most Republicans want our country’s embarrassing infrastructure fixed and better public schools. <br> Those objectives will not move forward unless the conservatives in the House resign themselves to this: they will never be in charge. Ted Cruz will not be elected president, nor will Mark Meadows. Their views are not broadly popular so they will never win a national election. Their job, an important one to be sure, is to advise and consent – to guide this president, to raise issues of importance, but to allow for progress at the same time. <br> Conservatives across the country need to tell their legislators that they back the Trump agenda and want progress. Tell them it’s time for them to do their job, and do what’s right for the country. 
 <b>Editor's note:The following column originally appeared in The Resurgent.</i> <br> Let’s be honest here. The Republicans in Congress were always going to find some deal with the Democrats. They were always going to find a way to surrender ultimately. What president Trump did was just short circuit the process and shorten the length of time we will suffer through failure theater where the Republicans in Congress and the Wall Street Journal editorial page try to convince us a rotten sandwich is tasty. <br> But there is a problem. By giving the Democrats a three month extension, the president has essentially compressed the legislative calendar. The GOP will now have to do tax reform, immigration, spending, and debt ceiling all at one time. This exponentially increases the odds of a terrible deal. <br> Using the newly compressed legislative calendar as an excuse, they will undoubtedly cut several bad deals with Democrats and lump them all together in a couple of pieces of legislation. Remember, there are two parties in Washington, the stupid party and the evil party. Occasionally they get together and do something that is both stupid and evil and the press heralds it as a bipartisan accomplishment. <br> We are on the road to stupid and evil more expeditiously because of what President Trump just did. Let’s be honest here. The Republicans in Congress were always going to find some deal with the Democrats. They were always going to find a way to surrender ultimately. What President Trump did was just short circuit the process and shorten the length of time we will suffer through failure theater where the Republicans in Congress and the Wall Street Journal editorial page try to convince us a sour sandwich is tasty. <br> But there is a problem.

The GOP will now have to do tax reform, immigration, spending, and debt ceiling all at one time. This exponentially increases the odds of a terrible deal. 
 BUDAPEST </span>Congress has returned to Washington after another unearned vacation and faces at least two immediate challenges, in addition to the familiar ritual of raising the debt ceiling. <br> President Trump has called the indecipherable U.S. tax code “self-destructive.” He has also decided to end the Obama-era program that allows “undocumented” immigrants who came to America as children to gain work permits. Congress would be given six months to replace it. <br> On Jan. 1, 2017, the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban lowered the corporate tax rate from 19 percent to 9 percent, the lowest rate among the 28 member states of the European Union. By comparison, the United States’ top marginal tax rate is 38.92 percent, just behind Puerto Rico and the United Arab Emirates. <br> In the last seven years, Kovacs says, 700,000 new jobs have been created in Hungary, only 150,000 of which are government jobs. The government jobs are mostly for people who had relied in the past on social welfare programs. Even here, he says, they know the meaning of the word “workfare.” The unemployment rate in Hungary is 4.5 percent, according to Kovacs, down from 11.4 percent in 2010 when the current government took power. Economic growth ranges between 3.5 percent and 4 percent, he says. <br> While American debt keeps rising, Hungary’s debt is falling. In 2010 it was 85 percent of GDP. Today it is 74 percent. True, Hungary has a high value added tax of 27 percent, but Kovacs says that is “temporary” (is there any such thing as a temporary tax?) and the government’s goal is to reduce it as revenue continues to increase. <br> The charges for this policy are familiar to Americans: “We are racists, we hate those people who come in,” when in fact, Kovacs says, it is about maintaining Hungary’s culture and way of life. <br> “We do not underestimate that element,” he responds. “Islam is mostly fundamentalist. Europe is mostly secular, but even for those who don’t believe in God, or go to church. The very culture of Europe is Christianity.” 
 It happens like clockwork in Washington.Every year or two when we approach the federal debt limit, countdown clocks start, doomsday scenarios are assumed, and backroom negotiations begin in earnest to prevent our country from defaulting on our obligations. <br> The prevailing theme of debt ceiling negotiations is usually avoiding default. Lost in the conversation is how we got here in the first place, and how we can get out of the cycle of deficit spending. <br> But the original intent of debt ceiling votes was to discourage or prevent our nation from getting into more debt. At this point, the debt limit conversation has created so many headaches that some have advocated a total repeal of it. <br> As the debt ceiling is currently constructed, it is nothing more than an arbitrary political tool that tends to produce more crisis theater than reform. Budget experts on the left and right have increasingly come to the conclusion that the debt limit no longer prevents, curbs, or restrains debt. <br> However, instead of repealing and eliminating the debt limit authority, Congress should reform it to make it a legitimate legislative mechanism to fix our nation’s massive debt problems. <br> For example, the debt limit could increase every two years with a signature from the president if the deficit has been reduced to a preset target. However, if the deficit has not reduced to the preset target in the past two years, Congress would be required to debate the issue and raise the debt limit through regular order. <br> This forward-looking date-certain debt limit reform would provide a transparent avenue to course-correct when the preset targets are missed. It would also provide an incentive for Congress to decrease the deficit and predictability for world markets when our deficits decrease. 
 In May 2014, a broad collection of thinkers and politicians gathered in Washington to celebrate a new conservative “manifesto.” The document called for replacing stodgy old Reaganite economics with warmer, fuzzier handouts to the middle class. Donald Trump must have missed the memo. <br> The president formally opened the tax wars on Wednesday with his speech in Missouri challenging Congress to meet his principles for reform. The media almost uniformly applied to the speech its favorite (though misused) descriptor: “populist.” But the real news was that Mr. Trump wants to make Reagan-style tax reform great again. 
 Republicans in Congress are at a make or break moment and everyone knows it. Moments like these don’t come around very often in politics. President Donald Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell all agree that the time has come to seize on real and lasting tax reform, which will lead to job creation and fuel our economic engine for future generations. Republicans, as well as any Trump-state Democrats seeking to help hardworking American taxpayers with this pro-growth legislation, need to come together. We must get a robust tax reform bill signed into law this year. <br> The American people know that Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress, and looking at the first six months of the 115th Congress have little to show for it. If Congress doesn’t act, it will appear that the campaign rhetoric was just that – all talk. We have a President of the United States asking Congress to send a tax reform package to his desk. Year after year during the Obama Administration, Republican leaders in Congress said “just wait until we have a Republican president. Then things will be different.” McConnell and Ryan must produce a historic tax reform package that members of their respective caucuses can get behind. Inaction on tax reform could very well mean minority status in 2019. Make no mistake about it; the American people expect action. It’s true that Democrats are being obstructionists, but folks around the country want Republicans to get the job done and keep their promise. <br> The American people believe all Republicans are in agreement that tax reform is critical. That’s why American families and job creators want to know when it’s going to happen and so does President Trump. Republicans on Capitol Hill from across the political spectrum, from the most moderate to the most conservative, all acknowledge that tax reform and tax relief were key campaign promises in 2016 that helped catapult them to victory and majority status in both chambers of Congress. <br> Republicans also agree on the importance of tax reform and tax cuts when it comes to growing the economy. President Trump’s uplifting economic message paved the way for his victories in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Upon taking office, the President’s economic optimism and executive orders on deregulation have caused the Dow Jones industrial average to skyrocket to historic highs, paved the way to one million new jobs created in six months and 2.6 percent growth in the second quarter, and made the unemployment rate shrink to its lowest level since 2001. But job creators in businesses large and small are expecting tax reform from Congress in 2017 so they can plan for the future.&nbsp; 
 The Constitution authorizes Congress to tax Americans to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare. But in Washington, the professional political class has hijacked that authority to rig up a tax code that provides for the well-being of Washington, not the country. <br> This week President Trump is coming to Missouri to explain how he intends to change that. His visit is welcome news, and Missourians should welcome him with enthusiasm to our state. The President understands that when it comes to taxing American workers, things cannot go on as they are now. <br> It’s no mystery how that happened. The people in Washington are getting rich with our money. Under President Barack Obama, the federal government swelled to record size, and it took more and more of our money to pay for it. Who benefitted? Not Missouri farmers or workers. While DC prospers, they are suffering through the weakest economic recovery in decades. <br> Step one is to make the tax code simpler. Today’s code and its regulations are a four million-word mess of special interest exemptions and corporate giveaways. This complexity fuels crony capitalism and grows the power of lobbyists, while burdening American workers. <br> President Trump has urged Congress to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, to increase the standard deduction, and to eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax that kills jobs and forces many small businesspeople into paying higher taxes. These are important proposals. A simpler system with a higher standard deduction would allow working Missourians to pay less, and to spend less time trying to figure out the tax code. Last year, Americans who filled out the standard Form 1040 spent an average of 16 hours and $270 of their money just for the privilege of paying their taxes. That’s ridiculous. It’s offensive. And it’s time to change it. <br> The president has also proposed lowering the tax rate on job-creating businesses. Today our rate is higher than any other industrialized economy, and it’s encouraging businesses to move jobs overseas. American workers and American entrepreneurs can compete with anybody, anywhere if our government will stop making America a cost-prohibitive place to do business. 
 Republicans in Congress return from vacation next week under attack from all sides. They need to put some wins on the boards, and show the country they can govern. They need to pass tax reform. <br> President Trump is blasting the GOP leadership for having failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and for ignoring his advice to tie the debt ceiling increase to the noncontroversial Veterans Affairs’ Choice Program extension. <br> Maybe more worrisome is the cautionary note sounded on Larry Kudlow’s radio show by Noelle Nikpour, a Republican strategist. In reaching out recently to favorite long-time bundlers, she has run into a brick wall. Some ask, “What have Republicans done for me lately?” <br> It’s understandable. Voters were promised that if they delivered the Senate, the House and the White House to the GOP, the country would break through the stifling gridlock of the past several years and begin to rebuild our infrastructure, cut through the regulatory thicket, renew entrepreneurship, and overhaul our failing health care system. To date, all the country has to show for putting Republicans in charge is Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. That’s not nothing, as they say, but it’s not enough. <br> Bottom line: for the Republican Party, and for the country, we need progress. We need to raise the debt ceiling, approve a budget and then pass a wide-ranging tax reform package that lowers rates for individuals and businesses and resolves some of our tax code’s most troublesome features, such as how we treat corporate profits earned overseas. The current approach, which is to tax repatriated income, is unique among developed countries and self-defeating. It encourages companies to pile up profits overseas, forcing them to borrow against those holdings in order to pay dividends, for instance, and makes it easier to invest abroad than at home. That must end. <br> There should be no such schism in advocating tax reform. There will be, for sure, plenty of haggling over which deductions bite the dust in order to allow tax rates overall to come down. Because Democrats will not work with the GOP to simplify and lower taxes, preferring to use any tax overhaul to redistribute the country’s wealth instead of build it up, Republicans will need to pass tax changes via budget reconciliation, which requires that the effort be revenue neutral over an agreed-upon time frame. <br> The message is clear, though. Republicans in Congress cannot let perfect be the enemy of good, as they did in the fight over repealing ObamaCare. Reforming our system so that it rewards workers and job creators is good for everybody. Rival CEOs David Abney and Fred Smith, of UPS and FexEx, respectively, recently teamed to write an op-ed pushing for measures that might boost growth, including tax reform. They write, “Studies show that permanently lowering the corporate rate by even 10 percentage points would increase GDP by 1% to 2% without lowering tax revenue.” That is a powerful selling point. 
 The liberal media is unhappy that President Trump is going to hold a rally Tuesday night in Phoenix, Arizona. Of course they are. Every time Mr. Trump ventures out to speak to the country, he reminds people why they voted for him. His message of rejuvenation and promise to “Drain the Swamp!” still resonate, bigly. <br> Some have criticized the planned gathering as insensitive, coming so soon after the dreadful murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville. They are worried that Mr. Trump might reignite racial tensions, or do something provocative, like pardon Joe Arpaio, the controversial Arizona sheriff recently convicted of contempt. <br> Trump should follow up his speech Monday night about sending more troops to Afghanistan – a speech in which he asked the country to promise our soldiers that when they return “they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one” – by committing to our soldiers coming home to find a booming economy and plentiful job openings as well. <br> This is not, however, a slam-dunk. <br> Let’s start with the inevitable Democrat resistance. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered to work with Republicans on tax reform as long as no relief goes to the top one percent, and only if the tax plan does not increase the country’s deficit. <br> Also, Republicans are intent on repealing the estate tax, which would clearly benefit the wealthiest Americans, as would a reduction in the top capital gains rate to 20 percent from the current level of 23.8 percent. Schumer knows these are high priorities for the GOP. <br> Then there are all the folks who will lose out under the emerging reform plan. To make the numbers work, some big tax breaks will have to go. State and local tax deductions are currently on the chopping block, which will enrage blue state residents, as is the expensing of corporate investments, a negative for capital equipment producers. The Big Six, as the masterminds behind the reform plan are called, is also considering a cap on mortgage interest deductions, probably targeting high earners, which will set the nation’s huge real estate industry howling. <br> But here’s what tax reform has going for it: a committed White House that has participated in drafting the proposal (unlike the various health care plans) and that is willing to go on the road and sell it to voters. One of the enormous failings of the push to repeal ObamaCare was the lack of an energetic messaging effort. This time round, the Big Six, which includes Ways Means Chair Kevin Brady, Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, are united in the effort. <br> The group’s Corry Bliss added:“We will continue to urge Congress to put American families and job creators first, members who fail to do so will be held accountable. It’s past time for members of Congress to put politics aside and work together to deliver results that move our country forward.” 
 <b>Editor's note:</b>The following column originally appeared in<a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/347270-juan-williams-mcconnell-and-trump-headed-for-showdown" target="_blank">The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com. <br> Steve Bannon’s battles — death matches against national security advisor H.R. McMaster and top economic advisor Gary Cohn, among others — rocked the White House until Bannon tapped out Friday. <br> That ongoing fight has a few in the Republican majority on Capitol Hill privately raising the prospect of a formal censure of Trump over his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. <br> Even so, fear of the populist president is giving way to anger among Senate Republicans. First of all, they can’t explain the politics of Trump going after the Republican leader of the Senate. Why is the president opening the question of whether McConnell should resign? <br> Why is the president delighting in taking down Republican senators? In recent days, he has labeled Sen.<a href="http://thehill.com/people/jeff-flake" target="_blank">Jeff Flake(Ariz.) as “Flake Jeff Flake,” and derided Sen.<a href="http://thehill.com/people/lindsey-graham" target="_blank">Lindsey Graham(S.C.) as a “publicity seeking liar. <br> Trump will need votes from these senators to get anything done in Congress. Even now, almost none of them are willing to go on television to defend the president. <br> At the moment, McConnell sees more advantage in not fighting back. <br> But there is no way for McConnell to look the other way on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible ties between Trump and Russia. Again, the president is damaging the GOP brand ahead of the 2018 elections. <br> McConnell’s shield against the president first came into view when the majority leader kept the Senate in pro forma session over the August vacation break. <br> Next, McConnell gave his Senate Republicans an answer to Trump’s self-serving rants about Congress’s failure to repeal ObamaCare. <br> Trump had every reason to let McConnell’s words roll off his back. But the president could not help firing back. <br> And Trump kept punching: “Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal Replace, Tax Reform Cuts and a great infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it!” the president said in another jab via Twitter. <br> Trump is getting support from conservative radio commentators in his war against McConnell. <br> A July PPP poll found that voters give McConnell an 18 percent job approval rating and a 58 percent disapproval rating. And the whole Congress had a 75 percent disapproval poll number. <br> It may be working with some GOP voters, but so far, McConnell’s GOP caucus is sticking with the Kentuckian. <br> Let’s not forget it was McConnell who used the so-called “nuclear option” to hand Trump the only real win of his presidency by confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. <br> That open seat gave Trump a strong campaign talking point — his promise to appoint a conservative to the court. 
 On Monday evening, President Trump addressed the nation to outline his new strategy to win the war in Afghanistan. <br> After a series of accusations by lawmakers and the media suggesting that the president had been dragging his feet onthe conflict, Trump confidently committed to sending an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan and indicated that the United States will work closely with NATO allies, as well as regional allies in Pakistan and India to resolve the conflict. <br> Although President Trump could not have effectively made a speech about the events in Charlottesville and the need for unity in our country alone, he did use tonight’s address to lay the groundwork for healing the wounds of division in our country, essentially using the examples of unity and common purpose that our armed service members consistently display. <br> This is the first step in a national reconciliation process that will take more time effort and commitment to implement. Along these lines, the President needs to lower his voice, reduce his tweets, and seek common ground with Republicans and Democrats alike. <br> Further, President Trump needs to begin working toward compromise on key issues like health care, tax reform and infrastructure. <br> On Monday night, however, the president successfully changed the national conversation to foreign policy and military strategy. <br> At this time, 4,000 additional U.S. troops are far too few to stop the full range of terrorist and insurgent threats menacing the United States and challenging the Afghan government. <br> However, as Senator McCain continued, “the unfortunate truth is that this strategy is long overdue, and in the interim, the Taliban has made dangerous inroads.” <br> It is my view that despite President Trump’s overt confidence and soaring rhetoric on Monday night, his new plan is too little, too late. <br> Modern Middle Eastern history tells us that no foreign power has ever succeeded in Afghanistan and there is no reason to believe things will change with this small additional troop allocation. <br> Given the recent gains made by the Taliban, Haqqani, Islamic State in Khorasan, and other terrorist groups, more is needed to successfully reassert the Afghan government’s control, as well as bring American involvement to an end. <br> But given the complexities of the political and military situations on the ground in Afghanistan, this achievement will take a serious commitment, extending well beyond what the United States has already dedicated over the past sixteen years. <br> These causes are all well and good and it is my hope the president and our military succeeds. <br> As echoed in Monday night’s address, President Trump’s reassertion of U.S. leadership around the world was a foundational component of his campaign. 
 <b>Programming note:</b>Watch “Varney Co.” weekdays on the Fox Business Channel from 9 – 12pm ET.</i> <br> Has there ever been a time when the two political parties have been as divided as they are now? <br> Start with the Democrats. Senators Feinstein and Schumer sharply criticize the president over the language he used on North Korea. Think about this: a rogue foreign power, armed with a nuke and a missile delivery system, directly threatens to attack America, and the left objects to the president's tone! <br> You'd think we'd come together at a time like this but no. <br> Internally, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have divided the Democrats over abortion, socialized medicine, energy and the endless tax the rich idea. That is a pretty big division. <br> The Senate Republican leader openly criticizes the Republican president. Republican John McCain returns to D.C. just in time to sink the Republican health care plan. And if you think there is agreement among republicans on tax reform, dream on! <br> ObamaCare is collapsing and millions are hurting: fix it! 
 “Sound practical judgment that is independent of specialized knowledge, training, or the like; normal native intelligence.” —<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/common-sense?s=t" target="_blank">Dictionary.com’s definition of common sense. <br> Sometimes what used to be called “common sense” can seem radical in Washington, which is used to practicing senseless policies and funding programs that don’t work. <br> Thanks to Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.), we now have a plan worthy of serious consideration, even implementation. <br> Last week, they introduced legislation that, according to USA Today, that would “overturn the rules for becoming an American citizen and cut in half the number allowed in.” <br> The second key concerns numbers and the goal of eliminating chain migration. Despite counter arguments based on the Emma Lazarus poem about the world sending America its “tired and poor,” poems are not the Constitution, or the law, otherwise Emily Dickinson might have become president. Poems are about sentiment. The right immigration policy is about survival. <br> Key number three is language. It isn’t difficult for immigrants to learn enough English to function in America. I meet them in Washington and everywhere I travel. Here’s the official government position for becoming a citizen: “To become a naturalized U.S. citizen, you must pass the naturalization test. At your naturalization interview, you will be required to answer questions about your application and background. You will also take an English and civics test unless you qualify for an exemption or waiver.” <br> The Cotton-Perdue measure would also eliminate the Green Card Lottery, which, in an effort to add diversity to the country, grants 50,000 green cards each year to countries that don't normally send many immigrants to the U.S. 
 Despite record job growth, the Dow over 22,000, illegal immigration down 70 percent and massive deregulation, the mainstream media still reports that Donald Trump’s presidency is a failure. To put the final nail in the coffin of the opposition (Republicans, Democrats and the failing mainstream media) President Trump needs victories in three areas: legislative, the court of public opinion, and national defense and diplomacy. <br> First, legislative – more specifically, health care. A handful of Republicans – after campaigning, raising money on and promising the repeal of ObamaCare – failed to deliver. This is why “we the people” like the president more than Congress. But it is not too late for Trump to post a victory here. He can propose a bill to repeal only the individual mandate and he needs to do it louder than anything else he has done to date. That is the single most unpopular element of the health care law and might even garner support from across the aisle – even Democrats have admitted it needs changes. This would be very hard to vote against and the president would post his first legislative victory. <br> Also in the legislative column: tax reform. What legislator would not want to go home to constituents and be able to say “we put more money in your paycheck?” Here is how you roll it out: send Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the podium with an average middle class American making $50-60,000 a year, hold up his current paycheck, what he makes and what he takes home. Then you hold up a second paycheck with the same salary under Trump’s tax plan highlighting the difference in the take home pay. “This is what President Trump stands for. Congress, the bill is on your desk, make it happen.” She walks out without taking any questions and does not hold a press conference until Congress votes on it. <br> In the court of public opinion, Trump has been convicted by the mainstream media of Russian collusion. The problem, though, is they have yet to produce any evidence for any of their criminal allegations. Here’s the play: Trump challenges his largest critics on this. Calling out Schumer, Pelosi, Waters and a few more saying that he will participate in the investigation to the fullest for 90 more days on the condition that if nothing is found, they resign their seats. Look, there is no precedent or legal grounds for this. If they don’t respond in 10 days, he fires Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It’s simply a PR play, they will NOT agree to this which gives Trump the opportunity to go on the offense and say, “The Democrats don’t even believe in this investigation.” <br> Finally, national defense. Even with the 15-0 global decision against it at the UN Security Council, North Korea is going to continue to push the envelope until we do something. Sanctions will not work and will only further enrage the regime. North Korea is so poor that people are eating the frogs and bugs in the streets – any sanctions placed on them simply re-directs any limited funds away from his people and back to his military complex. 
 First they said he would never run for president. Then they said he would never be the Republican nominee for president. Then they said he could never be elected president. The latest false narrative being pushed by the liberal media is that some Republicans are making moves to run against President Trump in 2020. <br> These fake news stories are in the interests of the liberal agenda because they raise manufactured questions about the president’s standing with Republican primary voters and are meant to cause division among conservatives. Try as they might, the American people are too smart for the elitist gamesmanship going on in the boardrooms at the New York Times and Washington Post. <br> On pro-life issues, the National Right to Life Committee gave President Trump an A grade for his performance through his first 100 days in office. On 2nd Amendment rights, President Trump is the first president to address the National Rifle Association leadership forum in 34 years and their Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said that he sees “a tremendous pride wave out there in the heartland of the country with this president.” Social conservative leaders praised President Trump’s recent decision to not allow transgender people to serve in the military. And if all this isn’t enough to satisfy conservatives, Justice Neil Gorsuch’s stellar service on the Supreme Court is icing on the cake. <br> There’s much more that conservatives like about the job President Trump is doing. When it comes to sanctuary city reform and border security, President Trump’s leadership has exceeded all expectations. In fact, President Trump has been so effective in dealing with sanctuary city lawlessness that elitist liberal Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is suing the Trump Administration to try and keep Chicago a dangerous sanctuary city. <br> No one knows this better than Vice President Mike Pence. Since becoming President Trump’s running mate a little over a year ago, Vice President Pence has been a full partner with the president in their mission to enact their conservative reform agenda and “Make America Great Again.” The vice president is focused like a laser beam on fixing health care, tax reform, and various other initiatives and is doing a great job. When Vice President Pence travels to Iowa or Ohio to advocate for the president’s agenda it means exactly that and nothing more. President Trump and Vice President Pence are looking forward to defeating Congresswoman Maxine Waters or whatever leftist the out-of-control Democrat Party nominates in 2020. 
 How long Trumpism, good or bad, lasts beyond Donald Trump is a question the political right and conservatives are going to be grappling with for the next four to eight years and beyond. <br> There’s no doubt that President Trump’s firebrand populism captured the attention of a good chunk of the nation on the right, but so has his instability in the White House and on Twitter. More than six months in, little has been accomplished beyond the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, minor executive orders and almost daily fights with mainstream media. <br> The same thinkers on the right who lament President Trump’s daily tweets are willing to at least entertain the idea of a Senate candidate like Kid Rock basing his entire would-be gimmick candidacy on retweets and his name trending on Twitter. <br> Members of the media who regularly use their Twitter feeds as their own personal Daily Show snark are elevating Kid Rock, while giggling to themselves at the very thought, somehow forgetting that Donald Trump’s flirtation with the presidency started this exact same way. <br> The question shouldn’t be can the middle-age Kid win with faux celebrity populism, as President Trump did. Kid Rock can hit all the right notes with pictures of home-cooked meals on Twitter and a pop image catering to “The forgotten man.” <br> Brandon Finnigan, the founder and director of Decision Desk HQ, a reliable election prognosticator, gives Kid Rock a 50-50 chance of unseating Stabenow, citing factors such as “name recognition, money, oddball candidate, midterm electorate.” The parallels with President Trump are certainly there, including the likely underestimation by Democrats of an unconventional but well-known candidate. <br> The desire by conservatives to feel relevant in contemporary culture has always been tempting. As more and more institutions in our culture – like Hollywood and academia – attempt to freeze conservatives out of the debate, some understandably feel the need for the blessing of already established voices. Unfortunately, this need can overwhelm those who should know better. <br> Johnson is also enjoying a celebrity honeymoon based on an image, reminiscent of the 1980s hyper-patriotism of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is all buoyed by Johnson’s offhanded flirtations in interviews about possibly pursuing the presidency in 2020 or 2024. Do we know what he stands for? Does he have an in-depth grasp of the issues at hand in a world growing ever more dangerous? Who cares! Of course he does! He’s The Rock! <br> The same people who warned us about the pitfalls of a celebrity culture bleeding into politics as they watched President Obama hobnob with the star-studded Hollywood elite for eight years&nbsp; are falling prey to the inevitability of today’s celebrities entering the political arena. Will they support a President Rock (Johnson, not Kid), President Kanye West, President George Clooney, Senator Kim Kardashian and Senator Kid Rock? <br> Also exploring a run for the Republican nomination for Stabenow’s seat in Michigan is former Army Ranger and Detroit businessman John James. Just last week he released a slick, well-edited video<b> articulating the importance of family, liberty, thriving small businesses and conservative values. 
 The Democratic Party is a mess. It has no effective national leader. It has no serious agenda. And Democrats have no idea how to win back the Rust Belt voters who propelled the ultimate political outsider, Donald J. Trump, to the presidency. <br> During President Obama’s eight years in office the Democrats became primarily a coastal party that caters to out-of-touch wealthy elitists in liberal enclaves like Manhattan and Hollywood, while ignoring the hardworking Americans who are the backbone of our country. <br> Forgotten voters in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina – whose families had voted for Democrats since President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s time – have finally had enough. They feel like they’ve lost their country and that their leaders in Washington have lost faith in them. <br> Then Donald Trump came into their communities, talking America First, American jobs, and American exceptionalism. Trump has backed those words up with an optimistic agenda anchored on the central promise to get Americans working again. The Make American Great Again effort is focused on reform: tax reform, trade reform, regulatory reform, domestic energy production reform, and health care reform. <br> A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that only 37 percent of the American people think that the Democratic Party stands for something. And 52 percent said all that the Democrats do is oppose President Trump. This polling data reflects reality. President Trump has been in office for six months and the Democrats up until now have done nothing more than run a permanent obstruction campaign against the president and his agenda. <br> I will go a step further and offer what I hear from the liberals in Washington and in the mainstream media about what I would call the real Democrat agenda: <br> This list represents the deep hole that Democrats have dug for themselves outside of their shrinking far-left base. 
 It’s the middle of July, and President Trump still doesn’t have a chairman for his Council of Economic Advisers. His nominee, Kevin Hassett, is a world-recognized expert on taxation, but he has been stuck on the sidelines despite tax reform being one of the administration’s big goals this year. He is the one person who could explain how the different parts of the tax bill fit together. <br> White House advisor Gary Cohn has reportedly told associates that time is running out for tax reform. He worries that if tax reform doesn't get done by the end of the year, it likely won’t happen at all. Missing key players such as Hassett doesn’t help. <br> The Senate Banking Committee very easily advanced Hassett’s nomination last month, with only Elizabeth Warren opposing. Other liberal Democrats such as Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Jack Reed (R.I.), Robert Menedez (N.J.), and Brian Schatz (Hawaii) all voted in Hassett’s favor. <br> The economists who know Hassett best also support him. Forty-four prominent economists, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike, signed a letter supporting Hassett’s confirmation. <br> It read, in part, as follows: “While the signers of this letter hold a range of views on President Trump’s policies, we all believe that the formulation of economic policy would be advanced by the analysis and advice that Dr. Hassett would bring to the table.” They also noted Hassett’s “record of serious scholarship.” The signers included all of President Obama’s Council Chairmen (Jason Furman, Alan Krueger, Christina Romer, Austan Goolsbee), President Clinton’s chairs (Laura Tyson, Martin Baily), Vice President Joe Biden’s chief economist Jared Bernstein, and Obama economic advisor Mark Zandi. <br> Hassett’s confirmation stands at 76 days and counting. For past incoming administrations, the chairman would have officially started his job by around February 26. <br> So far, only 24 percent of Trump's nominees have been confirmed. At this point in their administrations, Obama had 57 percent of his nominees confirmed and George W. Bush had 59 percent. And the low confirmation rate isn’t because Trump has clogged up the system with nominees. Trump has made just 206 nominations, compared to 355 for Obama and 313 for Bush. <br> People in the White House have told me that the current Council of Economic Advisers has been useless, staffed as it is with only Democrats who are hostile to Trump’s policies. As a result, others in the White House have had to do the research and put together the analyses that would normally be done by the Council. <br> President Trump runs an efficient ship. Under Melania, the first lady’s staff is 4. Under Michelle Obama, there were 22 people doing the same job. For Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, there were 18 and up to 19 respectively. The whole Trump administration is making do with less, but the Democrats won’t even let him fill those positions. 
 President Trump’s announcement Friday via Twitter that he is replacing White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus with retired Marine Corps General John F. Kelly could bring more drawbacks than benefits. <br> This is the latest shakeup in the Trump administration, as the president struggles to better organize the West Wing and increase his administration’s efficiency and effectiveness. <br> To be sure, the public feuding going on within the White House up to now has been unacceptable. An administration simply cannot operate with a chief of staff who is the subject of continuing abuse from the president. Further, the administration is only hurt when a chief of staff is fighting openly with the communications director. <br> It seems that given the ouster of two seasoned establishment Republicans – Press Secretary Sean Spicer on July 21 and Priebus on Friday – the White House is trading experience for loyalty, bringing on new Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci and Chief of Staff Kelly. <br> Yet the consequences of the latest staff moves, which may lead to further changes in staffing, will bring extensive political obstacles. <br> However, given the president’s slow pace at gaining Senate confirmations for his key appointees, replacing Kelly may take much longer than desirable. <br> With Priebus as chief of staff, President Trump’s top priority has been repealing and replacing ObamaCare. That has failed so far in Congress, where Republicans are divided on the best course of action. <br> President Trump was originally drawn to Kelly for secretary of Homeland Security because of his security expertise, specifically along the southern border. Given Kelly’s new appointment, this may signal that the president will now prioritize border security as well. <br> The degree to which everyone in our country, both Republicans and Democrats, is hurt by this polarization cannot be underestimated. 
 With the U.S. Senate still working on critically important legislation to replace the collapsing ObamaCare law, President Trump is focused on making sure that the American Dream is obtainable now and for future generations. Already, he has proven to be the greatest advocate for America, its proud citizens, and our working men and women since President Reagan. <br> One of the reasons Donald Trump ran for president in the first place was that he realized our leaders in Washington had forgotten about American jobs, American workers and American security. Hardworking American taxpayers were fed up with politicians in D.C. focused on seemingly everything but them. <br> The optimistic message of ushering in a new era of American exceptionalism begins and ends with American job creation. <br> Last week, for example, the White House hosted companies from all 50 states that make their products right here in the United States of America, providing good jobs for American workers. This Made in America initiative launched by President Trump should be a priority regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. <br> Since his first day in office, President Trump has worked to help American job creators, mindful of the wise observation by the late Republican Congressman Jack Kemp of New York that “you can’t have employees without employers.” <br> The president also understands the importance of opening up America’s vast untapped domestic energy resources for exploration and production. This type of comprehensive energy policy will create many thousands of American jobs and reduce our trade deficit with foreign nations. It is decades overdue. <br> Dramatically reducing the high U.S. tax burden will help to accomplish this. The president’s plan would slash the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. Job creators yearn for the certainty that taxes are going down and won’t be raised. Individual tax rates must also be lowered and our tax code must be simplified. <br> A robust tax reform plan must be taken up as the top priority for this Congress and signed into law by President Trump later this year. Americans heard this campaign promise from Republicans and then elected Republican majorities in the House and Senate to make the promise a reality. Every American will benefit from this enormous pro-growth reform measure. <br> I’m hopeful that some Democrats in the Senate who represent states carried by President Trump in 2016 will join with him and Republicans to support tax reform. These include Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Bill Nelson of Florida, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Their constituents all deserve common-sense tax relief. <br> Throughout the eight years of Barack Obama and during the failed candidacy of Hillary Clinton, Democrats lost their way.

 <b>Editor's note:</b>The following column originally appeared in<a href="http://theresurgent.com/the-gop-establishment-decides-to-stop-president-trumps-agenda/" target="_blank">The Resurgent.</i> <br> Conservatives support the repeal of ObamaCare, but moderate Republican establishment leaders do not. Guess what? ObamaCare is not being repealed. <br> Conservatives support tax reform, but, again, moderate Republican establishment leaders do not. Guess what? Tax reform is no where to be found. <br> Time and time again, the Republican establishment has blocked all those efforts. It is moderate and liberal Republicans who continue to stymie the advance of any and all conservative legislation President Trump supports. They want to grow government, subsidize ObamaCare, and reward their own special interests. They have no intention of providing a level playing field where the poor and middle class can compete against the rich. They’ve instead decided on a paternalism that keeps everyone piled on a social safety net with their friends rewarded. 
 <b>Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Resurgent.</i> <br> Mitch McConnell, in public, says he wants to pass a health care reform plan that repeals ObamaCare. Remember, McConnell says he wants to scrap ObamaCare “root and branch.” <br> McConnell, again and again, stacks the deck against conservatives, setting them up to be the fall guy for his own failures. <br> ObamaCare repeal is just about dead, even though it cannot be filibustered either. <br> Tax reform is dead on arrival. 
 As Washington stumbles over ObamaCare repeal and delays tax reform—and while seemingly endless scandals monopolize headlines—it’s all too easy to lose hope that transformative policy change is possible. <br> But those seeking a return to fiscal sanity should take heart: Significant reforms are advancing at the state level that could spur a bottom-up course correction across the country. <br> The Pew Charitable Trusts called Pennsylvania’s pension law enacted in June “one of the most—if not the most—comprehensive and impactful reforms any state has implemented.” <br> The answer is simple yet instructive: Budgetary pressures and political realities gave him no other choice. <br> Fifteen years ago, Pennsylvania’s pension plans for state employees and school teachers held a surplus. Yet, in the past ten years alone, the plans’ unfunded liabilities ballooned more than 800 percent to $71 billion last year. <br> The debt surged because lawmakers boosted pension benefits in 2001, then for years pushed off required contributions. Their deliberate underfunding coupled with stock market losses transformed a pension debt ripple into a tsunami. <br> Sadly, hardworking Americans bear the consequences of poor pension policy. <br> Against this grim fiscal reality, government union leaders fought all reform efforts—succeeding even when Republicans controlled the legislature and governor’s office. And in 2015, Wolf vetoed pension reform legislation. <br> A grueling, nine-month impasse over Wolf’s first state budget drove down his approval numbers and derailed his agenda. In 2016, voters, most of whom wanted pension reform, handed pro-reform lawmakers their largest majorities in the state House and Senate in decades. <br> Beginning in 2019, new state employees and school teachers, plus newly elected lawmakers, will enroll in a side-by-side hybrid retirement plan. This plan couples a smaller pension with a new 401(k)-style component. New workers could also choose a straight 401(k)-style plan, and current employees and re-elected lawmakers can opt in to the new system. <br> While this reform is no panacea—it does little to reduce the $71 billion taxpayers owe—it will reduce the future risk to families by approximately two-thirds. <br> This new system establishes a firm foundation that Pennsylvania can build upon. 
 President Trump caused some head scratching when he told a plane full of journalists en route to France that “what I’d like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan.” But as the Russia investigations drag on, the prospects for health care reform are on hold, and tax reform continues to be a work in progress, this seemingly far-fetched plan may in fact be the most likely opportunity for the president to land a signature legislative victory during his first year in office. <br> It’s not the conventional bet, but this is not a conventional time nor a conventional president – and, this is not the first time we’ve seen him lay some groundwork for such a pursuit. <br> Even before his comments on Air Force One, President Trump had signaled a desire and willingness to go beyond enforcement to fix the broken visa system and address the fact that 11 million people live here without legal status. <br> These comments may be far from setting administration policy – indeed, Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly just indicated he may not defend Obama-era protection for DREAMers and Politico is reporting that some in the Trump Administration are advocating for cutting legal immigration in half – but they do make clear that a broad immigration overhaul is on the president’s mind and he is open to taking on the issue that has stymied every president since Reagan. <br> I’ll be the first to acknowledge reasonable skepticism, but working on this issue from a nonpartisan vantage point, I believe there are three compelling reasons to believe immigration reform is and should be at the top of the agenda: <br> The bill didn’t skimp on the border, either. It included $46 billion for security and enforcement, double what President Trump is requesting for his wall now. It mandated hundreds of miles of walls and fences, doubled the number of border patrol agents, and funded aircraft, watchtowers, ground sensors, and mobile surveillance to further monitor the border, while also cracking down on employers who hired undocumented immigrants. <br> In this Congress, Republicans in both chambers have already introduced four distinct bills that would provide undocumented immigrants with legal status. (One such bill in the House has attracted more than 200 co-sponsors, including 99 Republicans.) <br> Multiple polls show that Americans of all political persuasions, including a clear majority of Trump voters, overwhelmingly support immigration reform that would secure the border, grant legal status to non-criminal undocumented immigrants, and bring the visa system into the 21st century by increasing protections for American workers while also allowing companies to recruit the top talent and necessary workers to fill gaps in the American workforce. <br> To get a deal, President Trump needs to sweeten the pot by adding broadly popular reforms that would grow the American economy. According to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, such comprehensive reform would cut the deficit by $900 billion over 20 years because of tax revenues from the millions of people who would be able to formally enter the workforce, and would actually result in a 0.5 percent wage increase for all American workers. It would go a long way toward supporting the administration’s economic growth and job creation goals – the president’s own chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has written extensively on the large gains immigration reform can bring – while also creating the budget room for other major priorities. 
 The two major political parties are not giving Americans what they want. Recent polls scream that Americans want politicians from both parties to work together to solve major national problems. For example, a<a href="http://archive.fo/6qp3V" target="_blank">late June Fox News pollfound 79 percent of Americans believe the politicaldebate in the U.S. is overheated and dangerous, while only 18 percent consider it heated, but healthy.” And<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/health/hearing-aids-congress.html" target="_blank">accordingto a recent Harvard-Harris poll, fewer than 40 percent of voters view top congressional leadership favorably. <br> Yet some inparty leadership–on both sides of the aisle–remain deaf to what Americans want. They have shown zero interest in cooperating on healthcare, infrastructure, tax reform, entitlement reform or any major issue. They insist on party discipline – meaning straight party-line voting. They are like rabid sports fans, only their teams are their political parties.They demand absolute fealty from their fellow members, focusing on scoring points against the other party while caring little for the national interest. <br> Resistance to bipartisanship has reached absurd levels. Some dyed-in-the-wool Republicans are even being attacked now as insufficiently conservative solely because they<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/health/hearing-aids-congress.html" target="_blank">joined with Democrats to make hearing aids less costly to millions of Americans. <br> These partyleaders are akin to crude tribal chiefs. Every fight is vicious. Every battle is personal. They lead by fear, control by money and dole out top committee seats to the faithful. They are leading our nation from greatness to decline. <br> Any Democrat seeking to reach across the aisle with members of the GOP or refusing to legislatively counter their attacks on our communities cannot be seen as qualified to carry out their responsibilities. If candidates that have refused to unite against the GOP are presented in the 2020 election cycle, they will not receive support or votes from the minority majority. Only candidates that actively block the efforts of the GOP will be considered. <br> The “resist” movement’s counterpart, the Freedom Caucus, also insists on a no-compromise approach that bars discussion or incorporation of Democratic ideas in any legislation. Bolstered by various media outlets, the Freedom Caucus would happily shut down government, ignore major national problems and hurt ordinary Americans rather than offer tiny concessions and get 80 percent of what they want. <br> Truth, justice and the American way has been replaced by two versions of the truth on every issue. Justice increasingly depends on the whims of the party in power. And “the American way” has become a path by which true believers from each party divide us so seriously that the Civil War may be the only comparable American precedent. <br> We now see leaders in Europe, South and Central America and Africa rejecting the broken politics and increasing economic isolationism of the U.S. and responding to the warm economic embrace of China. They are welcoming Chinese investment, considering bilateral deals and indirectly supporting the Chinese model of a stifled press, tight government control and one-party rule.These moves come as the U.S. continues down a misguided path of increased isolation – abandoning the Paris Agreement and pulling out of TPP, for example. While the rest of the world moves forward to address climate change with new technology innovations, the EU and Japan hammer out a trade deal and China steps up trade initiatives and influence. <br> And China has taken notice. <br> Our future is imperiled not by our resources or our people, but by our leaders’ refusal to acknowledge, confront and resolve our biggest problems: our spiraling debt, our sagging infrastructure, our imbalance between education and jobs, our broken healthcare system and our intergenerational theft from our children. 
 After eight years of failing policies and executive overreach by the Obama Administration, the American people entrusted Republicans with unified control of the House, Senate, and White House. We promised our constituents that we would work quickly to restore constitutional order and take much-needed steps to revitalize our economy. <br> Republicans made a hard commitment to the American people – we would fully repeal ObamaCare, implement pro-growth tax reform, balance the federal budget, and much more. We have begun clearing the overreach of the Obama administration by enacting significant reforms to the Veteran’s Administration, repealing Dodd-Frank, and passing vital regulatory reform. Yet we are now more than six months into the 115th Congress and President Trump’s administration, and have not made enough progress towards achieving our primary goals. <br> That is why I have worked diligently to urge that the House cancel the August congressional recess to inspire us to remain focused on achieving our agenda. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to enact these transformative policies, so Congress should respond in a once-in-a-generation manner. <br> I applaud Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s announcement that the U.S. Senate will cut short its August recess by postponing the start by two weeks. <br> No one should be under the illusion that completion of our agenda will be easy to accomplish, but we should work in good faith to remain true to our constituents. They expect us to work diligently and will be justifiably upset if we recess for four to five weeks instead of moving our agenda forward. Since the start of the 115th Congress, we have achieved some notable accomplishments that have been called singles and doubles. Only by working through August can we hit home runs and restore the trust of our constituents.

 The Senate’s machinations on the health insurance bill have led to significant movement in the past week. Republicans need a legislative win, the first substantive legislative win this year, so they can move on to fundamental tax reform, which has more agreement across all stripes of Republican lawmakers. <br> A week ago, President Donald Trump floated support for repealing ObamaCare first and working on reforms afterwards. Following the tweet, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, released an open letter to the president supporting his timeline, giving the Senate through the Independence Day weekend, and proposing the 2015 reconciliation bill as the vehicle for repeal, joining conservatives in the House and Senate who have been supporting the 2015 bill from the beginning of the year. <br> This bill has been a focus of conservatives committed to repealing ObamaCare for a couple major reasons: it has passed the constraints of reconciliation and almost every Republican in the House and Senate voted for its passage. <br> Ben Sasse and President Trump have come out on the right side of this. The Senate bill we have seen to this point is not a repeal of ObamaCare, and we have seen senators pressuring Republican lawmakers to accept it because “it’s time to put ideological differences aside and move,” as Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, said. <br> We need a strong repeal of ObamaCare to make it onto the floor, taking advantage of reconciliation that Republican senators voted for eighteen months ago. Being able to say, “Look! You voted for this; we want at least this level of ObamaCare repeal,” is important. <br> Our grassroots activists understand the shocking hypocrisy of someone who would vote year after year for ObamaCare repeal followed by year after year promises to repeal ObamaCare under a Republican president – only to change their tune under President Trump. They will understand that these members were relying on President Obama to veto their efforts – some Republicans never really wanted to have their bills become law. They would be exposed as frauds. 
 About 25 Democratic lawmakers have signed on to a bill that would create an Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity. <br> Their goal: declare the President of the United States mentally incompetent under Section IV of the 25th Amendment and remove him from office. <br> Particularly disturbing is the fact that lawmakers would turn to this as Americans are coming together to celebrate the birth of our nation, this Independence Day. <br> John D. Feerick is a former Dean of Law at Fordham University who was a chief architect of the Section of Article 25 that the lawmakers are attempting to use. He cites the original congressional debate on the section that he spearheaded, and he says that policy and political differences are not grounds for enacting Section IV of Article 25 to declare the president mentally incompetent. <br> These lawmakers are 100 percent Democrat, and this is a partisan effort designed to undermine the work of this president. <br> It is unethical to attempt to make diagnoses on living public figures one has not clinically evaluated. This is commonly accepted across the medical and mental health professions. <br> This is low-brow, even for Democrats who worked with Russian nationals to create a now discredited dossier on the president. This is low for a party who has lost more than 1,000 state and local elections in the past eight years, and is 0-5 in special elections since this Republican president was inaugurated. 
 President Donald Trump was elected our nation’s 45th president not beholden to Washington or any special interest in its swamp. President Trump is a change agent unlike any President the American people have ever seen. He’s the first non-politician to be elected president since General Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. &nbsp;President Trump was elected as a successful businessman to break up Washington’s failed status quo. What we are witnessing is the ultimate political outsider enacting real change. <br> So all the sound and fury emanating from Washington? That’s what it sounds like when an entrenched political class that is radically averse to change is forced to confront it, head-on. And all the noise is obscuring one very important fact, and that is that 161 days into the Trump Presidency – once you cut through the permanent obstruction campaign being waged by the Democrats and all the noise emanating from the liberal media – genuine progress is being made on the Trump agenda. <br> This week’s unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court ordering that the President’s executive order on immigration can largely take effect is an enormous victory for the White House and our national security. The Supreme Court put its stamp of approval on the fact that the President of the United States has the power to secure our country and that our immigration vetting system needs major improvement. <br> Through President Trump’s “America First” leadership, much progress has already been made. The nomination and confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch for example is a promise made and a promise kept by our president. This widely praised decision sent a signal to the American people that this president will appoint only supremely qualified defenders of the Constitution to our nation’s highest court.&nbsp; Similarly, President Trump’s consequential decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord makes clear he is prioritizing the economic interests of the United States of America and the American worker first and foremost. <br> Going forward, it is critically important that the U.S. Senate continue to improve their health care reform legislation and get it to President Trump’s desk for his signature. This landmark accomplishment will enable our country to finally move on from the divisive ObamaCare years and onto policy measures such as tax reform which will make dramatic economic gains and job creation become a reality. Job creators at businesses both large and small are craving for some economic certainty from our federal government. They want the certainty that taxes and regulations are going to be cut and that our tax code will be streamlined for the hardworking taxpayers that they employ. These optimistic pro-growth reforms are something that the American people will rally around. Hopefully some Senate Democrats from states President Trump carried will feel the same way. 
 On Tuesday House Speaker Paul Ryan, speaking at the National Association of Manufacturers, reiterated his call for the need for tax reform. Tax reform is urgent because the gap in corporate tax rates between the United States and our competitors is wide and increasing. <br> Ryan told the audience that “as the world changed, our tax code has remained stuck in neutral. It has ballooned to 70,000 pages of rules and regulations that few people today actually understand. There is an old line about this: our tax code is about five times as long as the Bible, but with none of the Good News.” <br> For example, Burger King, the fast food chain, merged with Canada’s Tim Horton’s, a doughnut chain, in order to access Canada’s lower taxes. <br> In America corporate profits are taxed three times, once at the business level, another time when they are distributed to individuals, and a third time at death. The high corporate tax discourages investment. The gap between American and foreign rates is widening, as foreign countries are lowering their rates even as the U.S. rate stays the same. In order to raise U.S. levels of investment, the corporate tax rate should be reduced to the range of 15 percent to 20 percent, as President Trump and Speaker Ryan propose. <br> After all these taxes are taken into account, the tax rate on equity can reach well over 50 percent, depending on the extent of the estate tax. This encourages firms to take on debt for financing, which is distortionary. <br> A global (or worldwide) tax system is uncompetitive with high tax rates because it imposes a high income tax rate on all profits, regardless of where they are earned. If an American company operates in the United States and Canada, its domestic affiliate pays U.S. taxes of 35 percent and its foreign affiliate pays U.S. taxes at 35 percent and Swiss taxes at 15 percent. America allows companies to deduct the taxes paid to foreign governments from U.S. taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service, but this means that corporations always pay the full U.S. rate and are unable to take advantage of low-tax jurisdictions. <br> America raised just under $300 billion from the corporate tax in 2016, according to the Office of Management and Budget, around 9 percent of all revenue, and the tax costs millions to administer. Most important, it effectively discourages investment in the United States. 
 “Puerto Rico, my heart’s devotion. Let it sink back in the ocean.” — West Side Story <br> The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is drowning. The island, so popular with tourists, is $123 billion in debt. That’s more debt than the $18 billion bankruptcy filed by the city of Detroit in 2013. In May, San Juan declared a form of bankruptcy after creditors filed lawsuits demanding their money. A federal district judge appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts will handle the case. <br> Fortuno was elected in 2009. In a telephone interview from his Washington law office, he tells me that during his one term he cut government expenses by $2 billion and the island’s bond rating went up. “We refinanced the debt on better terms” and by the time he left office in 2013, “we had brought down the budget every year and lowered corporate taxes. People believed they could take risks again.” <br> In the 2012 election, Fortuno lost to Democrat Alejandro Garcia Padilla by a narrow (0.6 percent) margin. Fortuno blames the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) for contributing to his opponent’s campaign. “They invested heavily against me,” he says. Padilla renewed the spending policies of the past and, though he left office earlier this year, the damage was done. <br> As the Journal noted, under Fortuno “Puerto Rico implemented tax reform and permit reform, legislated a world-leading public-private partnership (P3) act, reduced government expenses and paid its suppliers…” <br> A referendum on the status of Puerto Rico was held in Puerto Rico on June 11. Three options were open to voters: remain with the commonwealth, independence or statehood. Statehood won. <br> Fortuno doesn’t believe it is a given that Democrats would win those seats. He draws a distinction between the mostly liberal Puerto Ricans who have left the island for places like New York City and those who remain. He says current residents “are social and economic conservatives,” suggesting Republicans could pick up seats. 
 In making his impassioned speech on how our county’s economy can grow through tax reform, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said Tuesday, “We need to connect people with the skills they need to get good-paying, in-demand jobs.” <br> Speaker Ryan is absolutely right, and the House is immediately answering the Speaker’s call to action. <br> For many Americans this is not the case, and not the best path they can take to find the skills needed to ultimately lead them to the overall goal of an education — a good paying job and a successful life. <br> An unfortunate truth is that America is still facing a recovering economy, and a widening skills gap that is putting our workforce at a disadvantage to succeed in a 21stcentury economy. While companies across the country have openings for high paying jobs, and are anxious to hire, many workers lack the skills and adequate education needed to qualify and compete for those jobs. <br> Such a shortage in our workforce does not allow Americans to be on track to compete in a global marketplace. We have arrived at this shortage, in large part, because of the way we think about education and skills-focused education in this country. <br> These are students who find high-quality education and career development opportunities in their own communities, and are often recruited by companies in their own backyard who are in need of workers ready to play a role in a 21stcentury workforce. <br> In 2014, the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) was enacted into law, and set in motion necessary reforms to improve the dialogue between local leaders and private businesses on how workforce education could better serve employers’ needs in communities across the country. <br> Most importantly, all of these conversations can be had without the federal government dictating how these programs should be implemented. <br> A “Washington knows best” approach to creating successful skills-focused education programs is not the answer as communities plan and develop career and technical education programs tailored to their local economies. <br> In doing so, we are also changing the way we think about education and vocations in this country. <br> Our state and local leaders in the public and private sectors are in the driver’s seat when it comes to workforce development, and Washington can watch and learn as their work closes the skills gap in our country. 
 For years, as a radio broadcaster, I organized tax reform rallies on the state capitol steps demanding relief for hard working Minnesotans—but also changes in how the government collects its revenue. <br> Now, as a member of Congress, I actually have a chance to do something about it. <br> Rarely has a tax code done more to stifle, discourage and punish entrepreneurship than the one with which we're currently saddled. In fact, Americans were projected to spend more than 8.9 billion hours—the equivalent of roughly 4.3 million full-time workers—doing their taxes for 2016, according to the<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/compliance-costs-irs-regulations/#_ftn1" target="_blank">Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. <br> Yet the current federal tax code subsidises the higher income tax states like Minnesota instead of nudging them to get their taxes in line with the rest of the country. A loophole, by the way, which disproportionately benefits upper income earners. <br> Any wonder why after nine years of massive amounts of federal spending and debt we're still mired in the slowest economic growth rate since WWII -- yet to hit three percent annually? Why median household incomes still haven't reached their pre-2007 recession levels? Or why the civilian labor force participation rate is stuck at levels not seen since the ‘malaise’ of the 1970s? <br> The House tax reform blueprint simplifies the four-million-word tax code, cuts corporate and personalincome taxes and reduces seven individual brackets to just three. It also vastly expands those who will owe nothing by enlarging the standard deduction. <br> We need a tax code where more folks have skin in the game -- but at much lower rates. In fact, one reason for the army of special interest groups in Washington is the punitive nature of very high marginal tax rates. <br> On the corporate side, the OECD reports the combined federal and state statutory tax rate for the United States is nearly 39 percent—about ten points higher than the weighted average of the group’s other 34 members. <br> By some estimates, there may now be upwards of $2.6 trillion stockpiled offshore avoiding U.S. taxes. The House plan embraces a common-sense‘territorial system that taxes corporate earnings only once and starts the process of repatriating those trillions of dollars back into the United States for things like infrastructure investment right here at home. <br> In 1962,<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkeconomicclubaddress.html" target="_blank">speaking at the Economic Clubof New York, President Kennedy reiterated his support for an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes<i></i>because a complicated tax code coupled with high rates exerts too heavy a drag on growth&nbsp;and&quot;reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking. 
 <b>Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.</i> <br> How times have changed on ObamaCare. <br> And then there is the GOP failure to find a palatable substitute. <br> Even President Trump on a visit to Capitol Hill last week reportedly told Republican senators that he doesn’t like the House GOP’s American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it is “mean.” <br> Seeing Trump jump off the House plan is a very bad sign for Congressional Republicans as they get ready to talk health care with constituents over coming recesses around Independence Day and in August. Even when the president was celebrating the House bill, Republicans faced unruly Memorial Day town hall meetings, with outright protests against their health care proposal. <br> They are reported to be looking at increasing subsidies for the poor while providing more time to achieve the far-right goal of doing away with federal guarantees of Medicaid funds to pay medical bills for the poor. The GOP Senate majority also may include special grants to areas hard hit by opioid addiction. <br> Senate Majority Leader<a href="http://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell(R-Ky.) is keeping his caucus on board this night train ride by promising bright days ahead. The dawn will bring tax reform that will cut taxes for the rich – another promise the GOP wants to keep ahead of the 2018 midterms. But they can only get there once passage of a health care deal is in the rearview mirror. <br> The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page buys into the McConnell strategy. It contends the big players know what is in the Senate bill. Also, the paper views Democrats as insincere on the grounds that nothing will please liberal critics except renewal of ObamaCare. <br> Let’s see if the GOP can put a plan before the public that provides medical insurance to more people than ObamaCare and lowers premiums; that offers protections for people with pre-existing conditions; that pays bills for mental health, maternity and drug problems; that does away with yearly and lifetime caps on spending; and that protects young people from being prematurely pushed off of their parents’ plans. <br> Noticeably not on board are female GOP senators, including the most senior Republican woman in the Senate,<a href="http://thehill.com/people/susan-collins" target="_blank">Susan Collinsof Maine, who has a background as a state insurance regulator. Also excluded was South Carolina Sen.<a href="http://thehill.com/people/tim-scott" target="_blank">Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the upper chamber, who made his fortune as an insurance executive in the Palmetto State. <br> Polls show the public consistently rejecting the House plan. A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month found 62 percent of voters disapprove of the House bill while just 17 percent approve of it. <br> Meanwhile, Democrats are rushing into the town square in advance of the 2018 elections pointing to rising support for ObamaCare. And they are damning the Republicans with charges of hypocrisy. <br> “Look at how this bill was written,”<a href="http://thehill.com/people/john-boehner" target="_blank">Boehnerfumed. “Can you say it was done openly, with transparency and accountability, without backroom deals struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell, no you can’t! Have you read the bill? …Hell, no you haven’t! ...Shame on this body!” <br> Even if the Senate bill gets 50 votes once the deal is public, it will still have to survive a conference committee with the House Freedom Caucus hardliners. 
 What a mess. Any way you look at it, the Russia probe is a mess and distraction. The president needs to calm the waters, ignore his detractors, and legislate. He has eighteen months, at the outside forty-two, to work with a bicameral Republican Congress. Every day counts. <br> Yet the drumbeat continues. Thursday it was a Washington Post report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could try to thread the needle and take a look at “obstruction of justice” charges, but based on what? Not much there. Ninety-nine of a hundred legal scholars would say that, speaking legally, there is an inadequate basis for a finding of corrupt intent, let alone direction, in context of former FBI Director James Comey's prior public actions and President Trump's separate authority and basis for the firing. <br> Mueller likely knows all this, and sees it clearly. So why interview on the topic? Hopefully, dotting I’s and crossing T’s.&nbsp; Why are those inside now leaking his methods to the Washington Post, perhaps disgorging “law enforcement sensitive” information? To score political points, probably. Who is investigating them? Not clear. <br> In any event, an obstruction claim would just go to Congress for inaction. The best possible outcome for Democrats and anti-Trump bureaucrats might be a constant flow of leaks, rumors and innuendo, trying to render the sitting American president distracted, and possibly ineffectual. <br> Un-talked about is this fact: Mounting political backlash against Democrats, for pressing unsubstantiated claims, is certain to materialize. Like mounting backlash against those pushing violence on college campuses and against Republicans, this mess may get bigger. What a miscalculation, if the Democrats think that is their ticket to 2018, or 2020. <br> In the process, Americans would get real movement on health care, real tax reform, strong national security and law enforcement, needed infrastructure, and predictability. That would be more than enough. 
 With all the media focus on Russian investigations, tax reform, attempts to repeal and replace ObamaCare and President's Trump bold budget, it would be easy to overlook the impressive progress being made on the unglamorous but crucial area of liberating the U.S. economy from suffocating regulations – another form of taxation. <br> Experts believe these rules cost the American people up to $2 trillion a year. Now the ball of sensible deregulation is advancing, a stunning change from the Obama administration where hardly a day went by without some new anti-business mandate being promulgated. <br> A number of Obama anti-growth rules have been repealed through the Congressional Review Act. <br> Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., recently asked the right question in a hearing on improving our infrastructure: “Can performance-based regulations be more effective than command-and-control regulations in achieving safety goals while imposing less of a burden on industry?” <br> The answer, of course, is yes and there is now a bill before Congress that would codify this common sense approach, The Revamping American Infrastructure Act of 2017. The proposed legislation would call on federal bureaucrats to “identify those regulations, guidance and policies that in current form establish prescriptive requirements for regulated entities; and are able to be replaced, consistent with Federal law, with outcome-based performance standards.” <br> Thanks to deregulation in 1980, the industry morphed from an inefficient, loss-ridden system into the finest, most efficient in the world. Nonetheless, the industry is still weighed down unnecessarily by countless, archaic operational mandates. It is ready to deploy new technologies for inspections such as drones, trackside detection systems and sophisticated X-ray machines that would provide crucial information in real time. Yet the industry must abide by a rigid set of procedures established by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) that seems to think the world is still dominated by those legendary steam engines of yore. <br> This dinosaur mentality has begotten a rule mandating current crew sizes in perpetuity. The head of the Association of American Railroads points out that this is how government seeks to address a problem, in this case “accidents caused by human error by dictating to the railroads a specific approach: use of two-person crews. [Yet] it does so without any data or analysis to support the notion that the second person in the cab will actually result in a reduction in human-error accidents--which was, after all, the goal.” <br> We had mentioned the EPA's jihad against fossil fuels. One example is its so-called haze rule that it issued during the Obama administration, ostensibly to improve visibility. Trouble was, objective observers find it would do next to nothing to achieve that goal. What it would do, however, would be to force the closure of several coal-fired power plants and kill numerous jobs. 
 <b>Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com. <br> Will Democrats win any of these special Congressional elections? <br> So, what will it take for Democrats to start winning? <br> Second, last week’s poor jobs numbers and Trump’s lack of progress on tax reform offer more evidence that the GOP lacks a strong record for its candidates to run on. <br> And, third, the Democratic base is fired up. With Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate deal, the party is definitely unified in its fury at him. <br> Is there any concrete reason to think that the nation’s politics have changed enough to give the Democrats the 24 seats they need to take control of the House and set themselves up to defeat Trump in 2020? <br> Daily Kos Elections reports that, as of May 25, there had been 18 special elections for Congressional and state legislative seats. Democrats have done better than Clinton in 12, averaging a margin of 11 percentage points better than their 2016 presidential nominee. <br> That forecast fit with Clinton’s prediction at a tech conference last week that it is “certainly realistic” for Democrats to win the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. <br> Before he withdrew from the climate deal, Trump’s approval rating was underwater by 14 points: Gallup reported last week that the president’s job performance was approved by 40 percent of the country, while 54 percent disapproved. <br> A Politico/Morning Consult Poll last week found that 43 percent of voters want impeachment proceedings right now. <br> But all that is noise inside a political bubble unless there is a winning message from Democrats that goes beyond another dose of fury at Trump and speaks directly to voters. 
 The establishment press is easily distracted. Their goal is to sell papers or TV advertising. Conspiracy theories about Russians are more fun for the talking heads than deep dives into tax reform and health care reform. <br> By Election Day 2018 the American people will want to know the answer to the question, are you better off than you were two years ago? <br> Do your family members have opportunities and increasing wages? <br> The success of the Trump presidency will hinge on the passage of pro-growth tax reform that addresses the American competitiveness problem, boosts the economy, creates more jobs, and leads to higher wages. <br> For the economy to grow, tax reform must be permanent, it must lead to competitive tax rates with territoriality, and it must allow immediate expensing of business assets. <br> Over the past decade, the<a href="https://hudson.org/research/12714-economic-growth-by-president?ref=patrick.net" target="_blank">economyhas struggled at just two percent GDP growth – the worst recovery of the modern era. This lackluster recovery has cost families an average of<a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/analysis?ID=B47A025D-F45B-4657-A26D-C2252E363E48" target="_blank">$8,600 in annual income, according to the Joint Economic Committee. The Congressional Budget Office<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/52370-Outlook_OneColumn.pdf" target="_blank">projectsthat two percent growth will continue into the next decade under current policies. <br> While the U.S. rate remains high, other countries have adapted to the global changes by aggressively reducing their rates. Today, only the U.S. and Chile have<a href="http://businessroundtable.org/sites/default/files/BRT%20Tax%20Reform%202015%20Sept24%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank">higher
 President Trump’s economic team paints a rosier picture of what his policies can accomplish than the economics profession is willing to endorse. <br> Trump’s team is formulating<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-aims-to-balance-budget-with-deep-cuts-bullish-growth-projections-1495155600" target="_blank">budget and tax proposals that project 3 percent annual growth, while the number crunchers at the<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52370" target="_blank">Congressional Budget Office estimate only 1.9 percent. <br> Thanks to baby boomer retirements and a declining birth rate, the prime working age population — those aged 25 to 65 — is not likely to grow even 1 percent annually — even with<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/immigration-reform-could-be-the-win-that-trump-and-the-economy-need-2017-03-27" target="_blank">well-conceived, needs-based immigration reformsand changes in entitlement programs that encourage more adults to work. <br> There’s no doubt that cutting corporate and personal income taxes and spending more on roads and highways could give the economy a Keynesian jolt and raise growth above 3 percent for a few quarters. But Trump’s policy reforms are likely to be watered down by political infighting. <br> The prospects that those proposals will carry long-term punch for productivity and growth are limited by congressional politics and, perhaps more fundamentally, by conditions limiting the efficacy of pushing up investment through tax cuts. <br> Similarly, using private money to improve roads and bridges has some potential<u>,but<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/immigration-reform-could-be-the-win-that-trump-and-the-economy-need-2017-03-27" target="_blank">many improvements will likely require unpopular new taxes and user fees. Trump’s promise to get tough on trade faces strong opposition even among skeptics inside his own White House. <br> These days, they say, important new technologies — game machines and handheld devices that permit comparison shopping while roaming the aisles at Target — do more to entertain and enhance our leisure time than boost productivity. <br> Our models look at recent trends, cast them in concrete and then extrapolate into the future. They can’t accurately predict GDP growth two or three quarters from now, never mind tell us much about how emerging innovations will change work and the broader contours of the economy one or several decades into the future. <br> In the decades ahead,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-machines-think-and-feel-1458311760" target="_blank">machines that can feel and think<u> — replacing the tactile advantages of the human hand and genuinely solving tough problems, as opposed to merely accelerating the searching and processing of information — will boost productivity in ways we can hardly fathom. 
 In 2008, President Obama claimed that saddling the American people with $9 trillion in debt was “irresponsible” and “unpatriotic.” Yet, after eight years of his tax-and-spend policies, Obama is rightfully dubbed the King of Debt for doubling our national debt, which stood at a staggering $20 trillion when he left office. <br> This reckless approach to spending by Democrats launched our country into an unprecedented fiscal crisis. But last year, the voters said ‘enough is enough’ when they elected President Trump and Republicans at all levels for their bold vision to get our country’s fiscal house in order. <br> Republicans know that our nation’s entrepreneurs and small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. By making federal government more efficient and less intrusive, we empower them to invest, create jobs, and grow our economy. We want families to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, because we know they can spend their money better at home than the federal government can in Washington, D.C. <br> By enacting comprehensive tax reform that eliminates unnecessary, burdensome Obama-era regulations, our country can save as much as $1.2 trillion. This is a significant amount of money that will help bolster President Trump’s America First priorities. <br> One of the most crucial among those priorities is rebuilding our nation’s military, which was left depleted and out-of-date after years of neglect by the previous administration. President Trump’s budget includes a 10 percent increase in defense spending, providing a long-overdue modernization of military assets and support. This means our servicemen and servicewomen, who risk their lives daily for our freedom, would be fully equipped to succeed in the line of fire. <br> While many hard choices were necessary to reach this budget, the spending reductions reflect President Trump’s charge to reduce the size of the federal workforce and create a leaner, more accountable, and less intrusive government for the American people. 
 Most presidents’ budgets are “dead on arrival” in Congress. It happened to Obama and Bush, and there are those who hope it happens to President Donald Trump. <br> That would be a huge mistake. <br> Every GOP Member of Congress ran on limiting the size and scope of government, and bemoaning the ever-increasing national debt and the impact it will have on our children’s economic future must be part of Republican candidate training schools. <br> Our nation must get our fiscal house in order now, or else we may never have another opportunity, and President Trump has provided a pathway to bring our nation back from the brink of insolvency. The GOP Congress should work closely with him to bring their joint visions of our nation’s economic priorities into law. <br> The hard fact is that the past decade’s $10 trillion in deficit spending has produced the worst economic growth as measured by Gross Domestic Product in our nation’s history. You read that right, in the past decade our nation’s economy grew slower than even during the Great Depression. This stagnant, new normal, low-growth economy is leaving millions of working age people behind who have given up even trying to participate, and has led to a malaise where many doubt that the American dream is attainable. <br> The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney described this shift in government spending focus in an on-the-record conference call Monday as, “looking through the lens of the taxpayer.” <br> Border security, including funding the wall on the southern border, and national defense spending are also increased so that our nation can be secure allowing the economy to grow. And the President demonstrates his commitment to veterans by upping dollars to the Department of Veterans Affairs coupled with a renewed commitment to wring out corruption and incompetency from the system. Mulvaney specifically focused on the “taxpayer lens” test when mentioning the President’s commitment to ensure that disabled veterans get the assistance they need. <br> It is imperative that the GOP Congress work with the President using this budget as a guidepost, and together create a coherent spending plan which meets their joint priorities. After that agreement is reached, they should join shields and bring Senate Democrats into the negotiations, making necessary compromises to get Democratic votes without sacrificing GOP spending priorities. <br> The President and OMB Director Mulvaney have crafted a remarkable starting point for this process, and the GOP Congress needs to embrace it and work with them to create a spending plan that restores America’s economic growth and sets the stage for the renewal of hope for millions of Americans who believe that opportunity has been outsourced overseas. 
 Just over one hundred days into a new administration, what are American businesses thinking? What do they need to succeed? What public policies will help them spur greater economic growth? <br> One of the U.S. Chamber’s top priorities is to listen to Main Street businesses—and make sure Washington listens to them as well. In conjunction with our state and local partners, the U.S. Chamber invited hundreds of businesses to share their ideas on how to boost economic growth in a series of meetings across the country. <br> In our discussions with these Main Street businesses, there were five key takeaways: <br> Second, despite their renewed optimism, businesses tell us tax and regulatory burdens impede their growth and success. A business owner in Michigan said: “There will always be regulation, but it doesn’t have to be so burdensome. There will always be taxes, but they don’t have to be so punitive. Give us an opportunity to grow our business and let us be able to reinvest and hire people.” <br> Third, finding qualified workers is the single biggest challenge facing business. We are a nation of people without jobs and jobs without people. Businesses can’t find workers with the proper education and skills to fill openings. This is an anchor on their growth and is undermining our economy. <br> Fourth, businesspeople have a true passion for our free enterprise system. Many argued that they never would have been able to go into business, fail, try again, and succeed beyond their expectations under any other system. And all agreed that free enterprise was not only about helping yourself, but ultimately helping others. <br> Fifth, businesses expect Washington to produce results, and are ready to engage with political leaders to get things done. There was little tolerance for gridlock and gamesmanship. Most businesspeople described themselves as practical, nonpartisan, and solution-oriented—and they expect more of that in the nation’s capital. <br> There was strong and united support among the businesses we talked to for a public policy agenda to spur economic growth. It’s main elements include: enacting regulatory relief and regulatory reform; producing more American energy; making America’s infrastructure the best in the world; reforming our tax, legal, and immigration systems; selling more American goods and services abroad; improving education and training; expanding access to capital, especially to smaller companies; and renewing our country’s culture of innovation. 
 Despite its previous failure in March, House Republicans successfully passed the American Health Care Act Thursday afternoon, a major step toward repealing and replacing ObamaCare. <br> While Republicans have campaigned on this issue for nearly a decade though, Thursday’s replacement bill is as bad if not worse than the bill’s first iteration and even further, it’s DOA in the Senate. <br> The impact of these amendments is more pernicious however. These hasty changes, which show how desperate for legislative victory President Trump truly is, threaten coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions, as well as all patients’ coverage for the critical categories of services defined in ObamaCare’s Essential Health Benefits. <br> In terms of the Upton amendment’s impact, its additional $8 billion in funding over five years for states to create high-risk pools only puts a band-aid on a serious problem. <br> Critics of the AHCA on both sides of the aisle insist that $8 billion is not nearly enough funding to successfully nor adequately cover all patients with preexisting conditions. <br> Although the AHCA could bring a harbinger of problems for Donald Trump, Republicans critically needed to pass some form of legislation promised to their constituents before advancing onto tax reform, infrastructure investment, and other much-needed economic reforms. <br> Considering how exasperating it has been for President Trump, Speaker Ryan, and the Republican Party as a whole to push through their signature legislation promise of repeal-and-replace through, the outlook is grim for any upcoming legislation. <br> Rather than resist the president at every step, the Democrats in the Senate must now proactively find a way to not only minimize the estimated tens of millions of Americans who will lose their health care, but also rescue some vestiges of President Obama’s landmark health bill. 
 GOP members of the House finally climbed aboard the Trump Train. <br> It’s about time. <br> It wasn’t easy, but as Joe Biden might say, “This is a big f—ing deal!” <br> Voters were incredulous that after seven years of railing about the deficiencies of ObamaCare, Republicans didn’t have a shared vision for what should replace it. <br> The inability to muster votes on the first bill exposed long-simmering disputes within the Republican party – disputes barely muted by Trump’s astonishing victory in November. <br> Trump wheedled and cajoled, invited objectors from across the political spectrum in for an Oval Office chat, encouraged compromises and won over recalcitrant members of his own party. This is what we expect from Trump; this is the Art of the Deal. <br> Not only is the vote a win for health care reform; it is also a win for tax reform. The repeal of the taxes that supported the Affordable Care Act will save Americans one trillion dollars over the coming decade. That savings makes further tax cuts much easier to pass, since the reduced rates will be applied to a lower tax base. As the GOP struggles to produce a tax bill resulting in revenue neutrality, that trillion will loom large. <br> Democrats cleverly put the GOP on the defensive early on in this fight, portraying President Obama’s legacy plan as the Holy Grail of health care solutions. Even as it continues to fail across the country. <br> The central failure of ObamaCare is that it does not allow insurers to charge more for customers that will require higher expenditures. Women, for instance, who require higher medical expenditures, pay the same as men under ObamaCare. Also, people with so-called “pre-existing conditions” pay the same as all others. Simply put, this is not insurance, it is welfare. <br> The vote comes before the Congressional Budget Office has had a chance to score it. Democrats will jump on the eventual CBO report, which will most likely project that some people will lose coverage. The GOP bill will be portrayed by Democrats as heartless and mean-spirited. <br> Or how many parts of the country no longer have an insurance exchange available. <br> ObamaCare is simply not working; it is indefensible. <br> Nancy Pelosi has accused Republicans of wanting to destroy health care and take protections away from millions., all the while providing massive tax breaks for plutocrats. <br> That’s what they were elected to do. 
 Now that President Trump has survived his first 100 days, a burning question in Washington is whether House Speaker Paul Ryan will survive the second 100 days. A miracle might be needed. <br> Ryan’s repeated inability to pass anything resembling a repeal of ObamaCare goes beyond simple failure. It’s shaping up as a potential disaster for the Trump presidency and the GOP congressional majority. <br> But Friday’s<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/04/28/still-short-on-support-gop-delays-health-care-vote/" target="_blank">second collapse of the effortsuggests Ryan can’t deliver the GOP’s majority caucus. And if he can’t deliver it to drive a stake in ObamaCare, why should anyone think he can deliver it for tax reform or immigration, both of which will be even more contentious among Republicans? 
 Eight years ago, Charles Krauthammer assessed America’s future and famously wrote, “Decline is a choice. … Decline – or continued ascendancy – is in our hands.” <br> Obama’s presidency was defined by the expansion of government at home and appeasement and retreat abroad. Justly so, President Trump’s mission to correct our course has involved a wholesale rejection of his predecessor’s approach to government and view of the world. <br> Obama pledged to “fundamentally transform” the United States and tried many methods to do so. Changing the dominant judicial philosophy of the Supreme Court would have meant changing the very character of our country, but thanks to a major promise kept, that will not be happening anytime soon. <br> Ironically, the same pen used by Obama to enact much of his agenda is now being wielded by his successor to undo it. With each pillar of the Obama legacy he pulls down, President Trump is effectively unleashing our economy and setting America in a more dynamic direction. <br> The Obama years saw overregulation reach a record high with more than 20,000 new rules that collectively cost our economy more than $100 billion. The Trump years are already promising the opposite. By utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA), the president has signed more bills to repeal more regulations in his first 100 days than any president before him. <br> Once targets of frustrating political obstruction, the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines have now been approved for construction and completion. Once a cornerstone of liberal climate policy, the war on coal is now over. With the abolition of the EPA’s Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United Sates rule, an industry that employs thousands and provides affordable electricity to millions will no longer be strangled by smug federal bureaucrats. <br> Other areas of domestic policy have also been addressed by President Trump’s multitude of executive orders. With each action, he has commanded the federal government to ease burdens on the American people and set the stage for larger projects, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare and pro-growth tax reform. <br> No better snapshot of our rediscovered spine was seen than when Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad once again attacked his own people with chemical weapons. When this line was crossed in 2013, Obama publicly dithered for weeks and ultimately failed to enforce his own threat. This time, President Trump responded decisively within days and sent 59 Tomahawk missiles to destroy the airbase from where the gas attack was launched. <br> Above all, we are an America that respects itself again. <br> Now, we have a president unafraid to use both his inaugural address and a primetime speech to Congress to call our enemy by its name, condemn ISIS as “a network of lawless savages,” and declare it our war’s goal to “extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.” <br> This renewed confidence in our righteousness was felt as we dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb in combat history on an ISIS cave in Afghanistan. It is why our Guantanamo Bay naval base is no longer at risk of being closed for ridiculous symbolic reasons. <br> No president’s agenda has ever or will ever be completed in 100 days or even a year. There is still much work to be done and many promises to be fulfilled. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that our trajectory of weakness has been stopped and reversed. 
 Will Donald Trump be re-elected in 2020? <br> I know this because I follow the betting odds at ElectionBettingOdds.com. <br> But betting odds are usually right. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that if the bettors gave a candidate, say, a 65 percent chance to win, and he lost, bettors were wrong. But remember, 65 percent means bettors also thought there was a 35 percent chance that candidate would lose. <br> Bettors accurately picked Oscar winners, American Idol winners and most important elections. ElectionBettingOdds.com named VP picks Mike Pence and Tim Kaine a week before they were picked. <br> Last week, right before France's election, reporters claimed that the terrorism in France would help elect Marine Le Pen. Saturday, Fox News headlined: Le Pen sees Trump-like boost. <br> The New York Times hyped Jean-Luc Melenchon, France's socialist candidate (of course), claiming he was gaining steam. But betters weren't fooled. They gave Melenchon just a 5 percent chance. <br> I should explain: ElectionBettingOdds.com is a website my TV producer and I created. He takes the odds from legal betting markets, mostly from the biggest and most reliable one, Betfair (based in the U.K.). Our site converts Betfair's complex formulae to percentages that are easy to understand. <br> Actually, you Americans can't make that bet, because restrictive U.S. anti-gambling regulations prevent Betfair from dealing with Americans. <br> They do offer other interesting bets, however: <br> Tax reform fares better: There's a 50 percent chance individual income taxes will be cut. <br> None comes close to Trump in the odds. Pence is in second place, with just a 9 percent chance. Pence probably leads other Republicans because many bettors don't think Trump will complete one term. If Trump quits, Pence would have the incumbent's advantage. Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz are the next Republicans, but both are below 3 percent. <br> Of course, it's early. We should be skeptical of predictions of events four years in advance. But when I want the most accurate possible clues about the future, I turn to ElectionBettingOdds.com. 
 Editor's note:The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and<a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/330105-juan-williams-trumps-100-days-wound-gop" target="_blank">TheHill.com.</i> <br> This Saturday marks President Trump’s 100th day in office. <br> The GOP establishment still holds that view after 100 days of President Trump. <br> Trump’s most striking achievement in his first three months is being the least popular new president in modern history. <br> Even Trump’s supporters have to admit these first three months have been defined by the administration’s failure to deliver on campaign promises. <br> No repeal of ObamaCare. No tax reform. No Muslim travel ban — in the sense that the attempt to enact one is bogged down in the courts — and no evidence to support the incredible claim that President Obama had Trump wiretapped. <br> And in the last few weeks, the reversals on campaign promises have come thick and fast. <br> Senate Majority Leader<a href="http://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell(R-Ky.) put all the flip-flops in delicate terms so as not to offend the Trump faithful: <br> Trump’s singular success was getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court. <br> Now, let’s look ahead to Trump’s next 100 days. <br> He has proven to be a weight on Republican congressional candidates in two special elections in Kansas and Georgia. <br> That ballot question was simply, “If the election were held today, would you vote for the Republican or the Democratic candidate?” Enten’s average of the polls has the Republicans down by six points. <br> That gives Republicans every reason to start distancing themselves from the Trump White House. Democrats are already standing far away. <br> After a two-week Easter recess, Congress returns to work tomorrow with just four days left until funding for current government operations is set to expire on April 29. <br> “We’ll be talking to Senate Democrats,” McConnell said before Easter. “They will be relevant to the process. It will require 60 votes. I’m confident that Senate Democrats are not going to want to shut down the government.” <br> But Democrats know that Trump’s plans for future budgets anger their base. So why would they help him? <br> Trump recently said he remains focused on health reform and is threatening to withhold subsidies to insurance companies to force Democrats to help him pass a bill to replace ObamaCare. <br> If you are a Democrat who enjoyed the disastrous GOP civil war over their health care bill, then you are going to love the upcoming GOP slugfest over spending and taxes. If past is prologue then Trump will be frustrated, and fail to get his tax and spending plans passed by the splintered GOP Congress. 
 I’m a Hillary Clinton fangirl and I feel no shame. <br> Does that mean I don’t see her faults? Of course not. <br> I could go on and I could certainly also discuss the bizarre twists that undoubtedly hurt Clinton on November 8th. They include, but are not limited to, the role of FBI Director James Comey, Russian interference, Anthony Weiner’s sexting scandal, an overblown server scandal and viral rightwing media (I’m looking at you “performance artist” Alex Jones) that spread lies and disinformation about Clinton. <br> Soon President Donald Trump will have been in office for 100 days and with very little to show for it. <br> The American Health Care Act crashed and burned in spectacular fashion. Majority of the blame rests on Paul Ryan’s shoulders as he let his ego get ahead of good policy, public sentiment and the numbers. What good is a Speaker who can’t deliver his caucus? President Trump learned the hard way that there are actually principled conservatives (shocked this Democrat, too!) <br> And while we’re on the subject, there is no wall. <br> I do wish he would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That is what we have the White House for, GOP Senator Joni Ernst commented. We would love to see more of those State Department visits in Washington D.C. I have not spoken to him about the Florida issue yet, but that is something I think has been bothering not just me, but I think other members of our caucus.” That’s right, the guy who criticized President Obama for nonstop golfing can’t stop golfing – on our dime. His party is noticing. <br> Then there’s the flip flopping. On NATO, on the Fed, on intervention, on Chinese currency manipulation. And that was just one day! <br> Moreover, I’ll spare you a diatribe on rolling back worker and environmental protections – you know what I’m thinking. <br> So candidate Trump sold America a bad bill of goods and they bought it. Now we’re getting a bad bill of goods from President Trump. Clinton surely had something to do with that and we’ll continue re-hashing how it all went so wrong until the end of time (or at least the next four years). <br> I remember her message every time President Trump does something that makes my jaw hit the floor. It’s going to take us all working together. That starts with the occupant of the highest office in the world and trickles down to each and every one of us. 
 Justice Clarence Thomas made headlines last month when he criticized civil forfeiture, a notorious police practice that allows law enforcement to confiscate property, even from people who have never been charged with a crime. “This system,” he wrote, “has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses.” <br> To prevent future abuses, I, along with Rep. Tim Walberg, reintroduced the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act (FAIR Act) in March. The FAIR Act would dramatically reform federal civil-forfeiture laws to respect the American people’s Fifth Amendment rights while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds from crime. <br> Worst of all, Congress created powerful financial incentives to pursue civil-forfeiture cases. <br> According to a report by the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm, the Justice Department’s Assets Forfeiture Fund skyrocketed from just under $94 million to more than $4.5 billion between 1986 and 2014. <br> In a bombshell report released last week, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the Justice Department has funneled more than $6 billion in equitable-sharing funds to local and state agencies since 2000. Several law enforcement officials even told the OIG that the “primary reason” they turn to equitable sharing is because “their states’ forfeiture laws restrict law enforcement’s use of forfeiture.” <br> Russ Caswell knows this all too well. Russ owned a motel in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, which had been run by the Caswell family since 1955. But his small business, which he owned free and clear and was valued at $1.5 million, became a tempting target for equitable sharing. <br> The reason? Prosecutors identified 15 “drug-related incidents” that occurred out of 196,000 rented rooms. <br> Thankfully, after the Institute for Justice took on his case pro bono, Russ won in federal court and could finally sell his motel and retire. <br> Stories like these are why the FAIR Act is so critical. First and foremost, the FAIR Act would abolish equitable sharing and redirect all forfeiture proceeds to the Treasury’s General Fund. Both reforms would end the perverse incentives that encourage police to pursue cash over criminals. <br> The FAIR Act is bipartisan, bicameral legislation that has brought together a diverse coalition. The ACLU, Americans for Tax Reform, Campaign for Liberty, Drug Policy Alliance, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action, Institute for Justice, NACDL, and NFIB — organizations from all across the ideological spectrum — have endorsed the FAIR Act. <br> For far too long, civil forfeiture has ruined the lives of tens of thousands of Americans who have done nothing wrong. 
 Thanks to the beneficence of the federal government (and the calendar), we Americans have until midnight on April 18 to file our income taxes. It’s too bad filing taxes wasn’t an easier process. <br> Does anyone believe this tax code language is something we should maintain? “Enter 6 percent of the smaller of line 40 or the value of your Archer MSAs on December 31, 2015, including 2015 contributions made in 2016. Include this amount on Form 1040, line 58A or Form 1040NR, line 56B.” This little gem is in T.R. Reid’s book “A Fine Mess,” a work about our tax system that should raise the ire of any taxpayer not already irate. <br> The federal government collected record amounts of individual income taxes and payroll taxes through the first six months of fiscal 2017, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement published by CNS News. <br> “The federal government also collected $547,491,000,000 in Social Security and other payroll taxes during the first six months of fiscal 2017. That is about $2,731,820,000 more than the $544,491,000,000 in Social Security and other payroll taxes (in constant 2017 dollars) that the government collected in the first six months of fiscal 2016.” <br> As Ronald Reagan said, the reason we have a deficit (and a debt approaching $20 trillion) “is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is that government spends too much.” <br> “And I said, Michael, how do you do your taxes? They’re due tomorrow. He says, well, I pop a beer. I go online and see if the government’s got the numbers right. And if they do, I hit a button. Takes five minutes. He says, but you know, sometimes I start checking the numbers. (If) you start checking the numbers, it could take almost half an hour just to pay your taxes. He was outraged.” 
 Mr. President, <br> If you follow Congress’ lead on tax cuts, your economic agenda is on the road to destruction. The base, which is already treated like a perpetual headache by GOP leadership, will not tolerate this Congress blowing it again on a major election promise. <br> But it will be up to you to take the lead. Strong and effective leadership is precisely what is called for right now. <br> Keeping this pledge of tax cuts to the American people is critical. Individuals and families need the relief and the economy needs the boost. But the GOP leadership’s disastrous handling of the health care bill should lower all expectations that this Congress is capable of carry tax cuts across the finish line.&nbsp; <br> The embarrassing Republican plan kept the worst parts of ObamaCare and did little to address those who are currently being hurt by astronomical premiums due to the Democrats radical restructuring of American healthcare. <br> Believe us when we tell you: it was like pulling teeth getting this Congress to do anything the grassroots elected them to do, even when leadership made sure that no matter what they did, it wouldn’t matter. <br> Speaker Ryan and his colleagues are now kicking the tax reform can down the road to God only knows when and with who knows what type of bill. <br> Right now Congress is embarking on recess having accomplished practically nothing for your agenda. It is now up to you President Trump to steer the ship. <br> Together, you and the American people put pressure on Congress<i>to get your agenda back on track. 
 Conservatives wonder: what the heck is Gary Cohn doing in the Trump White House? Cohn, a life-long Democrat and latecomer to the Trump train, is White House Economic Council Director. The former president of Goldman Sachs is reportedly ascendant, while Steve Bannon, Peter Navarro and Stephen Miller see their stars fading. This is not good news for Trump supporters, or for the GOP. <br> His backers didn’t care that Trump knew little about policy or Washington; he was in a sense an empty vessel when it came to translating common sense ideas into legislation and regulations. Now, though, they see that vessel being filled in part by individuals who do not share their views. One of those is Gary Cohn, who has emerged as a powerful but discordant voice. <br> When Gary Cohn recently lofted the possibility of bringing back Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that allowed big banks to engage in investment banking, Senator Elizabeth Warren was reportedly giddy with joy. The law, which was repealed by Bill Clinton in 1999, is viewed by progressives as having helped cause the financial crisis. Leaving a meeting in which Cohn mused about reinstating the bill, Warren reportedly said to an aide, “Has the whole world gone mad? Am I on the same page as a former Goldman executive? My entire worldview has been shattered.” <br> It is worth noting that while reinstituting Glass-Steagall would be problematic for all the leading financial institutions, it would hurt Goldman much less that the big banks who are its major competitors. <br> Cohn is also reportedly a free-trade advocate, and has appointed Andrew Quinn to the Economic Council as Special Assistant to the President for International Trade. Quinn was one of the lead negotiators of the multi-national TPP trade pact that Trump savaged on the campaign trail and has since junked. How will Quinn work to revise our trade commitments and revise NAFTA? <br> It is also true that there are other sound voices on economic policy within the administration. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is nobody’s fool, and will support an aggressive U.S. trade posture. Though conservatives have reservations about Steve Mnuchin, they applaud some of his picks, like economist David Malpass for international affairs and Drew Maloney for legislative. Mnuchin’s choice of major Hillary fundraiser Craig Phillips to oversee financial regulation, is less popular. <br> It is early days, but ongoing power struggles could well determine the success of the Trump presidency. He needs to remember who put him in office, and who he will rely on to keep him there. It wasn’t Manhattan elites or Democrats, it was people who are counting on him to cut taxes, bring back jobs, dismantle our stifling red tape, and rein in illegal immigration. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed Trump losing ground with exactly the people who elected him – Republicans, white voters and men. And guess what, he isn’t making up for those losses with newly affectionate Democrats. 
 Lost in the alt-left's extreme and ruthless opposition to President Trump is the fact that he's been very busy keeping his promises and checking off items on his agenda, one by one. <br> “Over the past two months, the American people have gotten to know, respect and truly admire our newest member of the United States Supreme Court,” he said. “In Justice Gorsuch, they see a man of great and unquestioned integrity. They see a man of unmatched qualifications. And most of all, and most importantly, they see a man who is deeply faithful to the Constitution of the United States.” <br> President Trump is busy bringing back jobs, making phone calls to the CEOs of companies day and night. He's gutting Obama-era regulations, and the president has said he could eliminate up to 75 percent of government rules and regulations. The war on coal is over and the red tape from the Obama administration is gone. <br> President Trump has drafted a plan to defeat ISIS. His administration has sanctioned Iran over its missile program and put the rogue regime on notice. Our commander-in-chief responded to Syria's use of chemical weapons by approving a Tomahawk missile strike. <br> While the president is enacting his agenda every day, there's still plenty of work do. Failing to repeal and replace ObamaCare was a big misstep.Republicans need to learn from that mistake and build consensus before introducing such an important bill. And while the health care bill is not dead, Republicans are moving ahead on a massive tax reform plan. <br> While President Trump works to advance his agenda, the alt-left, propaganda, destroy-Trump media, breathlessly reports on infighting in the White House. Who knows whether or not the press has blown this out of proportion, like everything they cover. But the reality is that it's irrelevant. Whomever President Trump wants around him is his business. If you work for the president, your job is to put his agenda in place, serve him and serve the country. 
 Let’s be honest: our organizations didn’t see eye-to-eye on the best way to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The National Taxpayers Union supported the House Republican bill and FreedomWorks opposed it. <br> We simply cannot afford to squander this once-in-a-generation opportunity to pass fundamental tax reform. <br> Our tax code is an absolute mess. Americans spend nearly7 billionhours annually on tax compliance. This wasted time, when combined with out-of-pocket costs, amounts to an economic loss of$261.2billion each year. But it’s not just complexity that’s problematic. Our current tax structure imposes excessively high rates on individuals and small businesses. This takes far too big a bite out of family budgets and limits the economic potential of entrepreneurs. <br> While the path forward on reform remains unclear, it’s extremely helpful to have a workable blueprint in place: the Better Way plan authored by Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady. The blueprint is not perfect, but it does a great job of setting the table for reform. On the individual side, it broadens the tax base by eliminating many “loopholes,” lowers and consolidates tax rates, and expands the standard deduction. <br> These proposed changes to the tax code, most of which conservatives and libertarians have long desired, promote economic growth and opportunity for all Americans. The American worker hasn’t seen a pay raise in 15 years. We’re confident that this overhaul and simplification of the tax code would put more money in the pockets of Americans. <br> As the process moves forward, the House plan will hopefully be refined and improved through public input and the legislative process, but there’s no doubt it represents a dramatic improvement over the status quo. It’s a great starting point and FreedomWorks and National Taxpayers Union are excited about working cooperatively to advance the discussion. 
 Three cheers for Nigel Farage! <br> Farage, who is a Fox News contributor, told shocked and angry members of parliament from the rest of the continent that he is glad his country has decided to leave the European Union. That’s what happened last week when Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50, formally embracing the results of last year’s shockwave vote for a “Brexit.” <br> The comparison to a criminal organization earned Farage a stiff reproach from the Italian occupying the president’s chair in the chamber, but what does he care? He was speaking for the millions of Britons who have expressed their disdain with being dictated to by an entity that has little regard for the unique history of Great Britain. <br> Farage was an early supporter of pulling out of Europe. For too long, he argued, the country has ceded decisions to the European Union in Brussels. It had lost control of its ability to control its borders. And it was losing its identity as a proudly independent island nation with a rich history of economic freedom and self- government. 
 President Reagan left us with many useful lessons in his 1989 farewell address. <br> But today, a different passage from his speech caused me to rethink the current approach to tax reform. <br> Reading this, I was struck with a single thought: If eight years from now, President Trump can point to 19 million (or more) new jobs, Americans – and others around the world – will regard his presidency as a success. <br> So, for the Trump administration, Republicans should stop saying we want to reform the tax system. Reforming will not create jobs on its own. We want to cut taxes and reform the system. <br> But there are six more steps lawmakers can take to create space for tax cuts that will drive job creation. <br> Consider the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which jumped to 125.6 points this month – the highest confidence has been 17 years. The Conference Board CEO Business Conditions Survey increased from 17 points last quarter to 60 points this quarter. The CEO Short Term Forecast hiked from 25 points to 60 points, while General CEO Confidence jumped from 50 points to 65 points. <br> Second, unused federal assets should be leased or sold. This will generate non-tax revenue which could offset the cost of some of the tax cuts. Aggressive leasing of oil, gas and mineral rights combined with selling federal housing and office stock currently being mismanaged could generate billions to support tax cuts. <br> Fourth, creating pro-American trade policies will clearly have positive impact on growth. This growth might not be huge statistically, but even an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent can yield billions over a decade that could be leveraged for tax cuts. <br> Sixth, we should have a bias for pro-growth tax reforms that have compounding, revenue generating effects. Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal for a border transfer tax will increase American manufacturing jobs. It will also generate revenue paid for by foreign importers. Because we are still the world's largest economy, the Ryan border transfer tax will incentivize foreign manufacturers to open factories in America. The result will be even more economic growth and future government revenue to pay for tax cuts. 
 The knives are out for Paul Ryan. To survive, the House Speaker must produce a win on tax reform. That will not be easybecause the obstructionist Freedom Caucus could once again join Democrats to defeat this next major White House initiative. While Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will bleat about handouts to billionaires, the intransigents on the right could well object to the “new” border adjustment tax. &nbsp; <br> Still, the failure of the AHCA – at least in its first round at bat -- has put Ryan on the hot seat. The Freedom Caucus blames him for the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, and for embracing the now mainstream position that the country expects all citizens to have access to healthcare. Like John Boehner before him, House Speaker Ryan has failed the litmus tests of the far right; they want him gone. <br> Ryan’s American Healthcare Act of 2017 would have accomplished much<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gop-entitlement-caucus-1490653793" target="_blank">that conservatives wanted.Through its dismantling of the fees and taxes which funded Obamacare, it effectively dismantled the law itself. In addition, the bill would have for the first time thrown a lasso around Medicaid, starting to rein in the third-largest federal program, which has tripled in size since 2000. <br /> 
 It is hard to overestimate the damage the Freedom Caucus has done to the fledgling presidency of Donald Trump, and to the country. By blocking the American Health Care Act of 2017, the conservative group has guaranteed that Americans will struggle forward under the burden of Obamacare. In the next few months insurers will announce their premium hikes for the coming year; chances are, given the continuing withdrawal of major companies from the marketplaces and the ongoing failure of the bill to attract enough young and healthy participants, the new rates will not be pretty. Last year premiums went up 25%; it’s likely the increases will be higher this year. <br> Now the Republican Party inherits the Sisyphean task of managing Obamacare’s inevitable decline. They are no longer critics; they are now the producers of the show. It is unlikely that House Speaker Paul Ryan or Trump will have the political will and patience to return to the drawing board and attempt to craft a brand new bill. They have made other commitments to voters, and so Obamacare, as a defeated Paul Ryan admitted after withdrawing the AHCA, is the law of the land. Live with it. <br> It is the young Trump presidency, however, that takes the biggest hit here. Trump was elected because people across the political spectrum thought he could fix some of our problems. He was the businessman who could import common sense to Washington, and the deal maker who could bring people together. He made big promises; a country tired of stalemate and disappointment believed that he could bring back jobs, reduce our debt, build the wall, find a better healthcare solution. <br> Who is to blame? House Speaker Paul Ryan will be dragged through the mud for failing to win enough votes. He will also be criticized for concocting an arguably complicated and overly cerebral approach to the mission at hand. The AHCA was only part of the solution; Ryan vowed to press forward with more changes – like allowing insurers to compete across state lines, expanded health savings accounts and Medicaid reforms – in future legislation. It was a complex three-step approach; framing a sales pitch was all but impossible. <br> Nancy Pelosi mocked Trump for bringing the bill to the floor before he had the votes; that won’t sit well with a president who likes winning. So far, he is blaming Democrats, but he will doubtless find others – including perhaps the Speaker – to chastise for the loss. That will be unfortunate. As an outsider, President Trump has to rely on some seasoned hands to move bills through Congress; notwithstanding this recent defeat, Vice President Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan are an excellent and necessary team. Relying on executive orders, as Obama did, produces unsustainable measures easily overturned by the courts. <br> Caucus leader Mark Meadows, who hails from western North Carolina, may find himself under scrutiny. People may wonder why the American Society of Anesthesiologists was one of the top five funders of Meadows’ campaignand why health professionals were among the top five industries donating to his reelection in 2016. Medical groups typically like Obamacare, which provides healthcare services to an expanded population. Did they count on Meadows undermining Obamacare repeal? Did they know that thanks to his efforts, Obamacare would carry on? <br> And Meadows may not be alone. The National Republican Congressional Committee has been hauling in record amountsof money these past few months – money that can go to fielding candidates that support the White House. The Chair of the NRCC is Ohio’s Steve Stivers, who was a yes vote for the AHCA. His predecessor at the NRCC was Oregon Representative Greg Walden, who campaignedall-out for the AHCA. It’ unlikely either Stivers or Walden will champion the reelection of Meadows or his colleagues. 
 This is the truth: the Freedom Caucus has breathed new life into the demolished Democratic Party. <br> For eight years Democrats have accused Republicans of being the “Party of No”, only capable of obstruction and posturing but not of governing. In defeating the efforts of Paul Ryan, Mike Pence, Tom Price and Donald Trump to dump ObamaCare and replace it with a slimmed-down, more intelligent and flexible program, they have given Democrats incalculable ammunition to make that case. <br> Now that they actually have a chance to <b>do </i>something meaningful – repeal the taxes and fees that are the undercarriage of the Affordable Care Act – they can’t make it to the finish line. <br> Number One: Conservatives are not in the majority in the United States. If they were, Evan McMullin would be president. <br> Number Three: Crafting a compromise health care bill that will safeguard popular provisions that President Trump vowed to keep, like protections for those with preexisting conditions or the ability to keep children up to the age of 26 on their parent’s insurance, is not easy. <br> The Senate, too, will have a chance to weigh in. <br> The Freedom Caucus and others opposing the ACA must accept that the push for this bill is bigger than their principles and it is bigger than health care. <br> The United States has entered a danger zone, where trust in our political leaders and our institutions has plummeted. The only way out is for President Trump to follow through on the promises he made to voters, promises which will put the country back on track. <br> Since other measures, and most especially tax reform, are backed up behind the ACA, it is quite possible that the reckless behavior of the Freedom Caucus will derail the Trump train. <br> They are hopeful that Obama’s progressive agenda will be swept aside, allowing the country to return to policies buttressed by common sense and a common purpose. That agenda hangs by a thread. <br> That said, they are not the voice of the nation or even of the Republican Party; what they want is unrealistic. It is not politically possible to repeal ObamaCare and not put something in its place. Imagine the confusion and anxiety; real people will suffer, and for what? Only 20 percent of the country wants ObamaCare repealed, according to a recent poll. This is not a popular position. <br> The Freedom Caucus needs to get on board – now. 
 Just one year ago, as Donald Trump’s Republican primary opponents were uniformly dropping out of the 2016 Presidential race, many long-time party members feared their party’s presumptive nominee would be unable to unite the party by Election Day. <br> Today, however, the Republican postponement of the American Health Care Act signals not only that Trump is still unable to unite his party, but that his ability to lead and deliver on his many promises is in serious jeopardy. <br> As a result of this log-jam, the favorable economic data and stock market rallies Trump has frequently cited as early successes may very well screech to a halt too. <br> Stemming from both the White House and Congressional Republicans, unfounded accusations of surveillance and perpetuating controversy around the President’s ties to Russia does absolutely nothing to deliver reforms to hard-working Americans whose quality of life is at risk in our broken healthcare system. <br> The postponement on healthcare in particular comes after multiple weeks in which seemingly the only thing the Republican Conference could make clear to the public was that they could not agree on anything. <br> Yet today’s developments underscore that Trump has been unable to build broad support for a national reforms agenda that delivers on his, or any Republicans’ for that matter, important promises to their voters. <br> If as many as 14 million people will conceivably no have health coverage one year from today, and if the healthcare exchanges are going to fall apart, then the Republicans clearly have not put forward a serious plan to fix healthcare in this country. <br> If the Republicans can find opportunities to truly, forge compromise, and actually get something accomplished, they can quickly get back on track with Trump’s pro-growth agenda. 
 The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com. <br> Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House Democratic leader, reduces the many problems with the GOP health care plan to this: “They have no idea how to explain stealing $600 billion from working families’ health care to give more tax breaks to the richest people in our country.” <br> Once again, the most important tweet last week in conservative politics did not come from President @realDonaldTrump. It came from Matt Drudge, the proprietor of the Drudge Report. <br> Drudge is looking ahead on the political horizon and seeing that ObamaCare replacement and tax reform can’t be separated. Without a health care plan that cuts federal spending, there is no chance for tax reform. <br> “And for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do health care before we do the tax cut,” he explained. <br> “It makes tax reform a lot harder, it makes it more difficult…” without a new, low-cost health care plan, Ryan noted. <br> But now with the GOP majority’s mash-up of an effort to replace ObamaCare, the tax reform plan looks like it is headed for the graveyard. The only hope for the GOP is to demand party loyalty to the ObamaCare replacement plan in the service of reviving the tax cuts. Ryan and Trump are twisting arms by telling GOP lawmakers that if they don’t pass tax reform, angry Republican voters will punish them in the 2018 midterms. <br> Voters have noticed. A Fox News poll showed 54 percent disapproval of the Republican plan. About two-thirds of those who dislike the proposal say their complaint is about “too many changes to ObamaCare.” <br> Even with that SOS call, the speaker’s problem is that the Tea Party’s Freedom Caucus wants more cuts to ObamaCare programs for seniors and the poor. That kind of fix will not arrest the decline in public support. <br> The biggest problem the Republicans face is the so-called “border adjustment tax.” Big manufacturers like Boeing support it, while big retailers like Walmart oppose it. <br> Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, raised the bar even higher when he told CNBC recently that any tax cut plan will be “deficit neutral over a 10-year period.” <br> “The fight over a border-adjustment tax isn’t the only challenge for Republicans in their push for tax reform,” The Hill reported last week. “Notably, some business groups have criticized the proposal to do away with the deduction for businesses’ net interest expenses.” <br> It’s not like Trump and Republicans lack political cover to go bold on taxes. The problem is that the congressional GOP is unable to reach consensus within its ranks on even its most basic principles. <br> In their talking points, congressional Republicans like to remind people that the nation has not seen comprehensive tax reform since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan worked with a Democratic speaker, Tip O’Neill. <br> When it comes to a health care plan and tax reform, the GOP might as well echo the famous words of the comic-strip character Pogo: “We have met the enemy and he is us.” 
 Back in the 1980s, syndicated TV journalist Geraldo Rivera appeared live on TV to open a secret vault in a Chicago hotel that had once belonged to mobster Al Cabone. <br> But at least he didn’t know what would be inside when he hyped the story. <br> As Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post concluded the result was a “nothing burger.” <br> The return showed that Trump had paid $38 million in federal income tax off a $150 million income that year. While Trump has frequently boasted that “I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.” But the Alternative Minimum Tax, which works to make it hard for multimillionaires to evade all federal income taxes apparently worked in Trump’s case. <br> The White House noted that “it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns” and said the president will continue to pursue “tax reform that will benefit all Americans.” &nbsp; <br> Regardless of the source, Trump’s adversaires and the media will continue to obsess about the tax returns. David Brock, a longtime court jester in the camp of Hillary Clinton, is offering a $5 million reward to anyone who hands over President Trump's complete and legally obtained tax returns. That’s bait and switch. If someone sent him the tax returns, Brock would cheerfully publish them and point out he didn’t have to pay the money beccause there’s no way an outside party can “legally” reveal tax returns. <br> It was outrageous that Trump would often promise to release the returns, and then spuriously claim he couldn’t release even returns from two decades ago because his current returns were under audit. <br> I strenously argued that Trump would sink his chances of beating Hillary Clinton by becoming the first major presidenital nominee since Nixon not to release his returns. <br> But it’s time for the media to ponder cutting their losses, and moving on to other and fresher problems with the Trump presidency -- like his continued failure to fill sub-Cabinet positions that are key to allowing his govenrment to function. 
 The modern Democratic Party is hoping you care more about Trump’s tax returns than your own. <br> “Trump’s tax returns.” Maybe if they say it three times while walking backwards around a cemetery drinking goat blood the world will be restored on its axis. <br> One notes that polling has consistently showed that the vast majority of Americans believe no American now matter how rich should pay more than 25 percent of their income in total taxes.The 25 percent tax paid by Trump was his federal tax alone. Doesn’t count property taxes, sales taxes, state and local taxes. <br> This brings us to the real story of 2016: Trump ran promising to reduce the tax burden on Americans and American businesses that create jobs. <br> Next, Trump will move to comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform. Individualrates will move from seven different rates to three rates: 33%, 25% and 12%.The Death Tax will be repealed.Business taxes will fall from 35 percent to 20 percent or lower -- closer to the worldwide average -- making America more competitive. And job-creating investment will be immediately expensed -- which reduces the cost of new investment and will turbo charge growth. 
 Repealing and replacing ObamaCare and implementing President Trump’s plan to build $1 trillion-worth of infrastructure are massively important for the president’s bold vision to make America great again, but the key to President Trump's success is tax reform. <br> President Trump acknowledged this to congressional leaders in a meeting yesterday. <br> The Republican repeal effort to reform health care will likely result in a bitter partisan fight. Probably no Democrat will vote to repeal ObamaCare. <br> We will need positive reforms in other areas that will bring some Democrats into a bipartisan coalition. <br> After the president’s address to the Joint Session of Congress last week, I predicted his massive infrastructure plan will win over about a third of the Democrats. However, it will face scrutiny from Republicans concerned about finding ways to pay for it – even though I’m confident President Trump will negotiate a much lower price tag, develop public private partnerships, and reduce costs by eliminating reams of burdensome rules from the Code of Federal Regulations. <br> The first major step Congress should take is to reform the tax system so companies are incentivized to invest and build factories in the United States and create good-paying jobs. <br> I recently spoke with a group of about 30 major American investors, and they expressed tremendous support for a border adjustment tax. Under our current tax system, it makes more sense for companies to move manufacturing jobs out of the United States, produce products in lower-wage countries, and then export their goods back to the U.S., because we do not impose corporate tax on imports. <br> With a border adjustment tax, we would tax imports – just like more than 160 other countries that have either a value-added tax on imports, a border adjustment tax, or both. <br> Reducing taxes on businesses and individuals, and reducing regulations, will cause more companies to invest in America again. The Tax Foundation reports that Speaker Ryan’s plan will create about 1.7 million jobs in America, and increase Gross Domestic Product by more than 9 percent. 
 President Obama and Democrats in Congress appear willing to use every legal (and maybe some illegal) tools available to undermine the Trump White House. Illegal leaks, misleading news stories, demonstrations, bureaucratic meddling, and Congressional obstruction have morphed into the Left’s partisan playbook, intentionally slow walking those trying to move forward on the Trump agenda. <br> Here’s why. The best response to the coordinated attacks on the Trump presidency is to repeal and replace ObamaCare, enact tax reform, confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and roll back Obama’s damaging environmental legacy. <br> There are 115 week days from now until Congress decamps on July 31. For fully 22 of those days, Congress is scheduled to be in recess. With Democrats assembling a full-out campaign of obstruction and delay, that is way too many days off. <br> A recent piece from BuzzFeed chronicles the build-up of a so-called Democratic “war room” aimed at slow-walking everything GOP. <br> That’s not all. The group is also working to fuel the ongoing brouhaha over connections between Trump supporters and Russia, gin up protests that greet Congressional Republicans on their visits home, offer Democrats strategies for undermining GOP policy initiatives and generally “expand indefinitely” their efforts to oppose Trump. The group is rapidly adding staff, which has swelled to 340 operatives. <br> Democrats think this is a winning strategy, but polling shows that’s not true. Almost two-thirds of likely voters in a recent survey said they thought it would be good for the country if Democrats worked with Trump. The same number thought the obstruction wasn’t even good for Democrats. Americans know we have serious challenges that have not been addressed over the past eight years. Everyone talks about infrastructure; it’s high time we did something about it. All parties know we need to revamp our dysfunctional tax system and over-regulated state. Trump wants to address those issues, if only Democrats will play ball. <br> Worse, there are some 552 executive positions to be filled. Only 18 have so far been confirmed, while an additional 17 have been nominated. The New York Times chides the Trump White House for failing to fill the queue, but it’s pretty tough to roll out a well-coordinated hiring process when your top folks aren’t yet in place. Also, given the scrutiny that activists will give every nominee, the process is more gummed up than usual, with even those ready to fill less important positions requiring what President Trump might call “extreme vetting.” <br> Republicans cannot afford to lose the confidence of their backers. Cancelling vacations would help. It would also deny liberal activists the opportunity to stage demonstrations as the members of Congress return home to host town hall gatherings. These rallies make for great TV and help Democrats portray the nation as not happy with Trump’s policies. Polling suggests otherwise, and indicates the GOP needs to push ahead. 
 President Trump says he wants to “drain the swamp.” His strategist Stephen Bannon calls for “deconstructing the administrative state.” They face fierce opposition. But their biggest obstacle may end up being of their own making. There are nearly 2,000 political vacancies within the Trump administration, most of which did not require Senate confirmation, according to the tracking service Leadership Directories. <br> The White House won’t respond to inquiries about its Presidential Personnel Office, and there may be a good reason. It is headed by John DeStefano, who served as former House Speaker John Boehner’s political director and senior adviser. At age 38 his only major personnel experience has been advising newly elected 2010 Tea Party members on who to hire. <br> The bottleneck inside the Trump White House has gotten so bad that some jobs such as who should serve as general counsels in agencies are being effectively handled by the White House Counsel’s office. <br> While admirable on some level, in practice such a stance amounts to being penny wise and pound foolish. The Washington Examiner reports that “the White House has not submitted any names to fill the 10 jobs below Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin that will require confirmation. There’s no way President Trump can fulfill his promise to improve veterans’ health care without those officials. <br> “I wish I had more of my staff on board,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions plaintively said Thursday, as he recused himself from the Russia probe. <br> As Kori Schake, a research fellow in government management at the conservative Hoover Institution, told the Washington Post: “The president risks looking like he appointed an admirable Cabinet he intends to make ineffective by denying them staff.” <br> I don't know yet, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, told the Associated Press on Wednesday when asked about Perdue's paperwork. I wish to hell I did. We need a champion for agriculture, we need him on board. <br> “Personnel are policy, and if you don’t have key personnel and enough of them the home team of Washington bureaucrats will wear you down and win every time,” a key Trump appointee awaiting confirmation told me. <br> “If something is broken, you fix it,” Donald Trump frequently said on the campaign trail. 
 Tuesday night, with his speech before a joint session of Congress, President Trump raised the stakes, making obstructionist Democrats look foolish at best – at worst, unpatriotic. <br> Like schoolyard bullies, they have called the president names and insulted his family. They have ridiculed his policies and platform, and worked to undermine his legitimacy. <br> Democrats have dug deep trenches of petty defiance, even as polls show that such moves are unpopular with voters. A poll by Harvard-Harris ten days ago showed that 73 percent of Americans want Democrats to work with Trump. <br> Is Chuck Schumer listening? Is Nancy Pelosi or Tom Perez, the new head of the DNC? Not on your life. <br> The hypocrisy of their stance is breathtaking. After eight years of preaching the costs of GOP obstructionism, they now embrace even more absolute resistance. Even on policies they presumably embrace, such as spending on infrastructure, they have cut themselves adrift. <br> In 2016 Union workers swung to Trump in greater numbers than for any Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan; they will stick with him if they see him jawboning corporate CEOs to bring jobs home and promulgating tax policy intended to boost U.S. production. They applauded him walking away from the TPP, and believe he’ll lead the fight for fairer trade pacts. They like that he puts America first. <br> President Obama talked in eloquent and grandiose terms about Hope and Change, but neither generated the former nor produced the latter. <br> Bloomberg reported just a day ago that consumer confidence leaped “unexpectedly” in February to the highest level since 2001, a 15-year high. Unexpectedly to Bloomberg maybe, but not to Trump supporters, who see him following through on his campaign promises and walking away from the boneheaded progressive agenda of President Obama. Very few people seem to think that the federal government’s highest priority should be dictating which restrooms transgender children should occupy. <br> It also reminded Republicans in Congress that Trump is a power to be reckoned with. He wants to carry through on his promises of tax reform and ObamaCare replacement. If Congress dithers, and tries to score political points by resisting these measures, they will suffer for it in 2018. The country wants action, and has given the GOP all the tools necessary to comply. <br> Trump cannot be laughed off; he isn’t going to disappear, as some loons on the Left have predicted. 
 In Tuesday night’s address to a joint session of Congress, President Trump appealed to our best. To our heroes. To our self-sacrificing warriors and police. To our innovators who cure diseases and create amazing technologies. To our love for our nation, our children and each other. He ended by reminding us that we bleed the same blood, salute the same flag and are made by the same God. <br> He set the course to fulfill his campaign promises, and he presented them in a way that sounded reasonable and worthy of bipartisan support. <br> He challenged our nation to shift paradigms, much as he does in the book. After starting strong by condemning hate crimes, he discussed the scourge of addiction, promising to block the flow of illegal drugs while helping those fighting addictions. He spoke of increased investment in our military and infrastructure. <br> He offered a new immigration system similar to what Australia and Canada have in place today. This important shift is vital to the consumer technology industry – a vibrant sector of our economy that supports more than 15 million American jobs and relies on high-skilled immigrants to compete globally. <br> He recognized the value of both private and public money to fund these projects. His plan to reduce the corporate tax rate is welcomed by the business community, but his reforms should avoid a border adjustment tax – a regressive measure which will harm working class and low-income Americans—the very groups Trump seeks to aid and champion the most. <br> As Trump continues to develop his ambitious trade agenda, he must consider issues critical to our globally dominant technology industry – such as removing barriers to trade – to ensure that the U.S. remains competitive. <br> However, the devil is in the details. Although he criticized his predecessor for doubling the debt, he presented many expensive proposals without explaining how they would be funded. His only mention of costs restated the obvious: Drug companies are overcharging Americans. In the weeks to come, we need him to expand his vision to include a plan for tax reform that doesn’t punish success and instead promotes growth. <br> His recognition of U.S. Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owen’s sacrifice, and the heartfelt response of his widow, Carryn, was the emotional highlight of Tuesday’s speech. 
 Maybe I have baseball on the brain, but when I watch President Trump what I’ve seen to date is one fastball after another. <br> This was one of several unresolved questions going into Tuesday night’s joint address to Congress: could Trump deviate from the rhetorical heat that proved effective as a candidate to a president capable of mixing speeds (rhetorically, at least) and keeping Democratic batters off-balance and behind in the count? <br> Trump’s address -- he billed it as “a renewal of the American spirit,” calling on Congress to join him “in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country” -- weaved in and out of familiar places. But with the occasional surprise detour – the sort of focus-group approach that made Bill Clinton’s speeches before Congress so long (Trump spoke for an hour) but politically effective. <br> Democrats were forced to take notice of Trump’s call for paid family leave, just as Republicans couldn’t ignore a stronger-than-usual call for school choice. <br> The effectiveness of it all? I’ll wager that it tested well with voters willing to put aside the man’s personality and listen to his ideas. <br> And President Trump? <br> Here are four takeaways from Trump’s speech: <br> For Trump, it’s a little from column A, a lot from column B. The economy’s a mixed message: stocks have never been higher; Target, the epitome of Main Street America, is struggling thanks to the digital monster that is Amazon. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats refuse to grant Trump presidential stature. <br> In a realigned Washington, a Republican president now touts victimhood (bad trade deals stealing American jobs; illegal aliens preying on lawful citizens). Congressional Democrats bemoan government over-reach in the form of Obamacare stepped-up immigration enforcement. <br> 2. The State of Trump’s State. The 45th president entered his first joint address to Congress with a 39 percent approval rating, per the Fox News Poll (Obama was at 60 percent at the same point in 2009). <br> What does work for Trump is the novelty of his appearing in prime time television (as a politician, that is) working off a TelePrompter and having an adult conversation with the American public. Unlike the a.m. version of Trump – the one prone to manic tweeting and extemporaneous remarks at press avails that set off dumpster fires – the p.m. version is less abrasive and makes a more convincing case that he’s serious about the job and has a lot of ideas that makes sense. <br> What he should consider: more speeches like this and town hall venues outside the beltway, where the presidential agenda has far more resonance – with Democrats representing districts that didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton in a tough spot. <br> The surprises: <br> -- Trump’s call for bipartisanship included fair trade and a new “border tax” – not “drain the swamp” reforms such as lobbying restrictions that were mentioned earlier in the address (and met with Democratic sarcasm). <br> -- While the economy got large play, the specifics of tax reform didn’t. The president made a vague reference to reducing for businesses and families, but didn’t give it the same play as infrastructure investment or regulatory reform. One imagines that Wall Street was hoping for more. <br> It’s been almost 1,000 hours since Barack Obama left office. To the extent the left has complained about the former president, it would be: despite talking a big game (climate change, gun control) he didn’t engage with Congress on a personal level to win over lawmakers. <br> This isn’t to suggest that Trump should rent a copy of HBO’s “All The Way” and mimic Lyndon Johnson’s handholding and arm-twisting. But perhaps it’s time to shift gears and push for the agenda in the same struggling economic pockets that made the politically impossible last fall. 
 “We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.”</i> <br> But what exactly is the country’s most urgent economic challenge? Scanning the headlines, one might think the answer is tackling the negative impacts of foreign trade, reversing the decline of American manufacturing, or slowing the rapid pace of technological change. <br> Put more simply: Americans are reeling from the negative effects of<i>too littleeconomic change, not too much. This low-dynamism era is quietly calcifying our economy, resulting in less competition, widening inequality, and fewer pathways to the American Dream. <br> Enter the Great Recession, which turned what had been a slow startup decline into an accelerated collapse. For the first time on record, the rate of business formation dropped below the rate of business closures. Even after years of economic recovery, the startup rate has barely budged from its record low. The news gets worse when it comes to geographic mobility and labor turnover rates–two important measures of dynamism that demonstrate the extent to which workers can access better opportunities. Both have fallen to<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__eig.org_dynamism-23workersd=DwMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=TzD3VbQ-L0ieXytmJoeKebFcbDoWchds3FDjqzodUSks=q_ijWQyi3bh4eBaLdfNC-lPhLC3HFMG0ejz5RS4_Sace=" target="_blank">historic lows. <br> Indeed, the recession ushered in a troubling new normal: most metro areas now see more businesses close than open every year, reversing decades of nearly universal expansion. As a result, an economy that for decades added an average of over 100,000 firms per year instead had 182,000<i>fewerfirms in 2014 than in 2007, even though GDP increased by $1.1 trillion over that period. <br> The low-churn, startup-less recovery has been quite good for one constituency: incumbent big businesses. Indeed, facing less competition, large older firms (think Carrier, Toyota, and Boeing) are enjoying something of a golden age: they have never been more profitable, more dominant within their industries, or responsible for a larger share of the U.S. workforce. <br> Restoring dynamism will require presidential leadership across a broad set of policy areas. Every proposalfrom tax reform, to infrastructure, to regulatory overhaulshould be evaluated through the lens of dynamism. Will it increase mobility for workers and reduce geographic inequality? Will it foster competition? Will it improve access to capital for entrepreneurs? 
 I was in Washington, D.C. this weekend attendinga meeting ofthe National Governors Association. OnFebruary28, a day after our meetings conclude, President Trump will address a joint session ofCongress. <br> For example, President Trump signed a bill that will roll backthe Obama administration’s last minute “stream protection rule.” Though the rule was given a name that sounds beneficial,itwould have escalated the “war on coal” resulting in the elimination of tens of thousands of coal miningjobs. Many of the so-called protections in the rulewere already addressedby sections of the Clean Water Act. <br> Perhaps as noteworthy as the roll back of the ruleitself,is the method of review that was employed. Congress used its powers under the Congressional ReviewAct. This allowed them to weigh the benefits versus the repercussions ofthis expansive regulation. Thatopportunityshould have been affordedCongress<i>before implementation of a rule that would adversely affect so many Americans. <br> It is for that reason, that I applaud President Trump’s appointment of Scott Pruitt to direct the EPA. As Oklahoma AttorneyGeneral,Mr. Pruitt filed several lawsuits against the EPA.It is important to note, however, none of those suitswereintended to remove any environmental protections of significance. Instead,theywere broughttoforce the EPA to remain within their statutory authorityand to obey the rule of law. <br> In addition to the restoration of regulatory sanity, President Trumphas repeatedly expressed his commitment to our military veterans. The president isdeterminedto reform whatcan only be characterizedas a broken Veterans Administration health care system. <br> On a larger scale, President Trump sharesthedesire of most Americans to see the failed ObamaCare law repealed and replaced. <br> The presidentmade a brilliant choice when appointing Tom Price asHealth and Human Services Secretary. As a former physician and congressman,SecretaryPricebrings much experience and knowledge to the health care issue. Now that hehasbeen confirmed,we can begin to build consensus on how best to accomplishreplacement of this disastrous law. <br> InKentucky,we are meeting regularly with business leaderswho are encouraged about our state’s recent passage of pro-business legislation and who are now considering our state as a possible location for expansion. Likewise, President Trump’s commitments to tax reform and deregulation have encouraged investors to propel the stock market to new heights. <br> The Trump administration can be proud of these accomplishments and the impressive array of additional cabinet appointments,includingKentuckian Elaine Chao as Secretary of Transportation. 
 There were scores of pressing queries for the White House press corps to put to presidential spokesman Sean Spicer at Wednesday’s daily briefing: President Trump’s new immigration restrictions, relations with Mexico, China and Russia, tax reform, ObamaCare, the fight against Islamic terror. <br> As Bellwether noted last week, several state legislatures were dismayed, during the closing year of the Obama administration, to receive a letter from the Departments of Justice and Education instructing them to let students who claim to be transgender use whatever bathrooms, locker rooms and showers they want, based solely on which gender they feel they are. States that refused to comply were threatened with a cutoff of federal funds. <br> The Trump administration is widely expected, sometime this week, to rescind those Obama-era instructions, and let individual states deal with the issue as they see fit. <br> “It’s not a priority,” answered Spicer, pointing out that the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a case this week involving transgender rights, and the new administration has to decide before then whether to continue, or amend, the Obama-era guidance. <br> Texas, which voted for Trump and is considering a state law that requires people to use the bathroom assigned to them according to the gender on their birth certificate, is an example. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told me last week, “This is not a law aimed at discriminating against transgenders. It’s aimed at sex offenders who could use this to pretend they’re transgenders. It’s intended to protect the right of a woman not to have to share a bathroom with a man if she doesn’t want to.” <br> Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is trying to ignore interference by sports associations like the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. Both have hinted strongly that if the proposed legislation is passed into law, Texas will not get to host major sports events like All-Star games or the Super Bowl. 
 People are constantly asking me – “What makes the president tick?” <br> If people who are struggling to understand Donald J. Trump just took the time to do their due diligence, they would realize that there is a method to his professional life. There are principles he adheres to and protocols he follows. <br> Chapter 1: “A Week in the Life” – In 1987, he liked flexibility in his schedule. He wrote that he cannot be “imaginative or entrepreneurial if you have too much structure.” <br> His typical business day officially starts at 9am and ends at 6:30pm. <br> There were no “tweets” in 1987 when he published his book so we can assume phone calls at that time took the place of them at that time. <br> He will settle on less but only if he feels that is what it will take to close the deal. And, when a deal is closed, he will always claim he got the best of the deal. <br> So, what impresses Trump is a person’s track record, instincts and impression. <br> 1.Think Big – Immigration, Repeal and Replace ObamaCare, Tax Reform, etc. <br> Compromise is a necessary component. <br> 4.Know the Market – Take counsel from the best and brightest who know their “market.” Cabinet Secretaries are the best and brightest in their “markets” and that is who was hired and that is the counsel he will take. <br> 5.Use Your Leverage – Never show desperation for a deal. Deal from strength using all the tools available to you to project strength. Sometimes that requires “imagination and salesmanship.” The U.S. government and the president have a great deal of leverage to exert, economically, militarily, politically, etc. <br> 7.&nbsp;Get the Word Out – You can have the best policy and solution but if the people don’t know it then they can’t appreciate it. <br> You must create excitement. <br> The more sensational or outrageous the sale, the better, because the press eats it up. <br> He uses “bravado” as a tool of promotion. He plays to “people’s fantasies” like: “Making America Great Again.” <br> Puffery is allowed as part of the sale because it is a tool allowed in the marketplace. <br> Trump will fight back harder than the attack itself. And, he will fight back on multiple fronts, i.e. courts, press, etc. <br> 9.Deliver the Goods – Trump realizes that after all the hype, promotion and excitement there must be a deliverable. You have to be able to talk a good game but in the end you must deliver. <br> 10. Contain the Costs – Spend what is needed but no more. If you feel you are being taken advantage of – pick up the phone and let the party know. <br> 11. Have Fun – The excitement of making the deal is playing the game. Trump does not rehash or relive deals because he is on to the next one. He claims that if you enjoy what you do, you will be successful. It is just that simple. <br> President Trump is applying his business principles to governing. He believes that by applying tried and true principles and protocols that made him successful as a businessman he will also be as successful as a president of the United States. 
 Donald Trump’s presidency is only one month old, but already the buzzards are circling. The president cheered supporters by assailing his critics at yesterday’s press conference, but there is little doubt that the Trump White House is struggling to keep its momentum. The drama over Michael Flynn’s departure and the defeat of Labor nominee Pudzer raise concerns over organization and focus, and feed headlines reporting “borderline chaos.” <br> First, some perspective. At this point in his presidency, Bill Clinton’s White House was in disarray. His chief of staff, a lifelong friend named Mack McLarty, a person described by his grade school teacher as Just a real nice boy who grew up into a real nice young man, was way over his head, unable to rein in the bigger-than-life personalities that typically occupy the West Wing. Infighting between the staffs of the president and Hillary was undermining the young administration. Chaos reined. <br> Sound familiar? Woodward also reveals how Clinton staffers leaked damaging information – about each other and the president -- to the press. George Stephanopoulos, one of Clinton’s closest aides, told a reporter that the president was incapable of making decisions, while others took potshots at Hillary’s healthcare initiative, Bill’s “dishonest” budget and so on. <br> What’s different today? Trump faces an extraordinarily hostile media, which Clinton did not. Though some in the press criticized Clinton’s inexperienced apparatchiks, most supported the president’s agenda. They were not out for blood. <br> And, from time to time, he throws gasoline on the smoldering rage ignited by the election. <br> First, it may be that he should take a page from the Clinton playbook and bring in a time-tested barracuda chief of staff (think Rahm Emmanuel). Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax Media, says Priebus is over his head; it’s possible the former RNC Chair is simply too nice a guy to knock heads. It wasn’t until hard-knuckle Leon Panetta became Clinton’s Chief of Staff in July 1994 that the White House got its act together. Given the hostility arrayed against him, Trump can’t wait that long. An ideal candidate would look like Newt Gingrich without the ego, or Chris Christie without the ambition. <br> Third, Mr. Trump needs to erect a speedbump in his Twitter feed. Just one set of eyes, one person who has the authority to say “go” or “no-go” on the 3 am tweets. Trump is engaging, still, in too many petty battles, when there are big ones to be fought. However, he should not shut it down; his tweets have increased in popularity since his inauguration, being “favorited” on average 120,000 times, and retweeted over 40,000 times. Those who are irate over the mainstream media’s treatment of their president are delighted he can address them directly, and they can respond. <br> Finally, Trump should invite John McCain and Lindsay Graham to lunch, and hear them out. Both are respected GOP senior statesmen and they are aligned against the president. Their resistance will give cover to others, and the president needs a united party. Some of it is policy; some is personal. Trump has a big personality; he must win them over. 
 <i>Editor's note:</b>The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.
 President Trump and the Republican Congressional leadership are following the lead of their rank and file. They are making their first priority the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare. That is a mistake. Health care reform is complicated. Arriving at a replacement plan will not happen quickly or easily. <br> Under the current proposed legislative agenda, Congress will not be able to take up the issue of tax reform until members of Congress get a firm picture of a replacement health care plan. That plan, which cannot be passed under the 51-vote majority reconciliation vehicle, but instead will require 60 votes, could take longer than expected to develop. During the next several months, the Senate will also be tied up in debate over the President’s Supreme Court nominee. Usually that process takes several months of debate and backroom maneuvering before a candidate is confirmed. The Senate becomes bogged down. <br> The prospect for tax reform is one reason the U.S. stock market has surged since the election. The more that ObamaCare replacement and the Supreme Court debate drag on through the rest of this year, the greater the chance that markets conclude that despite the Republican majorities and a Republican White House, legislative stalemate will continue well into 2018 if not longer. <br> True, there will be opposition to the border adjustment tax, particularly from retailers. And those who suggest that the tax reform package not include individual tax reform are misreading the situation. Today 80 percent of businesses are so-called “pass-through” entities that are exempt from the corporate tax system. Any tax reform would have to include these smaller “corporate” entities -- i.e. it would have to include reform of the individual tax code in addition to the corporate tax code. <br> The stakes for financial markets are high. If there is a chance tax reform and expensing are not be enacted until some unspecified time in the future, how does a company make a decision on new capital investment? Hold off investing this year in anticipation of much more favorable tax treatment in the future? But such delay could come at a cost to the economy and equity market. Under a border adjustment tax, exports would not be taxed. Should a corporation hold up on its exports until some unspecified future date to achieve tax savings? But such a delay would increase the trade deficit and harm the economy. 
 Democrats are overjoyed that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against President Trump’s immigration order. That figures; never mind the legal issues or the possible impact on the White House’s ability to enact measures aimed at keeping the country safe. Most important: it was a blow to Trump, and Democrats couldn’t be happier. It’s gotten personal. <br> Which path would that be? Maybe Trump’s immigration order, which, notwithstanding the ruling of a notably liberal court, gets approval from 55% of the country, versus 38% that disapproves? Or his proposal to revoke federal funds from sanctuary cities, a policy supported by 55% of registered voters and opposed by only 33%, according to the same new Morning Consult/Politico poll? <br> This toxic posturing could well backfire as Democrats try to win back disaffected voters. As important, it could hurt the country, and for that they will not be forgiven. <br> Since then, as Democrats have slow-walked confirming Trump’s cabinet nominees and have placed themselves squarely in front of every policy he has suggested, consumer confidence has slipped almost three points, giving up much of the post-election gain. That could quickly translate into slower spending, meaning fewer jobs. <br> The liberal media will blame Trump for everything that goes wrong, including less-than-immediate gratification on Obamacare and tax reform. The media, though, get worse marks than the president these days; their incessant attacks on Trump have undermined their credibility. <br> Meanwhile, where is the vision that will lead Democrats out of their self- inflicted political exile? Where are their policies that will boost incomes and win back the hearts of traditional blue collar Democrats? <br> At the retreat, Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House, tied future gains to rebuilding “our state and local parties.” He doesn’t seem to understand that attracting voters requires a winning message. Hillary Clinton didn’t have one, and neither does the party today. <br> Warren tweeted to call out Sessions’ supposed “radical hatred” and “racism, sexism bigotry”; evidence for those charges during Sessions’ decades of public service are scant. Sessions is hated by the Left because he will execute the laws of the country – laws that are under attack from numerous sides. Laws that were often ignored by former Attorneys General Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder. <br> In fact, voters appear to like most of the executive orders signed by Trump. Some 54% think freezing new regulations is a good idea (33%), 48% like Trump’s decision on the Keystone Pipeline, against 37% that do not. Similar portions of the electorate agree with his moves on building a wall, withdrawing from the TPP and not giving federal money to organizations providing abortions. 
 Before I became a member of Congress, I had a successful career in the private sector. I learned firsthand just how many obstacles our families and small businesses face, thanks to our overly complicated tax code and mounting government regulations. <br> To give some context, former Governor John Engler had won Site Selection Magazine’s prestigious Governor’s Cup four years in a row. Our economy was growing. Fast forward to the end of Governor Jennifer Granholm’s administration, and per-capita personal income had taken one of the largest drops of any state over a nine-year period since 1929. More than 800,000 jobs were lost and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to 15 percent. Not surprisingly, a common bumper sticker in our state read, “Last one in Michigan, turn out the lights.” <br> To start, we closed government budget shortfalls by cutting and reforming government spending, instead of relying on tax increases. Spending from state resources decreased every year from 2006 to 2010. We introduced and passed reforms to the state’s Medicaid system, one of the fastest-growing cost drivers, to root out fraud and waste. <br> Our reforms paved the way for Michigan’s recovery under Republican leadership. We’re now a top 10 pro-business state and have an unemployment rate of 5 percent. In 2017, Michigan is ranked 12th among all states for overall business tax climate. <br> It begins with tax reform. <br> We must put an end to the special deals for special interests. We should be encouraging competition, rather than perpetuating an economic drag. <br> House Republicans have a plan that makes it easier to create jobs, increase wages and generate opportunities for everyone. Congress and the administration must work together to create the best possible environment for jobs to stay and grow in Michigan, and across the nation. 
 President Trump is already set to move decisively on the economy than his predecessor, but he must scale huge hurdles to accomplish 3 to 4 percent economic growth. Why? Because radical policy changes will be required. And that's tough to do even in this era of aggressive executive orders. <br> Still many large businesses, and most small ones, are organized as limited liability corporations and pay taxes through the personal tax code—after corporate tax reform they would be saddled with effective rates above 40 percent while their corporate rivals pay half that rate or less. <br> Whenever and whatever Congress ultimately decides, genuine tax relief will require bigger deficits. Those are an anathema to many Republicans and in any case don’t guarantee growth. <br> Trade deficits with China and on oil directly subtract $500 billion annually from the demand for American made goods and services, kill millions of jobs, stifle RD and tax growth. <br> Trump must gird for a broad crisis with China, deploy the full range of America’s geopolitical and economic assets and compel Beijing to reckon with the fact that their shaky economy cannot withstand an all front confrontation with the United States without risking the Communist Party’s grip on power. <br> On the supply side, it’s a lot more expensive to start a business and make things in America than it was in the 1980s and 90s, because of the growth of the regulatory state. Just compliance with labor market, health care, financial, environmental regulations and the like require hundreds of thousands of employees and cost businesses billions of dollars. <br> A good deal of what Obama imposed was by fiat—executive orders that can now be repealed. However, he also imposed overly aggressive and burdensome regulations established under statutes, and those are more difficult and time consuming to nix. <br> All can be axed or reshaped by congress, but the Trump administration can expect a pitched battle from progressive Senate Democrats dedicated to remaking the American economy in the low-growth, high unemployment model of continental Europe. <br> In the end, Republicans in Congress may have to resort to a grand budget reconciliation bill—or for their senators to reluctantly vote to suspend the 60 vote rule—to push through a panoply of reforms, and Trump will have to marshal public support for radical measures to overcome a barrage of criticism and protests from liberal politicians and the media. 
 I am in the lucky position of being someone who has both a lot of conservative friends and a lot of liberal friends. I value these friendships greatly both because I like my friends and because I benefit from hearing both sides off all issues. <br> My friend Erwin Chemerinsky sincerely believes that Donald Trump is anti semitic even though his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism, Trump has given a key White House appointment to his Jewish son-in-law with whom he is very close, and Trump has adopted the most pro-Israel foreign policy of any president in American history. <br> Liberals are hysterical over Trump’s ban on immigration from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and the Sudan while overlooking the fact that there are violent civil wars going on in those countries. The vast majority of Muslim countries are not affect by Trump's ban including: Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf states, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and many parts of North Africa including the Northern half of Nigeria. <br> I have pointed out to these liberal friends that there are all sorts of checks and balances built into the Constitution that would prevent Trump from doing to Muslims or Hispanics what President Franklin D. Roosevelt did with Japanese-Americans during World War II, which was to round them all up and put them in a concentration camp – another worry a liberal friend has expressed to me. <br> Former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is so good that even my liberal friends think he won the vice presidential debate last fall with Democratic rival Tim Kaine. <br> Trump’s pick of Steven Mnuchin to be Secretary of the Treasury is also brilliant. Mnuchin understands supply side economics and the way in which real tax reform could jump start our largely stalled economy. <br> Betsy DeVos is in my opinion the best pick for Secretary of Education in the history of the Department of Education. Her support for school choice and vouchers is essential if we are ever to repair our failing public schools. <br> The pick of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to be ambassador to the United Nations is yet another very wise Trump choice. Haley is first East Indian-American to serve in that job, and she reflects both the excellence and the diversity that characterizes the United States. <br> Most recently, on January 31, President Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court in an absolutely brilliant and superb move. <br> If Gorsuch is confirmed, as he deserves to be, it will mark the first time in U.S. history that a Supreme Court justice will have served on the bench with one of hiss law clerks. <br> His Supreme Court nominee is as good as was Justice Scalia, who was Reagan’s best Supreme Court appointment out of four tries. Donald Trump is a genius at hiring highly talented and well credentialed officials. 
 <b>Editor's note: Dana Perino, co-anchor of The Five on Fox News Channel, recently sat down with radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt to talk with him about his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Way-Conservative-Playbook-Majority/dp/1501172441/" target="_blank">The Fourth Way:The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority.</i> <br> HUGH HEWITT: Early in the campaign I asked President Trump about Iran's Quds Force. He heard --as happens in radio often-- Kurds not Quds. Thus his answer was disconnected to the question. The MSM [mainstream media] cut him zero slack and it sounded like a gotcha question which I always think are counter-productive. He wasn't happy with the exchange, buthe came back on the program a dozen more times, so we got past that. <br> DP: In order to successfully achieve the GOP policy goals Republicans hope to put forth this year, who does the president need as his greatest ally? <br> DP: What do you expect will be the greatest hurdle the president must overcome during his first 100 days in office? <br> DP: How do you think the media will adapt to a Trump presidency? And might President Trump find that the relationship with the press can be mutually beneficial to reporters doing their jobs and a president wanting to advance an agenda? <br> Selling the MSM on unified GOP initiatives is going to fall on the Speaker. <br> HH: People live in homes that they can afford because of the mortgage interest deduction, in states where the tax burden is enormous --but deductible-- and deeply involved in their churches to which they make tax deductible contributions. It is political suicide to tamper with much less eliminate any of the big three deductions. I hope the GOP doesn't love the theory of tax reform more than the reality of voters' lives. <br> HH: I pitched this book to Simon Schuster the day after the election. I thought President Trump would lose --badly. But the stunning result opened up an opportunity to realign politics, one that was obvious to me. <br> DP: What audience do you recommend this book to most and what do you hope the audience learns from it? 
 As Donald Trump prepares to assume the Presidency, Republican friends have asked moderate Democrats like me why we don’t join the GOP. After all, the party of Lincoln dominates state legislatures, Governorships, and all levers of power in Washington D.C. <br> Growing up in rural Oregon, being a Democrat was a good thing. My grandparents celebrated President Roosevelt and his efforts to pull the nation from the brink of the Great Depression. There were good government jobs for those with strong backs and willing hands. The elderly and disabled could count on Social Security to comfort them in their hardest years. <br> As my parents grew up, they took inspiration from President Kennedy and his call for shared sacrifice and service. They agreed that their fellow citizens ought to first ask what they might do for their country, not the other way around. Everyone was expected to work and contribute, especially as we battled the Soviet Union and the evils of communism. <br> In the 1980s, my siblings and I grew up witnessing the power and importance of compromise. Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill (D-Mass.) worked closely with President Reagan to find common cause on tax reform and immigration despite profound ideological differences. Later, we watched a rural leader and neighbor – Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.) – work with President Bush as the Soviet Union collapsed and the U.S. emerged as the leader of the free world. <br> But throughout the 1990s, things started to change. For the parties. And for the country. <br> But rural Oregon wasn’t alone. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, this same scene played out across the nation. Steel mills, canneries, furniture plants, and mines. Gone. Their loss impacted not just white working families but black and brown too. <br> But there was also another guilty party: urban elites. These rich-getting-richer Americans viewed our land as Fly Over States, filled with poor-getting-poorer hillbillies. We may have grown the food on their plates, but we weren’t good enough to enjoy it with them. <br> Both political parties understood this sad development and took advantage. <br> Democrats took their own turn, using identity politics to cobble together their coalition of women, minorities, and urbanites that cast the rest of America aside. <br> The result? Our democracy lost the people and temperament for compromise and empathy. <br> Is it any wonder that nobody’s happy with this political arrangement? Approval ratings for members of Congress are about the same as those for communist North Korea. <br> But if Trump fails, how do we break this fever of division? And how do Democrats help encourage that process? After all, we need multiple voices in America’s democracy. We are not North Korea – or China or Russia – with their single political party. <br> First, we’ve got to find, train, and promote candidates who put <i>America first</b>, not our party. No more ideologues who are unwilling to compromise. That means things have to change at the Democratic National Committee – a topic I’ll cover in another column. <br> Democrats and Republicans. <br> I have no illusions that collaboration will be easy or without conflict. In fact, I embrace civilized debate. Most of us do. But we’re tired of the endless fighting. And we have no shortage of problems to tackle. There’s little time to waste. 
 For President-elect Trump, boosting economic growth and creating more good-paying jobs recovery will not prove easy. George W. Bush campaigned on -- and delivered -- lower taxes and more limited government, but his economic expansion was no more robust than Barack Obama’s and ended with the 2007/08 financial crisis. <br> Still public confidence is as important as government policies for inspiring growth, and he can still spell out a robust agenda during his first 100 days. Here are five things to look for in the new president's first days: <br> Repealing ObamaCare is easy but replacing it requires the GOP to craft programs to insure Americans with pre-existing conditions and who need financial assistance can obtain coverage. <br> Federal and state programs are two-thirds of health care spending, and those often permit service providers to drive up prices rather than contain costs. More competition, as congressional Republicans prescribe, may help but the Germans have found they simply must regulate prices to stem profiteering by pharmaceutical companies and the like. <br> 2. Tax Reform <br> Trump should table a plan to simplify the personal tax code and lower rates enough to provide a modest cut for everyone. That would encourage small businesses—which generally file under personal, not corporate, laws—to create more jobs and in turn pay for the tax cut. <br> 3. Infrastructure Spending <br> He should send to congress a plan to distribute money directly to the state and local governments with “use or lose” deadlines but subject to broad guidelines. Local governments have lots of schools, bridges and the like in queue for repair and replacement. Private accounting firms could audit spending to ensure funds are used properly. <br> 4. Deregulation <br> 5. Trade <br> China accounts for about two-thirds of the trade imbalance and its undervalued currency is a problem. However, so are its high tariffs, administrative barriers to U.S. exports, pirating of intellectual property and other trappings of its socialist-market economy. 
 Wednesday morning at Trump Tower, President-elect Donald Trump held his first extended media gathering in over five-and-a-half months – in Trump’s words, a “general news conference”. <br> Here are five takeaways. <br> Trump began by taking the Russia dossier report head-on, trashing it as “disgraceful” and “fake news”. <br> Repealing and replacing ObamaCare? A plan will be offered as soon as his choice for health and human Services Secretary, Rep. Tom Price, M.D. is confirmed. <br> The biggest news nugget in this regard: Trump said he’ll make his Supreme Court pick ”within two weeks” of taking office, after “some pretty good signings” (presumably to roll back past executive orders). <br> That still happened, though it won’t grab the same headlines it might have nearly a month ago. However, it did have one advantageous effect for Trump: the financial briefing brought the media to dead silence – a lull between two storms. <br> Trump’s handling of the matter, I thought, was politically deft – he left it to an aide to calmly detail the creation of a firewall and explain the nuances of the family operation; donating the profits to charity was a nice touch. <br> As such, it was the opposite of the typical Obama White House press conference, where the principal usually fielded about a half-dozen-or-so questions during the allotted time. <br> Trump, on the other hand, was direct in his responses – at times seeming to draw energy off the contentious nature of some of the questions. <br> 4. Not A Release Valve. Why do presidents hold press conferences? If not to break news or control a bad story/trend, then to release some pressure from a media entourage clamoring for interaction. <br> Trump opened his remarks by crediting most news outlets for not running the latest Russia dossier allegations. But his dislike for the institution of the press (not to mention his lack of dependency, thanks to his Twitter feed) is palpable. Then again, that contempt is two-way traffic. <br> Which takes us to the final point . . . <br> Once in office, there’s little chance of Trump going dark for six months. Some presidents have – but not until the closing chapter of their White House years (George W. Bush held two solo news conferences in the last 13 months of his presidency). <br> Barack Obama held 10 solo news conferences during his first year in office. He averaged one presser for roughly every six weeks of his presidency. <br> Bill Clinton? Twelve solo news conferences during his first year; only 10 during his last three years, with reporters wanting time to delve into impeachment. <br> Trump’s choices moving forward? <br> As for more traditional news conferences? Make the Bush 43 statistic – four solo press conferences a year – the over-under. 
 President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on cutting taxes for Americans of all income levels. This year he has the opportunity to do so multiple times. <br> But this is not the first tax cut Congress will send to Trump’s desk. By passing legislation repealing ObamaCare through budget reconciliation, lawmakers have an opportunity to remove nearly 20 taxes which will save taxpayers more than one trillion dollars over the next decade. <br> The trillion dollars in higher taxes have restricted health care choice, increased costs, made saving more difficult, and granted government more control over care at the expense of individual control. Below are just some of the tax wins that will come from repealing ObamaCare: <br> ObamaCare enforces many of its provisions through stiff tax penalties both on individuals and on businesses. <br> Similarly, the law forces employers to pay a $2,000 penalty per full time employee if that fail to offer qualifying insurance. This mandate increases taxes on businesses by $166.9 billion over a decade. <br> At the same time ObamaCare mandates insurance coverage, it directly drives up the cost of that insurance through a massive tax totaling $130 billion over the next decade. This tax is borne by small businesses, individuals and families through higher premiums. <br> The tax could cost up to 286,000 new jobs, and $33 billion in lost sales by 2023, according to research by the National Federation for Independent Businesses. <br> People -- not businesses – bear the burden of these taxes, so this is billions of dollars in higher taxes that are passed on to consumers who rely on life-saving and life-bettering products. <br> In addition to increasing the costs of health care through higher prices and stifling mandates, ObamaCare directly increases taxes on Americans with high medical bills. <br> Around 10 million families used this deduction before ObamaCare, with the average taxpayer earning just $53,000 in 2010. Based on this information, the average family is paying $200 to $400 in higher income taxes each year. <br> ObamaCare imposed several taxes that hit the tens of millions of Americans who use Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts. Specifically, the law forbid families from using HSA and FSA dollars for over the counter medications. Families had been making such household medicine cabinet purchases for years – cold and flu medicine and hundreds of other medical products. ObamaCare also hikes taxes on FSAs by imposing a cap ($2,500) on the amount of income families can contribute to FSAs and increases the tax penalty on early withdrawals from HSAs. 
 “Hear us again for the first time!” Effective Conservatism and the Republican Study Committee. <br> There isoverwhelmingevidence to support a hopeful and optimistic outlook for the 115th Congress. <br> Yet, we must also ask the question -- is knowing the right policy alone enough? I believe the day has arrived when preaching to the choir is no longer adequate -- that’s the easy road. The worn-out language and rhetoric may be attractive language to our base, but the oft-repeated talking points of individual liberty and personal prosperity falls short in reaching many of our communities. We can do better. <br> I am growing more convinced that policy alone is insufficient without the right approach and the right voice. The American people are demanding ”effective conservatism” and I am certain that all three – the right policy, the right approach, and the right voice can be accomplished. <br> As RSC chairman, my hope is to lay out clear and measurable objectives with contemporary messaging that communicates our principles of opportunity, liberty, and security.I don’t assume that we’re the first to share such a vision but the American People have afforded us this momentum and we must act with urgency – not out of political gain or posturing but rather out of the belief that good policy with the right approach can change America for the better. <br> I believe members of the RSC were elected to represent conservatism. Together, conservatives can make a difference and change the misguided policies and laws that have broken the family, stifled entrepreneurship, and veered away from the Constitution. Liberty. Opportunity. Security. <br> We will work to rediscover the path to Effective Conservatism and the vision of our Founding Fathers. We will listen to the American People and implement their ideas into our solutions. <br> It is not too late to reestablish a constitutionally limited government that is efficient and productive. 
 President-elect Donald Trump’s dramatic deal with air conditioner manufacturer Carrier to keep jobs in America is not the only major campaign promise that he's working to keep. <br> “We're already sitting down and discussing this with Congress,” Mnuchin said. “And this is going to be something that happens absolutely within the first 90 days of this presidency. We're going to have a major tax reform, biggest tax reform since Reagan. And it's not just going to be a cut in corporate taxes, but it's also going to be a very large middle income tax cut that's going to help this country.” <br> Mnuchin is also revealing that the Trump team is moving ahead with the president-elect's plan to allow multi-national corporations to repatriate trillions of dollars in profits that are held overseas at a 10 percent rate. That means companies can bring all of that money back to America to build factories, manufacturing centers and create jobs. <br> “The president-elect's made it very clear he wants the Congress when they convene in early January to take up the task of repealing and replacing ObamaCare first,” Pence said. <br> He won’t be sworn in for another 50 days, and he is already checking boxes. 
 Donald Trump is already Making America Great Again. True to his campaign theme, this consummate deal maker and now president-elect has now put his negotiating savvy to work for the American people. <br> PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S THREE GREATEST CHALLENGES <br> It is also possible that Trump hinted that Carrier’s parent company United Technologies, which derives some 10 percent of its $56 billion in revenues from the federal government, would do well to play ball with the incoming administration. <br> Bottom line: We don’t know and we don’t care. This unexpected win is why the stock market has been soaring since the election, and why consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in over nine years in the past month, in spite of the incessant gloom broadcast by the liberal media. This is why voters elected Trump, upending politics as usual. And, it’s just the beginning. <br> The Carrier decision, and the resulting 1,000 jobs, is a drop in the bucket, but it is a powerful symbol at a time when working people in our country are just regaining their optimism. Carrier had long broadcast its intention to shift the manufacturing of its gas furnaces and fan coils from Indiana to Monterrey. The move was expected to save Carrier some $65 million per year, but became a rallying cry on the campaign trail. The planned move became the poster child for the seeming indifference of U.S. companies to its workers, as well as the negligence of the Obama White House, which did nothing to prevent the devastating seepage of manufacturing jobs from our land. <br> Trump’s picks for key cabinet spots confirms that he means business and should bolster those expectations. Choosing Tom Price, a doctor and member of Congress who has spent years crafting alternatives to ObamaCare, shows Trump’s readiness to replace the dysfunctional health program. In selecting Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary Trump has served notice to the teachers unions: there’s a new sheriff in town, and he’s will demand changes in our failing public schools. Ditto Elaine Chao, who if confirmed will be Trump’s Secretary of Transportation. Chao, wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, knows her way around the capitol, and will be an excellent shepard for Trump’s infrastructure initiative. <br> The liberal press will minimize the Carrier deal, pointing out that 1,000 jobs will not of itself lift economic growth, and that structural cost problems remain for U.S. manufacturers. Paying Mexican laborers three dollars an hour is a powerful enticement; workers in Indianapolis are making more than $20. <br> The Carrier reversal also shows our billionaire president-elect ready to use the power of the Oval Office to negotiate a better deal for our country – from corporations as well as from foreign countries. Underlying that premise is Trump’s recognition that the U.S. is the exceptional nation, and that our prestige and clout can be leveraged on behalf of American workers. What a welcome change. 
 After an emotional ride, an evening of surprises and possibly the biggest political shakeup this country has seen, the voters have spoken and we now prepare to embrace President Donald J. Trump. <br> What was missed through this election, and also underreported and clouded by the immigration noise, was the fact that the top issue for Hispanics is jobs and the economy. <br> Many Americans mistakenly believed that Trump’s hard line on immigration and polarizing epithets like ‘bad hombres’ would ruin his chances with Hispanic voters. This logic relied on an assumption that immigration and race relations were the most important issues for these voters — yet the data says otherwise. <br> Some early reports show a 34 percent Hispanic support in Florida, which is exactly aligned with CuturIntel™'s non polling method of measuring opinion: two days ago, the method showed Trump had 32 percent of Latino support in the Sunshine State. <br> Back in June we reported Trump securing 34 percent positive opinion among Hispanics, which was reported by Fox News Latino, Drudge Report and covered by The O’Reilly Factor. It unleashed a wave of tweets in disbelief that I backed with data and an N sample of over 1.9 million. Our data also always reported them almost in a dead tie for positive opinion nationally. <br> Over the last 12 months, jobs and the economy dominated 35 percent of Hispanics’ political conversation, which possibly made a winning difference for Trump. <br> The number of Latino-owned businesses has grown nearly 50 times faster than non-Latino-owned businesses, yet Latino businesses lag far behind in revenue compared with those owned by non-Latinos, as reported by the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative. This represents a $1.4 trillion opportunity for the U.S. economy that could be positively impacted with less regulation and incentives for small business owners. <br> Peter Navarro, one of Trump’s economic policy advisors, claimed that the lag in entrepreneurship and successful small businesses started with government restrictions. Trump articulated that it was most important to focus on growing GDP to 3.5 percent through deregulation. <br> This is particularly attractive to small business owners, as the National Small Business Association reports 2 in 5 of the owners of small businesses as Republicans and 95 percent of them as active voters in national elections. <br> Certainly, this election leaves us with many lessons to learn. Polls need to be reconsidered and advanced data extraction techniques and big data should be considered as complimentary technology. Also, Hispanics are not a single-issue community. We are highly entrepreneurial, motivated by a vibrant economy and jobs and ultimately vote for candidates and not for parties. 
 Exit polls from the 2016 presidential election find that the biggest motivatingfactor for voters in the contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was a desire for “real change” (39 percent). Of those voters, Donald Trump won an astounding 83 percent. That is the biggest reason he won. <br> But when it comes to the nuts-and-bolts of his tax and economic plan, Trump has been attacked by liberals as offering“warmed-over supply-side nostrums” with the New Yorker sneering that Trump represents “Palin populism in the streets, but Reagan in the balance sheets.” <br> As for personal income tax rates, Trump would create four brackets of rates ranging from 12 percent to 33 percent. The standard tax deduction would be increased, and at the same time over 90 percent of Americans would no longer have to itemize their deductions. <br> No doubt Trump will be slammed for having refused to release his tax returns during the campaign. Trump doesn’t deny he employed legal means to lower his tax burden as much as possible. But he says many tax provisions should be sunsetted. “One of the major reasons Iam running is to reform our broken tax code,” he told an audience in Colorado in September. “Who better to fix it then someone who knows just how crazy it is?” <br> “What might compel [action], especially in this era of populism, is this broader sense of how much some folks are getting away with, lawfully or not,” says Sage Eastman, a lobbyist at Mehlman Castagnetti and former top aide to retired House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.)The trick, he says, is to make sure that corporate welfare and egregious tax provisions for special interests are addressed as part of any reform <br> Why is tax reform so important? <br> For the Obama-Hillary team of economic experts, permanent subpar growth is not a crisis. Wealthyspecial interests are prospering in an easy money environment while their lower-income voters are promised more social programs. <br> It already has. We are living through the weakest expansion since World War Two. President Obama has yet to preside over a single year in which the economy grew by 3 percent. The Federal Reserve does not project the economy to grow above 2 percent through 2019, and its longer run expectations are for the economy to grow about 1.8 percent a year. Current signals are bleak -- factory orders have been down for 22 straight months and business optimism is at the lowest level since the financial crisis. <br> Trump’s economic team indicts currentpolicy makers as too complacent about the anemic economic growth of the last decade, “If we slash regulations, tap intoour bountiful domestic energy reserves and reduce business taxes while avoiding a trade war we could see an explosion of economic growth,” says Steve Moore, a Fox News contributor and economist at the Heritage Foundation. <br> Because tax and budget issues can’t be filibustered in the Senate they require only a simple majority vote. 
 For nearly seventeen months now, I presumed that Donald Trump was playing an elaborate game of chicken with the American people. <br> But Trump kept going – through the primaries, then the general election, to a stunning Election Night upset that earns him a four-year stay in a white, albeit less ornate mansion that’s a short stroll from the fancier hotel he recently opened in the nation’s capital. <br> Repeat, exhale . . . then say it again. <br> The trick now: solving the Bill McKay question. That’s the fictional politician Robert Redford played in the 1972 movie “The Candidate,” which ends with the senator-elect asking: “What do we now?”. <br> 1. Seize the Moment. I was going to start this by suggesting Trump spend a week in Palm Beach seclusion for some much-needed RR. That can wait until Thanksgiving and beyond, when it’s time for the big transition decisions that can be done behind the scenes. <br> Trump should invite Hillary Clinton for a private lunch. He should also let it be known that he wants to sit down with President Obama and discuss an amicable transition. <br> In 1824, it was John Quincy Adams staving off a populist challenge from Andrew Jackson, the man who statue sits in Lafayette Park, across the street from the North Portico of the White House. <br> This could have been the scenario in 2020. Much to everyone’s surprise, the revolution came four years ahead of schedule, with the unlikeliest of generals leading the charge. <br> 3. Time to Let Go. Assuming Trump is able to be a gracious winner (and his speech Wednesday night was a good start), it’s time to pivot out of campaign mode. He’s now tasked with acting as a statesman, not a showman treating presidential political like a reality TV show. <br> For Trump to have any semblance of dignified leadership, he has to let go of the petty insults and juvenile denigrations that are simply unbecoming of a president. <br> 4. Meet With GOP Thought Leaders. Can Trump work with a Republican Congress? Some members will be on board right away; for others, it will take time (hint: handing out presidential goodies has a way of healing wounds). <br> There’s nothing stopping Trump from holding a series of dinner salons with influential conservatives in New York (The Wall Street Journal editorial board, for example) and in the District of Columbia (Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, George Will, to name just a few). <br> 5. Put Someone in The West Wing Who’ll Challenge You. Throughout the saga that was the Trump campaign, there was always the question of adult supervision: an aide, a confidante who could tell Trump things he didn’t want to hear and convince him to moderate bad habits. <br> This is a job for the new chief of staff. Who has the stature to pull this off? New Gingrich? Rudy Giuliani? Would either be willing to be the West Wing’s bad cop, confronting Trump when they think he’s wrong on policy, strategy or execution? <br> 6. Build a Cabinet of Insiders and Outsiders. Are we in store for talk of another “Team Of Rivals” approach to building a presidential cabinet (in reality, the gang Barack Obama assembled wasn’t all that Lincoln-esque). <br> A reminder for Trump: in addition to promising to drain the Washington, D.C. swamp, he began the campaign vowing to bring a business sensibility to the federal government. If he doesn’t sprinkle his cabinet with secretaries possessing a private sector, outsiders’ perspective, then the president-elect has broken his first pledge. <br> Most new administrations get a period of grace before the press starts turning the screws. Not Trump – certainly not after months of demonizing his press entourage. <br> Just as stressful for the press secretary will be dealing with the new president when there’s bad press – that’s not an if, but a when. We know Trump can be overly sensitive to negative coverage. If he’s smart, he resists the urge to storm into the Briefing Room and tell the press corps what’s on his mind. <br> For Trump, this first big speech is more than the opening act of his presidency. It’s about making a good first impression with a skeptical public. He foes that by demonstrating the enormity of the vow he will have just taken. <br> Trump should task a team to study how past presidents approached their first address, pair it with some solid polling and focus groups, and keep the rhetoric to a minimum and the style muted. If so, Trump just might get off to a good start. <br> Here is a list of 13 things Trump could do in his first day on the job: <br> And maybe the biggest blow of all: he could kill the Iran nuclear deal. <br> Bill Clinton and Barack Obama almost didn’t get that second term because they bit off more than they could chew once they took office. For each, a big reach on health care reform would have devastating consequences I midterm elections. <br> So where should Trump start? I’d choose tax reform. There’s arguably more bipartisan consensus on that than anything else he’s proposed. And the promise of new revenue will help justify any extra dough Trump wants to spend on a Pentagon buildup or an infrastructure blueprint. 
 The historic 2016 election suggests very strongly that despite the relatively close popular vote and somewhat wider, but still significant electoral margin, Democrats need to rethink their politics, policies and approach. <br> But most of all, the outcome reflects a clear sense that the Democratic party cannot and will not be able to win elections unless it moves back to the center of the electorate. <br> The Democrats now have to put aside partisanship and seek to find common ground with Donald Trump on issues like immigration, tax reform on both corporate and individual level and most of all on infrastructure given our crumbling roads, bridges and highways. There is so much more that we can work on together than politicians acknowledge and a majority of Americans have long wished that politicians in Washington would work with one another. <br> The Democrats have to make it clear that they will seek consensus and compromise. For the Democratic party to feel in any way that the closeness of the race is an indication that they should accept the politics of the far left would be a profound mistake. <br> To this end, in one sense, the far left agenda contributed greatly to Secretary Clinton’s loss and it’s certainly one of the reasons that we need a change in the party if we are to return to the strength and ideological and substantive positioning the party achieved in the 1990s when I worked for Bill Clinton. 
 Donald Trump is again gaining on Hillary Clinton. Is it because of ObamaCare? Is it because of WikiLeaks? Or could it be because frustrated voters demand change, and that Clinton is the poster child for the status quo? Trump is not the perfect messenger, to be sure, but he is embracing a perfect message: it’s time to shake up the establishment, or, as he says, to “drain the swamp.” It is time for a new Contract with the American Voter, and he is offering just that. <br> Predictably, the mainstream media focused on Trump’s threats to sue his female accusers instead of the content of his speech, which was a shame. Nonetheless, as he has continued to campaign on some of the promises contained in that program, voters are paying attention. Simply put, he is saying what the majority of Americans wants to hear, and Hillary is not. She sounds out of touch with the country, because she is. <br> By contrast, whether it is calling for term limits on members of Congress, or freezing the size of the federal workforce, Trump is laying out ideas that voters applaud. <br> Trump is calling for a 5-year ban on government officials becoming lobbyists, a lifetime ban on White House workers lobbying on behalf of a foreign government and a “complete” ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for candidates in American elections. <br> By highlighting corruption issues, Trump reminds voters that Hillary is entangled in endless controversies, almost all of which have to do with the questionable means by which the Clintons have personally amassed hundreds of millions of dollars. <br> Trump also promised to protect American workers, by renegotiating our trade deals, by holding China and other trading partners to account, by encouraging domestic energy production and by redirecting taxpayer money from overseas climate control ventures into domestic infrastructure projects. <br> He also promised to launch tax reform aimed at growing the economy, to employ private-public partnerships in rebuilding our infrastructure, send education dollars and policy-making back to communities, where they belong, and repeal and replace ObamaCare. The list of common-sense proposals goes on to include securing our borders and tamping down crime. <br> It was a gift to those worried that our economy is incapable of providing opportunity, and that, thanks to failing schools and crumbling infrastructure, our country is becoming uncompetitive. <br> People sense that nothing can be fixed until everything is fixed, that incrementalism is not enough. <br> The real question before voters is whether they will be bold enough to elect a candidate who wants to change the trajectory of the country, to push back against the failed policies that have crushed our entrepreneurs and degraded our schools, to clean out the corrupt stables of Washington and to give power back to the people. 
 Not since George and Martha in the play “Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” or for older readers Don Ameche and Frances Langford in the radio comedy “The Bickersons,” have we seen the kind of verbal pugilism practiced in Sunday night’s presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. <br> Sunday night, Clinton recycled the familiar Democrat playbook that the wealthy aren’t paying their “fair share” in taxes, when the real issue is that government already receives record amounts in tax money, but misspends much of it and never seems to have enough. <br> In the debate, Clinton said she “only” wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, not the middle class. ATR notes she has said just the opposite on many occasions. It calculates that if all of her tax proposals are enacted, it would cost taxpayers $1 trillion over 10 years and gives the following examples: <br> She wants a tax on sodas that ATR estimates would add $2.16 per 12-pack. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) charged this would violate her pledge to protect the middle class from tax hikes: “Frankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal violates her pledge.” <br> Trump purports to favor school choice, which is an essential tool for escaping poverty and would do more than any federal anti-poverty program to help poor children obtain a good education. Hillary Clinton claims to favor school choice, but only as far as publicly funded charter schools. Since she and many Democrats receive political contributions from teachers unions, it’s unlikely she’ll let poor children escape failing schools. In the latest debate she tried to claim credit for all she has done for children, but what she has not done by refusing to support school vouchers, which allow parents to use public funds to pay for some or all of their child’s private school tuition, overcomes whatever good she may have accomplished. <br> The hypocrisy meter is in hyper drive when you consider that some of the same Democrats condemning Trump said of Bill Clinton’s numerous affairs “it’s just about sex” and had nothing to do with his performance as president. These are people who still hold John F. Kennedy in high regard, despite his long list of women with whom he had sex, including secreting some into the White House. 
 It’s a strange time to be in St. Louis. <br> Maybe strangest of all: the political Shocktoberfest that is the 2016 presidential election, culminating in the second debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the city’s Washington University. <br> To say nothing of morbid curiosity: a pre-debate survey of Washington University students came up with this summation: “a gruesome debate about who is more an enabler of sexual assault.” <br> Trump admitted embarrassment, but quickly dismissed it as “locker-room talk.” Cooper pushed him on the subject – was he a groper, did he force himself on women? – but Trump wouldn’t play along. <br> The smiling Hillary we saw throughout the first debate on Long Island? She didn’t make the trip west. <br> Did Clinton defend her husband? Actually, she invoked Michelle Obama: “when they go low, you go high.” Make of that what you will. Then she belittled Trump for failing to make past apologies, after which Trump upped the ante by promising to sic a special prosecutor against Clinton if he’s elected. <br> The highlights: <br> That segued into one of Clinton’s weaker moments: defending her plan to expand the Syrian refugee population from 10,000 to 65,000. Clinton invoked a bloodied boy, but couldn’t resist trying to bloody Trump as a recruiting tool for ISIS and chumming the waters yet again over his Iraq war position. <br> Then came the question of the WikiLeaks passage in which Clinton supposedly said a politician sometimes needs “a public and a private position” on certain topics. Hillary tried to make it sound Lincolnesque. Equating Wall Street reform in a paid with the fight to abolish slavery? Sounds like a stretch. <br> Two complaints about this debate: <br> And the moderators: CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Martha Raddatz were more aggressive in policing Trump’s time and parsing his words (Raddatz, in particular, on Aleppo). Must there always be a question of a fair fight? <br> Something else the poll revealed: only 12% of Republicans think Trump should quit the race; 74% think the GOP establishment should continue to back him. <br> I give this debate to Trump. He was in better form than the first encounter in Hofstra. This time around, he wasn’t as clunky when defending his record. Unlike the first debate, when he started strong but fell apart, Trump improved as the night went on. <br> Clinton’s style and presentation were better than Trump’s – she seemed visibly more comfortable cradling the mike and approaching the audience. <br> In all, it was an evening that will be hard to forget. Trump thinks Clinton should go to jail. Judging by the look on her face, Clinton would like to condemn Trump to a more subterranean existence – which is funny, since it’s Trump who thinks Hillary is satanic. 
 What would you think of an individual or a company that earned a pre-tax profit of $29.9 million in one year, paid nothing in taxes and still received a $3.5 million refund? <br> In other words the Times took advantage of tax laws that only good tax attorneys understand and in doing so was no different than Donald Trump. The Times, which obtained Trump's supposedly confidential tax returns, made a big deal out of the Republican presidential candidate's use of loopholes to avoid paying taxes. <br> The federal government is taking in record amounts of tax revenue, but is approaching a $20 trillion debt. The problem, noted Ronald Reagan, is not that the American people are taxed too little, but that their government spends too much. <br> Leaking sealed or private documents is not a new strategy for Democrats. When Barack Obama was a candidate in the Democratic Senate primary in Illinois, the sealed divorce papers of his opponent, Jack Ryan, were shamelessly used to help defeat the family values Republican. Had that dirty trick not been used, Obama might never have been a senator, much less president. <br> The left's narrative -- stated and implied -- is that everything government does is good, and so it is only right that taxpayers pay increasing amounts of taxes no matter how irresponsible government is in spending them. In this thinking, government has replaced God and taxes have replaced the collection plate, which at least amasses voluntary contributions. <br> Republicans in high tax states and at the federal level should use the left's smoking gun on Trump's taxes as a weapon to demand tax reform. Flat and fair taxes have been suggested. Anything is better than the current system. Real tax reform would ensure that Trump paid some taxes, though they would likely be lower for him than for everyone else who pays them. 
 You don’t forget moments like this – the ones that come so unexpectedly, shoving a pit into your stomach. I was 21-years-old and nearing the due date for my husband Bryon and my first baby. That’s when the phone call came: “Kristi, your dad is stuck in a grain bin.” I knew instantly what it meant. <br> Not too long after the accident, while we were still trying to pick up the pieces, our family received a letter from the IRS. Because of this tragedy, one that undermined our sense of security, the death tax was now about to undermine our financial security. <br> I couldn’t imagine losing the farm my family had built. After all, it was my dad’s dream to pass it on to us kids. <br> We needed the machinery to continue the operation and I could hear my dad’s voice telling me that selling land wasn’t an option either. After all, I can’t tell you how many times he said: “Don’t ever sell land. God isn’t making any more.” <br> I have never understood why the federal government thought it was appropriate to go after families with this double tax – especially in a time of crisis. My family had already paid taxes on the equipment, the land, and any other assets. Now, we had to pay taxes on it again because my dad had died. It’s not right. <br> Earlier this fall, the House Ways and Means Committee offered a blueprint for tax reform designed to grow families’ paychecks, the workforce, and the American economy. In doing so, we worked to shrink the tax burden for every family and streamline the tax code to make it more simple and fair. This includes eliminating damaging add-on taxes – most notably, the death tax. 
 On Oct. 2, Colombians will vote on whether to approve or reject a flawed peace agreement reached by the government and the FARC narco-terror group. <br> In effect, Santos has wagered too much of Colombia’s interest on a peace deal, forcing government negotiators to grant many costly concessions. The lack of jail time for war criminals, the inclusion of special economic benefits to demobilized guerrillas not available to law-abiding citizens and the granting of automatic congressional seats to a FARC political party make this deal unacceptable to many Colombians who have suffered from the FARC’s 50-year terror campaign. <br> If rejected, years of negotiations will have been wasted, and the country will face a return of war and of a host of economic and societal problems largely ignored by the government – all without the international goodwill and financial support which the peace process has garnered. <br> For all its faults, the agreement to end the conflict will provide opportunity for renewed economic growth and stability for Colombia that was previously unavailable. The government will be able to extend its presence into previously ungoverned spaces, allowing the private sector to regain safe access to and develop natural resources which will foster growth for the country. The end of the conflict will also attract renewed foreign investment crucial to stimulating the economy. <br> At the same time, Santos and others should be wary of overselling the benefits of the agreement with predictions of dramatic economic growth and social progress to an already skeptical public that has too often felt the sting of false promises. <br> A weak government presence, outdated investment and tax codes, deep societal and economic divisions, corruption and criminality will remain after the agreement and must be addressed before Colombia can take full advantage of the opportunity presented by peace. <br> While the conflict with the FARC would end, remaining organized criminal elements such as the ELN and BACRIM will still be a source of violence that will continue to require significant attention and resources to combat. <br> To prevent history from repeating itself, the Colombian government will have to be vigilant in ensuring that the vast wealth the FARC has derived from narcotrafficking does not find its way into the political campaigns of its candidates and that criminal entities do not reoccupy the space left after demobilization.

 Environmentalists should be pleased with Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention Thursday night, because it was largely recycled talking points we have heard for decades. <br> First there was the charge that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump cannot be trusted with the nuclear codes. The same was said about Ronald Reagan in 1980. Democrats called him a cowboy who might blow up the world. Instead, he rebuilt America's military, as Trump has promised to do, and helped bring down the Soviet Union. Can Hillary be trusted with classified documents? <br> Hillary Clinton's proposals will add hugely to the debt, now approaching $20 trillion. But wait. She will pay for all this new stuff by taxing those obscenely wealthy Wall Street people, who paid her and her husband millions to speak to them. No one knows what about. She won't release the transcripts. <br> -- Increasing income taxes by $350 billion in the form of a 28 percent cap on itemized deductions. <br> -- There's the euphemistically named fairness tax of $400 billion she says would restore basic fairness to our tax code and an increase in the death tax. Real fairness would eliminate the undecipherable tax code and replace it with a fair tax, but Democrats would never go for that. <br> To my surprise, many in the mainstream media, who couldn't stop talking about the historical significance of the first woman nominated for president by a major political party, thought her speech fell flat. Robert Draper of The New York Times tweeted: Not well written, not well delivered. Tom Bevan of Real Clear Politics tweeted: Clinton is giving the eighth best speech of the convention. Ben Dreyfuss of the far-left magazine, Mother Jones, tweeted: This speech isn't great. <br> Polls increasingly indicate a majority of voters want real change this time around. More people are being drawn to Trump's message that the political system is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is crooked. <br> Donald Trump also suffers from high negatives, but because of Hillary Clinton's thin record of accomplishment she will have to tear down Trump because as Kimberley Strassel concludes in her Wall Street Journal column, It's Hillary against Hillary. This November is about whether Americans can look at 40 years of Clinton chicanery and nearly a decade of broken Obama promises, and still pull the lever for her. 
 In the 1970s, the “Dirty Harry” movies presaged the death of politically correct liberalism and the rise of Reagan Republicanism. “Dirty Harry” was a San Francisco cop played by Clint Eastwood, who was legendary for apprehending killers, rapists and thieves. His secret was that he broke politically correct police force rules with reckless abandon, as audiences cheered. <br> They regularly save the world from terrorist mass murderers, but they can’t always stop terrorist assaults from harming innocent bystanders. The Avengers consequently take the rap for not caring about “collateral damage.” In the opening scenes, the Avengers foil a vicious band of terrorists threatening the world with a stolen biological weapon in Lagos, Nigeria. But as they fought, one terrorist explosive rebounds to kill nearby humanitarian volunteers from the Wakandan tribe. <br> But as the Wakandan King addresses representatives of the 117 nations in celebration of their new global accountability treaty, the terrorists blow up the UN building in which they are meeting, apparently killing them all. <br> Donald Trump is the political beneficiary today of the surge of American nationalism, in which the American people yearn for someone to speak up for the USA. If Trump can just accomplish a few simple, obvious things as president, he can carry this mantle of Captain America. <br> Trump has already shown he knows what needs to be done, proposing tax reform with lower tax rates than even Reagan accomplished. Lower marginal tax rates, the rate on the next dollar of income produced, provide incentives for job creating investment, whether starting new businesses or expanding existing ones. The resulting increased demand for labor drives up wages. <br> Reliable low cost energy would be the foundation for the renaissance of world leading American manufacturing, which would mean the revival of America’s world leading middle class. These policies would be enough to unleash a booming, world leading economic recovery, which still lurks within this economy, yearning to break out. 
 IIn 1939 a young man opened a car dealership to realize the American dream. He built his business up from nothing. He worked hard and he created jobs. <br> When the man passed away, his business was passed along to his only child who wanted to continue in his father’s footsteps. After the funeral, while still in grief, the IRS came to collect 55 percent of the value of the business from the son. He nearly declared bankruptcy. <br> Today, the son still runs his father’s car dealership and employs more than one hundred dedicated workers. That son is me. <br> The reality of our tax code is that it is a bloated, costly mess of business-killing measures that does nothing but line the pockets of an out-of-control, wasteful federal government that is 19 trillion dollars in debt. <br> While politicians – many of whom have never worked in the private sector, let alone owned a business themselves – devote all of their attention to Wall Street, they have forgotten about the 28 million small businesses that are forced to play defense every single day. <br> I first ran for Congress four years ago to fight for moms and dads who have risked everything to achieve the American dream. To fight for those who do not have the means to hire teams of lawyers and accountants to navigate our 70,000 page tax code and comply with unnecessary rules and regulations. <br> Jumpstart America will implement repatriation at 5 percent so U.S. companies are incentivized to return home. <br> It is for that reason that my plan calls for help for cash flowing middle class families and the businesses they run. 
 According to one expert, the average American unwittingly commits three felonies every day, due to the massive size and scope of criminal laws in the United States. As shocking as that is, somehow the idea is even more concerning during tax season. After all, according to the Tax Foundation, federal tax laws and regulations have grown to over 10 million words in length. <br> The tax code is the way the government exercises power over the people, and enables a few to become more powerful at the expense of many others. This needs to change, and a serious overhaul of the tax code is the only way to ensure equity in economic opportunity and wage growth for all Americans. <br> Ordinary Americans who are dutifully making an effort to properly file their taxes can only hope for the best to make the task easy. Those who can afford an accountant are fortunate to have someone who can handle the tangled web of forms, deductions and general filing process for them, but not everyone is so lucky. The tax code has grown so complex that just the instruction book for filing a 1040 form has grown to over 200 pages. Even former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner failed to pay the taxes he owed, explaining that he made “careless and unintentional mistakes.” If Tim Geithner can’t manage to file his taxes properly, odds are rough for the rest of us. <br> An unnecessarily complex tax system raises barriers to opportunity for every American. Rather than allowing the spirit of American entrepreneurship to simply flourish and inspire new generations to follow their dreams of starting a business, it is as though the government is actively trying to make it more difficult. <br> Hispanics in the U.S. start businesses at double the national rate. The number of entrepreneurs could be higher, but more are being held back by the unreasonable and costly demands of occupational licensing requirements and the bewildering complexity of the tax code. <br> Our current system favors the powerful and the wealthy. It empowers individuals and entities that have the resources to hire armies of lobbyists to carve out loopholes and exceptions, and accountants and lawyers to find more loopholes and ensure compliance, or to play defense if something goes wrong. The tax code is the way the government exercises power over the people, and enables a few to become more powerful at the expense of many others. This needs to change, and a serious overhaul of the tax code is the only way to ensure equity in economic opportunity and wage growth for all Americans. 
 On Tuesday Pfizer Inc., one of America's iconic pharmaceutical companies, announced that it is dropping it's bid to merge with Dublin-based Allergan. <br> Pfizer must now pay up to $400 million to Allergan for expenses associated with the cancelled wedding. Shareholders in both companies are the big losers. So are patients hoping for new miracle cures for diseases. <br> Pfizer was only one of the latest major American company that had announced it is packing up and moving to a foreign country because of lower tax rates in India, Mexico, Canada, Ireland, and almost anywhere else on the globe. First it was Burger King, then Medtronics, and then Pfizer, Johnson Controls and on and on. Can Disney and Mickey Mouse be far behind? <br> Obama complained that these companies are moving to avoid paying their fair share of the taxes. His new inversion rules will only make America less competitive by effectively preventing companies like Pfizer from ever leaving. This only makes it less likely that technology, manufacturing, drug, and financial services company are formed in America to begin with. If you can't ever leave, you don't come in the first place. <br> There was a much simpler and less punitive solution here. ‎ Mr. President: why not just cut the U.S. tax rate to make America tax competitive? Shouldn't it be a wake up call when socialist Sweden and France have lower corporate taxes than we do? <br> Our corporate tax rate is almost 40 percent and many countries in the rest of the world are closer to 20 percent. ‎Every year other nations around the world cut their tax rates some more. Japan was the latest tax cutter. <br> Republicans like Paul Ryan, now the House Speaker, have wanted tax reform for years. ‎ <br> Small businesses saw their highest tax rate rise from 35 to 41 percent under Obama. <br> The best way to stimulate growth is to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 or 20 percent right now. Then let companies bring back the $2 trillion stored in offshore accounts and pay a 5 percent penalty tax. This could raise $100 billion and bring repatriated capital back to the states where the money will be invested by American businesses. <br> Why not do what Reagan and JFK did? Cut tax rates and the businesses and jobs will come back home. 
 By now it is quite clear that Americans are not supportive of another Washington bailout of entities that have taken irresponsible risks, whether these be banks or municipalities. Particularly in the midst of a weak recovery and a recent market downturn, the prospect of Congress rewarding reckless behavior by putting taxpayers on the hook is not going to appeal to the average voter. <br> Congress has a vital interest in ensuring that Puerto Rico survives its current debt crisis and builds a better, more sustainable future. It should not squander that opportunity and risk a social and economic calamity in the process. <br> Puerto Rico is in the middle of a financial crisis, and longstanding issues with Medicare and Medicaid have only further exacerbated the problem. Though Puerto Rico has the highest participation in the nation for Medicare Advantage, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the island has experienced an 11 percent cut in MA reimbursement rates. This is why I recently sent a letter to the Department of Treasury asking them to provide Puerto Rico with temporary relief from the fee under Section 9010 of the ACA during the Territory’s economic crisis. Territory residents are not eligible to access the ACA marketplace to purchase insurance and do not receive any tax credits to purchase coverage. This relief would greatly benefit the the people of Puerto Rico. <br> The dimensions of the island’s plight are stark. The government has already endured several smaller defaults and faces a raft of lawsuits from the creditors left holding the bag. Large payments—of principal as well as interest—loom in May and June; unable to meet those obligations, government officials are frantically negotiating with creditor groups in hopes of restructuring some $49 billion of the total $72 billion debt. <br> Default is not an option. Despite the rhetoric of some who advocate letting Puerto Rico twist in the wind and pay the consequences without any federal action to allow bankruptcy status, such a course would be both catastrophic and unsustainable, all but guaranteeing more dramatic action and expenditure of taxpayer dollars when the dominoes start to fall. <br> As Puerto Rico’s 3.5 million residents quickly realize how desperate their situation has become in the wake of a default, with cutoffs of services and social chaos, that influx to the mainland is sure to spike. These transfers in population have increased federal and state government expenses as Medicaid eligibility levels for Puerto Rico tend to be significantly lower and a great deal of Puerto Rican immigration will receive Medicaid and CHIP benefits, costing taxpayers billions of dollars over several years. <br> Puerto Rico’s debt crisis presents a unique opportunity to put some pro-growth policies in place and demand fiscal transparency on the island. Over-regulation, a mandated minimum wage that the island’s economy cannot sustain, the abuse of workers’ compensation, and the withdrawal of one of the world’s largest U.S. Naval facilities a decade ago have led to a stagnant economy for residents with 40 percent of the population on food stamps and workforce participation at a miserable 40 percent. <br> Congress has a vital interest in ensuring that Puerto Rico survives its current debt crisis and builds a better, more sustainable future. It should not squander that opportunity and risk a social and economic calamity in the process. 
 Some credit Aesop and his “Fox and the Lion” fable with first coining the phrase: “familiarity breeds contempt.” <br> A better Aesop fable in honor of Thursday night’s gathering in Houston, the tenth such GOP debate dating back to August? <br> A better choice: “The Frightened Hares,” given the Republican establishment’s growing panic over the very real prospect of Trump actually winning the party’s nomination. <br> Did Trump Lose Ground? In a word: no. <br> From the time he first latched on to illegal immigration and changed the dynamics of this race, it’s been clear that Trump knows how to speak to the fed-up side of the GOP electorate – more so than any other candidate still alive in the race. <br> The establishment hates the man’s style and antics, but the one-third-plus of the primary electorate that’s propelled Trump to the front of the multi-candidate pack – and won’t be leaving him anytime soon – adores the show. Which is why Trump likely will fare well on Super Tuesday, despite spending a great deal of time on the defensive and on the bad side of some pretty nasty put-downs. <br> Rubio must have heard the griping, as he went right after Trump on the get-go. It began with allegations of Trump hiring foreign workers for his Palm Beach estate. After that: construction labor forces, Trump-signature products manufactured overseas, the lawsuit over the entity formerly known as Trump University. And on it went, throughout the night. <br> This tactic will get Rubio a lot of air time between now and Super Tuesday. It’s also a second-guesser’s delight, as the cling-free Trump has been the Teflon Don of this field. <br> But on Thursday night, Cruz seemed consistently missing from the action. Part of it had to do with Rubio and Trump noisily locking horns. But having to ask Wolf Blitzer for a chance to weigh in on Obamacare? It seemed . . . well, kind of weak for a debate champ on his home Texas turf. <br> If Thursday night was closing the deal in Tuesday’s Texas primary, Cruz failed at the task. <br> To be fair, both gentlemen brought this on themselves – just as they have in previous debates. <br> Carson decided months ago that he’d speak only when spoken to. Yes, the retired neurosurgeon had a valid complaint when he pointed out to Hewitt that he was left out of the tax-reform discussion. And he scored the other big sound bite of the night, underscoring the fact that he was going unnoticed amidst the food fight: “Can someone attack me, please?” <br> A final thought: <br> At this point, with only two scheduled GOP debates remaining (March 3 in Michigan; March 10 in Florida), the Republican field should be approaching its closing arguments. <br> The 150-minute debate in Houston underscored how the situation is driving mainstream Republicans nuts. Trump gets attacked all night long – in the process, giving Hillary Clinton’s oppo team writer’s cramp as it races to jot down the many vulnerabilities – yet he seems impervious to attacks personal, professional and policy-wise. 
 America needs a new 21st Century tax code that is built for growth -- the growth of families’ paychecks, the growth of local businesses, and the growth of our economy.Ways and Means Republicans believe we have a responsibility to work on this challenge now. That’s why we’re holding a hearing at our committee Wednesday about international tax reform – a critical component of our comprehensive plan tooverhaul our tax system from top to bottom. <br> To put this in perspective, in the two decades leading up to 2004, we averaged two “inversions” of substantial American businesses per year. In the decade through 2014, we averaged four per year. In 2015, there were six more. And if the pace so far this year continues, the three in January might become 30 by the end of the year. <br> We must address the real root of the problem – our broken tax code that discourages investment and growth. Our hearing Wednesday will examine the driving forces behind inversions and foreign mergers and how we can develop policies that will prevent more American jobs from moving overseas.&nbsp;The policies we develop will also be designed to attract more foreign firms and jobs to locate to the U.S. <br> We will also examine how other countries are taking actions with their tax systems that disproportionally burden American global businesses and ultimately, our workers. <br> TheOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in itsBase Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project has advanced ideas that will make it harder for our companies to compete and grow. Worldwide American companies are rightly concerned that the BEPS project will result in higher foreign taxes, higher compliance costs, and double taxation. As countries around the world incorporate the BEPS ideas into their tax systems, many more companies could be forced to restructure their business operations and move U.S. activities, such as research and development, overseas. <br> A direct result of these global developments is the loss of jobs for hardworking Americans. The loss of an American global business to a foreign merger or foreign takeover means many of its headquarters jobs will move to the foreign jurisdiction. Because these companies currently have American suppliers and other local businesses that support their operations, the negative impact will ripple throughout our economy. When business decisions are made in the new foreign headquarters, foreign vendors will replace many of these American small businesses. <br> To deliver the simpler, fairer and flatter tax system Americans deserve, members of our Committee will think fresh and boldly. We will examine the whole range of tax ideas – consumption tax, reformed income tax, and any other approach that will be pro-growth. There is no perfect way to tax, but there are proven ways to grow investment – and that’s what we will focus on. 
 We are just one week away from the Iowa Caucuses. The presumed front runner last year at this time? Jeb Bush. Or rather “Jeb!” as his campaign has dubbed him, hoping to add a little excitement to the mix (and possibly to underplay his famous last name.) &nbsp; <br> Not only are his poll numbers far from where his supporters thought they would be by now, Jeb is also acting as spoiler, destroying the candidate most likely to beat Hillary Clinton. In doing so, it appears his nasty campaign against Marco Rubio has wrecked his own chances. In clobbering his popular rival and one-time mentee, Bush has shown himself either incapable of bucking the operatives running his Super PAC, or full of baloney. <br> For months, Jeb Bush publicly agonized over whether he should run for president. Bush worried that he would be forced into the political gutter, claiming that he would only run if his campaign could focus “on the issues.” He was eager to lay out his prescriptions for solving the country’s ills, to push education and tax reform, for instance, but not keen to engage in a cage match with the other contestants. He wanted to run “joyfully” because he thought the country needed a candidate who would “lift the country’s spirits.” <br> Some of the ads target Rubio’s attendance record in the Senate, and his numerous missed votes. Some paint him a flip-flopper, changing positions with the shifting political winds. And then there was a cheesy ad mocking Rubio’s boots, of all things, which surely was another rung down into the gutter. (In fairness, the New York Times ran no less than four pieces on Rubio’s boots.) <br> Has the assault on Rubio helped Bush? Certainly not in Iowa, where R2R has spent $8.5 million blasting Rubio. In that state, Bush is languishing in fifth place with only 3 percent of the vote, compared to 14 percent going to Rubio and 37 percent to Trump. In more moderate New Hampshire, a state where the Bush-Rubio rivalry is critical to both campaigns, the Bush Super PAC has spent $7.5 million attacking Rubio. <br> Perhaps more important, the attack ads haven’t helped Bush nationally. Back in September the former Florida governor claimed an almost 10 percent support amongst GOP primary voters; now he’s under 5 percent. In terms of how voters see Bush, the news is not good. Some 54 percent have an unfavorable view of Jeb compared to 32 percent who see him more kindly. <br> Jeb Bush has disappointed followers who expected him to run as he had promised, on solving the nation’s issues. As a successful governor of a successful state, Bush brings gravitas and stature to the race. He has also disappointed those who expected Bush’s ability to raise huge early money to put him and keep him out front; Donald Trump upended those expectations, and every other aspect of the race. <br> The most likely answer is that he won by being himself, not the puppet of his Super PAC. Though there is supposed to be clear distance between the campaign and R2R, Murphy’s influence is undoubted. Murphy and Bush have worked together on campaigns since 1997; Murphy claimed in a Bloomberg interview, “I understand what Jeb wants, I understand what kind of campaign he wants…” So, was Bush’s promise of a “joyous” campaign utter bunk, or has he been hijacked by his operatives? <br> That was not Bush’s only awkward campaign moment. Like Hillary Clinton chastising the banks that pay her so well, the more inauthentic Jeb becomes, the more likely he is to flop. Perhaps that’s why he can barely deliver a sentence that doesn’t include a verbal hitch. In his head, he is thinking one thing, but his directors have him saying another. <br> Take back control of the campaign, ditch the nastiness, and he might have a shot. 
 Somebody out there in TV Cable Land has a sense of humor. <br> The good news: FBN didn’t take the bait and turn the night into a conversation about Southern discomfort – the notion that the modern GOP is too Dixiefied in its social conservatism to win national elections. Even though the debate was held in a state – yes, governed by a vibrant Indian-American woman – that took down its Confederate flag only last year. <br> With but one gripe: tax reform didn’t come up until far too late into the evening. There’s a wide gulf within this field over tax reform – in particular, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (a flat-taxer) and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (a more traditional rate-reducer). Voters deserve to hear more. And hopefully they will, unless Cruz and Rubio devote their energies to attacking their respective Senate records as they did at the debate’s end. <br> That leaves Ben Carson as the odd man out. Nothing personal against Dr. Carson: he’s a wonderful man with a candidacy that’s exceeded expectations. But his moment seems to have passed. <br> For openers, it was a reminder that Cruz, like him or not, knows his way around a debate stage. He framed himself as one half of a humble couple of limited means in dismissing this week’s New York Times hit piece on his Goldman Sachs loan. <br> A word of caution here for the Cruz Crew: Jeb Bush tangled with Trump; his candidacy cratered. The same is true of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Thursday’s lone debate holdout. Like falling into a black hole or marrying a Kardashian, the contact sport that is extended sparring with The Donald is a ticket to oblivion. Trump knows this, which is why he doesn’t relent. <br> A second observation: this was anticipated as an “everyone hates Marco” event – the rest of the establishment quartet ganging up on the Florida senator, who’s pushing for third place in Iowa and second place in New Hampshire. <br> Third, it was, in fact, a pretty good night for Christie. He flashed some edge and was strong in clarifying his New Jersey record (point of irony: while the New Jersey governor talked guns, Scarlett O’Hara was blowing away a Yankee trooper on a Tara stairwell). <br> Finally, as for Bush, it was a middlin’-to-good night – he fared well at times, especially when he countered Trump’s Muslim ban. <br> The problem for Bush: it’s what Southerners call “catawampus” – a situation that’s gotten out of hand. The Bush super PAC is spending tens of millions of dollars on ads that effectively belittle other candidates but haven’t boosted Jeb’s poll numbers. Standing as he was at the end of the stage, the ex-frontrunner looked like he was from a distant planet, not the center of the solar system – a far cry from a year ago. 
 The Republican primary campaign may be great theater but GOP hopefuls are making the work of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a lot easier. <br> We know the tread-worn laments. Globalization, immigration and automation in factories and now in the grocery stores are killing good paying jobs, high and unfairly administered corporate taxes are driving American companies abroad, and women, who in increasing numbers support children and spouses, still earning about 71 percent of what men do. <br> Most of this sounds too much like trickle-down economics. It doesn’t resonate well with voters, because life was getting tougher for working Americans during the Bush years too. <br> Tax reform must be fair and the nightmare complexity of April 15 and ideological-driven enforcement at the IRS must end. Instead, Trump and mainstream candidates promise to tinker with an arcane and fundamentally broken system and magically cut taxes and incentivize business without reducing revenue. <br> A conservative platform that would resonate would include: radical renegotiation of trade agreements to guarantee balanced trade and job opportunities for all participants; requiring health care providers and pharmaceutical companies to charge prices for procedures and drugs no higher than charged in Germany and Holland, which have similar insurance-based systems and more affordable insurance; canceling the individual and corporate income taxes in favor of a simple value added tax and a federal payment for each child under 21; and requiring employers to publish salaries for all employees and undertake and make public salary surveys that explain differences in compensation among job categories— a generous child allowance and such employer transparency would go a long way toward improving the lot of working women. <br> Those are attractive to many voters because they appear to offer quick relief but would further slow economic growth, raise prices and push down family incomes overall. 
 At the start of 2015 President Obama had a goal: use the blunt force of taxation to effectively kill 529 college savings plans. <br> It was a spectacular failure. The public backlash against his proposal was immediate, heartfelt, and fierce. <br> As the year comes to a close the Obama administration would prefer we all just forget the whole ordeal. There is scant coverage of the issue in beltway journalists’ end of year look-backs. But it is important to review what happened not as a way to spike the football, but as a lesson of what the Left might do to your savings if given full control of the federal government. <br> One of the reporters on the call provided the document to Americans for Tax Reform, whose tax policy director Ryan Ellis published a late night analysis ringing the alarm bell on the Obama 529 tax. <br> It took the mainstream media nearly a week to realize what was happening. On Jan. 22 the New York Times finally reported on the issue with an article headlined, “White House Proposals on 529 College Savings Plans Would Reduce Benefits.” On Jan. 23, the Washington Post came out with a piece titled “Critics Pounce on Obama’s Plan to Cut the Tax Benefits of 529 College Savings Plans,” and POLITICO deemed 529s “The Hot New Tax Debate.” <br> Embarrassingly for the White House, at the same time Team Obama was calling 529s “upside down,” “ineffective,” and “tilted towards the upper end,” Ellis and ATR rolled out a series of items detailing official White House and Obama family experience with 529s that told a different story. <br> It was also revealed that in July 2010, during a lengthy interview on ABC's Good Morning America, Obama cited his own 529 accounts as an example of how he can identify with the middle class. He was asked, Can you feel the pain directly that other Americans are feeling?&nbsp;His answer: <br> The hits kept coming. It turns out the Obama White House was for 529s before it was against them. <br> 529 plans are an attractive and convenient means of saving for college.</i> <br> “Today I want to highlight one program in particular, Section 529 savings plans. </i> <br> An official White House statement from the same day praised 529s as “a convenient, tax-preferred way for families to save for college.” <br> On Jan. 27, 2015 public pressure reached fever pitch. An unnamed White House official told the New York Times the 529 tax hike would be dropped. The 529 issue had become a “distraction,” said the official. <br> Even after formally dropping the 529 tax hike from the budget, the White House stood firm in support of the policy itself. During the Jan. 28 White House press briefing the following exchange took place: <br> White House spokesman Eric Schultz: “Sure. We do.” <br> A fitting coda. The tax is dead. For now. 
 Donating to charities is a part of American life. According to the World Giving Index, the United States is the most generous country in the world, followed by Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Britain. According to another study, ordinary individuals gave 73 percent of the money donated to U.S. charities in 2010 — more than $200 billion. <br> Loving your neighbor is not judged in dollars donated. In fact, it should not be judged at all. Anyone who gives something to someone in need expecting nothing in return is to be respected. <br> Americans should be proud that philanthropy and charitable giving is not just a practice of the wealthy. It is ingrained in our culture. <br> As we approach 2016 many candidates are advancing their tax plans and some incorporate the elimination of all deductions including the charitable deduction. These plans must be scrutinized and understood in the macro and micro of their economic cause and effect. <br> Congressional tax writers have spent months scouring the tax code in a complex effort to overhaul the nation’s tax laws, and insist they are looking at every provision with a fresh, scrutinizing gaze. But the broad group of senators contended that the charitable tax deduction is unique and should be left untouched as part of any overhaul effort. <br> “The charitable deduction is unique. It is the only provision that encourages taxpayers to give away a portion of their income for the benefit of others,” the senators wrote. “Analysis has repeatedly shown that proposals to cut, cap, or limit the charitable deduction could cause charitable donations to decline by billions of dollars annually. <br> Backers of the deduction cheered the letter, calling it a “clear signal” on the importance of the charitable deduction. <br> I implore all men and women of good will who are seeking the office to the presidency, U.S. Senate and House to preserve the charitable deduction. 
 As I’ve analyzed the field of viable presidential candidates for the past year, I’ve been in search of a conservative leader with three vital qualities -- experience, an abiding belief in the American people, and a clear vision for our future. <br> Marco is a leader who can unite conservatives and inspire all people. He was elected Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives by his peers, demonstrating that he is a leader among leaders. <br> Marco is effective, developing thoughtful policy initiatives and building broad coalitions on issues ranging from reducing the size of government to championing tax reform. <br> What’s far more important than experience alone however, is a belief not just in America, but in the American people. Too often I hear pundits and leaders speak in terms of the inevitable decline of our nation and without hope for the next generation of Americans. <br> The American people have done more to advance the cause of freedom and to improve the human condition than any society in the history of the world. <br> Finally, I am convinced that Marco Rubio’s conservative vision for the future of our country is his strongest qualification for the presidency. <br> I myself am the grandson of immigrants and have lived the dream of rising from ordinary circumstances to achieve the extraordinary. 
 Well, if CNBC got an F then Fox Business News gets an A. The winners of Tuesday night's GOP debate in Milwaukee were the audience and the Republican party.This wasn't just a debate. It was a tutorial on growth, taxes, health care, trade, regulation, and the Fed. Six random takeaways: 1. Every candidate argued for lower tax rates and closing loopholes and simplification. What a contrast with the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Rubio was the outlier. He argued for a tax credit as a way to help families. ‎He calls this a pro-family tax cut, but it doesn't help the economy. Rand Paul zinged him with the argument that his refundable credit is a $1 trillion entitlement program. 2. Sparks flew the most on issues of foreign policy, immigration, and trade.Trump got smacked down on immigration when he called for a deportation of 11 million people. Bush, Kasich, Rubio, and Fiorina were for an aggressive, interventionist foreign policy with more military spending. Trump and Paul argued for a hands off policy. <br> Kasich. ‎He referred to tax cuts as tax schemes.He defended bailouts. He got booed. His best line was balance the budget by cutting taxes. Cruz. The Texas senator gave a spirited defense of his tax cut plan. He argued that immigrants are driving down wages (sic). He argued for taking away power from the Federal Reserve. He needs to stop grimacing when he talks. Bush. The former Florida governor gave his strongest performance yet. He endorsed repealing every Obama rule. He defended his brother's actions in Iraq.Best line: when Trump talks about deportation there are high fives in the Clinton campaign. 
 The venues for the first two Republican presidential debates made perfect sense. Cleveland is the site of next summer’s Republican National Convention; the Reagan Library is a shrine to America's pre-eminent conservative. <br> That said, presidential politics isn’t real estate. As long as there’s a hot mic, a satellite feed and Donald Trump to juice the ratings, location doesn’t matter. <br> Money Talks. <br> A topic mostly overlooked in the first two debates, but taking center stage in round three: tax reform. For the 10 candidates, this is a soup-to-nuts menu: Jeb Bush’s plan to lower the top personal rate from 39.6 percent to 28 percent Marco Rubio weighs in at 35 percent, while eliminating estate and capital-gains taxes); Ben Carson’s 10 percent flat tax Rand Paul has it at 14.5 percent; Ted Cruz wanting to abolish the Internal Revenue Service; Trump (no Jolly Old Saint Nick, he) as the “Santa Claus” of the bunch. <br> Low (J)ebb. <br> In the last week alone, Jeb Bush slashed his campaign’s payroll, hunkered down with his family to assess the health of his candidacy and got off track at a Nevada event promoting Hispanic upward mobility by commenting on the relative hotness of television’s “Supergirl.” <br> Gentle Ben. <br> Trump wasted no time trying to reclaim the spotlight. In one tweet alone, last week he managed to insult Carson, the good people of Iowa and genetically modified corn. And he made mischief with Carson’s Seventh-day Adventist faith. <br> Upstairs, Downstairs. <br> Going up: Rubio, though it’s not a textbook climb. Given Bush’s struggles, Rubio is fast emerging as the GOP establishment’s favorite to save the party from itself (translation: no Trump, no Carson, no Cruz). <br> Going down: Paul. <br> Paul might want to ask how many in the Boulder crowd will be eligible to vote in next year’s Senate race in Kentucky. It’ll be the senator’s focus if and when he lays the presidential run to rest. 
 Six months ago, Senator Mike Lee and I offered a variety of ideas on how to reform America's tax code to be both pro-growth and pro-family. Our goal was to slash rates, shrink the IRS, create jobs, grow wages, and empower parents all at the same time. Since offering these ideas, I have gathered input from Americans of all economic backgrounds and engaged in discussions with leaders across the conservative movement to form a complete, pro-growth, pro-family tax reform agenda for the 21st century. <br> Second, my plan cuts rates for all businesses – large and small – to no higher than 25%, which would finally make us competitive again with the rest of the developed world. My plan recognizes that big businesses shouldn’t get a larger tax cut than small businesses, which are the main drivers of economic growth. To further spur job creation, I will end federal taxation of business investment by allowing for immediate expensing. I will also shift to a territorial tax system, thus ending the double-taxation of profits earned abroad for both businesses and individuals. <br> A critical component of my plan is tax relief for middle-class parents. By providing a new child tax credit of up to $2,500, which phases out for wealthier Americans, we can ease the extraordinary financial burdens of parenthood. While some well-respected voices oppose this tax relief, I remain adamant that empowering struggling families should be a priority for any modern reform plan. I know from firsthand experience how expensive it is to raise children in the 21st century, and I believe our tax code should support parents rather than drain their budgets. <br> I believe one of the greatest threats to family life today is that too many Americans have to give up being with loved ones in times of great need in order to avoid losing their jobs. I will begin to solve this problem by providing a limited 25% non-refundable tax credit to any business that offers between four and twelve weeks of paid leave to workers with qualifying family or medical issues – for example, a newborn child in need of care, an elderly parent with declining health, a personal health crisis, or a spouse’s deployment. <br> My tax reform plan is designed to advance America's two most important goals in this century: a growing, opportunity-rich economy and strong, financially-secure families. Everyone in politics claims to support these goals, yet I can already hear the establishment voices saying my modern approach to tax reform is all wrong. They will say the tax code of the 20th century will continue to work in the 21st. They will say we can continue to raise taxes and increase spending without long-term consequences. They will say that to protect your job we need to raise your boss’ taxes – or that for you to climb up the economic ladder we have to pull someone else down. 
 Pope Francis’s visit to the United States is attracting a flood of attention, and preparations have been underway for months in the cities and communities that will welcome him. While the pope will be greeted by thousands as he visits our nation’s famous landmarks and cathedrals, he has also planned a stop where the residents cannot come out to greet him: a local jail in Philadelphia. <br> The pope has often implored us through his words and actions to treat the people we put in jail or prison with respect and mercy. Some of those in jail have committed serious crimes, while others have committed relatively minor offenses. Many struggle with mental illness or drug addiction. Many simply can’t afford to make bail. Treating them justly and fairly is a strong Christian, and quintessentially Catholic, imperative. After all, Jesus taught us to visit those in prison. He also told us that what we do for the least of our brothers and sisters we do for Him. <br> Pope Francis continues the tradition of Catholic leaders urging us to offer hope and a second chance to prisoners. <br> The pope’s visit to the jail in Philadelphia will call attention to a part of our criminal justice system that receives too little notice: local jails. Prisons are the focus of most of the discussion about criminal justice reform, even though 20 times more inmates (12 million) pass through our jails each year compared to our prisons. The jail population is different from prisons because most jail inmates are nonviolent offenders awaiting trial, and innocent in the eyes of the law. <br> We see time and time again that overincarceration tears families apart by locking up fathers, mothers, brothers, and daughters mostly for minor crimes. The vast majority of people in our jails are there for nonviolent offenses like traffic violations or drug use. When they are finally released, most have lost their jobs, which leaves them unable to support their families and puts stress on their loved ones and the community. <br> There is a broad consensus on both left and right that our criminal justice system is failing us, and is in need of transformation. <br> We have worked over the last decade to build conservative support for criminal justice reform, rooted in our political views as well as our faith. <br> A cornerstone of the Catholic faith is that redemption is available to everyone, no matter what they have done. We are all sinners, and the ground is level at the foot of the Cross. 
 The supporters of Governor Jeb Bush’s tax reform proposal have called it “radical.” In an important sense, this is an accurate characterization, because the reform would be a dramatic departure from the<i>status quo. It’s also radically different from the tax reforms typically presented by presidential candidates. As opposed to the usual vague generalities, this plan is detailed and includes tough calls that will likely irritate some special interest groups. <br> Given that he was a Professor of Moral Philosophy, it’s no surprise that Smith’s first principle dealt with fairness:&nbsp;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities. <br> Smith is arguing that everyone should pay the same proportion of his or her income. The Bush proposal follows Smith’s general principle that tax liabilities should increase with income. However, following most modern commentators on tax policy, the Bush proposal goes beyond Smith by stipulating that the<i>proportion</i>of income paid in tax should increase with income. Indeed, several aspects of the plan enhance progressivity relative to the status quo, such as the limit on deductions that benefit mostly high-income individuals. <br> Our current tax system is so complicated that even people who want to be honest don’t know if they are paying the right amount and live in fear that they will be subject to “the odious examination of the tax-gatherers” (sorry, IRS auditors). For example, think about all the head scratching that goes on when individuals are trying to figure out just what expenditures are deductible. <br> Smith next turns his attention to the importance of minimizing the economic damage done by taxes:&nbsp;Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state.Smith notes several ways in which a poorly designed tax system can violate this maxim. <br> The centerpiece of the Bush proposal is a substantial reduction in marginal tax rates. Smith also warns against tax systems that discourage people “from applying to certain branches of business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes.”</i> 
 The fact that the world has been abuzz with Donald Trump's antics since last Thursday night’s presidential debate in Cleveland demonstrates that no one really broke through or was fatally damaged in the debate itself. But what has been largely ignored is how little discussion there was on by far the biggest issue of all: the economy. <br> Yes, Ohio Gov. John Kasich made eloquent reference to the importance of economic growth near the end of the debate and Jeb Bush also mentioned it. But the subject should have been front and center from the get-go. <br> Republicans aspirants should remind themselves of what Bill Clinton's campaign maestro James Carville famously said in 1992: It's the economy, stupid. <br> But Reagan grasped what his GOP opponents did not: America was hungering for a pro-growth economic optimist. <br> He hit President Jimmy Carter hard for a miserable, inflation-wracked economy, but his message was optimistic: we can get America growing again and here's how we can do it. <br> Reagan understood that a weak America meant trouble around the world, not to mention a debilitating malaise at home, and that drastic measures were needed to get the economy soaring again. <br> Soviet Union boss Mikhail Gorbachev desperately tried to resuscitate a lumbering, stagnant, bureaucracy-ridden economy — and failed. To the astonishment of all, the Soviet Union collapsed. The U.S. won the Cold War, something virtually every foreign policy expert thought an impossible event in their lifetimes. <br> Attack the Obama economy and couple this with bold proposals on taxes, health care and money. Jeb Bush will stay stalled unless he puts something like the flat tax on the table and trumpets it across the land. His advisers are clearly too cautious. He must show leadership and overrule them. Half-measures or anodyne a flatter, fairer tax code sound bites won’t do. <br> Rand Paul has a very interesting flat tax proposal out there today, but he only mentioned it once — and that in passing — in the debate. Don't bury the best thing you have going for your campaign. Lead with it. <br> Gov. Walker, Sen. Cruz and Dr. Carson have spoken in favor of the flat tax. It’s time for them to offer up the beef and run with it like Reagan did with his tax-cut plan. <br> Gov. Huckabee mentionedhis support of a national sales tax to replace all federal taxes on income only in response to a question on entitlements. <br> The big question for the GOP is this: which candidates, if any, will vigorously seize the optimistic, pro-growth mantle of Reagan and make it their centerpiece? I 
 Puerto Rico’s governor announced this week that the small island territory would be unable to repay its $70 billion in outstanding debt. The commonwealth is in its tenth year of a depression and is losing its tax base as thousands of residents relocate to the mainland for better economic opportunities.</u> <br> Flawed policies from Washington have aided Puerto Rico’s descent into fiscal insolvency in a number of ways. Washington inflated the island’s transportation costs, destroyed the island’s labor market with an abnormally-high minimum wage and lavish entitlement programs, and pushed flawed tax policy that created an economic bubble.</u> <br> The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour applies on the island. The minimum wage’s effects are well-known, but it has disproportionate influence in Puerto Rico. <br> The high minimum wage raises the cost of employment and prices many employers out of the market, causing unemployment to rise and thus tax revenue to dry up. The minimum wage is a partly why the island’s unemployment rate is almost three times that of the mainland. <br> Finally, Washington fueled the Puerto Rico bubble with inconsistent tax policy. Per Congress, Puerto Rican municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxation—like other states—but they are also exempt from state and local taxes too. Triple tax exempt bonds are a great investment. That attracted buyers to the bond market, allowing Puerto Rico to issue billions and billions in debt cheaply, and postpone spending restraint.</u> 
 Comprehensive tax reform would be a wonderful thing – something agreed upon, at least in theory, by both the Republican Congress and the Obama administration – but there is little realistic hope that it will come to pass anytime soon in the poisonous atmosphere of today’s Washington. <br> In the technology and the Internet sector, there are plenty of areas where Congress can do right by their constituents. Permanently authorizing the overwhelmingly bipartisan and soon-to-expire Internet Tax Freedom Act would help keep Web access affordable for families, students, and entrepreneurs. Barring states from imposing taxes on broadband access would directly benefit users, especially those in lower-income brackets for whom the Internet is a crucial avenue to education, opportunity, and upward mobility. <br> Along these lines, consumers would also be grateful to Congress if it dropped the laughably entitled the Marketplace Fairness Act, an ill-conceived proposal that would allow states to charge sales tax on Internet purchases their residents make outside state boundaries. That’s a not only a dangerous precedent in the expansion of taxing authority; it would bury smaller Internet sellers under a mountain of red tape and compliance costs, while increasing the price of online purchases. An Internet sales tax could put the brakes on one of the fastest growing segments of our economy. <br> The Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act also addresses taxes paid on Internet purchases, specifically digital downloads. This bill would standardize the chaotic layers of tax that currently surround the downloading of songs and movies, ensuring that only the buyer’s home state could tax the transaction. The bill would restore order and fairness, and remove a needless government barrier to economic growth. <br> For our seniors, Congress should also abandon the senseless mandate that penalizes people if they don’t start taking annual distributions from their 401K plans at 70.5 years of age. Wage earners should have the power to decide what to do with their retirement savings, not the government. Keeping more money in 401Ks would not only benefit savers, but also make more funding available for investment and business expansions. 
 Saturday, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum affirmed his support for Bruce Jenner as a transgender woman,<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.cnn.com_2015_05_04_politics_rick-2Dsantorum-2Dbruce-2Djenner-2Dtransgender_d=BQMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=H-YxWUs17R9RDLYYXfOsy985BTjGUtlMRiPRguX9sE4s=NsdheB70HM01lU8v0sRgFZtQ5_F-n1cUiITRLxkKQXYe=" target="_blank">explaining: “My responsibility as a human being is to love and accept everybody.

Support from Republicans such as Santorum suggests that members of the GOP are indeed ready and willing to do so. <br> But there’s another question thatnobody has asked yet:Areliberalsreadyto accept a proud, highly-public LGBT Republican? So far, it seems the answer isno. <br> But conservative support for marriage equality—and, by extension, identifying as a gay ortransgenderRepublican—isn’t as counterintuitive as it might seem. <br> At Log Cabin Republicans, we believe there isnoconflict between conservative principles and our endorsement of civil marriage equality. Rather, our group holds that legal same-sex marriage is a natural extension of the conservative doctrines of limited government, individual liberty, and a strong family unit. <br> Case in point:Santorum is just the latest Republican to receive Jenner with tolerance and compassion.Strident voices in the Republican Partyhave hadnoproblem acceptingJenneras a faithful conservative. <br> These reactions focus on supporting shared interests—low taxes, broadening the Republican base—rather than exacerbating points of difference. &nbsp; <br> AsoneTwitter user emphatically<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.nationalreview.com_article_417543_tolerant-2Dliberals-2Dstart-2Dinsulting-2Dbruce-2Djenner-2Dwhen-2Dhe-2Dsays-2Dhes-2Dconservatived=BQMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=H-YxWUs17R9RDLYYXfOsy985BTjGUtlMRiPRguX9sE4s=azFqvB6XIR7GwWJiQlhntrl8zV3Um7P-nfP7LSf-g7Ae=" target="_blank">explained, “#BruceJenner I was with ya til i [sic] read you’re a conservative Republican.No,no,no...” <br> The closed-minded responses from the political left belie its reputation of tolerance and inclusion. And the implications of this stunning liberal hypocrisy are dangerous. <br> Consider the recent backlash that ensued when two gay advocates hosted a meeting for presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The gathering was purportedly intended as an opportunity to discuss gay rights and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. Sen. Cruz and his hotelier hosts disagreed on the former subject, but were in consensus on the latter. <br> The reasons for boycotting businesses owned by Ian Reisner abound, but being in conversation with someone with whom you may not entirely agree is notoneof those reasons. Instead, it’s precisely this kind of dialogue—characterized by a mutual willingness to reach across the aisle—that should be lauded, rather than criticized. 
 No one can really say absolutely what the American income tax system allows or prohibits. Not the IRS, not the legislators who wrote it and not the most sophisticated tax experts. <br> When it comes to complexity the income tax code has few rivals. Its labyrinthine construction, like layers of three dimensional origami cemented together over a hundred years, has created incomprehensible nooks and crannies…and fear and revulsion by both average Americans and businesses. <br> There are more tax preparers than police officers in the United States. About 20 percent of what is raised in federal income taxes will be spent this year on tax preparation costs--paid out simply to comply with a law that is like a demanding Frankenstein monster who has had additional surgery every year for a century. For the average American, tax day costs an average of about $270 in tax preparation help to avoid facing a minimum of five hours of mind numbing work to complete a form 1040.The instructions run a hundred pages. <br> An “abomination” is a fair description of our income tax system: Something that is greatly disliked and abhorred and which represents a shameful condition. <br> It began as a flat tax that affected few and was easy to calculate. This year theaverageAmerican will work until April 24th to pay all taxes owed. <br> World War Two saw the first imposition of “withholding” taxes from paychecks ahead of when federal taxes are actually owed—and today, withholding too little results in a penalty from the IRS. Today, most wage earners only know what their “take home” pay is and pay little attention to what they earn before taxes are withheld. <br> There are three commonly accepted paths to a simpler tax system. Simplifying existing tax brackets and closing loopholes (most favored by those who work in Washington, D.C.) a national retail consumption tax called the FairTax (with a die-hard army of legislative sponsors) and the simple Flat Tax championed by business leader and former presidential candidate, Steve Forbes. 
 Tom Price, the new chairman of the House Budget Committee, has just released the GOP budget blueprint for the years ahead this week. This will have a big impact on how the government spends more than 20 percent of our economy, and where the revenues will come from to fund this behemoth operation. <br> Mr. Price tells me: “My budget stays faithful to the budget caps. We repeal ObamaCare. We eliminate hundreds of programs. We make room for tax reform. And we block grant many of the welfare programs back to the states.” The goal here, the Georgia Republican says, “is faster economic growth and more spending discipline. That is what our party should stand for. <br> It's pretty much the antithesis of the Obama budget that was released last month. President Obama wants to grow the government by $500 billion through 2017 and raise tax rates across the board on workers, investors and employers to pay for it. Mr. Price doesn't run from that fight. He ‎tells the White House, in effect: Bring it on. Just three months ago voters went to the polls and flat out rejected the Obama-Pelosi-Reid vision of income redistribution and government expansionism in Washington. <br> Holding the sequester is essential to keeping the budget under control. Before the sequester, federal expenditures from 2007-11 exploded by $874 billion, a one-third blowout rise in spending. But with the sequester in place, federal outlays have fallen by $168 billion – a 16 percent decline relative to inflation. <br> Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote last week in the Wall Street Journal that “the country cannot meet its national security responsibility within the caps on defense spending imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act (BCA) and sequestration.” <br> Only inside Washington is that considered a cut. <br> Mr. Obama desperately wants to repeal the spending caps and sequester as well. He calls it a “mindless” budget reduction tool because it cuts spending across the board. But this is only because the White House and Congress won’t cut spending in any other responsible way. <br> Mr. Price has it right. One of the greatest long-term threats to our nation’s security is our out-of-control economy -- our massive $4 trillion budget and the $18 trillion national debt that keeps growing by nearly $1 trillion a year. As Ronald Reagan taught us all so well: When you’re weak at home, you’re weak abroad.” 
 The bottom line on Emailgate? It won’t move the needle. <br> Who are these stalwarts? Women. Women who think Hillary Clinton deserves to be the next president, because she has worked so hard for so long to land that plum assignment. Women who feel Hillary is held to a higher standard, who feel sorry for her, who believe she is the perfect candidate to shatter what she has called the “highest and hardest glass ceiling.” <br> Women like Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, who says of her: She's more than an idol … She's an inspiration … <br> This strategy was evident in her carefully scripted comments at the U.N. press conference. She deleted her personal emails, she said, because she wanted personal communications – about matters such as planning Chelsea’s wedding or her mother’s funeral – to remain private. <br> Here’s the problem: Women won’t get Hillary elected. While becoming the first woman president might have been a strong playing card in 2008, when she ran against the man who would become the first African-American president, the moment has passed. She can show up at another hundred women’s conferences over the next year – and it looks as though she will – but she will only be cementing the ardor of a group already in her column. What she needs is men, and in particular white men. <br> More specifically, the Post reported, “non-white men and women are pretty similar when it comes to the former secretary of state, but while 58 percent of white women back Clinton, 54 percent of white men oppose her.” This polarization is not new; in 2008 a survey showed that in a match-up with John McCain, Hillary’s backing would split along similar lines. <br> Both could happen. Hillary’s feminist message seems a bit stale, especially for the younger generations, who have fewer grievances. Equal pay is the law of the land, and many of the once hot-button issues (like access to contraception) have been resolved. Some think there is actually a backlash brewing that has generated, for instance, more than 32,000 “likes” for a Facebook page called Women Against Feminism. <br> Meanwhile, men could be forgiven if they are tiring of hearing about the travails of women – especially as they see females earning 60 percent of college and graduate degrees, holding 52 percent of all professional-level jobs, and enjoying lower unemployment. <br> Society has focused on obstacles faced by women in recent years, and rightly so. The attention has paid off. While there remain opportunity gaps, American women have made enormous strides. This is not the case in many other countries, where there is much work to do. But Hillary wants to be the president of the U.S., not Kuwait. Her zeal is impressive, but voters may regard other issues – like jobs, tax reform, unsustainable entitlement programs and terrorism – as equally important. <br> Hillary’s emails won’t do her in. But she could be in trouble nonetheless. 
 Congressman Paul Ryan recently said that Congress must “make meaningful strides on tax reform by the end of the summer in order to stand a chance of achieving consequential changes to the tax code in the near future.” There’s no more significant legislative leader in Washington when it comes to tax reform than Ryan, the newly-appointed Chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, and he’s clearly serious about tackling the inequities and inefficiencies of our current tax code. <br> He may, however, be overlooking the single most effective way to get the ball rolling on real tax reform. It needs to begin from a blank slate, not from the absurdly complicated current code – a piece of labyrinthine legislation that is 2,652 pages long in the shortest form published by the Government Printing Office, and 73,954 pages long in the version published by the Commerce Clearing House, which is what most tax practitioners use. <br> Any attempt at tax reform that begins from that point will almost never get off the ground, and certainly not by this summer. What Congressman Ryan should champion as the first step in the tax reform process is to sunset the current tax code at a specific date, far enough into the future to avoid roiling the financial markets with uncertainty, yet soon enough to force serious action. <br> As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich once said, “Find 75 or 80% [popularity] issues. Stand next to them and smile. Let your opponent frown!” Seventy-five or 80% issues are rare, but they have the potential to upset the usual political calculus. <br> If it were promoted so that it became a major issue with the public, isn’t it at least plausible that it could win the support of seven Democratic Senators? If it passed the Senate, President Obama would be faced with an interesting veto decision: would he really want to veto the will of the American people – especially when there was no real downside to signing the bill, since the effective sunset date would be well after he left office? <br> It would also tee up tax reform as a major issue for debate during the 2016 presidential, senatorial and congressional campaigns. 
 <i>Editor's note:</b> Fox News' Dana Perino, former White House press secretary and current co-host of The Five recently interviewed Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union chairman about this year's <a target="_blank" href="http://cpac.conservative.org/">Conservative Political Action Conference
 Why is President Obama asking for “Authorization for Use of Military Force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant”? Why ask for permission to carry on with operations that have been underway for more than six months and that are permitted under a 2001 authorization that is still in place? Because he doesn’t know what else to do. <br> As many have noted, he has been unwilling even to identify our enemy as Islamist extremists or to acknowledge that this is a religious confrontation. Though he has made the case that our coalition forces are holding the line against ISIS’ further advance, Americans are not so sure we are making progress. They are more impressed by the horrifying murders perpetrated by the ISIS savages, and they want more from their president. <br> Meanwhile, the unnerving battle against terrorism threatens to upset the president’s legacy pursuit here in his final innings. Each time Mr. Obama reveals another leftist agenda item, ISIS rolls out another barbaric video. In the public’s imagination, free community colleges are no match for the incineration of a Jordanian pilot. The murder of Kayla Mueller trumps increased maternity leave. Unwillingly, Mr. Obama keeps being dragged back to the Middle East. <br> President Obama has decided that he will bring Congress in to debate the merits of his still unformed strategy, specifically to argue about the circumstances under which our military will continue to battle ISIS. <br> The John McCain wing wants an all-out assault on the enemy, wherever they are, by whatever means we have at our disposal. Take no prisoners. <br> With good reason, Mr. Obama is confident that his will emerge as the voice of reason. <br> At the same time, requesting this authorization will allow Mr. Obama to embellish his favorite meme — that Congress has prevented him from carrying out his agenda. But for the Republicans on the Hill, he has often claimed, he would have enacted measures that would have added even more jobs, slowed the rise of the oceans, boosted the middle class and burnished our image overseas. <br> Americans are fed up with Obama’s tendency to go it alone — his executive action on immigration, for instance — and they are ready for a change. Nothing could be more damaging for Mr. Obama’s legacy (or for his party, though that appears a secondary concern) than the emergence of a unified, successful, responsible Republican Party. Such a renewal would pave the way to electing a GOP president next year who might well roll back the most unsavory aspects of ObamaCare, or EPA regulations — undoing Obama’s most cherished programs. That he cannot tolerate. 
 As the legislative agenda of the new Congress begins to take shape, there is one area in which both Republicans and Democrats appear to agree - the need for comprehensive tax reform, especially of the business tax code. But as with most attempts at reform, the devil is in the details. <br> When tax reform proposals are debated, “interest-group politics are brutal” the Post noted. Also true, and in this respect, President Obama isn’t blameless. His intransigence on the Keystone pipeline and his foot-dragging on freeing crude oil and natural gas exports from trade restrictions, for instance, are well documented. Perhaps nowhere are his interest-group politics clearer than his disparagement of U.S. energy producers as “Big Oil” and his efforts to raise taxes above already high levels. <br> I expect his fiscal year 2016 budget, set for release Monday, to be no different. It’s just another good example of what not to do as we move forward with tax reform – and of the type of partisan rhetoric that can derail progress on this vital issue. <br> Neither his claim nor the president’s withstands scrutiny. <br> Americans for Tax Reform calculated that a recent White House budget would heap some $90 billion in tax hikes upon American energy over the course of a decade. There’s no more sure-fire way to kill jobs, dampen investment, and weaken our nation’s new-found competitive advantage in energy than to pile on taxes. <br> We alsoshould applaud the robust energy industry’s role in private investment. The Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) once again recognized major domestic energy firms in its annual Investment Heroes ranking. The energy companies on the list collectively comprised the second most active industry, with six firms accounting for a total of $40 billion in domestic capital spending. 
 Is President Obama trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run? That’s one take-away from his feisty State of the Union address, in which Mr. Obama did three things: first, he moved the Democratic agenda far to the left, where Hillary is not entirely comfortable; second, he rebuffed the clear preference of voters that he work with Congress, by making the cornerstone of his address proposals unacceptable to the GOP and third, he assured the country that our foreign policy (Hillary’s foreign policy) is working. <br> None of these messages works for Hillary. <br> Mr. Obama’s focus on the middle class is unsurprising. Lagging income growth for the average American has emerged as the likely debate in 2016, for good reason. The numbers show that during the Obama recovery, the middle class has, as Joe Biden put it, been “left behind.” <br> Despite Americans listing job creation as their number one concern for the past six years, putting people to work has never been President Obama’s priority. He has not encouraged businesses to hire, either through reducing tax rates on employers or by expanding business opportunities – through trade, or reduced regulations, for instance. <br> As of this SOTU address, he has doubled down, since many of the suggested tax hikes will land on small companies that pay taxes as individuals, and as his proposed sick pay and maternity leave will raise the costs of hiring. Such policies have led to labor participation rates that are still bumping along historical lows, a crisis in our disability program, and stagnant wages. A short course in economics might help the White House: a tighter jobs market will raise wages. The government raising wages will put people out of work. It’s that simple. <br> It’s a tired song, and Americans have never bought the program. <br> The tax proposals outlined by President Obama are old school, and dead on arrival in the Republican Congress, as he well knows. Congress has indicated an eagerness to work with the president on tax reform, but has prioritized changing the dysfunctional corporate tax code. <br> This is a slap at Hillary, for two reasons. First, Hillary is unquestionably uncomfortable putting on a progressive cloak. <br> Hillary is a successful, wealthy woman who pretends otherwise and stubs her toe on money issues, such as when she described herself and her husband as “dead broke” upon leaving the White House. Also, Hillary has difficulty distancing herself from Wall Street; the Wall Street Journal has reported that she and her husband have raised nearly $5 million from Goldman Sachs alone. <br> Voters have shown they want the government to function – to repair our infrastructure, reform our dreadful tax code, to compete more effectively with our trading rivals, to streamline our outdated government agencies. <br> Voters do not like the president’s “go it alone” program; they understand why the nation’s founders included those pesky checks and balances. Obama will make it more difficult for any Democrat trying to succeed him to convince voters that he or she will “work across the aisle” – a claim that Hillary might actually credibly make. <br> His embarrassing absence in Paris, his waffle on Syria, his underestimation of ISIS – it all speaks to his pretense that we have won the War on Terror. 
 Some crank apparently has it in for John Boehner. No, I’m not talking about Ted Yoho; rather, the bartender who supposedly threatened to poison the House Speaker’s drinks – a low blow. Seems like there’s no end of folks eager to attack the GOP leader. <br> They failed, but in the process they gave wounded Democrats ample fodder for ridicule. They also steered the narrative away from the popular programs mainstream Republicans hope to pursue and that Americans hunger for. <br> The pundit chorus should stand down. While they were sniping over his tactics, the New York Times reports that Boehner participated in some 150 campaign events during 2014, raised $102 million — and transferred $23 million from his own political action committee to the National Republican Campaign Committee. That GOP majority that conservatives accuse Boehner of squandering — he helped build it. <br> Florida Rep. Daniel Webster, who came closest to ousting the speaker (which is to say, not very close), is considered a moderate by most of the organizations that rate such things. For instance, the Heritage Foundation gives him a 56 percent score — lower than the 61 percent rating accorded the average House member. Still, the dissension was embarrassing. <br> Over the past several years, Boehner has mollified the right by allowing more than 50 votes to repeal ObamaCare, a symbolic undertaking that most of the country rightly views as a waste of time. <br> Most recently, the far right is furious over Boehner’s endorsement of the Cromnibus. The rebellious group in the House wanted Boehner to stall passage of the government’s omnibus funding bill — shut down the government — in retaliation for Obama’s amnesty measure. As usual, they never articulated how this would help the GOP, or the country. And, by the way, the dissidents were not even united on this approach; Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, one of the right’s ringleaders, actually voted for the Cromnibus. <br> Some on the right dispute that, arguing that the GOP’s extraordinary sweep in the midterm elections proves that the 2013 shutdown failed to harm the brand. They are wrong; it took an unbelievable cascade of disasters emanating from the White House to turn around GOP fortunes. <br> Polling after the 2013 GOP-led government shutdown showed that 80 percent of Americans — 8 in 10 — opposed the move. And, not just Democrats were teed off. Two-thirds of Republicans and independents who lean right disapproved of the gesture. Because that’s what it was — a futile gesture. <br> Having U.S. credit downgraded over political uncertainty summed up the damage. Worst of all — throughout the fracas, President Obama’s approval ratings were untouched, while approval of Republicans sank to an all-time low of 32 percent; 63 percent of the country held an unfavorable view of the party. It doesn’t get much worse than that. <br> The GOP cannot become complacent. <br> Another survey showed that 50 percent of millennials consider themselves independents, an unheard-of desertion of our political parties. Those votes, come 2016, are up for grabs. <br> My guess? He’s just getting started. 
 Friday the Labor Department is expected to report the economy added 245,000 jobs in December. That’s down from 321,000 in November, and a slower economic growth will likely drag on jobs creation through much of 2015. <br> Going forward, household finances are in their best shape since the financial crisis and consumer spending should continue to lift the recovery. Also, much postponed business investment—for example in the commercial real estate and accompanying office fixtures and IT businesses—may be expected to boost growth. <br> However, weakening conditions in Europe and foreign governments’ policies that artificially overvalue the dollar against the yuan, yen and euro will slow U.S. exports, especially for technology-intensive capital goods and software that compete with Chinese, Japanese and European offerings. <br> Overall growth should range between 2.5 and 3 percent in 2015, and that will not support jobs creation of more than 235,000 per month unless productivity growth is weak. <br> Since 2000, Congress has enhanced the earned income tax credit, and expanded programs that provide direct benefits to low and middle income workers, including ObamaCare and Medicaid, food stamps, and rent and mortgage assistance. <br> Similarly, many women with good skills and education, who might enjoy the fulfillment and independence of full-time work, are encouraged to avoid employment or accept only part-time positions. <br> The whole system encourages retailers and other employers to chop two jobs into three and limit hours to less than 30 per week. <br> The GOP Congress could work with President Obama to fire up growth and jobs creation. With gas prices so low, raising the excise tax that funds federal highway trust fund in line with inflation since it was last adjusted in 1997 could be used to finance sorely needed investments in urban roads and transit systems. <br> Congress should require that the proposed trans-Pacific free trade agreement include provision with real teeth to eliminate currency manipulation by the Japanese and other participating governments. 
 Could 2015 be the breakout year for the economy? <br> All of this is good news as we ring in the new year. And the best may be yet to come. <br> The growth was propelled by a big rise in business investment, up nearly 9 percent; personal consumption, up 3.2 percent; and exports, up 4.5 percent. <br> The news was so good that even the threat that the Fed will now have an excuse to raise interest rates hasn’t deterred the bulls on Wall Street. <br> First, a huge factor in the economic rebound has been the fall in energy costs. As the price of oil has fallen from $105 a barrel this summer to closer $70 by September, (and at the end of December it was at $53) the cost of oil imports has tumbled. Imports fell by nearly 2 percent, and this alone added almost 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth. <br> Second, businesses are clearly feeling less trepidation about investing, and some of the wet blanket of Obama's anti-business, anti-shareholder agenda has dissipated as the Republican Congress repels his worst ideas: cap-and-trade, minimum wage hikes, new taxes on the energy industry and massive new spending initiatives out of Washington. Gridlock now looks to be built into the political system for the next two years, and in many ways that's reassuring. <br> Federal spending has fallen from 24.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 23.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 21 percent of GDP in 2014. Even better news is that in the fourth quarter of 2014, federal spending as a share of GDP fell to below 20 percent, according to a new analysis by Dan Clifton of Strategas, an economic policy consulting firm. This is creating an anti-Keynesian boost to growth, because the government is taking fewer private sector resources each month. <br> This, by the way, shows the foolhardiness of the Keynesian notion of a government-spending free lunch. Five years ago the Obama economics team was talking about multiplier effects from higher federal outlays — the stimulus bill spent $830 billion — that would juice the economy with even more private spending. <br> A final reason for optimism is that the incoming class of Republican governors and conservative state legislators across the country should mean more growth policies coming out of state capitals. At least a dozen governors from Massachusetts to Illinois to Tennessee are talking about tax cuts to create jobs. So even if we don’t get tax reform at the federal level, states should be providing an additional tax cut stimulus. <br> This recovery from recession is still nearly $2 trillion behind where we should would be if we had a Reagan-paced boom. This is still one of the most anemic recoveries, though it is belatedly picking up steam. <br> As 2014 comes to a close, here’s where we are: Interest rates are as low as they’ve been in 40 years; inflation is tame, thanks to the surge in oil and gas output; and corporate profits remain high. 
 In the wake of the Republican wave that swept the country last week, people have been asking me two questions. How did it happen, and what does it mean for the future? <br> No sitting Republican senators lost, and a bunch of races that were supposed to be close were blow outs. [pullquote] <br> Why the difference? <br> The answer is simple. Republicans in the House could point to hundreds of common sense bills passed under their watch. The Democratic Senate, on the other hand, was a place that good ideas, even bipartisan ones, went to die. Instead of legislation encouraging energy exploration or export expansion or regulatory reform, Democrats pushed show-votes designed to further their divisive political strategy. <br> The lessons both parties should learn from the results are clear. The American people expect leadership, and they expect to see Congress pass legislation to help them and their families. And that’s what we must deliver. <br> We will end the job-killing medical device tax and begin the process of repealing and replacing ObamaCare. <br> We will begin work on comprehensive tax reform that will make America the best place to do business again, increasing wages and benefits for workers in the process. <br> When we move ahead with a positive legislative agenda, the ball will be squarely in the President’s court. He says that he heard the message that voters sent to him on Tuesday night, that he understands they are ready for him to come to the table and work with the Republican Congress. We will do our part. The president must do his. 
 As Congressional leaders come together at the White House Friday to meet with President Obama there are two questions on everyone’s mind. <br> And second, will the president be serving Kentucky bourbon? <br> [pullquote] <br> President Obama was more opaque about where he sees the potential to work with Republican leadership, even though he was clear that it was his priority to make sure that the government keeps working during his final two years in office. <br> But more importantly than any specific issue, the legacy of Obama’s presidency is very much tied to whether he will work with Republicans in these next two years. <br> To be sure, the president has accomplished a great deal on social issues. He will always be remembered for ObamaCare as well as key pieces of legislation like the Equal Pay Act and his support for gay marriage and women’s rights . <br> This would be the wrong approach on two levels. First, it would mean that government will continue to get nothing done. That’s a losing scenario for both parties and the American people. <br> In a recent WSJ/NBC News poll, 50% of Americans said they would rather a candidate “who will make compromises to gain consensus on legislation,” up from 34% at the 2010 midterms. 
 “Today I had a chance to speak with John Boehner and congratulated Mitch McConnell on becoming the next Senate majority leader,” said Barack Obama in the opening of his White House press conference following the Democrats’ Tuesday massacre. “And I told them both that I look forward to finishing up this Congress’s business and then working together for the next two years to advance America’s business.” The president is looking forward to “working together to deliver for the American people.” <br> This begs the trillion-dollar question: Is Obama still relevant? Given the truly historic proportion of this Republican victory, is Barack Obama about to become the lamest of lame-ducks? <br> Before Republicans get too excited, I would caution that a president is never irrelevant, simply due to the sheer power of the office. We don’t call it the Bully Pulpit for nothing. There are plenty of muscles for the commander-in-chief to flex, even if the opposing party runs the fitness center. <br> I would point conservatives to a notable example from their presidential icon, Ronald Reagan. Six years into his presidency, in 1986, Ronald Reagan’s party likewise lost the Senate, and again lost the House. And yet, Reagan’s final two years were rich with success. He and Mikhail Gorbachev held four summits, in Geneva, Washington, Moscow, and New York. They signed history’s greatest nuclear-missile treaty: the INF Treaty. Domestically, Reagan reaped the benefits of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, a further boon to economic prosperity. <br> Could Republicans seek the same against Obama? I doubt it. Any attempt to do so, no matter the validity, would be met with the loudest wails of “racism” and everything and anything else from the progressive corner. <br> But while Barack Obama might not be the subject of Capitol Hill hearings, the Democrats’ presumptive nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton, likely will be. This seems inevitable, given that Benghazi demands continued investigation. But back to the Reagan analogy: Ronald Reagan generally enjoyed an excellent final two years from a policy standpoint, especially in foreign policy. Could Obama do the same? No, I don’t think so. Consider: <br> Domestically, his signature policy achievement, Obama-care, will be slowed if not stopped. It has now lost all momentum and assistance from the legislature. Obama is no longer on offense. That’s especially true given his pronounced inability to reach across the aisle over the past six years, an opposition he once called “hostage-takers.” <br> The rhetoric is nice, but given Obama’s ideology and perhaps psychology, I don’t foresee him suddenly becoming the great unifier, initiating a cascade of bipartisan triumphs. I can’t even imagine what those would be. <br> He will also hammer out a long-term liberal legacy with the courts, where he can help shape law and culture. Given the opportunity, he will seize the chance to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with another leftist in the mold (and youth) of Elena Kagan. The long-term impact on issues like religious freedom could be dismal. If Obama has made any particularly discernible “change,” it is in the courts. 
 Voter discontent will soon give Republicans control of the Senate, but Americans may quickly become dissatisfied with the new cast on Capitol Hill. <br> Here are five big challenges where public resistance stifles progress. <br> Voters can’t seem to accept that putting everyone to work would raise productivity and wages enough to offset paying a bit more for a coffee table or cell phone at Walmart. <br> Most voters seem unable to accept that those restrictions don’t reduce environmental risks but merely shift them to developing countries. <br> Income taxes could be junked in favor of a lower, value added tax that treats everyone the same, but Americans cling to their privileges. <br> Computers and sophisticated apps have eliminated many of those jobs, but Americans send half of high school graduates to college and many end up underemployed and terribly in debt. <br> Colleges should have fewer students and resources should be redirected into vocational education, but educators and parents won’t accept that most children should not go to college. <br> Republicans keep preaching vouchers and competition, and ObamaCare will drive up costs by subsidizing an already inferior system. <br> 6. Bureaucratic Bloat. State and municipal governments have amassed huge union dominated bureaucracies that make everything from keeping a car to putting up a backyard deck a morass of regulations and compliance. <br> Americans are correct to demand change but more gridlock in Washington is likely. <br> Still the Senate Republicans can hold hearings and encourage a bipartisan dialogue about how we could better manage globalization, energy, tax and other policies that need to change. 
 There are a number of basic questions that will be answered very soon.We will know if Democratic control of theSenatecontinues and what kind of support President Obama willhavefor his agenda overthe next two years. <br> If the past six years area good guide – and I believe they are – we’re most likely to see more of the same. Confrontation and discord will continue to characterize inter-party dealings, and even intra-party dealings. <br> It follows that evenifRepublicans controltheSenate –the most likely outcome as final polling shows toss-up races across the country steadily shifting toward the Republicans – it is unlikely that they will be able to govern effectively. This is partly due to internal divisions that will make it difficult to come together in support of an agenda – orsignificant bills for that matter. <br> Compounding this problem is the fact that it’s extremely unlikely that President Obama will bedoinganything otherthan vetoing Republican bill after Republican bill. Considering that the president has shown little interest in compromising with Republican lawmakers over the course of his tenure, evenwhen Democrats had at least some control of the House, I can’t imagine a scenario wherein the legislation Republicans come up with on their own will become law. <br> House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthybluntly told a group of donors, “I do know this: If we don’t capture the House stronger, and the Senate, and prove we could govern, there won’t be a Republican president in 2016.” <br> There is much to be excited about in the agenda that Sen. Portman laid out. But there’s also very little reason to think that anything like that would even get enough Republican support to get to President Obama’s desk. <br> The president's promise todelivercomprehensive immigration reform after the election byway ofexecutive orderhas naturally ruffled feathers. McCarthyleft open the possibility of an immigration overhaul, but added that if the president approached it by executive order it would “stop everything.” <br> In other words, w e will be right back where we started. <br> Truth be told, there’s no reason for the Republicans to do anything differently. If they take the Senate, they will have managed to win the election without a clear plan or strategy. 
 Former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) is thinking seriously about running for president in 2016, according to his son, George P. Bush. <br> Politico, and many others, assert it's because of an answer Bush gave in 2012 to a hypothetical question posed by a member of the House Budget Committee, which resurfaced now as he contemplates running for president. Bush was asked if he could accept tax increases of $1 dollar for every $10 dollars in spending cuts. He said he could and seemed enthusiastic about the 10-for-1 formula. <br> Norquist and other anti-tax advocates perhaps see in Bush's comment a replay of his father's pledge at the 1988 Republican National Convention: Read my lips: no new taxes. He violated that pledge when congressional Democrats promised to cut spending in exchange for tax increases. Bush raised taxes. Democrats did not cut spending. Many have long believed that broken promise contributed to his failure to win a second term. <br> The Treasury Department last week released figures showing tax revenue in fiscal 2014 exceeded $3 trillion for the first time in American history. Treasury also said the deficit was nearly $500 billion. The national debt has passed $17 trillion, and continues to climb. As Ronald Reagan and other conservatives have noted, the reason we have such massive debt is not because the American people are undertaxed; it is because their government overspends. <br> Republicans need to reject the notion that government needs more money and change the subject to the elimination of wasteful and unnecessary spending. Deep within our DNA remains a Puritan ethic of living within one's means and not borrowing to pay for what we can't afford. <br> The collection of any taxes which are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to the public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. <br> And this: No matter what anyone may say about making the rich and the corporations pay the taxes, in the end they come out of the people who toil. 
 If Republicans win the Senate, President Obama risks another bruising recession if he doesn’t embrace compromise and abandon ineffective populist prescriptions. <br> Stimulus spending only temporarily boosts growth but permanently increases deficits. <br> Here are five things Obama could do with Republicans to boost growth. <br> Obama and GOP leaders want to close loopholes to lower rates. However, Obama wants to use reform to boost revenues, while Republicans want lower taxes overall. Neither side wants to abandon its favorite corporate favors—for example, the GOP likes breaks for the oil industry, while Obama recently shelled out new benefits to the telecom sector. <br> 2. Patch ObamaCare: Republicans should accept the president won’t sign a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act but he should accept the law needs major fixing. <br> Ban skinny plans, but allow businesses to offer workers earning less than $15 an hour tax-free allowances to sign up for coverage and qualify for subsidies on the health insurance exchanges, instead of slapping employers with penalties as the law now provides. <br> 3. Encourage the Fed to Normalize Interest Rates: The Federal Reserve appears poised to raise interest rates in 2015, but that won’t much increase stock market volatility. Even if the ten-year bond rate, currently 2.2 percent, rises to 4 percent, profits on stocks, currently above 5 percent, would remain attractive. However, raising interest rates would give the elderly more income to spend from their CDs and boost growth. <br> Along with reasonable conservation measures, more offshore production could make the U.S. self-sufficient in oil, boost GDP by 2 percent and create about 3 million jobs. <br> Until China lets market forces determine the value of its currency, tax dollar-yuan conversions to raise the cost of importing unfairly subsidized goods and corporate investment in outsourcing to the Middle Kingdom. 
 Thursday, Reince Priebus, the Dickensian-named Republican Party chairman, gave what he billed as a major address on “Principles for American Renewal.” <br> The performance brought to mind the vapid and sub-grammatical motto of Jebediah Springfield, fictional town father in Fox’s The Simpsons: “A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.” <br> Twenty years ago, the little-known House minority whip, Newt Gingrich, stood on the steps of the Capitol with scores of congressmen and candidates to announce the Contract With America. The pact’s bold ideas helped make the 1994 midterms a wave election and paved the way for welfare reform, balanced budgets, tax cuts, and stronger economic growth. Today, the conservatives again need new, bold, positive ideas. They can’t count on congressional bosses who have decided to play it safe. Those leaders believe that ObamaCare, scandals, foreign disasters, and voter fatigue will drag down the liberals this November. 
 More than a decade since I first arrived in the United States Senate, the chamber has become unrecognizable. What had traditionally been a forum for thoughtful debate of principled ideas has gradually devolved into a venue for carefully orchestrated theater. <br> Despite all the challenges facing our country, my colleagues in the majority continue to prioritize political stunts and show votes over serious legislating. Indeed, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. has allowed so few amendments that one of his fellow Senate Democrats recently told Politico, “I got more substance on the floor of the House in the minority than I have as a member of the Senate majority.” <br> By contrast, our colleagues in the House of Representatives have sent over scores and scores of bills on job creation, taxes, health care, immigration, and other issues, only to have Senator Reid declare them dead on arrival. No wonder Congress has a 14 percent approval rating; the American people are frustrated with Washington, and rightly so. <br> First and foremost, we have long stressed the need to pass a pro-growth, fiscally responsible budget that actually cuts spending and reforms government. We should leave the next generation more economic opportunity, not more debt. Americans and small businesses across the country budget responsibly every month, and so should their government. <br> We need energy policies that enhance our energy security, reduce prices, encourage investment, and create jobs here at home. <br> Republicans believe we must continue aggressive oversight of the Obama administration’s out-of-control regulatory agenda, which is hurting hard-working Americans while empowering federal bureaucrats. <br> We believe that future reforms should allow health-care decisions to be made by patients and their doctors, not by Washington. We believe those reforms should make quality health insurance and quality care more accessible for everyone, including people with preexisting conditions. <br> Republicans also favor ending “too big to fail,” thereby ending the implicit government subsidy currently enjoyed by America’s largest banks. There are a number of ways to achieve that goal, but we all agree that Dodd-Frank did not solve the problem. <br> Republicans are proud to be a party of ideas, and we view our intellectual diversity as a sign of strength. Moreover, we are firmly united on the core ideas and principles that define us. 
 Burger King’s decision to acquire Tim Horton’s, a Canadian purveyor of coffee and doughnuts, is a good business move but its choice to locate the newly created company's corporate headquarters north of the border is the direct result of President Obama’s anti-business tax policies. <br> McDonald’s is getting into coffee—a high margin business—in a big way, and Tim Horton’s java knowledge offers Burger King the opportunity to do the same. <br> Also, Burger King could apply its knowledge of foreign franchising and restaurant regulations to expand Tim Horton’s limited global footprint, as rival Dunkin’ Brands is doing in Asia. <br> In the second quarter of this year, Burger King’s federal and state income taxes were 24 percent of its operating costs and 34 percent of its profits. Locating in Canada would cut those figures by up to 25 percent. <br> What American businesses actually pay in federal and state income taxes varies a lot, thanks to many exemptions, deductions and provisions to delay taxes on foreign earnings; however, the average combined U.S. and foreign tax burden on profits is about 30 percent, whereas the average for foreign rivals is about 23 percent. <br> If Congress doesn’t act, Lew is threatening to bypass Congress and make tax inversions illegal by “reinterpreting” tax laws—likely as suits the convenience of Obama’s political agenda. <br> A 2013 study undertaken by a European think tank ranked the United States 94th out of 100, right after Zimbabwe, for its impact on business competitiveness. No wonder the U.S. economy is not creating enough jobs. <br> It is no accident that telecom companies, which are highly regulated entities, are big donors to the Democratic Party. In fact, the home of Comcast’s CEO is one of the president’s favorite fund raising venues. <br> As Lew’s recent actions demonstrate, that will come down to burdening firms led by Republicans paying even higher taxes and dolling out advantages to industries whose management support the Democratic Party. 
 President Obama, as promised, is changing America. High taxes and enforcement abuses are driving businesses and ordinary citizens to leave the country altogether. <br> The United States stands alone among industrialized countries by requiring U.S. businesses to pay taxes on profits from overseas operations and investments—in addition to taxes paid to foreign governments. <br> Of course, what American corporations actually pay varies a lot, thanks to many exemptions, deductions and provisions to delay taxes; however, the average combined U.S. and foreign tax burden on profits is about 30 percent, whereas the average for foreign rivals is about 23 percent. <br> Ordinary citizens permanently living and working abroad also must pay U.S. and foreign taxes, face burdensome dual filing requirements and abusive penalties. U.S. tax laws can impose penalties of more than $1 million on unpaid taxes of as little as $20,000. <br> Imagine trying to run a small sales organization or live and work in Rome without a local banking account to pay bills. <br> Recent IRS abuses of American businesses, taxpayers and non-profits for political views and contributions -- and Justice Department reluctance to prosecute malefactors -- only add to perceptions that the U.S. tax system makes America no place to do business. And increasing numbers of businesses and individuals are making that choice. <br> Similarly, private citizens living abroad -- unable to obtain bank services, faced with huge tax and compliance costs, and the risk that even a hangnail error or whispered politically incorrect view could put them in the cross-hairs of the IRS -- are disavowing their U.S. citizenship. <br> Democrats and Republicans alike say they want tax reform, but Obama is unwilling to reduce the overall tax burdens. He only wants to move around and reduce certain deductions but maintain or increase revenues. 
 Spring cleaning is a healthy tradition. If only politicians did it! <br> When Barack Obama ran for president, he promised to clean house, I'm not a Democrat who believes that we can or should defend every government program just because it's there. There are some that don't work. <br> I cheered when I heard that! But politicians always say they'll get rid of waste. Then, once in power, they spend more. Obama sure has. <br> We just need to cut back! said Obama, the candidate. He promised to end waste at the Economic Development Agency and the Export-Import Bank that's become little more than a fund for corporate welfare.&nbsp; <br> Yet both programs thrive: The Ex-Im Bank just gave another $8 billion to Boeing, and the EDA spent $2 million to build a wine-tasting room and culinary amphitheater. <br> Both the left and right denounce the other party's spending, but expensive waste is supported by both. Neither party makes much effort to cut farm subsidies or NASA -- or to end subsidies for big corporations, the people who need it least. <br> On my Fox Business show Stossel (Thursdays 9- 10 pm ET) this week, he points out that the Pentagon destroyed $7 billion worth of weapons in Afghanistan and Iraq instead of shipping them home. That just shows you the inefficiency, says Coburn. <br> Welfare for businesses is even more harmful than welfare for poor people, because it kills the free enterprise that creates real prosperity. <br> Centrally planned economies bring stagnation and poverty. <br> Today I worry even more about the sheer <i>quantity of rules. There are now 170,000 pages of federal laws and many more local rules. If you can't get a job, there's a good chance that this spider web of regulations is the reason why. <br> I'd be <i>afraid to build a serious business. Today's laws are so complex even the lawyers don't understand them. <br> So now that spring is about to arrive, let's give government that overdue cleaning. Eliminate half the 170,000 pages of federal laws, scrap useless Cabinet departments, and cut the $4 trillion in spending in half. We could move about so much more freely if our lives weren't buried in government's junk. <br> Clean this stuff away! <br> To clean house, pass the Stossel Rule. It's simple: For every new regulation bureaucrats pass, they must repeal five old ones. 
 Americans desperately want a fairer tax system and relief from arbitrary treatment by the IRS. True reform requires simply junking the personal and corporate incomes in favor of a consumption tax. <br> The tax code is riddled with special interest provisions that favor rich donors to political campaigns, distort business decisions and consumer choices, and handicap economic growth and job creation. <br> Camp proposes to eliminate or modify many exemptions, deductions and other special provisions, but just the summary of those reforms takes 194 pages to explain in language only a tax expert could fully comprehend. <br> Despite noble intentions, much of the morass would remain, and the biggest beneficiaries would be the lawyers and accountants tasked by the rich and big corporations to game the new system. <br> In 2013, the Treasury collected $1.6 trillion from corporate and personal income taxes. This could be replaced by a 12 percent sales tax on all private purchases and other payments — be they computer equipment, college tuition or lunch at the corner takeout. <br> It would end forever all the headaches associated with valuing inventories, calculating depreciation on capital equipment and other work that cost billions in accounting and legal fees. <br> Businesses and institutions would file a three-line return: how much tax they collected, how much they paid and the difference. Individuals would file no tax return at all! <br> Two problems remain. A VAT is not progressive — it taxes rich and poor consumers at the same rate. The elderly, who more or less live on savings, have already paid income taxes on those savings and would be taxed again. <br> If Congress wants to spend more, it could raise the rate further. That would make transparent to all the cost of spending more on government activities. If conservatives on Capitol Hill want to cut programs, they could explain to voters how much those savings would lower the rate. 
 Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-Ky.) are now in position to end the Tea Party’s death grip on the Republican Party’s political future. <br> If the nation’s credit rating, stocks and the recovery went down the sewer because of Republicans’ refusal to raise the debt ceiling, the GOP’s chances in the midterm elections would have been severely damaged. <br> Having successfully defied the Tea Party on the debt ceiling, now it is time for Boehner and McConnell to use that momentum to pass three bills: An extension of unemployment benefits for people suffering long-term joblessness; a minimum wage hike; and, most important of all, immigration reform. <br> The Tea Party caucus in the House and the Tea Party star in the Senate – Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — are never going to love Boehner or McConnell. Both Congressional leaders have tried for years to accommodate Tea Party passions but they can never do enough. <br> By increasing the minimum wage, which is favored in polls by a majority of Republicans and Democrats, as well as extending unemployment insurance, the GOP can avoid the trap of being labeled as the party of the rich. Indifference to the people hit hardest by the recession is a major political vulnerability for the party as income inequality becomes a dominant political theme. <br> The last two months have seen small steps by Republican leaders to get the Congress back to work. First the budget deal, then the Farm Bill, and now raising the debt ceiling. With no help from the GOP, President Obama issued an executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers last week. Obama’s healthcare plan is now showing better enrollment numbers, too. <br> Boehner is ready to move on immigration. He issued a list of principles for immigration reform before a Tea Party caucus rebellion made him quit. He then tried to blame the situation on a lack of trust in Obama to “enforce our laws.” That was a weak excuse. The president has deported nearly 2 million undocumented workers since taking office, angering his own political base in the process. <br> “We’re still trying to keep the focus on legislative action,” insists Sharry, who believes there are between 50 and 60 Republicans in the House ready and willing to defy the Tea Party caucus and support a discharge petition to move immigration reform to a vote on the House floor. <br> With support from Boehner, this effort to move beyond Tea Party paralysis on immigration becomes a winner for Republicans. At the moment, all they can do is complain if Obama issues an executive order. Meanwhile, immigration activists, including Sharry, continue to press Obama to act on his own. <br> Immigration activists want the president to unilaterally end deportations of parents of citizens. Next, they want him to stop deporting people who have not committed crimes. Finally, they want him to stop deporting anyone who qualifies for citizenship under the Senate immigration bill, which the President has said he supports. <br> Unless Boehner and McConnell stand up to the Tea Party now, the GOP will forever alienate Hispanic voters and limit the party’s chances in future elections. It is time for them to end the infighting that is hurting their party and the nation. 
 House Speaker John Boehner said something noteworthy at the recent House Republican retreat on Maryland’s Eastern Shore: “It’s important that we show the American people we’re not just the opposition party, we’re actually the alternative party.” <br> However, opposing only gets you half the way there; blocking the other side’s forward motion is not the same as making forward motion yourself. So yes, opposing is fine—but winning is better. And winning, as Boehner said, requires the power of a superior alternative. <br> Continuing, Boehner added, “We’ve passed dozens of bills this year to help the economy, to help improve education, improve energy production in America”—but then noted that most of these bills then went into limbo in the Democratically-controlled Senate. <br> Boehner also declared, “Republicans have to do more to talk about the better solutions we think we have that will help the American people grow their wages and opportunities at a better job and clearly have a better shot at the American dream.” <br> Yes, ObamaCare may continue to unravel, and yes, the economy may be softening. Even The New York Times had to concede that the recent jobs report was “a disappointing showing that is likely to spur fears that the labor market is poised for yet another slowdown.&nbsp; <br> For example, there’s a decent chance that Obama will approve the Keystone Pipeline. And if he doesn’t, well, Republicans have effectively framed the Keystone debate as a jobs issue, and jobs are popular; a recent poll found that 56 percent of Americans support the pipeline, while just 41 percent oppose it. So for the sake of the Democrats in Congress, Obama would be well advised to endorse the pipeline. <br> In other words, lower the rate and broaden the base, in the same way that Ronald Reagan worked with Congressional Democrats to enact tax reform in 1986. (I am the co-chair of the RATE Coalition, a bipartisan group working to make the U.S. corporate tax code more competitive.) <br> But Democrats have other issues. For example, there’s health care, specifically, national health insurance. That’s been a core Democratic issue, going back to the 1940s, when President Truman first proposed it, later followed, of course, by President Clinton in the 1990s. And without a doubt, the cause of national health insurance helped Obama win in 2008. <br> Still, for Republicans, there’s the issue of providing an alternative. Can Republicans do it? The answer seems to be, yes, they can. <br> “The Patient CARE proposal repeals Obamacare and focuses on targeted reforms that will lower costs and expand access to quality care. We can lower costs and expand access to quality coverage and care by empowering individuals and their families to make their own health care decisions, rather than empowering the government to make those decisions for them.” <br> Yet that could change; The Washington Post recently reported on a statistical model that showed that the GOP has a better-than-even chance of winning the Senate this November. <br> We might further note that health care consists of a lot more than insurance. Even more fundamental is the issue of health itself. As noted here at Fox News Opinion last February, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor spoke out on the value of cures: <br> In other words, medical research and cures are the key to holding down health care costs. The logic is simple: To cite just one medical example, if tens of millions of Americans develop Alzheimer’s Disease, then the costs will be so astronomical—some $1 trillion a year by mid-century—as to overwhelm any kind of health insurance at all, public or private. <br> Earlier this month, House Energy Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, (R-Mich.), added his public voice to the cure-cause. Upton took note of a new collaboration between 10 big pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health, aimed at achieving breakthrough cures for dreaded diseases, including Alzheimer’s, diabetes, lupus, and arthritis. <br> “The search for cures must be an all-hands-on-deck effort. This landmark effort exemplifies the very best of a public-private collaboration, and we in Congress also want to do what we can in the name of breakthrough research.” <br> Republicans now have a double-barreled approach to health care. Thanks to Burr, Coburn, and Hatch, they have a solid ObamaCare alternative. And thanks to Cantor and Upton, they have a new vision of cures and hope. 
 In recent weeks, the national media have been obsessed with highlighting divisions and disagreements among Republicans on Capitol Hill. It’s time for GOP lawmakers to remind the American people of what unites us. Republicans are united in our desire to dismantle President Obama’s health care law and replace it with patient-centered alternatives that reduce costs, expand quality insurance coverage, and improve access to care. <br> We’re united in our desire to simplify the U.S. tax code and encourage job creation by lowering marginal rates and broadening the base. <br> To expand domestic energy production. <br> To end Wall Street bailouts. <br> To appoint constitutionalist judges who will faithfully uphold our founding document. In other words, what unites Republicans is far more significant than what divides Republicans. <br> Moving forward, if Republicans want to maximize our leverage and achieve conservative policy gains, we must remain united and focus on issues where President Obama and the Democrats are clearly vulnerable. For example: The administration spent more than $400 million to get the ObamaCare health exchanges up and running by October 1, but so far they’ve been a total disaster. <br> Polls have consistently shown that most Americans want to delay ObamaCare’s personal health insurance mandate. Republicans agree that, at the very least, Washington should delay the mandate for individuals and families, especially since President Obama has unilaterally delayed the corresponding mandate for employers. <br> ObamaCare does all of these things. <br> Republicans overwhelmingly support a simpler, more logical tax system with lower marginal rates and fewer loopholes. That’s a winning message, and it’s one we should aggressively promote. Finally, Republicans should remain united in blocking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attempt to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is America’s second-most-influential judicial body. <br> Based on its caseload, the D.C. Circuit simply does not need more judges at the present time. <br> The results of Obamanomics speak for themselves: Since June of 2009, we have experienced the weakest economic recovery and the longest stretch of high unemployment in postwar history. <br> Indeed, according to one measure of the income gap, inequality has increased about four times faster under President Obama than it did under President Bush. Republicans want to restore the economic and constitutional principles that made our country the envy of the world. <br> Conservative tax policies would make it easier to raise families, start businesses, and save for retirement. <br> Conservative regulatory policies would end “too big to fail.” 
 With a fiscal deal now in place, some might think America’s budget and debt crisis is over: they would be wrong. <br> For Republicans, hindsight has shown that the strategy of shutting down the government and risking default to force defunding of ObamaCare was doomed from the beginning. <br> President Obama will never abandon his signature issue, no matter how flawed and unworkable it might be. &nbsp; <br> The real solution here is not to bring the economy to the brink of default, but to win elections so we can implement the policy changes we all know are needed. &nbsp; <br> House Republicans should have learned last December that only by unity can we achieve our objectives -- and that you don’t achieve party unity by opposing the Speaker and the Leadership. <br> Democrats who believe they’ve achieved a “victory” should think again: nobody wins a standoff like this, as evidenced by polls that show Congressional Democrats’ ratings in the low 30s, while Obama’s has sunk to 43 percent -- one of the lowest of his presidency. <br> In the negotiations to come, Republicans can get off the mat by focusing on real, achievable solutions that promise a positive impact. <br> Two salient facts should guide Republicans’ thinking right now: first, 11 million of our fellow citizens are out of work; and second, we are now four years into the slowest economic “recovery” in our history. <br> Republicans must use the upcoming negotiations to re-establish a laser focus on job creation and economic growth, just as so many Republican Governors and state legislatures have done around the country. <br> 1. Tax reform. Everyone agrees that lowering rates and closing unproductive loopholes would result in higher levels of economic growth. &nbsp;Republicans should push for a long overdue overhaul of the Tax Code. <br> 3. Entitlement Reform. While the budget caps implemented as part of sequestration temporarily reduced the deficit relative to the Gross Domestic Product, the red ink will soon resume an upward trajectory because of entitlement costs. <br> Since even the Obama administration has endorsed the concept of entitlement reform, Republicans might consider offering Democrats changes in the sequester levels as a tradeoff for structural entitlement improvements that will have a far more profound impact in the years to come. <br> It’s not just computer software design flaws that are keeping people from signing up: Americans don’t like this law, and its complexity alone is discouraging people from enrolling. <br> Unfortunately, major changes can only be made when there is a new occupant in the White House. <br> There is a large bipartisan majority in both Houses to kill this tax, and Republicans need to advance its repeal (full disclosure: my firm represents device companies). 
 With frustration building over Washington’s refusal to behave in the public interest, perhaps it’s worth noting a drastic solution tried by the Irish. <br> The measure to abolish the Seanad lost by just 42,500 votes out of more than 1,226,000 cast (51.8 percent to 48.2 percent). <br> [pullquote] <br> The Republican Governors Association (RGA) has produced a video in which five Republican governors highlight successes in their respective states. <br> Bobby Jindal (Louisiana) who wants you to know that his state’s GDP has grown by $36 billion since 2008, nearly twice the national rate. That puts Louisiana eighth best in the country and third best in the South. <br> John Kasich (Ohio) closed an $8 billion shortfall without raising taxes and cut taxes by $3 billion. He eliminated the “death tax,” modernized Medicaid, eliminated the bureaucratic Department of Development and created a private, nonprofit corporation — JobsOhio — to “respond to job creators’ needs at their pace instead of at ‘the speed of statute.’” <br> Nikki Haley (South Carolina) pushed through tax reform on small businesses, which she claims, resulted in South Carolina having the fastest growing manufacturing sector on the East Coast and creating 38,000 new jobs, which have contributed $9 billion in new investment. <br> Oh, and those “controversial” union reforms that caused demonstrations at the state capital two years ago? Gov. Walker says those reforms saved the state more than $2 billion. <br> The “American Comeback” campaign should resonate with those who long for an economically, politically and culturally sound America, something we do not have under the Obama administration. <br> Real problem-solving is taking place in states headed by Republicans. If you’re tired of the bickering, turn away from dysfunctional Washington, follow their lead and emulate their successes. 
 It’s almost surreal to imagine a time when a government so sharply divided between Republicans and Democrats could still get things done in Washington. Right now Americans see their elected officials lunging from one crisis to the next without ever seeming to accomplish much of anything. It’s true that political leaders are in a difficult time. They face a deteriorating conflict in Syria, a potential government shutdown over the budget, entitlements in desperate need of reform and finding solutions for poor economic conditions. Taken all together, it makes for a tough workload. <br> But as hard as it might be to believe, it isn’t anything that we haven’t seen before. <br> Clinton used his deft political skills to win reelection in 1996 after a difficult first four years in office, and then went on to lead Democrats to electoral success in 1998 even under the dark cloud of impeachment. Yes, the government did shut down in 1995, and yes, Congress impeached Clinton, but Republicans and Democrats in Washington found a way to overcome their political differences and govern. Talk about multitasking! It wasn’t easy and it wasn’t perfect, but Congress and the president found solutions to our nation’s problems without succumbing to political gridlock. The Washington we see today doesn’t need to be this way. Congress and the White House can and should reach a grand bargain on spending restraint, tax reform, entitlement modernization and a path to a balanced budget. Just think about how the American people would respond if the grand bargain that everyone knows needs to happen actually happened. It certainly wouldn’t be perfect, but it would provide certainty to an economy that is struggling. It would enable employers to focus on growing their business and creating job opportunities, and not trying to anticipate how Washington will impact their viability. Washington’s leaders were capable of multitasking then. They can multi-task now. And Americans should demand that they do so. 
 Frustration with efforts to get to the bottom of IRS targeting of conservative groups should illustrate to even the most ardent supporters of big government that the federal tax agency is dangerous to civil liberties, irrevocably broken and corrupting national politicians. <br> Thanks to presidential executive orders, the union representing IRS employees is deeply involved in the management of the agency. Its leaders have the self-proclaimed goal of doing whatever it takes to defeat conservative politicians. The union consults regularly with leading Democratic politicians—including President Obama—on electoral strategy. <br> Simply put, the IRS has cultivated a culture that encourages employees to exercise discretion in ways harmful to free speech and association. <br> The IRS is not a neutral tax-collecting institution but a collection of grass roots activists, enjoying virtually unchecked sovereign power to destroy the personal reputations and finances of those who oppose liberal ideas. It inflicts terror on ordinary Americans through the arbitrary and capricious interpretation of tax rules and onerous audits. <br> There is little hope of curbing such behavior or reforming the IRS when his colleagues in the Senate take no substantive action to censure him, and the mainstream media finds nothing much to investigate having learned about such egregious conduct. <br> Moreover, the present quagmire of incentives and disincentives from the agency distorts business investment decisions and consumer choices. It reduces economic growth and leaves all of us less satisfied with our lives. <br> Business and institutions would then pay to Treasury the taxes they collected minus sales taxes they paid on purchases of materials and equipment, rent and the like. This subtraction would avoid the double taxation of materials and create a “value-added tax” so often proposed by advocates of tax reform. <br> Individuals would file no tax return at all! <br> If Congress wants to spend more, it could raise the rates. That would make the cost of spending more on government activities completely transparent to all Americans. <br> Elegant, egalitarian and efficient, such a value-added tax without exemptions would give Americans the tax reforms they want but that privileged rich folks and big businesses spend a fortune forestalling. 
 <i>Editor's note:</b> This article is adapted from the Spring 2013 issue of City Journal. <br> Christie’s stance countered most of the elite postelection commentary, which gleefully pronounced the Republican Party’s political irrelevance. But the governor was right. <br> Democrats boast similar power in just 12 states, with a population of 100 million. Even Republicans’ unimpressive national showing last November didn’t reverse their state-level momentum. <br> [pullquote] <br> At a time when Washington policymakers seem paralyzed by our toughest problems, these state-level revolutionaries have restrained government growth and radically reformed local tax codes. <br> Christie, whose stock has risen in New Jersey as he heads into a reelection battle this year, believes that the next national leadership of the Republican Party will emerge from the ranks of its effective governors. “I don’t think this is a core philosophical examination we have to go through,” he has observed. “What this is about is doing our jobs.” <br> Even as the country seemed to lurch leftward, however, state voters began to revolt against Democratic governors’ tax increases. <br> McGreevey boosted taxes and fees $3.6 billion between 2002 and 2004 alone, raising everything from income taxes to levies on home sales. Corzine followed in 2006 with his own $1.1 billion sales-tax hike. <br> Christie ran enormous political risks in trying to shrink that deficit. Despite discontent over the high taxes, polls showed that voters wanted higher levies on the rich, so that the state could continue a popular program of property-tax rebates for homeowners. And though the voters favored winning concessions from government workers, they also wanted the state to keep subsidizing public schools richly. <br> When homeowners complained, Christie urged them to vote against the expensive municipal and school budgets that were driving their ever-rising property taxes. Voters responded, defeating nearly 60 percent of the school budgets proposed in 2010. Christie’s reforms slashed state spending by nearly 9 percent and balanced the state budget without new taxes. <br> He also signed off on roughly $347 million in business tax cuts, though he has yet to find the revenues to make good on his pledge to lower Jersey’s income tax. Christie’s favorability rating was just 44 percent after his first budget passed, but as Jerseyans watched his strategy play out, his popularity grew. <br> “Despite the challenges that Sandy presents for our economy, I will not let New Jersey go back to our old ways of wasteful spending and rising taxes,” Christie recently announced. “We will deal with our problems, but we will continue to do so by protecting the hard-earned money of all New Jerseyans first and foremost.” <br> Perhaps the most ambitious of the 2010 crop of reform governors is Michigan’s Rick Snyder, a former venture capitalist with no previous experience in office. <br> Perhaps Snyder’s post-partisan image was what kept him off the national press’s radar for so long: he ran as a wonk who would use his business acumen to fix the state’s finances. <br> The MBT didn’t just tax businesses’ profits, as most corporate taxes do; it taxed their revenues as well, meaning that firms had to pay even when they weren’t making money. <br> Snyder’s tax-reform plan was audacious. To make up for the lost MBT revenues, he proposed a flat corporate levy; jettisoning $400 million in targeted corporate tax credits, which had tried to keep particular companies in the state; and (most controversially) taxing the pensions of all Michigan residents. <br> Snyder’s call to tax pensions understandably upset retirees and government-worker groups, who threatened to try to recall the governor. But he persisted, and the recall idea fizzled. <br> Nor was that the end of Snyder’s reform drive. Last year, he lowered Michigan’s personal income-tax rate. And now he’s seeking to eliminate the state’s so-called personal property tax, which is actually an outdated tax on business equipment. Snyder’s changes are “unshackling the state from its obsolete economic past and positioning it for new prosperity,” noted the Detroit News. <br> Republicans in the state legislature, balking at ending the popular items, passed a tax-cut package without them, lowering the state’s income-tax rate from 6.45 percent to 4.9 percent. <br> States are laboratories of democracy, in Justice Louis Brandeis’s famous formulation, and the very different experiments that their Republican and Democratic governors conduct over the next few years—especially on issues that go to the heart of economic competitiveness—will be eye-opening. 
 The economy is not doing well. Unemployment is too high and big deficits threaten the credit worthiness of the federal government, and only genuine tax reform will make things right. <br> Taxing the well off is not free—it slows growth, smothers jobs creation and pushes down wages for the middle class and working poor. <br> [pullquote] <br> Over the comparable Reagan years, when taxes, especially on the well-off were lower but more voters paid at least some income taxes, unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent but then the economy grew at 5.3 percent.&nbsp; <br> The highest marginal federal tax bracket is about 40 percent, but with so few Americans paying significant taxes, the average income tax rate is about 12 percent. <br> Each year, automatically adjust those levels up or down so that the share of federal spending financed by the income taxes remains constant—if folks want more or less federal spending, everyone pays more or less federal taxes. <br> These reforms would eliminate the terrible disincentive high taxes impose on small businesses to invest, grow and create jobs. Corporate tax rates could be similarly reformed so that investment decisions are not made on the basis of getting a tax credit but on the likelihood of boosting profits and employment. <br> For the former, the minimum wage could be boosted an appropriate amount—perhaps 50 cents an hour—beyond what President Obama and Congress agree. Social security payments could be similarly hiked, on a one time basis, by adjusting the payroll tax a few tenths of a percentage point. 
 President Obama is set to propose his “compromise” budget plan on Wednesday. His budget is reported to trim the deficit by $1.8 trillion over the next ten years, with nearly $600 billion in savings coming from additional revenue and $1.2 trillion coming from domestic program and entitlement cuts. <br> But new survey data, collected and financed by Douglas E. Schoen, LLC and in collaboration with the Campaign to Fix the Debt, shows a path towards a deal and how one can be reached. <br> The American people are in a profoundly pessimistic and angry mood. The Republican Party’s approval ratings stand at a 20-year low, with 66 percent judging it unfavorably compared to 33 percent favorably. The Democrats are viewed in a more favorable light, but are still not in good stead (43 percent favorable to 53 percent unfavorable). <br> Against this backdrop, Democrats and Republicans have offered up competing budget proposals—the Democrats in the Senate, the Republicans in the House—to address the nation’s mounting fiscal challenges. <br> With such stark differences, it’s no surprise that the plans have had a polarizing effect—we face, yet again, a seemingly intractable budget stalemate in Washington. Neither side wants to compromise. And Americans are enthusiastic about neither plan. <br> When we asked whether they thought that either the Democrats or Republicans had a realistic plan to reduce the deficit, just 20 percent said that the Republicans did, while 25 percent said that the Democrats did. But 49 percent believe that neither side has a realistic plan. <br> This plan would reduce our debt by $2.4 trillion. <br> The plan stood up to scrutiny. When we told respondents that it would cut their Medicare and Social Security, they still supported it, 56 percent to 24 percent. What’s more, when we said that cuts to Medicare and Social Security would only affect higher income retirees, including millionaires, the plan’s support increased, with 65 percent in favor and 20 percent opposed. <br> To date, very few surveys have examined this issue in any great detail, comparing the actual details of the Democratic, Republican, and compromise plan and gauging American attitudes. Our findings offer compelling evidence that, while there is a great divide between the two parties, what the public wants is a clear, bipartisan fix to our nation’s fiscal situation. 
 It is time your leaders in Washington tell you the truth: the fiscal crisis caused by America’s national debt and deficits is a real problem that needs to be dealt with now. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Further delay will only threaten future hopes and dreams of all Americans. <br> Enough is enough. <br> It’s time for real leadership that puts an end to irresponsible spending in Washington. That begins with the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House all presenting serious budgets that tackle the catalysts of our spending-driven debt crisis. <br> This year will be the first time in four years that the Democrat-controlled Senate has written a budget, forced to finally do so by House legislative action. For its part, the Obama administration's budget will be more than two months late from its legally required deadline when it finally gets to Congress. <br> House Republicans recognize that the way things have been done in Washington simply has not worked. <br> The House Republican budget is a long-term solution that ensures Washington is using your hard-earned tax dollars in an accountable and effective way. <br> No more budget gimmicks. <br> Most importantly, “The Path to Prosperity” will create a healthier economy where job creators are hiring, job seekers are finally finding work and more American families and entrepreneurs are realizing their dreams. <br> Some may try to convince us that we cannot reduce government spending while still honoring our commitments to America’s most important priorities. <br> In fact, our budget saves and strengthens Medicare, protects our national security, cares for the poor and sick by repairing America’s safety net programs and expands economic opportunities for everyone. <br> The American people have demanded real solutions and real results, and House Republicans have done more than just listen. 
 The president did what he had to do. He delivered a well-written, well-crafted speech that hit all the right notes and drew the appropriate applause lines. <br> There were indeed the gestures towards bipartisanship lawmaking and a shift away from the brinksmanship that has paralyzed our system that we heard from Obama on the campaign trail, in his inaugural address and during the fiscal cliff negotiations. But these points fell flat when considering that there has been no genuine desire and willingness to achieve bipartisanship or to call on the Republicans for any bargain that would produce immediate legislative results from the president. <br> To be sure, bipartisan lawmaking is what we need. As I have argued for years and in my latest book, we are on the brink of collapse due to the divisiveness that dominates our legislative system. To this end, President Obama failed to tell us how we will achieve it, especially considering the divisiveness of Washington politics today. <br> It follows that while Tuesday night’s State of the Union was a great speech, to see it as anything other than a reiteration of the themes that the president has articulated previously would be a mistake. <br> The real question then becomes, can the Republicans offer a credible alternative to the president’s vision for America? 
 WASHINGTON </span>For the first time since Election Day, President Obama is on the defensive. That's because on March 1, automatic spending cuts (sequestration) go into effect -- $1.2 trillion over 10 years, half from domestic (discretionary) programs, half from defense. <br> It backfired. The Republicans have offered no concessions. Obama's bluff is being called and he's the desperate party. He abhors the domestic cuts. And as commander in chief he must worry about indiscriminate Pentagon cuts that his own defense secretary calls catastrophic. <br> What should the Republicans do? Nothing. <br> Republicans should explain -- message No. 1 -- that in the fiscal-cliff deal the president already got major tax hikes with no corresponding spending cuts. Now it is time for a nation that is $16 trillion in debt to cut spending. That's balance. <br> If they do nothing, the $1.2 trillion in cuts go into effect. This is the one time Republicans can get cuts under an administration that has no intent of cutting anything. Get them while you can. <br> Naturally, the Democratic Senate, which hasn't passed a budget since before the iPad, has done nothing. Nor has the president -- until his Tuesday plea. <br> Otherwise, Mr. President, there is nothing to discuss. Your sequester -- Republicans need to reiterate that the sequester was the president's idea in the first place -- will go ahead. <br> It's not. Tax reform, as defined even by the White House's own webpage on the subject, <b>begins</i> with lowering tax rates. It then makes up the lost revenue by closing loopholes. <br> Obama has zero interest in lowering tax rates. He just got through raising them at the fiscal cliff and has made perfectly clear ever since that he fully intends to keep raising taxes. His only interest in eliminating loopholes is to raise more cash for the Treasury -- not to use them to lower rates. <br> Hence Republican message No. 3: The sequester is one thing, real tax reform quite another. The sequester is for cutting. The only question is whether it will be done automatically and indiscriminately -- or whether the president will offer an alternative set of cuts. <br> The country needs tax reform. But first it needs to rein in out-of-control spending. To succeed in doing that, Republicans must remain united under one demand: cuts with no taxes -- or we will let the sequester go into effect. 
 Who is the Forgotten Man today? Is it the coal miner whose employer was shuttered by the EPA? The construction worker hoping to build the Keystone Pipeline? Maybe it’s the salesclerk who was laid off because her boss feared having more than 50 people on the payroll as ObamaCare kicks in. <br> Our jobs shortage has disappeared as an issue – buried by a news community anxious to reelect President Obama. The White House has scuttled all discussions of employment and even of the economy. <br> In his second inaugural address, the president waxed enthusiastic about gay rights and the sanctity of our entitlements programs, and also proclaimed that America’s prosperity must “rest on the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.” How that class is supposed to rise when people can’t find jobs is a mystery – one that President Obama has yet to reveal. <br> Mr. Obama only in passing mentioned that “an economic recovery has begun.” Well, it certainly didn’t get very far in the fourth quarter. In fact, output took a nosedive in the final three months of the year, contracting by 0.1% as businesses pared inventories, exports tumbled and government spending took a hit. Doubtless activity will return to modest growth in the current quarter, but the economic news reminds us: something is not quite right in this recovery. <br> How can that be? There are two reasonable explanations. The first stems from a hard look at where corporate profit gains are coming from. After the financial crash, businesses slimmed down, cut staffs and readied for the drop in demand. In time, as business picked up, companies discovered they didn’t need to replace laid-off workers; they could manage with less. And they did so—quite profitably. <br> Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve handed out an unexpected bonus – lower interest rates. A chart contained in a recent presentation by Societe Generale (and published by The Economist) shows corporate net income recovering more robustly in 2010-12 than earnings before tax and interest. Lower interest rates boosted results – a factor that is unlikely to repeat. Earnings per share have been further bolstered by share buy-backs, financed by those same extra-low interest rates. <br> That’s where President Obama’s leadership becomes a factor. After 9/11, President George W. Bush exhorted Americans to go on with their lives despite their fears, asking “continued participation and confidence in the American economy.” (Contrary to many erroneous re-tellings, including by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Time magazine and others, Mr. Bush never urged us to go shopping.) <br> It sounds almost hokey today, but the country was shaken; no one knew what to expect, and it would not have taken much to plunge the nation into an economic crisis. Indeed, the economy was already softening, and unemployment rising, when Bush took office. Instead, people rallied, they went out to dinner and – yes -- they went shopping. <br> By comparison, consumer confidence in the U.S. most recently plunged to 59 in January, after falling for three months. This – in the face of a booming stock market. In the past five years, it hasn’t been able to top 73.1. <br> Instead of cheerleading from President Obama, we get browbeating. Every time the nation’s economy has begun to get traction, Mr. Obama has engaged in a fight with Congress – over health care, the debt ceiling, appointments to the NLRB, environmental regulations – over one issue after another that keeps the country on edge. <br> Is it any wonder that one measure of confidence among the wealthy --Pam Danziger’s Luxury Consumption Index – scored its second biggest loss in January since the start of 2008? <br> Unfortunately, President Obama seems to relish the political brawling and appears unable to rise above campaign mode. That is bad news for the country, and bad news for all those forgotten people who can’t find jobs. 
 Last November, my brother-in-law left his steady job at the city’s Public Works Department to begin working for an energy production company whose work site is situated near George West, a small town in South Texas. Although the move would keep him about 100 miles away from the family four days out of the week, he said what mattered most at this point in time was that the job change would double his annual salary. <br> I’ve known my brother-in-law long enough to know he is not impulsive, and my sister –like many women in households across America who are the bill payers, the “penny pinchers” who manage the family economy with laser-like attentiveness– does not allow many indulgences. She also happens to be the mother of four vivacious young children that take up a lot of her time. <br> I was thinking it’s bad when the new normal means our children are being forced to adjust to a life of separation, but it was hard to argue against the reasoning behind their decision, so I didn’t. <br> Is it any wonder more and more Americans succumb to the siren song of the “The Life of Julia” (President Obama’s fictional female cartoon character who relies on the government to sustain her from cradle to grave) as opposed to undergoing the difficulty of real life hardships and make the gut wrenching decisions necessary to make ends meet, when the only answers coming from Washington politicians are to continue recklessly printing money in billion dollar stacks, racking up sinful amounts of debt and spending hard-earned taxpayer dollars in redistributive schemes? In fact, the United States has now recorded a deficit during 45 of the last 47 months. <br> The president has shown himself to be so keen on spending he told the press he will simply refuse to negotiate with Republicans on the “debt ceiling”. Republicans have repeatedly said they fully intend to leverage the debate as an opportunity to agree on much needed spending cuts. The standoff has become a high stakes game that may end in a disastrous government shutdown. <br> It seems that the $600 billion tax hike the president received at the start of the year will not quench his thirst for the spending he envisions. His position is that the size and scope of government must grow in order to sustain the spending binge that his administration has enjoyed during the past four years. <br> Similarly, President Obama’s call to run up the nation’s credit card without approving spending cuts must also be resisted if we are to rein in runaway spending and improve the take-home pay of every hard working American. <br> It is time for Washington to make the hard choices in these hard times so then, maybe soon, folks like my brother-in-law can afford to come home to be with their families. 
 WASHINGTON </span>It has become conventional wisdom that Republicans are suffering an internal split that President Obama is successfully exploiting to neuter the Republican House. It is not true, however, that the Republican split is philosophical and fundamental. And that a hopelessly divided GOP is therefore headed for decline, perhaps irrelevance. <br> How do we know? Simple thought experiment: Imagine that we had a Republican president. Would the party be deeply divided over policy, at war with itself in Congress? Not at all. It would be rallying around something like the Paul Ryan budget that twice passed the House with near 100 percent GOP unanimity. <br> In reality, Republicans have a broad consensus on program and policy. But they don't have the power. What divides Republicans today is a straightforward tactical question: Can you govern from one house of Congress? Should you even try? <br> Can you shrink government, restrain spending, bring a modicum of fiscal sanity to the country when the president and a blocking Senate have no intention of doing so? <br> They were willing to risk the fiscal cliff. Today they are willing to risk a breach of the debt ceiling and even a government shutdown rather than collaborate with Obama's tax-and-spend second-term agenda. <br> The party establishment is coming around to the view that if you try to govern from one house -- e.g., force spending cuts with cliffhanging brinkmanship -- you lose. You not only don't get the cuts. You get the blame for rattled markets and economic uncertainty. You get humiliated by having to cave in the end. And you get opinion polls ranking you below head lice and colonoscopies in popularity. <br> Obama's postelection arrogance and intransigence can put you in a fighting mood. I sympathize. But I'm tending toward the realist view: Don't force the issue when you don't have the power. <br> The more prudent course would be to find some offer that cannot be refused, a short-term trade-off utterly unassailable and straightforward. For example, offer to extend the debt ceiling through, say, May 1, in exchange for the Senate delivering a budget by that date -- after four years of lawlessly refusing to produce one. <br> Go small and simple. Forget about forcing tax reform or entitlement cuts or anything major. If Obama wants to recklessly expand government, well, as he says, he won the election. <br> Aren't you failing the country, say the insurgents? Answer: The country chose Obama. He gets four years. 
 There will be tremendous hardship on family pocketbooks if Washington drives America over the fiscal cliff come January 1.But the financial damage from that will be as nothing compared to the fiscal crisis and debt that await the Millennials--Americans aged five to 30 who seem doomed to be remembered as America’s Debt-Paying Generation. <br> Will Washington really let this happen?It will as long as it continues to doggedly ignore basic facts about our debt problems. Here are three basic mistakes our leaders make—to the peril of the rising generation. <br> One: Both parties carefully chose their facts when they talk about making tough cuts. The House Republican budget targets Medicaid spending and entitlements – both good things. Yet it fails to embrace much needed spending reforms in defense and Social Security. <br> According to calculations done by the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Data Analysis, 69% of the federal budget is made up of 47 programs, most of them social spending. Add in interest payments, and over 80% of the federal budget is made up of 48 areas of federal spending. Yet Democrats focus on defense, a large but shrinking percentage of the federal budget, and Republicans would rather look at nutrition programs for poor mothers than eliminate energy and farm subsidies. <br> How important are interest payments to balancing the budget over time? In 2011, they amounted to $454 billion, or 12.5% of the budget, or about 3% of Gross Domestic Product for all debt, and $227 billion for publicly held debt. But these reflect current record low interest rates, as calculated by CBO, of 2.1%. Now suppose the economy pulls itself out of the doldrums, and interest rates return by 2016 to a more normal 4%? Interest on the borrowing for that year’s deficit will be $14 billion greater as compared to today’s debt servicing, and payments over the following decade would jump by 90% as compared to CBO’s expectations of that time period. All told, that extra $1.67 trillion equals $5,352.56 greater debt per American. And as the debt continues to grow, so will those payments. <br> The simple fact is that revenues are down because of the stagnant economy, but in all actuality the federal government would have plenty of revenue with current rates, which it did prior to the recession. Therefore, it is an error for conservatives to fall prey to the same mistakes liberals make when analyzing the nation’s fiscal and economic problems, and pretend that spending is not the entirety of the problem. 
 I don’t know about you but I have always been leery of politicians who have “grown” during their time in Washington. <br> [pullquote] <br> It should be pointed out that 64 % of all new jobs are created by small business owners and they will take it on the chin if Mr. Obama and his allies in the Senate have their way and bump the tax rate from 35% to 39.6 %. <br> There is much talk of a “Grand Bargain” by the president. From this conservative’s point of view -- any grand bargain must include no net tax increase, no decoupling of tax rates, no sequester without spending reductions, and insist on a no two step process that kicks the can down the road, and no increase to the debt limit without budget cuts and spending caps. <br> Republicans historically have been the party of low taxes. This stance on taxes has served the party well and because of Reagan and Kemp it resulted in 25 years of record economic growth for America. <br> My message to the party's leaders is this: don’t play the president’s class warfare game on taxes, and question why bloated and duplicitous government programs need more money especially when the nation has incurred a $16 trillion debt that is growing daily. <br> The public also understands if we keep on the same track that the president and allies have prescribed -- we are then well on our way to that of Greece. 
 Let’s stipulate something about the current tussle at the edge of the fiscal cliff. President Obama and the Democrats and the media--the champions of expanding the public sector at the expense of the rest of us–are going to win, and the Republicans–the last remaining defenders of the private sector–are going to lose. Taxes will go up on upper-income Americans, and spending will continue to grow–and Republicans will glumly go along with it. <br> The goal of getting Republicans to agree to raise taxes is not to raise new revenues. After all, allowing the Bush tax rates to expire for wealthier Americans will bring in perhaps $67 billion a year; Warren Buffet’s plan for a thirty percent minimum tax rate for millionaires another $5 billion. That’s spit in the ocean compared to annual deficits of $1 trillion and counting–let alone a $16 trillion national debt. <br> And contrary to reports from the media, the goal isn’t “to raise the morale of the middle class”by punishing the rich, or any such class warfare strategy. <br> What a Republican capitulation on taxes will really mean is a future of political defeats stretching out beyond the horizon, as a disheartened base either stays home or wages bitter Tea Party versus Establishment primary fights like the ones that cost them the Senate this year. <br> What Obama and the Democrats are hoping is that GOP lawmakers will publicly abandon the no-new-taxes pledge they signed as part of their campaigns for office. The media like to blame Grover Norquist for the pledge, but he was only the instrument, and his Americans for Tax Reform the vehicle, made for the purpose. The pledge was simply a solemn promise to voters that this Republican candidate at least, when he went to Washington, would not be party to stealing more from the private sector in order to grow the welfare state. <br> Honor and trust. Breaking the no-tax pledge violates both–and it’s hard to see how either ever comes back. And the Democrats know it. That’s why they’ve focused on the pledge. They don’t just want to take away Republicans’ voters; they also want to destroy their sense of honor and integrity. They know it will make Republicans more compliant for future deals, and more alienated than ever from the voters they will need if they ever get another chance to salvage what’s left of this country. 
 The 2012 election did not provide a clear mandate for either party, and certainly not for President Obama. The election itself reflected the polarization of the last four years and offered little in the way of direction about what the American people would like to see done. Rather, this election was more about tactics and campaign techniques than it was about messaging or any sort of vision for the future. <br> The just completed survey shows that over three quarters of the American people would support a compromise that lowers tax rates, reduces deductions as well as promoting pro-growth fiscal policies – all the while reigning in spending and entitlements. In short, the electorate has clearly agreed on a path forward. If only the politicians would listen. <br> A mere 2 days after both sides pledged to work together to reduce the debt and deficit, Republican and Democratic leaders were back to their original position with President Obama saying it is essential to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and House Speaker John Boehner, just as adamant over the weekend in his rejection of any tax increases. <br> Both parties are now viewed extremely negatively – 58 percent view the Republicans in Congress unfavorably and 56 percent say the same about the Democrats. And both parties receive almost equal blame for the country’s economic deterioration – a testament to the deep dissatisfaction the electorate feels towards politicians from both side of the aisle. <br> The results of my survey of 600 randomly selected Americans suggests that the American people are far more aware of the gravity of the fiscal situation than either party has acknowledged. <br> The Bowles-Simpson framework is a clear starting point for negotiation. After receiving widespread public support from the business community just before the election, it is my belief that Bowles-Simpson can, and arguably should, form the basis for both a short term and long term approach to our fiscal challenges. <br> Indeed, there is widespread skepticism that either party has an approach that can save us from the worst ravages of the fiscal crisis. <br> Fortunately, the path forward is clear. Tax reform that reduces rates and limits deductions will, in the electorate’s mind, stimulate the economy and job growth as well as providing a way to address both President Obama’s desire for greater revenue from the wealthy and Speaker Boehner’s desire to lower tax rates. To be sure, tough decisions would have to be made about which deductions to limit, but the idea of means testing the home mortgage deduction and charitable deductions is an immediate possibility for consideration. 
 “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, there’ll be hell to pay in the next election”. This should be the simple yet loud message Latino voters must send to President Obama as he prepares for a second term. We’ve heard the campaign promises before and the many excuses that followed. We heard the blame game, over and over again. But this time, no excuses will be accepted nor tolerated. <br> When you look at a precinct analysis of targeted counties in Florida, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia, you realize that not only did Obama scored historically high levels of support, but he also got the largest turnout in Latino voting history. And that turnout was sufficiently high to deliver those swing states and provide President Obama the margin he needed to win reelection. The exit polls do not show the extent of this effort. Precinct results in predominantly Puerto Rican areas in the I-4 corridor in Florida, show Obama received over 84% and the turn out increased by 15 points. Similar data exists for South Florida, Northern Virginia, Las Vegas, Denver and other predominantly Latino neighborhoods. &nbsp; <br> On the Democratic side, action on immigration legislation needs to happen within the first 100 days of the new administration. If it doesn’t happen then, it will not happen at all. If the President is serious about his commitment to this issue, then he needs to make it a legislative priority and have something submitted within the first three months. Otherwise it will become once again a partisan blame game, and once again we will be witnessing four years from now, a Democratic presidential candidate promising to deliver immigration reform. <br> Many Latino activists at the grassroots level fear that the Obama Administration will make a minor, yet well publicized effort in Congress and not achieve a bipartisan consensus. Then they will drop the ball and once again say “we tried, but the Republicans blocked us.” <br> The message should be loud and clear: No excuses. You fooled us once in 2008. If you try to fool us again in 2012, there will be hell to pay for Democratic politicians in the 2014 mid-term elections. No excuses. <br> But most importantly, the Republican Party needs to stop using insulting rhetoric. They need to craft real reforms based on free market principles and an effective communications strategy to promote them. And they need to make Latinos feel that they are truly welcomed and wanted. Not just during a campaign, but in the process of developing policy and political strategies. In other words, treat us as adults. <br> Latinos finally entered the national political stage with a big splash. The question is how they will use this new influence and power. If the average Latino voter does not see quick results after all the promises made, you will see a disillusioned community that will revert to political apathy. Let’s make sure that we hold politicians accountable to those who elected them. It’s time to get the job done. No excuses accepted nor tolerated. 
 It’s over, thank God. After months – years-- of polling and sniping, calculating and conquering, Americans have chosen Barack Obama to lead them Forward! for the next four years. <br> Sour-grapes types may think the president learned just how far you can ride on personal popularity – that even though most people think the country is headed in the wrong direction, they don’t hold him accountable. That even though they dislike the president’s signature legislation, they will allow him more such “bold experimentation.” That even though they do not think he is the best candidate to nurture economic expansion, and that 59% of the electorate say that is their number one concern -- they will give him another shot. He might have learned how easy it is to blame his shortcomings on other people. <br> A sourpuss might conclude that President Obama learned this: that winning was everything. <br> With luck he heard from small business owners who are stymied by the lava flow of rules and regulations flowing from the Obama White House. Perhaps he heard the discouraged woman who said she was “exhausted at defending” the president and who wondered “Is this my new reality?” <br> Perhaps Mr. Obama will reflect on the important (possibly pivotal) support role played by former President Bill Clinton. Clinton’s enduring popularity, in spite of being only the second-ever Commander in Chief to have been impeached, can be traced to his ability to work with the opposition and pass popular legislation such as welfare reform. Clinton is viewed as a moderate – someone who moved the country in a direction approved by most voters. They like him for it. <br> Republicans also learned some lessons of importance. Mr. Obama’s campaign brilliantly sliced up the American people, and then gobbled up one portion after another. <br> Exit polling reported by the American Enterprise Institute reveal that 59% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in most circumstances. Like gay marriage, this is an issue where attitudes are moving away from the GOP; adopting an aggressively anti-abortion platform will not help win elections. <br> Hispanics were another group that shunned the GOP ticket. This is a tragedy; as many have said, hard work and aspiration are essential to Hispanics – they should be voting Republican, but have been disenfranchised by the right’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. As with abortion, sentiment is softening; exit polls revealed that 65% of voters think that illegals working in the U.S. should be offered a shot at legal status. Republicans like John McCain have led the search for a bipartisan solution to this issue; they need to get in front of the quest once again. 
 You should get to know the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is only polite, because the IRS wants to get to know you better. Much better. Soon. If President Obama is re-elected his ObamaCare legislation will continue to go into effect step by step.You already know about the 20 taxes, many conveniently phased in after the 2010 and 2012 elections: The rationing board or IPAB that will decide how much health care older Americans really need; taxes go up on medical devices; If you have a flexible savings account or health savings account, new taxes damage your insurance. But most Americans are not yet aware of the role the IRS will play in enforcing ObamaCare. Whenever the federal government wants to make us do something the easiest enforcement agency are the nice folks at the IRS and they are preparing the paperwork to police your health care decisions so they fit Washington’s plans. <br> One wonders if ObamaCare's mandate is a good idea, why it was delayed? Obama and those Democratic Senators and Congressmen who voted for ObamaCare appear to think you might not be happy with what happens in 2014 and they prefer you come face to face with the non-negotiable mandate after you vote in 2012. So what does happen in 2014 if Obama wins? What is he hiding? To help out American taxpayers who like to be prepared, today Americans for Tax Reform released the projected tax form that will be required of all American citizens not presently in prison. You can view and print out your projected IRS form at www.ObamacareTaxForm.com. The Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare forces all Americans to buy a health insurance plan deemed “qualified” by the Department of Health and Human Services. The HHS bureaucracy will decide what your insurance will include.You don’t get to choose. The old slogan that if you liked your health insurance you could keep it was suckers bait and is “no longer operative.” As they said in Animal House—you screwed up kid, you trusted him.<br /> If you don’t buy the insurance Washington tells you that you have to pay a tax penalty ranging from $695 to $2085 or higher depending on the size of your family. The dollar amount will grow over time. So the IRS form will require that you certify that you had Uncle Sam-mandated insurance each and every month of the year.You will have to disclose your personal identifying health ID number, the nature of the insurance and any information from your health insurance card the IRS regulations demand in the future. Now if you are a prisoner in a federal penitentiary or an undocumented immigrant or a welfare recipient you don’t have to pay the tax penalty. You might want to print out the form---based on the legislation and congressional testimony where they explained everything ObamaCare will require you and your family to do—to begin the process of reporting everything toWashington.You will note that because an estimated 6 million Americans will be forced to pay the tax as they are unable or unwilling to buy the health insurance demanded by the federal government, they will find that penalties and interest payments will pile up over time. It is best to prepare now to save up to pay these taxes and to open your personal health ID information to be shared with the nice government workers at the IRS. They are just doing what the law commands. And we will have to also. Or you could vote in such a way that the IRS forms will go into the dustbin of history. 
 Presidential Debate III was more like “Rocky” Round 16, an afterthought where neither boxer really lands a clean punch on the other and where the crowd has dozed off or gone to bed. Only in the land of MSNBC were sparks flying. <br> “I think they hate Obama. They want him out of the White House more than they want to destroy Al Qaeda. Their No. 1 enemy in the world right now, on the right, is their hatred, hatred for Obama. And we can go into that about the white working class in the South and looking at these numbers we're getting the last couple days about racial hatred in many cases … this isn't about being a better president, they want to get rid of this president,’ he said.” <br> [pullquote] <br> The Huffington Post, a major prObama operation, criticized the economic focus and the moderator’s inability to change that. “Schieffer seemed to be unwilling or unable to move the conversation back to international issues for some minutes,” wrote HuffPo. <br> White House senior adviser and 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe backed off that almost immediately after the debate. “No one thinks it should happen,” Politico reported him saying. <br> As CNN’s now-much-more-famous Candy Crowley put it, “the president came to rough up Mitt Romney.” GOP candidate Romney, on the other hand, “approached this like a physician: ‘first do no harm’” <br> Two NBC staffers noted a key difference between the candidats. “Meet The Press” host David Gregory agreed with Crowley. “Romney seemed more interested in coming across as a sober and careful commander in chief than a bellicose alt to President,” he commented on Twitter. <br> Supporters on the right and the left saw what they wanted to see. Lefty MSNBC analyst Jonathan Alter naturally felt even a peace-supporting Romney was bad. “By reversing his views on war and peace, Romney has raised a character issue about his ability to be trusted as a steadfast defender of U.S.,” he argued. <br> Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, credited the job Schieffer did. “Whatever his biases, and he has biases, Bob Schieffer didn't show them tonight. Unlike Candy Crowley and Martha Raddatz, Schieffer managed to moderate this debate without revealing his own positions. Well done.” <br> The debate was not without its Schieffer-isms. To end a discussion of education, Schieffer added: “I think we all love teachers.” And, of course, he began the first debate question with a reference to liberal icon John F. Kennedy. <br> And yes, Obama once again had more time than Romney, though only 35 extra seconds.

 On Oct. 3, I raised a question here that reflected President Obama’s strong momentum and Mitt Romney’s apparent readiness to accept defeat. <br> I have my answer. I’ve gotten it so many times in the last 17 days that I am now convinced of it. <br> And I am starting to believe he will be. <br> He was drifting, not fighting, and seemed oddly content with a race sliding away, as though the nomination was victory enough. Obama, on the other hand, gave every indication he wanted to keep the job, no matter what it took. His re-election had a growing sense of inevitability. <br> Some polls show him leading nationally by as much as 6 points, and the Electoral College map is moving in his direction. Romney still needs more states in his column and there is plenty of time for the race to swing back to Obama. <br> That’s how good he’s been. Partially, he moved the needle by putting meat on the bones of his tax-reform plan and linking it to economic growth and jobs. Obama responded by calling him a liar — not very presidential — and failed to match him with a second-term agenda that would give undecided voters a rationale for backing him. <br> The new Mitt showed up at the Al Smith dinner Thursday night. His delivery of the biting jokes, some at his own expense, was direct and his timing was shockingly good. His bearing, instead of merely business-patrician, was elegant and leader-like. You could say it was presidential. <br> The effect on the 1,600 New Yorkers jammed into the Waldorf-Astoria ballroom was powerful. The ovation he received after his 10-minute speech was far stronger than when he began. It was a killer performance before a hard-to-please crowd. <br> He still faces a long, winding road to the White House, and doing well in Monday night’s final debate is essential. But because of his newfound determination, Romney controls his own destiny. The race is his to win. 
 Told ya so. President Obama should have pulled a Joe Girardi and benched Joe Biden long ago. Hillary Rodham Clinton would have knocked last night’s debate out of the park and probably won the election for the Democrats. <br> Following his mood swings was like riding a roller coaster. He was over-amped in the beginning and somber and melancholy toward the end. Did the medication kick in, or was it wearing off? <br> Biden’s conduct was both rude and alarming. Instead of the services of liberal moderator Martha Raddatz, who was too deferential to Biden, we needed EMTs with a straitjacket. <br> As such, he passed the most important test before him. With Mitt Romney shaking up the race with his brilliant performance in the first presidential debate, Ryan hoped to compound the gains. He may have done that in some quarters, but at the very least, he did no damage. <br> He was especially good on describing the political nature of the Obama troop drawdown in Afghanistan by explaining how commanders wanted the troops there for the fighting season. Biden’s response, that politics were not involved at all is simply not believable to the many commanders who objected. <br> Those moments, where Biden controlled the time and set the agenda by repeating false charges of Romney’s tax- reform plan that Ryan was forced to rebut, showed Biden at his Washington best. Arrogantly commanding the floor and talking with a certainty that belies his erratic record, he pointed his finger and even lectured Raddatz that “facts matter” when she dared challenge him. <br> To the extent that Biden’s hyper behavior was planned, it was clearly designed to reverse the image of a downcast, low-energy Obama in the first debate. Biden succeeded in that, but his conduct reinforced my concerns about his mental state. He doesn’t seem steady. <br> If they had a record they could defend, they would. And with two more presidential debates to come, Obama still must describe what a second term would look like. 
 If President Barack Obama is given a second term, one vitally important group of taxpayers—small employers—will face five key tax increases: <br> 2. Death Tax Increase. The death tax in 2012 has a top rate of 35 percent, and a “standard deduction” of $5 million ($10 million in the case of a married couple or surviving spouse). President Obama’s plan proposes raising the rate to 45 percent and slashing the exemption to $3.5 million. When a family business owner dies, it’s up to the surviving family members to pay the death tax to the government. Needless to say, many successful, job-creating small businesses simply won’t survive this process. Such families will have little choice but to sell the business (and lay off all the employees) in order to pay the IRS. Or they will have to pay a small fortune to lawyers, accountants, and the life insurance industry to avoid this fate. 3. ObamaCare self-employment tax rate increase. Currently, successful small business owners face a self-employment tax of 2.9 percent. Thanks to ObamaCare’s 2013 hike in this tax rate, this will rise to 3.8 percent. All told, the combination of the income tax hike and the self-employment tax hike will raise the marginal income tax rate on small business profits from about 38 percent today to about 43 percent in 2013. That extra five percentage points might not sound like a lot, but most small employers have very thin profit margins. A company with $1 million in profits facing a higher tax rate of 5 percentage points will be saddled with another $50,000 in taxes. 4. ObamaCare Medical Device Tax: Taking effect in 2013, this 2.3 percent tax on companies making devices such as prosthetic limbs, pacemakers, and operating tables is particularly destructive because it is levied on gross sales, even if the respective company doesn’t earn a profit in a given year. The industry employs 409,000 Americans in 12,000 plants across the country, and many incur a loss for several years as they pioneer the next generation of life-improving devices. This looming $20 billion tax is already causing small business job loss and cuts to research and development budgets. Even liberal Democratic Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren knows the medical device tax is destructive to small business. She wrote an op-ed in opposition to the tax, saying: “When Congress taxes the sale of a specific product through an excise tax, as the Affordable Care Act does with medical devices, it too often disproportionately impacts the small companies with the narrowest financial margins and the broadest innovative potential. It also pushes companies of all sizes to cut back on research and development for life-saving product.” Eighty percent of device companies have fewer than 50 employees, according to the Medical Device Manufacturers Association. Many of these small businesses are located in electoral swing states such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Florida, and New Hampshire. 5. ObamaCare Investment Surtax: Also taking effect in 2013, this tax increase captures those few small business owners not covered by the self-employment tax hike: owners of Subchapter-S corporations and limited partners. These owners are currently exempt from self-employment tax, mostly because they are investors rather than proprietors. But ObamaCare sweeps them into the IRS net too, forcing them to pay the 3.8 percentage point tax as an “investor surtax.” This will make it far more difficult for investors to raise money to start up small firms. An investor is going to need to see even greater small business profit projections to overcome this higher “hurdle rate” of taxes. Not only does a small business owner have to give his investor a strong return on his investment, he now has to do it with a giant tax mill around his neck. 
 When the House failed to pass Rep. Lamar Smith’s STEM Jobs Act Thursday night, I cried for America. The bill would have reallocated 55,000 green cards to foreign-born graduates with advanced degrees in science, tech, engineering, and math (STEM). By deciding we don't want to keep the world's best and brightest, we squandered an easy, no-cost and long-term boost to our economy. Our political leaders decided to push our nation from world class to average. <br> Yet, when these bright foreign students receive their masters and Ph.D.s from our top universities, we force them to the back of the visa line. Many leave reluctantly, but once back in their native countries they do what we don’t let them do here: innovate, create jobs and build businesses which then compete with U.S. companies. <br> Yet, in this case, actions and words don't match. For more than three years, President Obama and the Democrats have said they will only change the law as part of overall immigration reform. Republican leaders decided for the good of the country to cast off their anti-immigration extremists and push a simple fix. This was more difficult for Republicans than you would think. Just last year, I debated a far right Republican congressman who said he would rather have American B students than foreign A students. I responded that America is an A country. <br> Despite the president’s overtures, for the floor vote the White House went quiet. The word is the administration sent notice to its congressional allies to kill the bill. Democratic House members told reporters they liked letting bright STEM graduates stay here but opposed the Republican legislation because it required a corresponding drop in the number of lottery immigrants - those we allow in from other countries through random lottery. <br> I have no problem with unskilled legal immigrants. I descend from them. Many if not most are hard working and take tough entry-level jobs. <br> All but 30 Democrats voted against this legislation last Thursday. God bless these 30 Democrats for bucking the White House and for putting our nation ahead of party loyalty. 
 With the economy sputtering, President Obama would like voters to believe he faces tougher challenges than any president since Franklin Roosevelt and needs two terms to turn things around. Sadly, the president’s problems are so daunting only because his policies are not up to the task. <br> In 1980, Americans were bearing double-digit interest rates and inflation, growing trade deficits on oil and with export juggernauts Japan and newly industrializing economies in Asia, and stuck in a malaise of self-doubt quite similar to today. <br> [pullquote] <br> He removed Carter-era policies that discouraged domestic oil production, and aggressively sought to right-size regulation—not slash and burn, but retaining what was needed to keep business honest and foster competition, and jettisoning the rest. <br> When President Reagan faced voters in 1984, the economy was growing at 6.3 percent and unemployment was down to 7.3 percent—it ultimately fell to 5 percent, as Old Dutch engineered a 92 month economic expansion. <br> Similarly, Mr. Obama inherited an economy crippled by gaping trade deficits—this time with China and again on oil, and too much financial chicanery on Wall Street. <br> President Obama has limited offshore drilling in the Gulf, the North Slope of Alaska and Atlantic and Pacific Coasts—no surprise the petroleum trade deficit is up nearly 70 percent since the recovery began. <br> All this is exacerbated by Dodd-Frank financial reforms, whose bureaucratic burdens are forcing small banks to sell out to their larger brethren on Wall Street, where the deal making, sharp practices and gambling continue seemingly unabated. <br> As President Obama faces the voters, the economy is growing at a 2.2 percent pace. Unemployment has fallen to 8.3 percent but only because so many adults have quit looking for work altogether. If the adult labor force participation rate was the same today as when he took office, the jobless rate would be 11 percent, and most economists see little room for improvement on that sad record. <br> Encouraging individual initiative and entrepreneurs, an understandable tax system, producing more American oil, getting a fair deal for American workers competing with China, lowering health care costs, and smarter regulation of Wall Street—it all makes sense. 
 Monday's announcement by President Obama that he wants Congress to extend tax cuts for middle class families earning under $250,000 for one year is a vivid demonstration of his campaign taking the initiative in the 2012 race. <br> The president's one year tax cut is for Americans making under $250,000. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) want the tax cut to apply to those making $1 million or less. <br> Monday's announcemet is a huge win for the president and a clear indication that the Romney campaign was once again backfooted. 
 While the individual mandate tax gets most of the attention, the ObamaCare law actually contains 20 new or higher taxes on the American people. These taxes are gradually phased in over the years 2010 (with its 10 percent “tanning tax”) to 2018 (when the tax on comprehensive health insurance plans kicks in.) <br> 1. The ObamaCare Medical Device Manufacturing Tax <br> These are often small, scrappy companies with less than 20 employees who pioneer the next generation of life-prolonging devices. In addition to raising the cost of health care, this $20 billion tax over the next ten years will not help the country’s jobs outlook, as the industry employs nearly 400,000 Americans. Several companies have already responded to the looming tax by cutting research and development budgets and laying off workers. <br> This onerous tax provision will hit Americans facing the highest out-of-pocket medical bills. Currently, Americans are allowed to deduct medical expenses on their 1040 form to the extent the costs exceed 7.5 percent of one’s adjusted gross income. <br> 3. The ObamaCare Flexible Spending Account Cap</b> <br> The cap will also affect families with special-needs children, whose tuition can be covered using FSA funds. Special-needs tuition can cost up to $14,000 per child per year. This cruel tax provision will limit the options available to such families, all so that the federal government can squeeze an additional $13 billion out of taxpayer pockets over the next ten years. <br> For further proof, note the ObamaCare “medicine cabinet tax” which since 2011 has barred the 13.5 million Americans with Health Savings Accounts from purchasing over-the-counter medicines with pre-tax funds. <br> Under current law, the capital gains tax rate for all Americans rises from 15 to 20 percent in 2013, while the top dividend rate rises from 15 to 39.6 percent. The new ObamaCare surtax takes the top capital gains rate to 23.8 percent and top dividend rate to 43.4 percent. The tax will take a minimum of $123 billion out of taxpayer pockets over the next ten years. <br> 5. The ObamaCare Medicare Payroll Tax increase <br> As you can understand, there is a reason why the authors of ObamaCare wrote the law in such a way that the most brutal tax increases take effect conveniently after the 2012 election. It’s the same reason President Obama, congressional Democrats, and the mainstream media conveniently neglect to mention these taxes and prefer that you simply “move on” after the Supreme Court ruling. 
 There's no question that Thursday's ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance starting in 2014 is a short term victory for President Obama. That's simply undeniable. <br> But there's a downside in today's news for the White House and the president's 2012 reelection campaign. <br> A new Associated Press-GfK poll found that the Affordable Care Act remains unpopular across-the-board -- and particularly among independent swing voters. Indeed, Just a third of Americans overall -- and only 21 percent of independents approve of the law, a new low in AP-GfK polling. <br> Indeed, it will mean that the legislation will now be explicitly seen in the context of higher taxes for hardworking Americans at a time of weakened economic conditions. <br> What the President needs to do is something that he has been reluctant to do -- take on the issue of entitlement policy in the context of overall fiscal and budgetary reform. <br> Moreover, he must put forth a comprehensive set of policy prescriptions to address the issues that the American people regard as fundamental, and a long-term economic agenda that emphasizes tax reform, fiscal prudence, and economic growth -- as well as the need to rein in entitlements, balance the budget, and reduce the debt and deficit. <br> For his part, Mitt Romney will almost certainly say that his first act if elected President will be repealing ObamaCare, and continue to attack the higher taxes and the impact on health care costs that will surely result. <br> But with Mitt Romney's own favorability ratings remaining low and a new round of polling showing Obama holding a consistent advantage in key swing states -- it is a strategy with limited upsides. 
 President Obama greeted last week’s rotten news on unemployment by saying the economy is facing “serious headwinds.” It took him three-plus years to figure that out? <br> Fine, Obama took office in the teeth of the Great Recession, with businesses shedding jobs in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But that was three-plus years ago. <br> Then his party lost big in 2010 -- and he apparently gave up on doing anything to help the economy. He even ignored the recommendations of his bipartisan deficit-reduction panel -- including its push for tax reform, probably the best economic-growth idea to ever come near this White House. <br> Dodd-Frank almost assures that taxpayers will have to bail out the “too big to fail” banks in the next blowup, while heaping so many regulations on them that they aren’t lending to small business. For all the handouts given to people with underwater mortgages, housing prices remain depressed. And the twin culprits of the housing bubble, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, remain largely intact, still running up new taxpayer-backed debt. <br> They told us the stimulus would bring unemployment down to less than 6 percent by now; it’s 8.2 percent -- and rising. 
 I first met Mitt Romney in the fall of 1985 when he took a chance on me and my idea to sell discount office supplies. Together we then worked to found Staples. <br> That was the idea behind Staples. <br> Now that he’s campaigning for president, Mitt’s brand of leadership could not come at a more critical time. <br> What we do have is unemployment over 8 percent for 39 months, the longest stretch since the Great Depression. <br> President Reagan once said that “the more plans fail, the more the planners plan.” Nothing more aptly captures the behavior of the Obama administration. <br> That is a recipe for more failure of the kind we already have seen. <br> In actuality, his policies are deeply unfair. They involve having the federal government pick winners and losers in the marketplace. <br> The $2 trillion dollar price tag for ObamaCare is Exhibit B. <br> It’s time to let Mitt Romney clean up this mess. <br> He’s spent his life turning around failing enterprises and starting new ones. He has a keen appreciation for how our overgrown tax code strangles job creation. He understands why high marginal tax rates undermine investment. <br> Mitt’s tax reform plan will also increase America’s global competitiveness at a moment when we desperately need to compete. By reducing the corporate tax rate to 25 from the current 35 percent—the highest rate in the developed world—his plan would level the playing field for American companies. This, together with elimination of the repatriation tax, would create incentives for companies to bring capital and jobs home from overseas and broaden the tax base. Mitt clearly understands that cutting taxes sometimes can increase revenues. <br> Mitt Romney has put forward such a plan. 
 Editor's note: FoxNews.com is pleased to present an excerpt from 'The Debt Bomb: A Bold Plan to Stop Washington from Bankrupting America' by US Senator Tom Coburn.</i> <br> America’s Ticking Debt Bomb <br> The end-of-the-year meeting was held to discuss how to handle what had become the annual holiday train wreck in Washington when important bills were put off until the last minute. Not long after Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) began to go through the agenda, the meeting turned into an intervention – with ourselves. <br> It was an important point. The Senate Finance Committee is in many ways the committee of jurisdiction in the Senate. We oversaw the largest portions of the budget – health care, entitlements, and taxes – in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. Any solutions would come through us and should begin with us. <br> “I’d like us to be senators again and do what we are supposed to be doing. Instead we keep kicking the can down the road,” Baucus agreed. <br> It seemed the committee was waking up and accepting responsibility. <br> He was right. The fact that we had not done tax reform in 25 years – since 1986 – was a pox on both houses. Neither party wanted to let go of their favorite loopholes, exemptions, and deductions, even though doing so could lower rates and spur tremendous economic growth and job creation. Each side had a schizophrenic approach to tax reform that said, “Support simplification, give me complexity.” <br> Our discussion showed that many in Congress – and the administration – understood the severity of our problem. We all knew that we could not continue to borrow more than 40 cents for every dollar we spent. Yet, few were willing to risk their political careers to solve the problem. Most politicians were content to sit in their partisan bunkers and cling to the illusion that they were holding a line, when the reality was, there were no more lines left to hold. Both parties had betrayed their core beliefs and positions. We were under siege and surrounded on all sides, not by a foreign army but by foreign creditors … <br> America today faces one of the greatest threats to its existence since our founding. The threat does not come from any foreign army or terrorist network, but from our own government and its unsustainable spending. If we don’t change course in the near future – most likely the next two years – America as we’ve known it could soon be a shell of its former self. <br> What is certain is that maintaining our present course is a mathematical impossibility. If we ignore this problem, we will condemn future generations to a lower standard of living with less freedom and less opportunity. Sooner or later, our “debt bomb” will go off. <br> If Tom Clancy could capture our moment, he might call it “Red Ink Rising.” In a very real sense, the threat from borrowing from countries like China is greater than the threat of war with China. Sooner rather than later, a major fund or government will just decide one day that buying U.S. debt is a bad bet. And with one gust of wind, the house of cards will come crashing down. <br> If current patterns hold, we’ll hear increasingly dire warnings and more earnest promises to do something, but no one will act decisively until we experience more economic pain. <br> Stage 1: Congress tries to maintain the status quo on spending and entitlements <br> Stage 3: Interest rates markedly increase, harming consumers and sending interest payments on the national debt soaring <br> In this final stage borrowing enough money to fund our military and other programs will become much more expensive. Because we will be spending more on interest payments, it will be virtually impossible to balance our budget with spending cuts and revenue increases. The hole will be too deep and the sides too steep to climb out. <br> Inflation will make government debt seem smaller by shrinking the value of the dollar. Yet, for individual Americans, inflation will be an insidious hidden tax increase that will make everything you buy more expensive, and everything you own worth less. If our government tries to inflate its way out of a debt crisis, much of your life savings will be wiped out. <br> Finally, the bottom would fall out of the middle class. Unemployment would soar, while the cost of living would increase. Real wage growth has already been stagnant in recent years, and it will be the middle class and lower-income families that pay the price for Washington’s refusal to act. <br> We Can’t Wait on a Solution <br> From my vantage point, having spent hundreds of hours with people who have a sacred responsibility to solve this problem – from the president to congressional leaders – I believe a consensus for a solution already exists in the country and in Washington. But a real solution will never fit into an election-year strategy. In Washington, the moment to do what is right is never today. It is always a mirage just beyond the horizon of the next election. It comes down to a question of political will and courage. Will we be career politicians, or will we be statesmen? 
 As of Sunday, April first, the United States will have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. This new record is not something that would make most Americans proud. <br> The United States was in the middle of the pack when we last changed our rates in 1993. Since 2000, however, 30 of the world’s leading developed countries -- looking to boost their economies -- have cut their rates. <br> Canada cut its by 13 points. <br> Today the worldwide average is 25 percent. <br> Despite this disadvantage, Democrats in Washington have resisted calls to cut America’s exorbitant tax rates. They view corporations as bottomless wells of potential tax money. It doesn’t work that way in the real world. <br> High taxes also leave less money for businesses to expand, innovate and create jobs. The prospect of saving millions of dollars in taxes has caused some U.S. businesses to move overseas, taking their jobs with them. <br> America needs a simple, fair, broad-based tax system with lower rates and fewer loopholes. 
 Newt Gingrich can’t win a primary for love or money, but he sure has gotten under President Obama’s skin. His attacks on the president’s energy policy, or lack thereof, appear to have unnerved the normally unflappable Mr. Obama. <br> The president describes suggested measures that could bring down gas prices as akin to waving a “magic wand”; his press secretary Jay Carney accused anyone promising $2.50 gas of “lying”. How can Mr. Gingrich, who is nearly out of the GOP race, so rattle the White House? <br> He has consistently portrayed fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas as energy products of the past while expressing an almost unimaginably nave optimism about the potential of alternatives. His attachment to high-cost “green” energy has played well with environmentalists but for most of the country – the roughly 50% not concerned about global warming -- it is increasingly viewed as an expensive boondoggle. <br> Mr. Obama further compounded his difficulties by blocking the Keystone XL pipeline. To be sure, the politically motivated decision will have no near-term impact on gasoline prices, but it surely furthers the narrative that the president has turned his back on oil and gas. And to what end? <br> Perhaps Gingrich’s most nettlesome issue for the president, however, comes from the notion that the former House speaker is, as the Washington Post describes him, one of the GOP’s “most visible and prolific idea men.” <br> The irony is that it is President Obama who is out of step with new technology. Remarkable advances in oil and gas extraction have caused a profound change in expectations for our fossil fuel potential. Vastly increased estimates of oil and gas reserves are a serious game changer – and they should be influencing today’s energy policy far more than they are. <br> Instead of championing our local oil and gas producers, the Obama administration has promised to roll back tax breaks meant to encourage exploration and production, putting more onerous energy taxes at the heart of its “tax reform” agenda. <br> This isn’t about tax reform but about reallocating so-called tax expenditures to White House- favored organizations. Polling shows oil and gas companies to be unpopular, and so an easy target. Ditto the corporate jet industry. Heaven forbid the president espouse serious reform, that might undercut farmers, or ethanol producers or some other group receiving tax benefits – he might lose a vote or two. <br> In fairness, there’s not much that can be done in the near term. The White House has fallen back on the canard that higher prices are the work of evil speculators, and has vowed a crackdown. President Obama is also mulling releasing crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to bring down oil prices. <br> This is a foolish gesture, which last time did nothing to rein in prices. Instead, the extra supplies were bought by the Chinese, who are filling a similar reserve. In China, officials doubtless would view an “emergency” need as a serious supply cut-off. For the Obama White House, the emergency is a dip in polls. 
 When Congress acted last month to free much-needed spectrum for mobile broadband, they did so to keep consumer phone bills low and improve broadband service. In the very same week, however, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took steps to shut the doors of a brand new start-up wireless company whose existence would provide similar benefits. <br> This debacle is the direct result of lobbying by the GPS industry and various government agencies, which complained to a cowering FCC that the new wireless network would interfere with their devices. There is natural interference between wireless frequencies, a gray area where one person’s property ends and another’s begins. However, in this instance the GPS devices are the ones causing interference by looking directly into LightSquared’s signal. <br> For example, an FCC working group found that using spectrum situated farther away from GPS frequencies would solve virtually all interference issues. But the idea was dismissed. <br> Instead, the FCC is doing more to help its friends and kowtow to other federal agencies than do its job. It makes one wonder why we don’t phase out the FCC’s top-down system of bureaucrats doling out spectrum licenses and replace it with a free-market approach built upon real property rights. <br> This is a case of anti-free market regulatory capture, where GPS companies and the federal agencies they do business with coordinated to stop LightSquared, as e-mails between Defense Department officials recently revealed. The GPS industry even teamed up with bureaucrats in the Pentagon and other departments to leak a preliminary report on interference issues solely to undermine LightSquared. <br> If the FCC backtracks on giving LightSquared the green light, file this alongside the Keystone Pipeline. The Commission should be allowing LightSquared to try all possible options, including launching a ground network or finding new spectrum. Instead, their actions have already forced the company to lay off half its employees. 
 Editor's note: FoxNews.com is pleased to present an excerpt from Debacle: Obama's War on Jobs and Growth and What We Can Do Now to Regain Our Future the new book by Grover G. Norquist and FoxNews.com contributor John R. Lott Jr.</i> <br> What Was Promised <br> President Obama: Look, I’m at the start of my administration . . . And . . . and, you know, a year from now, I think people . . . are gonna see that . . . we’re starting to make some progress. But there’s still gonna be some pain out there. If I don’t have this done in three years, then there’s gonna be a one-term proposition. <br> The overall impact on jobs saved or created is just about what was predicted.—Austan Goolsbee, the head of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, December 3, 2010 <br> President Obama claims that instead of our economy being short more than 5 million jobs, things would have been even worse without his policies. According to him, we would have lost 10.5 million jobs without all of his spending. No matter how bad the job numbers get, Obama points to some hypothetical economic meltdown that was avoided by his policies. Thus, no evidence whatsoever, no matter how bad the news, can be used against him. <br> And then there was the $42 billion Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which was supposed to create or save another 500,000 jobs. Finally, the Disaster Relief and Summer Jobs Act of 2010 contained a hodgepodge of items, such as $24 billion to help keep teachers, police, and firefighters employed during the recession and $600 million to create 300,000 jobs for youth ages 16 to 24. <br> Even the mainstream media made the administration defend this prediction. By July 2009, it was obvious that the Obama administration’s initial predictions were way off. ABC’s This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Vice President Biden how the 9.5 percent unemployment rate in June squared with the administration’s prediction that if the Stimulus package was passed, “unemployment will peak at about 8 percent.” Biden replied, “We and everyone else misread the economy. The figures we worked off of in January were the consensus figures. . . .” <br> The whole administration spun the claim after Biden’s interview. Economic adviser Jared Bernstein contended that the 8 percent unemployment estimate “was before we had fourth-quarter results on GDP, which we later found out was contracting on an annual rate of 6 percent, far worse than we expected at that time.” Even the president echoed the claim: “It was only after the [fourth]-quarter numbers came in, if you recall, that suddenly everybody looked and said the economy shrank 6%.” <br> There was also plenty of warning before that GDP number was released. In a piece published by the Wall Street Journal on December 11, 2008, with the telling headline “Fourth-Quarter GDP: Worse and Worse” the paper estimated a drop in GDP of 6.2 percent at an annual rate for the fourth quarter. <br> Because of the stimulus, the Obama administration predicted a much milder drop in GDP in 2009 and strong economic growth after that (see Figure 3.2). The economy was only supposed to shrink by –1.2 percent in 2009 and then grow by 3.2 percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2011—leaving the economy up over 6 percent from where it was in 2008. But the actual economy performed much worse each year. Far from growing a robust 4 percent in 2011, the growth was a very anemic 1.4 percent. Over the first three years of the Obama administration, instead of the economy growing by a total of 6 percent, it grew by less than 2 percent. <br> It is also hard to believe that the state of the economy took Obama by surprise. He constantly warned of an economic Armageddon during the 2008 campaign and early 2009. At least once in each of the three presidential debates during September and October 2008, Obama claimed that we were in the “worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.” It was a constant theme of his campaign, and he made that claim again and again in many different speeches. Right after the election, he warned: “We’ve got an unprecedented crisis, or at least something that we have not seen since the Great Depression.” <br> But even after the full extent of the poor economic showing during the end of 2008 was clear, the administration’s predictions at the end of February were much more optimistic and less accurate than those of most economists. While the administration was expecting an average annual unemployment rate of 8.1 percent for the year, business economists and forecasters surveyed in early March by the Wall Street Journal expected the June unemployment rate to be 8.2 percent and the December rate to be at 9.3 percent. <br> Knowing how bad the economy was by the end of 2011, it is hard to believe that in March 2009, just five weeks after passing the Stimulus, President Obama was perceiving an upswing and started off a press conference by announcing: <br> This newfound optimism over the effects of the Stimulus seemed unaffected by the continued bad economic news. Obama declared later in May that the massive spending program was “already seeing results” and had created or saved almost 150,000 jobs. He talked about how the Stimulus was “laying the foundation for a better economy,” and by September, Vice President Biden was declaring: “In my wildest dreams, I never thought it [the Stimulus] would work this well.” By April the following year, the unemployment rate still at 9.8 percent, but Biden thought that now, for sure, the economy was just about to boom: “Some time in the next couple of months we’re going to be creating between 250,000 jobs a month and 500,000 jobs a month.” The administration touted that the summer of 2010 would become known as the “Summer of Recovery.” <br> And he was still making this same claim a year and a half later. Yet, despite Mr. Goolsbee’s claim, the unemployment rate did not rise above 9 percent until May, two months after Obama’s press conference announcing that the Stimulus was already creating jobs. Nor does it explain that the unemployment rate continued to rise, not just above 9 percent, but to 10.1 percent. <br> By the end of the summer, in August 2011, the unemployment rate was still at 9.1 percent. It was no longer possible to claim the Stimulus had worked well. Obama claimed that the sluggish economic growth wasn’t the fault of his own economic policies; it was the fault of other circumstances that he had no control over. It was either events outside the United States or the irresponsible political behavior of others in Washington. Obama claimed: <br> There are a couple of problems with his argument. Economic growth had already ground to a halt during the first three months of 2011—with GDP growing by just 0.1 percent. This was well before the Arab Spring, the renewed debt crisis in Greece and other countries, and the July and August 2011 debate over the debt ceiling. And whatever the impact of the March 2011 earthquake, its initial impact during the first quarter in the United States would have been very limited. The president also blamed Republicans for not passing his new legislation when they took over the House of Representatives in January 2011. But with Democratic supermajorities in both the House and Senate for the two previous years, it is pretty hard to blame for the slow growth in the first half of 2011. <br> Goolsbee, in an interview on Sean Hannity’s radio show in late October 2011, justified Obama’s references to Japan and the Arab Spring this way: “It is not excuses that he is giving for across the board. The question was: Why did we slow down in 2011 when we were growing and adding millions of jobs in 2010?” But it wasn’t just a sudden slowdown in 2011. From December 2009 to December 2010, fewer than a million jobs were added, not “millions.” And Goolsbee’s argument was quite a change from his comments in June 2011, which was well after these events in March, when he dismissed the previous month’s 9.1 percent unemployment rate as an aberration, saying that things were headed in the right direction and that “one month is not a trend.” 
 During his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Obama pushed for higher tax rates on what he called “the wealthiest Americans.” <br> “Fairness” was the codeword of the State of the Union address, not the chronic problem of lingering high unemployment, something the president never even mentioned. <br> Unfortunately, some Republicans come across as confused about capital gains taxes. Romney pushes a weak defense of himself rather than an explanation for why capital gains should be taxed at a lower rate than other income. <br> Still worse, Romney seems content to take other Republicans down with him. Romney attacked Newt Gingrich's tax proposal on Monday, which Romney warned would let him get away with paying even less taxes: <br> GINGRICH: Zero. ROMNEY: Well, under that -- under that plan, I`d have paid no taxes in the last two years. <br> The explanation is actually pretty simple. For every dollar that a company makes, state and federal taxes take on average 40 cents. Who bears the burden of those taxes? The owners of the companies, the shareholders, of course. Not some abstract corporation. <br> How much money in taxes is Obama really proposing that American investors pay? Imposing another 30 percent federal tax comes on top of the 40 percent corporate rate that shareholders are already paying. Obama’s proposed 30 percent tax rate may sound “fair,” but he is completely ignoring the corporate income tax. <br> But where is the fairness in imposing such a much higher high tax rate on those who invest in American businesses? <br> If the president really wants to do something about fairness, he can try not giving out huge government favors to politically favored Democratic billionaires. <br> Much of the oil that would have been shipped by the pipeline will still get shipped by Mr. Buffett’s much more expensive railroad. <br> Or the list of other companies owned by other wealthy politically-connected Democratic billionaires such as Tesla Motors, NRG Energy, and Abound Solar Manufacturing that are receiving billions in government money? 
 TAMPA, Fla. </span>Florida is easily the largest, most important and diverse state to vote in the Republican primaries so far. <br> As for the candidates, each had an overriding priority in the debate Monday evening. <br> Mitt Romney's chief goal was to slow Gingrich's surging momentum and poll numbers. He also wanted to refocus the debate to his strength as a steady and credible conservative who has the business experience necessary to fix America's broken economy. <br> Congressman Ron Paul has a pure libertarian message and looked for every opportunity to convey it. He cannot be the Republican nominee, but is the one most likely to go all the way to the convention in August while accumulating lots of delegates along the way. <br> Gingrich fended off the charges, but was on the defensive for the first quarter of the evening. Romney's strategy was to paint Gingrich as a high risk nominee whose campaign could very well implode in a race against President Obama.. <br> As in past encounters, Ron Paul strongly dissented and spoke out for a reduced military presence and a non interventionist policy around the world. <br> Gingrich's strongest answer might have been reciting the litany of his conservative activities including campaigning for Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, founding groups like the Conservative Opportunity society and GOPAC, and working for ideas such as supply side economics and military strength. <br> Santorum turned in a strong performance and counted on winning voters turned off by the Romney-Gingrich exchanges. However, he could have done more to push the consistent conservative theme by contrasting his views with those of his opponents. <br> The debate showcased the talents of each candidate and all performed well and demonstrated a strong command of the issues. There were tough exchanges, as would be expected when each candidate seeks to set himself apart from the field. <br> If the focus of the fall election is on Obama's economic performance v Republican pledges, one of these candidates will be the next president. <br> He can be reached at: 
 As parents across the country scurry to finish Christmas shopping for their families, Congress is quickly trying to deal with a number of tax provisions that expire at the end of the calendar year. <br> But putting aside the question of whether Congress should extend this cut, the rhetoric used within the debate highlights three current problems Washington has: <br> Republicans are not much better. Many in the GOP are insisting the extension be “paid for” (because it will reduce Social Security funds, and is the responsible thing to do) but it is a position they didn’t take last year during the payroll tax debate. Some claim this amounts to a Republican “identity crisis.” Perhaps, but it certainly indicates the type of disingenuousness that makes Americans fed up. <br> This lack of finality to the debates breeds uncertainty. And when you are dealing with things like unsustainable spending and debt, and taxes, that breeds anxiety in the economy.In addition to that, close deadlines allow lawmakers to use issues like the payroll tax cut as political stunts. <br> We’ve touched on it a bit, but the third problem is one of temporariness. Washington doesn’t like to commit to fiscal measures for too long -- because it doesn’t want a full accounting of the expense -- so the U.S. has become a nation living in a temporary fiscal state. <br> When the nation began the holiday season last year, Washington was having the exact same debate – but about different tax measures. Mark your calendars for December 2012 -- that’s when Congress will have to decide whether or not to extend -- again -- the provisions in the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. <br> It’s time for Congress get off the hamster wheel, it's time for lawmakers to stop using political rhetoric to make up for their missed deadlines and temporary policymaking. It’s time to stop the dysfunction -- and that means making a long-term commitment to real spending and tax reform. 
 Now is the moment for the GOP to blink. A nervous world hopes and prays that the Congressional Deficit Committee aka the Super Committee will agree to serious measures to plug our yawning budget gap. <br> Why now? Because they have won the battle and now must win the war. <br> Today, after the pressure brought to bear on both Republicans and Democrats by disgusted taxpayers, realigning our revenues and outlays tops the nation’s agenda. Imagine: Democrats on the deficit committee are offering up six dollars of cuts for each dollar of revenue increase. The proposal smacks of capitulation. This would not have happened without the Tea Party and its Republican allies. <br> During the summer’s fractious debates over the debt ceiling limit, who could not but admire the resolution of Rep. Paul Ryan and others in Congress who pushed hard – successfully-- for unprecedented spending cuts. And, who resisted equally forcefully any offsetting tax hikes. <br> However, that battle left scars. The brinksmanship is blamed for adding to the insecurity of the nation and the downgrade of our triple-A credit status. Americans wonder: if cutting spending is so positive, why would it impair the standing of our bonds? <br> Americans are not stupid. They know our country is in trouble, and they want the problems fixed. They desperately want leaders who will address our needs – jobs, education, infrastructure, more jobs. They are also pretty sure that simply cutting government spending is not the answer. <br> Also, the country has been convinced – rightly so- of the need for tax reform. Republicans should take the high ground here, allow the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts for the top income brackets and at the same time push for serious tax reform, allowing a net increase in revenues. <br> Government spending is too high relative to GDP today, an excellent argument for cutting spending. However, because of the recession, revenues are also too low. While raising taxes during a slowdown is not appealing, the impact should be softened by having the increases take hold in 2013 or 2014. It doesn’t matter. <br> Our great country needs new leadership. Our jobless need hope, our workers need inspiration. President Obama provides neither. It is essential that Republicans provide both. 
 I like and respect Grover Norquist. Despite the many matters on which I disagree with him, I respect his consistent, deeply held belief in limited government, which leads him to oppose higher taxes as an enforcement mechanism.<br />Norquist genuinely believes that government is a barrier to helping the poor and improving society. That doesn’t make him anti-poor. He simply believes that the best way to uplift lower-income people is by allowing the private market to create jobs and economic opportunity. <br> Norquist proudly keeps the pledge card, co-signed by two-witnesses, in a vault in his office. His theory or strategy behind the pledge is this: Starve the government of new money (higher taxes), and it must shrink. As he colorfully put it, in one of his most famous quotes:<br />“I don’t want to abolish government … I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.”<br />I recently heard a liberal host of an evening cable TV show describe Norquist as evil. I don’t get that. Politicians willingly sign the pledge, either because they believe in it or are fearful of voter reaction if they don’t. So whom do you blame — Norquist, the politicians who agree to sign the pledge, or the voters themselves?<br />As a liberal, I have the same problem with Norquist’s anti-government philosophy as Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a classmate of Norquist’s at Harvard.<br />In an op-ed piece, Patrick questioned the logic of Norquist’s view that “we could live independently of each other, making our own decisions in our own self-interest. But then who puts out the fires? Who answers the calls to 911? Who educates poor children? Who helps people with disabilities?”<br />Norquist would say, I think, well, government, of course. But much less government, supported by much lower taxes.<br />What he has never answered, to my satisfaction at least, is how we can afford to take care of our poor and our elderly and our hungry children without increasing taxes on the wealthier in our society without increasing our unsustainable $14 trillion debt.<br />Recently Norquist took me to task for describing Herbert Hoover as an anti-tax, anti-regulation conservative in one of my recent columns. His e-mail read: “Herbert-Hoover liked: fewer regulations and lower taxes? I am going to have to throw out a great number of history books. Who knew?”<br />Then his assistant sent me the facts: During his one term, Hoover, to my surprise, raised the top income tax rate from 25 percent to 63 (those earning above $100,000/year); raised corporate tax rates; supported increased tariffs in the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Act; and increased spending from 3.4 percent of the GDP in 1929 to 8 percent in 1933, before FDR took office.<br />To use Norquist’s expression: Who knew?<br />Despite his well-known conservatism, Norquist surprises me. He is often willing to defy conservative orthodoxy, especially on issues of tolerance and open-mindedness. 
 As I launch a two-week book tour around the USA promoting “This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House,” it’s a perfect time to reflect upon my campaign for president – and thank God for the opportunities I’ve been given in this great nation. <br> Deeply disturbed at what I saw coming out of the White House under President Obama – from forcing ObamaCare on an unwilling public, to weakening our military, to bowing down to foreign leaders, to his dreadful handling of the economy and soft-on-terrorism policies, it was impossible for me to remain on the sidelines. <br> My message for Barack Obama is this: Hope and Change just ain’t working! <br> Growing up in the segregated South with little money -- my family was rich in faith, love and a belief in the American dream. I learned from my parents, Lenora and Luther Cain, Jr., that <b>empowerment</i> – not entitlement, was the key to achieving success in life. You have to work hard – and given the right national policies for less government and lower taxes – the sky is the limit. <br> It’s true that I’m not a politician. Some say that means I can’t understand the government. Washington is full of politicians – how’s that working out for us? <br> Fortunately, more have started to take note – last week’s Wall St. Journal Opinion piece, “Taking Cain Seriously” was a refreshing sign that my message is resonating with Americans. <br> Looking at the Florida results, shouldn’t the question really be if I think Gov. Romney and Gov. Perry will support me when I win the nomination? <br> Admittedly, a major challenge has been name recognition – building over the year from 21% in April to 51% now. But then again, I haven’t been running for president for 5 years or govern a large state – we’ve had to start from scratch. <br> And although my campaign doesn’t have the resources of some others, the Florida results show that it’s about the message – not the money. It will be Americans who elect the next president – not the media. <br> My vision for economic recovery – the 9-9-9 Plan – gains a stronger following nationwide every day. <br> It’s also time for a strong leader – one who knows the difference between our friends and our enemies - and stops giving money to our enemies. One who doesn’t take his cues from the UN – but rather leads with America’s interests at heart. <br> Lastly, thanks to everyone who has jumped aboard the Cain Train – together we will take this country back to common sense solutions! 
 President Obama is rolling the dice. By pushing the Supreme Court to decide on the legality of his controversial Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare), the president risks having his “legacy” legislation declared unconstitutional. That would be a sizeable body blow for Mr. Obama, who has long expected that voters would cheer on not only the health care overhaul, but also his reelection bid. <br> Most important, the debate will remind voters that Mr. Obama spent a year and a half pushing health care “reform” instead of focusing on job creation. <br> The program’s estimated cost continues to soar while insurance fees are skyrocketing, as insurers offset the bill’s requirements that they cover dependent children and persons with “preexisting conditions.” <br> In 2014, as well, Medicaid rolls will swell, driving up the costs of healthcare across the board. All in all, it is not a pretty picture, and it will not help the president. This was anticipated; the legislation was carefully crafted so that its darker aspects would emerge only after Mr. Obama’s presumed reelection. <br> How could this politically canny administration have gone so wrong? <br> Sadly, the parallels exist. <br> ObamaCare is surely the worst manifestation of this power-grab. One lawyer arguing against ObamaCare before the court describes it as “a massive collection of sweeping changes that impose substantial new federal obligations on every corner of society and compel financial action from nearly every citizen of the United States.” That sounds about right. <br> Most important, Mr. Obama spent his political capital, of which each president has but a limited supply. What could he have accomplished instead? <br> He might have proposed a public/private infrastructure works campaign that would have required only modest funding from the government and yet created jobs. <br> He might have embraced an all-out development of our energy resources – not investing in solar companies that go bankrupt -- but opening new territories to oil and gas drilling, and created jobs. <br> Paul Krugman denies that the administration’s insouciant meddling with industries – autos, banks, insurers, oil companies, drug producers, mining, aerospace, credit card outfits, homebuilders and so on – the list lengthens every week- has anything to do with the failed recovery. He is wrong. <br> Once viewed as the savviest apparatchiks on the planet, the president and his team now seem clueless, consistently misjudging the moment and the message. <br> Unhappily for the country, President Obama has indeed channeled FDR, whose policies subdued our economy for the better part of a decade. Let us hope voters today are smarter than those of the 1930s, and that they judge Mr. Obama on his accomplishments, not on his promises.

 President Obama made clear in his Rose Garden speech on September 19 that he has abandoned all efforts to seek accommodation with the Republicans. The president in his Rose Garden speech made it abundantly clear that he will be aligning himself with the left wing of the Democratic party going forward-- a faction which has previously accused him of selling out to the Republicans. There will be no more grand bargains, no more efforts to reach broad accommodations on tax reform, on reforming entitlements, on cutting defense, and putting together a fiscal plan for our nation's future. <br> The president is effectively banking on the fact that as limited as the public confidence he is that he is now engendering, the Republicans, and at this point that means Rick Perry, will engender even less confidence. Moreover, the president is effectively setting up a campaign where he will say Think I'm bad? They're worse! <br> It is a discouraging set of circumstances which makes clear the point that Pat Caddell, John LeBoutllier and I have all offered on FoxNews.com Live's Campaign Confidential -- that there is a broad center in America that is frustrated and unrepresented, and that the American people are looking for clear alternatives to the two major parties and to their likely standard bearers. 
 Last week's largest decline in the stock market since October 2008 combined with zero growth in employment in August will certainly re-ignite a debate about what the federal government can and should do to get the economy moving and reduce unemployment. In addressing this issue, it's important to learn from the past and focus on the future. <br> Relying primarily on additional deficit-financed government spending is not the answer to our problems. It's time to start treating the diseases rather than the symptoms. To do so, government policy must take steps to increase private sector lending, enable further refinancing of homes at today's historically low rates, and unleash the trillions of dollars of cash and long-term oriented investment capital held by businesses and institutional funds both domestically and internationally. These steps can be accomplished through changes in existing tax policies and regulatory approaches. <br> As we look to the future, the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction needs to exceed its $1.5 trillion 10-year deficit reduction target by taking credible actions based on the individual elements in the CBO's current law baseline. The federal government must also take concrete steps to provide more certainty to businesses regarding future tax policies and regulatory conditions. This means taking steps that will result in comprehensive tax reform and regulatory relief beginning in 2013. <br> It's time to quit trying to use 20th century strategies to deal with 21st century problems. We need to quit just living for today and to start taking steps to help create a better tomorrow. The time to start is now! 
 Reality television is nothing less than captivating. That’s the brutal truth. Only in America could there be entire shows devoted to someone buying clothes for someone else. (In most houses, the personal shopper is called Mom.) But should there ever be an Academy Award for “Best Caricature of a Real Life” on cable television, surely the Kardashians would win for 2011.<br />In a breathtaking display of marketing genius, the Kardashians are reportedly ready to turn their humble family wedding (a mere $20 million affair) into a cash cow, ready for prime time viewing on E.<br />Media buzz is that much of America will tune in into watch coverage this week of the nuptials as people have learned to love Kim through her struggles – with beauty, fame, fortune, and nary a wardrobe malfunction in sight. Truly she represents the common man, Hollywood style, growing up the well-heeled child of Kris Jenner, with lovely sisters and sidekicks whose sing-song support of each other is lampooned regularly – but with a gentle smile – on “Saturday Night Live.”<br />While spending a small fortune, Kim and her crew will reportedly make money off of the wedding production, sale of photos and even from purchases of her limited edition perfume, Love. It would seem the Beatles were wrong; in honor of Kim’s wedding, you CAN buy me Love.<br />But as Kim prepares to wed NBA player Kris Humphries, sporting her 20.5-carat diamond engagement ring, consider the possibility that not only will the Kardashians singlehandedly make the idea of the profitable wedding every father’s dream, they may do more for the economy of the faltering state of California than all of Barack Obama’s so-called stimulus dollars.<br />And that’s a good thing, because, as every woeful business analyst can attest, the American economy is in a coma.<br />President Obama spent roughly $800 billion to hold down unemployment and stimulate the economy into something resembling, say, China. Now he’s trying to hold on to his job, like a lot of other Americans.<br />Bloomberg business news recently reported, “Confidence among U.S. consumers plunged in August to the lowest level since May 1980, adding to concern that weak employment gains and volatility in the stock market will prompt households to retrench.”Retrench – that’s economist code for, “I ain’t buyin’ nothin.’” Meanwhile, all the smart politicians in the Obama administration – without any real world business experience – concur with each other that the way to get people to spend more money is to take their money and give it to Washington, D.C. to spend for them … because that’s worked so well in the past.<br />And those bureaucrats can run up a tab. Americans for Tax Reform reported recently that Americans work a full 224 days a year to pay for local, state and federal government spending and regulations.<br />But let’s get real. In this consumer-driven economy, the Kardashian extravaganza may do more for real people in California than the pitiful fizzy-lifting-drink of Wonka magic that passed for a failed economic boost out of Washington, D.C.<br />Sure, Kim may have to make do with a $20,000 wedding cake styled like England’s royal newlyweds, a Vera Wang wedding dress, and wedding invitations that cost $250 each. <br> Under the Kardashian stimulus plan, at the end of the day, real hair dresses, waiters, bakers, caterers, car rental companies, florists, jewelers, television networks and home shopping denizens among many others will receive a check for a job well done.<br />And as Kim and Kris’ guests throw gold dust, rather than rice, over the departing newlyweds, one can only hope that this real-world stimulus plan is the start of good things for the happy couple – and the great state of California.<br />If the Obama administration would take the bulls-eye off the wallets of Americans with jobs and resources, perhaps then the much maligned “millionaires and billionaires” of Hollywood could get back to the business of creating jobs and circulating resources in the economy. But not just yet. This weekend...they’ll be busy at Kim’s wedding.<br />Kristi Stone Hamrick is a media consultant, future mother of the bride and served as a bridesmaid 19 times.</i> 
 I think the current environment is more like the October 1987 equity crash, when equities closed the year higher, than the September-October 2008 crash when equities continued falling for six months. While the current problems are immense, there’s no equivalent to the disastrous Lehman bankruptcy filing which immediately paralyzed the interbank and commercial paper markets worldwide. Nor is there an equivalent to the abrupt federal takeovers of AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all critical market players that became even more disruptive when they were absorbed into the government. <br> I’m looking for 2 percent third quarter U.S. GDP growth, up from 1.3 percent in the second quarter, and then an acceleration to 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter. If so, equities will do very well but bonds and gold will do badly as the fear trade subsides. <br> Adding to the 2011 turmoil, the Fed issued a statement after its Tuesday meeting that was disastrously gold-inflating at a time when gold is already in a bubble. The Fed threatened two more years of near-zero rates and dangled QE3 in front of financial markets by saying it was considering using “the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery.” <br> My August 5 Wall Street Journal article Weak Dollar, Weak Economy explained the harm from last year’s Fed splurge into QE2 -- the more bonds the Fed bought, the weaker the dollar and the weaker the economy. In its latest move, the Fed is locking in negative real interest rates even longer, souring the investment climate. Fortunately, growth may start up any way, and that’s what financial markets will be watching. 
 Every year, Americans for Tax Reform Foundation calculates how many days the average American must work to earn enough income to pay off the regulatory and spending burdens at the local, state and federal levels of government. The findings, released in the Cost of Government Day report, have become more disheartening with each passing year of the Obama Administration. In 2011, Americans must work until August 12 to pay off the full costs of government. While most taxpayers may consider their government debt paid when they file taxes each April, the true costs of government extract a far greater toll from the working public. <br> Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill, hallmarks of the administration’s first few years, will have explosive costs, the impacts of which cannot even be quantified in the bills’ initial stages. This is because in both of the bills Congress punted most of the details to be sorted out by bureaucrats; Obamacare requires over 40 different rulemakings before it will be fully fleshed out while Dodd-Frank needs 500 different clarifications before it can be implemented in its entirety. This, combined with the economic uncertainty spurred by such ambiguous lawmaking, augurs little hope for the economic “recovery” the Administration assures us is forthcoming. <br> One estimate shows that a five percent reduction in regulator budgets would increase GDP by $376 billion and expand employment by 6.2 million jobs over five years. Conversely, for the 2011 $2.95 billon regulator budget increase, the economy loses 6.2 million jobs over five years. This suggests the regulatory burden plays a much larger role in economic productivity than is normally assumed, especially when a quick look-back shows that regulators’ budgets have grown by 72.5 percent over the past decade. <br> Nonetheless, the President’s budget relies on extremely unrealistic expectations for growth. His spending blueprint, which permanently increases spending to two percent higher than the historical average, is premised on a rate of growth averaging 4.71 percent over the next decade. Assuming more realistic growth constrained by historical averages (which is still far below recent levels), spending would actually rise to nearly 28 percent of GDP. <br> Economic growth will continue to stagnate as long as the looming regulatory threats remain, both in the form of coming rulemakings for incomplete legislation and aggressive executive overreach that has become commonplace in the Obama Administration. The economic growth foregone will only be one bite of this sour apple; businesses will not expand while the uncertain regulatory threat exists. Employers will not hire, consumers will be paralyzed and the stalled economic recovery will become the new normal. With the growing regulatory regime, later Cost of Government Days will be unavoidable absent serious and long-lasting reform. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s got to go, and he's got to go quickly. <br> That being said, there is a clear move President Obama can and should make immediately to begin to resolve his political and financial problems. <br> That commission produced over $4 trillion in cuts over 10 years, won support across the board from 11 of the 18 members and called for making nothing sacrosanct in the budget. Discretionary expenditures, non-discretionary expenditures, entitlements were all on the table. The commission sought to lower rates through tax reform and removed loopholes as a means of raising revenue.What Obama needs to do is to fire Geithner immediately, make Bowles a sort of “super secretary” of the treasury, and outsource economic policy too. <br> It is only by doing this that President Obama has any chance of getting economic policy back on target. Pursuing the same approaches, the same talking points and the same vague generalities he did in his speech on Monday is a recipe for failure, politically and economically. 
 Yesterday, President Obama went before the country, trying to calm financial markets upset by SP’s downgrade of our debt. Traders watched, listened, and then doubled up on their sell orders. The markets suffered one of the worst drops in history – and delivered a stinging rebuke to the president. <br> Here’s what President Obama <b>should</i> have done: <br> Next, he should assemble said political leaders for a joint press event, in which he and they present a cohesive, if not united, front to the country. They should announce that Congress will return from its August recess, so that important work will go forward.Select four items that have broad bipartisan appeal and announce they will be enacted forthwith. These might include: <br> Not everyone will agree with these choices, but most Americans would be cheered to see their political leaders hunkering down and addressing our problems. <br> The trade pacts are a good example. Everyone wants them completed, but they continue to languish. <br> President Obama next needs to present hisbudget plan to the country. Though it is doubtless appealing to avoid the hard work of actually proposing changes to Medicare or Social Security, the White House has acknowledged the need to do so on many occasions. Republicans, led by Paul Ryan, have led the way here, and been pummeled for their efforts. <br> It is now time for President Obama to endorse or repudiate the ideas of his fiscal deficit commission. He needs to commit, and soon. This might actually<b> help</i> his campaign ambitions. Critics have often seized on his “no-show” votes in the Illinois State Senate, and his lack of publishing as a law professor as evidence that Mr. Obama, for all his eloquence, is an empty suit. His refusal to wade into the budget mess furthers that narrative. Time to stand tall, Mr. President – give us your ideas. <br> Sadly, promoting growth is way down the to-do list of this administration. Instead, Obama’s agencies teem with eager reformers whose resumes will only be burnished by enlarging the tangled cobweb of regulation. Our recovery from the financial crisis has been significantly hindered by anti-business rules and rhetoric that have dampened the animal spirits of our entrepreneurs and managers. Time to shift gears. <br> The president has embraced a culture of envy, which undermines our celebration of achievement. Mr. Obama, of all people, should value the open doors that are the very heart of what makes our country great. 
 First, do no harm. That is a useful injunction for doctors, lawyers, and, it turns out, U.S. presidents. <br> The speech did at least temporary harm. As soon as he finished speaking, the already jittery financial markets plunged. <br> They didn’t want him to repeat his basic talking points: the need to marshal the “political will” to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance benefits, or create an infrastructure bank. <br> Americans wanted to hear what President Obama was planning to do to create jobs and stop our economy from slipping over an economic abyss into a double-dip recession. <br> One must sympathize with the president. Last week was his worst week ever in the job. <br> Then he became the first president to have a downgrading of America’s credit worthiness on his watch – an action taken by Standard Poor’s, a company that made a two trillion dollar mistake in its own budget calculations and which gave the highest credit rating to Lehman Brothers on the verge of bankruptcy and to the mortgage-backed securities that helped cause the 2008 financial crisis. How do you spell “chutzpah” on Wall Street? <br> Then markets plunged. <br> Now, the left of his party, too, is in full rebellion. On Sunday, Drew Westen, a professor of psychology at Emory, articulated the fury of liberal Democrats in a New York Times Sunday Review essay. <br> How can one explain this lack of leadership? Westen offered several harsh theories. Perhaps Obama is, as conservatives have alleged, too inexperienced and hence, incompetent. Obama, he wrote, “had accomplished very little before he ran for president, having never run a business or a state.” He had a “singularly unremarkable career as a law professor, publishing nothing in 12 years at the University of Chicago other than an autobiography.” Finally, before joining the Senate, he had voted present rather than yea or nay 130 times, “sometimes dodging difficult issues.” <br> Ouch. No wonder Mr. Obama looked so very shaken during a speech that was intended to boost the nation’s confidence. 
 How can community activist President Obama continually underestimate the Tea Party? Mr. Obama celebrated his ability to clean up asbestos from public housing as a young organizer; why is he blind to the growing power of Tea Party activists who are trying to clean up our country’s balance sheet? <br> One thing is clear: the Tea Party won the debt ceiling skirmish and changed the nation’s discourse. The movement shifted the country’s focus to cutting spending and restoring our country’s fiscal health – a stunning volte face for our indulgent body politic. You have to wonder, when will Mr. Obama take the Tea Party seriously? <br> Fast forward to those midterm elections, when the GOP picked up 6 senate seats, 63 House seats and 5 governorships. It was, by any definition, a landslide – and a massive repudiation of President Obama’s first *two* years in office. It was also heavily influenced by the Tea Party. <br> In all of 2009, as the Tea Party spawned thousands of gatherings across the country protesting ballooning government outlays and ObamaCare, network TV ran just 19 stories or segments about the new group, according to a study by the Media Research Center. Imagine. A new political movement gains stride, and steals a Massachusetts senate seat, and is virtually ignored by network TV. <br> President Obama adopted this narrative, perhaps blinding himself to the political threat the movement contained. In April 2009, asked about the thousands of protests taking place on tax day around the nation, White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said “I don’t know if the president is aware of the events.” Soon thereafter, White House advisor David Axelrod explained the demonstrations saying “I think any time you have severe economic conditions there is always an element of disaffection that can mutate into something that’s unhealthy.” <br> It was finally (and surprisingly) the New York Times that ventured forth to record who was actually turning up at Tea Party rallies. They were shocked (and no doubt dismayed) to find the protesters “wealthier and more educated” than the general public, laying to rest the myth that the movement was spawned by skinheads and wing-nuts. <br> The 2008 presidential campaign showcased the power of the multitude and upended many assumptions about the importance of traditional party outlets. The 2012 campaign may be equally stunning; this time, however, the Tea Party may be in the driver’s seat. The GOP should hope that President Obama remains oblivious to their challenge. 
 Now that the national debt ceiling deal is done – and liberals like me are unhappy and conservatives deservedly have more to cheer about – Thanksgiving 2011 will be more than about good turkeys. This is the deadline for the so-called “super” congressional committee of six Democrats and six Republicans from the House and Senate to cut at least $1.2 trillion in the projected budget deficit for the next 10 years. <br> But if you are an anti-tax conservative who sincerely believes that you have to cut spending and not “feed the beast” with more revenues, then one approach on spending cuts for the super committee to consider is the simple and creative “Penny Plan” introduced by Rep. Connie Mack (R.-Fla.). <br> There is an automatic spending cut “trigger” under Mr. Mack’s plan – one he came up with well before the trigger used in the recently passed national debt ceiling bill. If congress failed to enact a budget implementing the one-percent-actual-spending cut required under Mr. Mack’s measure, then there would be automatic, across-the-board actual cuts in all federal programs to meet the one percent reduction, and that means all: in defense, Social Security, Medicare, Food Stamps, defense and national security spending, everything. <br> We had $1 trillion in surplus – money in the bank – when Bill Clinton left office on January 20, 2001, just eight years after he began his presidency inheriting a $300 billion deficit. Now we are heading towards a $15 trillion debt. How did this happen? <br> I am a liberal Democrat who believes that the national debt and annual deficits are the country’s greatest moral issues. We cannot continue to use credit cards to pay for wars, corporate jet write-offs, and Social Security and Medicare – and leave it to our children, grand-children, and probably great grand-children to pay our bills. <br> But since the “balanced” solution of both increased revenues and spending cuts entitlement reform is supported in virtually ever poll by substantial majorities of all voters, including large numbers of Republicans, Democrats need to find a spending cut formula that they can live with. The Mack Penny Plan seems a good place to start -- it is simple, it makes common sense, and with some adjustments protecting the poor and the unemployed, it could be seen as fair even to many of the most liberal Democrats. <br> In this time of crisis – and I believe our national debt is a genuine and historic crisis – we need members like Mr. Mack who know how to reach across the aisle, as I have seen him do many times, to find common solutions. The Mack Penny Plan deserves serious consideration – as serious as the man who proposed it. <br> He is the principal in the Washington, D.C. law firm of Lanny J. Davis Associates, which specializes in strategic crisis management. He served as President Clinton’s Special Counsel in 1996-98 and as a member of President Bush’s Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board in 2006-07.

 That was fast. Mounting his shrinking soapbox soon after the Senate passed the debt-ceiling bill, President Obama took less than a minute to lapse into his class-warfare shtick. <br> The nation avoided the dreaded default and did it with lopsided support in both houses. A majority of both parties in the Senate backed the deal, while in the House, Republicans backed it by more than 2-1 while Dems split evenly for and against. <br> Yet the result doesn't suit our president, who has an itch for punishing wealth and more spending. To scratch it, he turns reflexively to scapegoating. The man who promised to unite the nation instead relishes dividing it at every opportunity. <br> I don't know which is worse: That he really believes such drivel will help America, or that he's cynically throwing red meat to the Bubbas of his far-left base. Either way, he needs new material. <br> For such a smart guy, he's proving to be a slow learner about what works, and doesn't. He, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid had their unfettered way for two years, and they blew a giant hole in the budget without getting much bang for taxpayers' bucks.Unemployment is a staggering 9.2 percent and rising, and most economists believe the economy is in serious danger of a double-dip recession. Obama's answer: Let's do it all again. <br> Maybe he hasn't noticed or doesn't care, but the country is giving up on him. The shellacking his party and policies took in the 2010 midterms would be repeated if there were an election today. He's sinking, and his approval is now a woeful 40 percent -- that's Jimmy Carter territory. <br> In fact, Obama's intransigent stance against entitlement changes and pro-growth tax reform actually argues for a downgrade. His position makes further progress on reducing the debt less likely, and thus calls into question America's ability to meet its increasing obligations. 
 Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has it right. The so-called Gang of Six proposal to increase the debt ceiling is not ready for prime time.
 In a little-noted comment during his press conference this month, President Obama said “one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficit reduction is to grow the economy.” <br> Unfortunately, several of the debt reduction proposals the president has offered involve tax hikes on corporations that would only hamper growth, handicap our ability to compete globally, lower tax revenues, and exacerbate the problem we’re desperately trying to solve. <br> Raising taxes on corporations during good economic times is a risky proposition, but it’s certainly ill advised at a time when the economy is struggling find its footing after a prolonged and deep recession. Higher taxes simply reduce investments and employment. It’s a simple as that. <br> Likewise, targeting the oil and gas industry for tax hikes—under the guise of eliminating “subsidies”—would do more harm than good. Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS CERA and points out: “Taxation systems don’t exist in a vacuum in an increasingly competitive world. The unintended consequences of proposed changes would likely accelerate the shrinking position of U.S. companies internationally.” <br> Like it or not, U.S. companies have choices. And if the business tax climate is too unfavorable in America, many will simply move operations elsewhere. Already, companies like Google have moved certain parts of their operation to countries such as Ireland, which boast taxes that are a mere fraction of the United States’ rate. <br> That’s just a fact of life, one we’ve seen here at home, where companies are busy moving out of high-cost states like California—a state that CEO magazine recently listed as<a href="http://chiefexecutive.net/best-worst-states-for-business" target="_blank">the worst state in which to do business—to more business-friendly ones. <br> And while raising taxes on companies—particularly oil and gas firms—might appeal on an emotional level, they only exacerbate a more fundamental problem with the way we tax businesses in the United States. <br> At the same time, we have a massively complex tax system—riddled with special interest tax loopholes—that lets companies pay less than the advertised rate, but at a cost of $40 billion a year to comply, and many billions more in economic distortions. <br> Mr. Obama himself has recognized the need for tax reform, calling on Congress in his last State of the Union address to “Get rid of the loopholes.Level the playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate.” <br> In the end, if President Obama really wants to “grow the economy,” he and the rest of Washington need to focus on policies that will boost investment and growth in domestic firms. And the best way to do that is to cut corporate taxes, not raise them. 
 It is hard not to be excited by the news of the Gang of Six's resurrection. Their $3.7 trillion plan to reduce the budget deficit over 10 years coupled with lowering tax rates, eliminating loopholes, and ultimately raising $1 trillion in new revenue meets the broad outlines of the Bowles-Simpson Plan that was unveiled last December, and addresses most, if not all, the central concerns of centrist Democrats like myself. <br> Still there are concerns. <br> At the same time, with poll after poll showing the Republicans being too intransigent and voters supporting tax increases that must be a necessary part of the mix to balance the budget, it is hard for me and I suspect other centrists not to endorse the broad outlines of the deal that appears to have won at least tentative support from at least half the Senate. <br> Specifically, we need to know what spending cuts have been embraced by the Gang of Six; how the $500 billion in health care cuts will be achieved; what discretionary domestic programs will be cut; as well as what defense initiatives will be paired back; and specifically where and how revenue will be raised. <br> To that end I would be concerned if programs like Medicare part D were eliminated or cut back, and I worry that health care decisions might be turned over to an unelected board (IPAB) as was initially proposed and ratified by Bowles-Simpson. <br> The fact that we are now seeing broad based bipartisanship and a willingness to embrace both significant expenditure cuts, tax reform and entitlement reform suggests that there is still the possibility of achieving something big and important as part of the ongoing debate over raising the debt ceiling. <br> Douglas E.

 President Obama is suddenly a fan of press conferences. Last week, after months of not appearing solo before the media, he faced reporters twice, most recently this past Friday. <br> Why this sudden urge to converse? Simply said, it’s working for him. <br> There was nothing new to report on Friday, no real news. But his prior jamborees with the press had done something miraculous for Mr. Obama – they had convinced the public that he was doing his job. Not only had he engaged in the debt ceiling talks, but he was taking the <i>middle road</b>. <br> Indeed, there hasn’t been a budget proposal to emerge from the Democratic side of the aisle in months. Never mind. The message was clear: but for a few loons in the House, we would not be facing a meltdown of monstrous proportions. <br> The tit-for-tat between our nation’s leaders is riveting. Mr. Obama erred when he said the public was not interested in reality-TV antics; if Eric Cantor would only take a swing at Tim Geithner the president could put his campaign on hold – he’d be reelected in a landslide. That billion dollars he’s so hopeful of raising could instead go to deflating our deficit. <br> The president, too, should ditch the rhetoric, and get the job done. If he is so very concerned about the ill effects from not raising the debt ceiling -- if this stalemate is driving us towards true financial catastrophe – why not agree to raise the debt ceiling now, in company with spending cuts that even this spendthrift White House knows are necessary? <br> Tax reform has become, of course, code for increased revenues. In April, the president said “It’s important that we look at our tax code and find a way to work together to not only simplify and make the tax system fairer, but also that we use it as a tool to help us achieve our deficit targets.” We’re talking <i>decreased tax expenditures</b>, one of the more God-awful expressions to come out of this White House, along with “kinetic military action.” <br> This was one of the excellent recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission. They advised phasing out, for instance, the mortgage interest deduction. Though an abrupt revision of this long-standing tax arrangement could further shake the shattered real estate industry, a phased-in reduction is worth considering. <br> The financial crisis built on a mountain of ill-advised investment in property; this bubble was encouraged by the tax code (as well as excessively low interest rates, wrong-headed public policy, and careless bankers and investors.) Americans understand the attraction of owning a home; the government does not need to encourage such investment. <br> Liz Peek is a FoxNews.com contributor and financial columnist who writes for The Fiscal Times.

 So the fondest Washington hopes for a grand debt-limit deal have broken down over taxes. House Speaker John Boehner said late Saturday that he couldn't move ahead with a $4 trillion deal because President Obama was insisting on a $1 trillion tax increase, and the White House quickly denounced House Republicans for scuttling debt reduction and preventing the very wealthiest and special interests from paying their fair share. <br> We think Mr. Boehner is making the sensible choice. No one wants to reform the tax code more than we do, but passing a $1 trillion tax increase first on the promise of tax reform later is a political trap. If the president were really sincere about reform and a willingness to keep the top tax rate at or below 35%, he'd negotiate that at the same time he does a debt deal. Mr. Boehner will have a hard enough time getting any debt-limit increase through the House, much less one that raises tax rates. 
 There are huge political benefits for President Obama and Republicans in the Senate and Congress from a large scale deal that would cut some $4 trillion from the federal deficit and offer a tax reform package as well that would reduce rates and eliminate many loopholes particularly for upper income tax payers. It is less clear that this would benefit Democrats in Congress, but arguably there could well be benefits to the Party as well. <br> If Democrats are able to agree to $4 trillion in cuts, with cuts to entitlements, defense, and discretionary spending, that would go a long way to winning back independent votes whose support has been literally trending away from the Party since the 2008 election. It would also address many of the concerns that have been expressed that the president is too far to the left and is not willing to embrace fiscal discipline as part of his overall economic agenda. <br> Republicans will undeniably gain a benefit as well, because such a deal would present them with a substantial victory on their top goal of cutting spending and reducing the deficit. <br> Bottom line, there is a lot for the American people in a deal. There's also a huge amount for the president and there's even a clear path to victory. Republicans could potentially even winning the Senate while holding the majority in the House. All this is possible if both sides are able to get past impediments in their own party to achieve this goal. 
 The same Republicans who vote for tax cuts for the rich have tried to choke off long-term unemployment benefits. <br> After the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans led by newly minted Speaker John Boehner (R- Ohio) made it clear that their No. 1 legislative priority was to extend those tax cuts. The GOP said ending the tax cuts posed a danger to the economic recovery. President Obama, still reeling from the “shellacking ” his party took in the election, agreed to the GOP’s demand and signed an extension of the very tax cuts he had long opposed. <br> If raising the tax rate on the richest Americans is the work of a socialist, what are we to make of the Republican icon, former President Ronald Reagan? At the end of Reagan’s first term, the rate was at 50 percent. Under Richard Nixon’s administration, it was at 70 percent. And under Dwight Eisenhower, it was a staggering 91 percent. <br> Obama’s push for tax hikes as part of his deficit-cutting efforts is modest when compared to Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan — and comes at a time of crisis over the debt and with the nation engaged in two costly long-term wars. But somehow Boehner feels it is politically smart to announce that any deficit reduction plan that includes tax increases is “unacceptable and a non-starter.” <br> Somehow, no Republicans felt compelled to rally around Coburn and denounce Norquist. <br> The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, chaired by former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), reached essentially the same conclusion last year. <br> Almost one out of every 10 Americans are out of work. Yet the same Republicans who vote for tax cuts for the rich have tried to choke off long-term unemployment benefits and deny aid to tornado victims. <br> Now House Republicans are resurrecting President Bush’s failed scheme to privatize Social Security. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, introduced the “Savings Account For Every American Act,” which would allow people to immediately opt out of Social Security in favor of a private “S.A.F.E.” account. <br> What has happened to the once Grand Old Party? 
 It comes as no surprise that President Obama received a sizeable bump in public opinion after the announcement of the death of Usama bin Laden on May 1. A New York Times/CBS News poll shows an 11-point jump in approval to 57 percent (up from 46 percent last month). And the Washington Post/Pew Research Center found similar gains, with 56 percent approving of President Obama, up from 47 percent. <br> A poll by the Economist magazine conducted April 9-12 found that 91 percent of adults consider the budget deficit a somewhat or very important issue. Still, the same poll revealed that Americans remain reluctant to make the serious cuts in government programs that are necessary to restore the nation’s fiscal solvency – only 27 percent would support a decrease in spending. And when respondents were asked if they would be willing to accept cuts to spending that “benefits people like you,” only 20 percent of Americans said “definitely” yes. <br> A more honest explanation, however, is that Americans’ confusion about the budget and the economy is a function of a decades-long leadership deficit. Politicians and others in the “opinion class” have been playing make-believe about the nation’s financial situation for years. It is unrealistic to expect that taxpayers will fully accept and understand the nature of the significant changes that must be made to get the deficit and debt under control when lawmakers in Washington are not being forthcoming about what has to be done. <br> On one hand, Team Obama admits there's a problem and concedes that spending needs to be restrained, but their solution is simply higher taxes and more spending. And by calling for taxes on “the rich,” the president is not only reneging on the agreement he made in December to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, he is also misleading the American people into thinking that repeal would be enough to eliminate the deficit. <br> Education will eventually mean that more Americans will support spending cuts; still, it does not mean the confusion will be easy to dispel. After all, Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) was speaking out about earmarks for 20 years before the public groundswell against them was strong enough to spark action by Congress. <br> Rep. Ryan is not alone. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has turned a spotlight on the dishonesty of the budget debate; many of the supposedly “radical” cuts in the last budget deal were, as he wrote in The American Spectator earlier this month, “actually a rescission of spending authority for projects and programs that the government wasn’t going to need anyway.” In other words, they weren’t cuts at all. <br> On April 19,The Washington Post editorial board pointedly criticized the president and Democrats who are fighting for a “clean” debt ceiling bill free from any spending cuts, explaining that the vote, “offers an opportunity to accomplish some real deficit reduction.” <br> While Americans are applauding the president for his action in Pakistan last week, their support does not easily translate into other policy areas. Unless the president can show clear, consistent leadership on the economy, his bump in approval ratings will be just another flash in the pan. 
 If the 2012 election is about too much spending in Washington D.C., President Obama is in real trouble.<br />Obama, Reid and Pelosi began their reign in 2009 when they launched a spending spree that included stimulus spending, bank bailouts, union bailouts, a trillion dollar hike in domestic discretionary spending and then trillions more coming in the form of health care spending and corporate bailouts galore.<br />Obama's 2012 budget continues and increases this spending. (His first two years have been one long Seinfeld episode--no learning has taken place.) The president's budget raises taxes by $1.5 trillion in higher income taxes over the next decade.<br />Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan's budget, now passed by the Republican Congress drops Obama's spending by $6 trillion dollars. He stops the government take over of health care. He ends the bailouts. The Democrats' tax hike plans are stopped.<br />If nothing changes, this stark difference between Democrats and Republicans will lead to a repeat of the 2010 crushing defeat for Democrats.<br />That is why Obama set up a deficit commission, sometimes called the Simpson/Bowles Commission to focus, not on the country's spending problem, but rather on the resulting deficits. Too much spending can only be remedied by spending less. <br> When he was warned about the massive tax increases in the Obama Commission report, he and two other Republican Senators in the Gang of Six, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Saxby Chambliss of Geogia, wrote a public letter promising that the only increases in tax revenue they would support would flow from higher economic growth--not tax hikes. <br> If and when there is a legislative proposal to be presented to Congress and the American people, we look forward to again working with you and all interested parties to support a proposal where any increase in revenue generation will be the result of the pro-growth effects of lower individual and corporate taxrates for all Americans. 
 Every year around this time Americans come face to face with our complex tax code. Taxpayers struggle to comply with tax laws so complicated that even the IRS cannot figure them out. IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman recently stated that “I find the tax code complex so I use a preparer.” A whopping 89 percent of Americans also use a tax preparer. The Internal Revenue Code is 3.8 million words. That’s over 11,000 single-spaced typed pages. It is nearly universally agreed upon that we must make our tax code more simple and fair. <br> Let’s scrap the entire tax system and replace it with one that is simple, low and fairer. The best and most practical solution is to implement a flat tax. Unlike the other tax reform proposals, this can easily be done without repealing any constitutional amendments. While other tax reform options have merit, it will prove to be an arduous process to amend the Constitution. To repeal the 16th amendment—which established the federal income tax—we will need the support of 290 house members, 67 senators, the majority of legislatures of three-fourth of the states and the president. Introducing a reform such as the FairTax, which is a broad-based consumption tax on retail goods and services, without first repealing the 16th amendment is risky business. We could end up with both a national sales tax and a federal income tax. <br> With a Republican controlled House of Representatives, the flat tax is gaining momentum again. Rep. Burgess (R-Texas) has introduced the Freedom Flat Tax Act to implement an optional flat-rate tax system. It would phase in the flat-tax over a three-year period, with a 19-percent rate for the first two years and a 17-percent rate for the subsequent years. Unlike many other flat tax proposals, the Freedom Flat Tax Act that would allow individuals and businesses to choose if and when they opt into the system. These Americans would be able to file their taxes in just a few short minutes. A flat tax is a simple tax system that treats every American the same. It’s a huge improvement from the current tax code. <br> Russia is one of the prime examples of the success of the flat tax. In 2001, Russia replaced its progressive tax code with a single flat rate of 13 percent for all. The results have been outstanding. When people find their taxes to be low and sensible, they are willing to produce and invest more. In just the first year of implementation, Russia’s GDP grew a dramatic 5 percent. Between 2001 and 2004, The Hoover Institute found that tax revenue actually rose by 79.7 percent. Of course the flat tax is not a cure-all. Many of Russia’s problems can be blamed on other factors such as lack of property rights and excessive government intervention in the economy. 
 Sixty days ago President Obama submitted a fiscal year 2012 budget to Congress. <br> Obama’s FY 2012 budget called for $2 trillion in higher spending by the end of this decade. It increased taxes by about $1 trillion dollars. There were no real reforms in entitlements or rollbacks of the one trillion dollar increase over the decade in increased domestic discretionary spending enacted in 2009. Its goal was to lock in the vast spending increase of 2009 and 2010 that brought federal spending up from the traditional 20% of GDP to 25% of GDP. He hoped to be a moderate because after the spending binge he would stabilize the spending at his “new normal. “ <br> But if he means to enact his original budget and mesh it with the Simpson-Bowles Commission proposals, it results in the following: <br> -- Net taxes will be raised by $1 - $3 trillion over the next decade. (According to Simpson-Bowles itself, their proposal is a net tax hike of $1 trillion. Paul Ryan believed the actual tax hike was closer to $2 trillion. The Heritage Foundation said $3 trillion.) <br> -- The rate at which two-thirds of small business profits face taxation will rise from 35% to 39.6%. You can’t raise the tax rate on households making more than $250,000 per year without also raising the tax rate at which most small business profits face taxation. <br> -- The death tax rate will rise from 35% to 45%, and the exemption will be cut from $10 million to $3.5 million. This is the result of Obama’s budget, and would certainly be needed to raise taxes by as much as he would like to. <br> What else did we learn from the speech? <br> Second, the President’s advisors are scared of the Paul Ryan budget proposal that will be voted through the House of Representatives this Friday. Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has actually gone to the work of writing down a budget. The President’s speech today was an endorsement of sorts of a series of essays written by retired politicians Simpson and Bowles. The White House had told itself for months that the Republicans would come up with a budget that would be a political liability for all Republicans in 2012. The Democrats hoped that Ryan would rush to balance the budget by cutting and slashing programs. Instead Ryan put forward a well thought out series of reforms that slash nothing in the short run, but instead reform spending programs to slow growth and reduce overall spending over time. <br> If Obama hoped to attack Republicans for reforming Medicare, they are on thin ice. Obama’s own health care legislation slashed $500 billion from Medicare. Ryan’s reforms will not affect anyone over the age of 55. Those near or at retirement will see no change….except the threat of Obama’s budget slash without reforms. How can the Democrats scare older voters when there is no real “threat”? <br> Tax increases then become “spending cuts”. <br> So now when you read an Obama speech you never know if he intends to raise your taxes or actually cut the federal budget when he promises to “reduce spending.” But you have a pretty good idea he intends to eliminate a tax credit or deduction—the largest four being 1.charitable deductions, 2. the deductibility of your home mortgage interest, 3. the deductibility of state and local taxes you pay and 4. the deductibility of your employer-provided health insurance. 
 Even though Congress and the president have yet to agree on a level of spending for fiscal 2011, the debate in Washington is starting to shift to other fiscal issues. Today's release of the House Budget Committee chairman's fiscal 2012 budget proposal is likely to spur much more substantive discussion and debate over what needs to be done to put our nation's finances in order. The upcoming debt ceiling debate also represents a chance to do something concrete in connection with the structural deficits that represent the true threat to our collective future. <br> Ryan's budget proposes 10-year spending cuts far in excess of the president’s proposal and deficit reductions that exceed those recommended by the National Fiscal Responsibility and Reform Commission. He does so by cutting spending much more aggressively and without raising taxes. <br> Finally, Ryan proposes a number of other major reforms while providing varying levels of specificity regarding how his proposed cost savings and economic gains would be achieved. These include areas like Social Security reform, tax reform, federal employment and compensation reforms, and government consolidation and restructuring reforms. <br> However, contrary to Ryan's proposal, additional defense cuts that do not compromise national security and comprehensive tax reform that raises more revenue also need to be on the table in order to help ensure bipartisan support for any comprehensive fiscal reform proposal. <br> I look forward to seeing Chairman Conrad's (D-N.D.) Fiscal 2012 budget proposal and the results of the Senate's Group of Six (G6) efforts, of which he is a member. The G6 is taking a comprehensive and bipartisan approach to addressing our fiscal challenges that could help facilitate bipartisan action. <br> The best opportunity to make progress this year may be the upcoming debt ceiling debate. The Democrats Plan A strategy is to raise the debt ceiling unconditionally. The Republicans Plan A strategy is to raise it conditioned on passing a Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment. Neither of these approaches have the votes needed for passage. Our country needs a Plan B and, for the sake of our founders and our families, I'm working to help make sure that we have one. After all, doing nothing is simply not a viable option. 
 When Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi launched their massive spending spree in January 2009, many Americans wondered: what are they doing? It appeared to make no sense. <br> Then they unleashed plans to spend one trillion taxing real energy and subsidizing imaginary energy. Another one, two, or three trillion on a government takeover of health care. <br> This was no a mistake. It was the plan. <br> The end game for Democrats was -- and is -- the imposition of a Value Added Tax (VAT)-- a European style national sales tax that increases the price of all goods and services by a few percent to start with. The VAT is an easy tax to raise. Citizens see prices rise and blame businesses for the costs imposed by government. Clever. European rates have risen to 20 and 25 percent. <br> But this is America and the electorate revolted in November 2010, interrupting the plan. <br> In November 2012 there are 23 Senate Democrats up for re-election -- ten of whom are vulnerable -- and ten Republicans are up for re-election -- two of which might be vulnerable. <br> Compromises occur when two competing parties are trying to do the same thing but disagree on timing or pace. <br> Someone wins and someone loses. That is why so much of the fight in Washington is posturing and angling to get the public relations advantage. <br> A return to a Democrat House, Senate and president leads back to the tax-and-spend and regulate policies of the previous two years. 
 Here we go again. Just look at this headline on the front page of paper edition of The Washington Post this morning: “Prescribing bitter debt medicine, senators take case to the public.” And here comes the kicker of a sub-head: “‘Everything is on the table’ as bipartisan Gang of Six looks beyond spending cuts.” <br> But speaking of conservatives, or at least Republicans, who are these Senators working on this possible deal? Three of the Gang of Six are Republican Senators Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, and Mike Crapo of Idaho. As Chambliss told The Post, “Everything is on the table. For a Republican to put revenues on the table is significant.” <br> Remember what happened to President George H.W. Bush after he broke his “read my lips” pledge? After raising taxes in 1990, Bush was defeated for re-election in 1992, receiving the lowest percentage of popular vote for an incumbent president since 1912. <br> Yet as Ryan Ellis of ATR observed this morning, “Chambliss doesn't consider getting rid of tax deductions and credits to be tax hikes.” Ellis points to the exact language of the pledge that Chambliss signed, which includes these words: “oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.” That is, any loophole-closing must be matched by an equal amount of tax-rate cutting. <br> Chambliss seems to be saying he wants to not plow all the savings into lower rates. If so, that's inconsistent with his Pledge. The mortgage interest deduction (to take but a large example) is not spending like HUD is spending. The former lets people keep their own money. The latter requires money to be taken in taxes, filtered through government unions in Washington, and then sent out the door as welfare. To equate the two is fundamentally dishonest. The government does not have a right to all your money, as Chambliss' tax theory seems to imply. <br> The bipartisan senatorial sextet took their roadshow to Richmond on Monday night, delivering a slide presentation to a town hall in Warner’s home state. Perhaps--just guessing here--it’s on Warner’s mind that as a Democratic Senator in a Republican state, his re-election chances will be helped if three Republican Senators come to the Old Dominion and publicly praise him. <br> Of course, the mainstream media won’t report on any of that. What the MSM will say is more like, “Brave U.S. Senators, rising above party labels, are working together to solve an urgent problem.” <br> Then, as the negotiations stall, the MSM--joined, of course, by the Beltway Establishment--will pile on Republicans for being “intransigent.” <br> Eventually, the smoke clears, and the deal is done. The Republicans get praised on “Face the Nation,” while taxes AND spending go up. We might recall, of course, that in 1990, in the wake of the Bush 41 tax-increasing “budget deal,” the deficit went up, too. 
 At Sunday night’s Oscars, True Grit shot blanks in all 10 of its nomination categories. Although Hollywood understandably shunned this morally-certain tale of a willful young woman demanding justice, we can still hope House Republicans will take some cues from the film before its DVD slots at Wal-Mart need re-stocking. <br> It’s an apt metaphor for the Tea Party movement and House Speaker John Boehner’s Republicans: Outraged by the near-criminal negligence of over-spending pols charging 40 cents per dollar of Washington’s spending to the U.S. credit card – and onto the backs of future generations – Tea Partiers and the U.S. electorate “hired” a House GOP majority last November to hunt down and hang the economy-killing excesses of Presidents Obama, Bush and a bipartisan gang of thieves on Capitol Hill.<br />Early in True Grit, it’s uncertain whether drunken, one-eyed Rooster Cogburn (played perfectly by Jeff Bridges in the 2010 version and by John Wayne, 1969’s Best Actor, a generation ago) actually does have the grit to get the job done. Similarly, House GOP leaders have been approaching the monumental issue of the debt ceiling as if one-eyed drunks, dozing through the greatest opportunity to cut Washington down to size and do right by the American people since the west was won.<br />Nearly all of the 87 freshmen who made Boehner Speaker campaigned against raising the limit on the USA’s public debt, capped for now at a staggering $14.3 trillion. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner calculates that our national credit card will max-out near June. Yet Boehner has already muffed his lines, blurting intent to boost the borrowing limit on Obama’s Mastercard.<br />The Speaker and his budget chief Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could take a lesson in negotiations from Mattie Ross. Certain of herself and of right and wrong, Mattie shows canny (and literal) horse-trading instincts at the film’s start -- instincts which, so far, seem to elude Boehner. We are eyewitnesses to the troubling fact that Geithner has beguiled some leaders with the patently false notion that House resolve against further borrowing equals default to U.S. bondholders. This, in turn, argues to Boehner that it would be reckless not to raise the ceiling ahead of max-out.<br />Yet, as Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) and Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) contend via clarifying legislation, non-borrowed tax revenues are more than ample to cover debt service – just not enough to pay for every nice, silly or evil thing to which Washington has become accustomed. Reps. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), Ron Paul (R-Texas), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Mike Pence (R-Ind.), plus Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) and Rand Paul (R-Tenn.), are talking tough against higher debt. Buy, like the bear-clad, corpse-toting medicine man who offers dubious aid in the film, Beltway RINO’s and erstwhile conservatives alike are selling the snake oil that higher federal borrowing – GOP surrender on the debt limit – is good political science. It’s not.<br />The House tourniquet tied to Obama’s “checkbook authority” which expires on March 4 – or a couple weeks later by extension – isn’t nearly tight enough to staunch the USA’s bleeding deficit, salved by new debt of about $125 billion per month; concurrence required from bandage-loosening Senate Democrats and Obama ensures the government will keep hemorrhaging red ink. The March theatrics – perhaps involving a government shutdown akin to the 1995-96 duel between President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich (in which tenderfoot Gingrich blinked) – are merely the B-movie warm-up in a double feature; Tea Party America neither fears nor craves a brief, meaningless closure of the Washington Monument due to a gap in the administration’s spending authority.<br />Instead, the epic, blockbuster feature presentation in the nation’s political theater should be all about House GOP shutdown of the president’s credit card – the outlaw means by which official Washington has confessed to robbing unborn generations of Americans: In 2006, an audacious newcomer told his Senate colleagues that “raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure…. Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.” Playing the centrist, of course, he became president in 2008.<br />Can Obama’s House rival perform as well in the role of crisis leader? Can emotive John Boehner – who summons tears with the ease of an Oscar winner – fill the gritty boots of John Wayne and Jeff Bridges in a hard-charging Rooster Cogburn reprise on the Mall? The film climaxes with courageous Cogburn, reins in his teeth and two blazing six-shooters in hand, riding furiously headlong into four well-armed robbers on horseback; brave young Mattie, meanwhile, faces her father’s killer. In the states, meanwhile, confrontational “Cogburn governors” like Scott Walker (R-Wis.) and Chris Christie (R-N.J.) are showing Boehner the way.<br />The House packs heat far more powerful, however, than a couple of Colt pistols – something closer, in fact, to the Death Star of the space western Star Wars: Strategic inaction on the debt ceiling, plus bold messaging with the certitude of a Mattie Ross, represents a GOP WMD (weapon of mass discipline) that can incinerate every obstacle to the bipartisan reforms so desperately needed in our dysfunctional U.S. government. Wielding this awesome weapon without cooperation from the Senate or the president, House Republicans can rescue the American Republic from Washington’s outlaws – and they can do so in about the same time it takes a film like True Grit to get from theater to DVD. Here’s how:<br />Pursuant to a national summit gathering over the weekend in Phoenix, today throngs of Tea Party Patriots, the largest umbrella for local tea party groups nationwide, are imploring all House Members to absolutely, positively refuse to vote for -- nor even seriously discuss -- allowing the U.S. debt to grow beyond the current $14.3 trillion cap prior to enactment of: <br> 2) bipartisan tax reform (revenue-negative or neutral) to make the U.S. tax code flatter, simpler, less intrusive and more conducive to economic growth; and 
 When I was a speechwriter at the Pentagon, and drafted the national security parts of President Reagan’s State of the Union addresses, I used to record the speech. I’d then play it back three times: first, picture only -- no sound; then sound only; and finally picture and sound together. So, for part of last night's speech, I turned off the sound last night and just watched the body language.<br />President Obama looked like he was at a funeral. Here he was promising goodies for all – education, health care, tax reform, energy, troops, but he looked miserable. He had the command and power and majesty of the entire U.S. government sitting before him but he looked like he didn't want to be there. <br> He didn’t crack a smile while he delivered the speech, and he positively scowled when he walked out of the chamber, despite the applause and backslapping he enjoyed from the Democratic members of Congress.<br />On the other hand Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who was tapped to deliver the Republican response, looked energized. <br> And, if you turned off the sound, he looked like someone who relished the challenge. Here delivering his response to the State of the Union he was in a nearly impossible setting -- in an empty chamber staring straight into the camera. 
 Washington is known for political posturing rather than positive progress, with the most recent House repeal of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 serving as another example of Washington's symbolism over substance. <br> Our country is at a critical crossroads. We face a range of key sustainability challenges that threaten our future position in the world and standard of living at home. The largest of these is our nation's fiscal challenge. It is a much greater threat to our future than the Chinese, Al Qaeda or others. The cold but hard truth is that we have met the enemy and it is us. Washington has been fiscally irresponsible and violating its fiduciary duty and stewardship responsibility for far too long. <br> President Obama should use his State of the Union speech to state the facts and speak the truth to the American people about the true financial and fiscal state of our nation. He must help the American people understand the difference between our short-term deficits which are driven largely by temporary factors and the structural ones that represent the true threat to our nation's future. <br> The president must also tell the American people what he plans to do with his Fiscal Responsibility and Reform Commission's recommendations and how they will be reflected in his fiscal 2012 budget and broader legislative agenda. <br> He should propose a path for reforming social insurance programs, cutting defense and other spending, and engaging in comprehensive tax reform that will generate more revenues. In doing so, he must recognize the need for more meaningful citizen education and engagement and set realistic expectations regarding what can and can not be achieved within certain time frames. <br> He should also support re-imposing meaningful statutory budget controls beginning in 2013. These controls must be tougher than the ones that helped us restore fiscal sanity in the 1990s. They should include PAYGO rules that do not include trillions of dollars in loopholes, tough but realistic total discretionary spending caps, and specific annual public debt/GDP targets that would begin in 2013 or 2014. <br> It's time for truth, transparency and tough choices. President Obama will have the bully pulpit during his State of the Union address. He must use it to state the facts, speak the truth, and lay out a vision for how he believes we should proceed. He must call for progress over partisanship and civility over conflict. 
 The Deficit Commission is a dud. We always suspected it, now we know it. Co-chairs Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson attempted a grand compromise on solving the deficit, and got nothing for their efforts--nothing, that is, but scorn. <br> Let’s consider some of the elements of the plan: Raising the retirement age? Tell that to a blue collar worker who has been lifting boxes all his life. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction? Tell that to someone whose house is already “under water.” Eliminating the employer deduction for health insurance? Tell that to an employer who is already on the edge of dropping health coverage for employees. <br> In this world, there are two kinds of fiscal compromises. The first kind is the “artful work” compromise, which acknowledges differences and yet still manages to synthesize them into something useful. A classic example is the 1983 compromise on Social Security, in which Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill hammered out a deal on Social Security--a slight rise in payroll taxes in exchange for a slight reduction in future benefits. As a Republican Congressman who worked on the deal, Barber Conable, said at the time, “This was not a work of art, but it was artful work.” <br> Darman convinced Bush that it would be possible to achieve those “tax revenue increases” by various non-tax-increasing means, such as a rate-cut in the capital gains tax. But for their part, the Democrats, smelling Republican blood, would have none of that. Darman’s proffered compromise was thus a “dead cat.” It went nowhere, as Democrats ignored it and Republicans reviled it, knowing that the Bush administration was headed toward tax-increase city. <br> In five months of haggling over exactly what kind of tax increase to enact, Bush lost the battle for any spending cuts, even as the economy began sinking into recession. In the end, the 41st president signed a big tax increase, and lost not only the trust of the American people, but also his political base; in his 1992 re-election campaign, in a three-way race against Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, he suffered a humiliating defeat. <br> So back to Bowles and Simpson. It’s actually a very strange document that they released. Bowles and Simpson are the co-chairs of an 18-member commission, due to put out its final report on December 1. So why did just the two of them release their own rogue version of a final report three weeks early? Who, really, do they think they are? Simpson, a former senator from Wyoming, last won an election in 1990, and Bowles, a former chief of staff to Bill Clinton, ran twice for the US Senate in North Carolina and lost both times. <br> That’s the way things work these days: The president, by the stroke of a pen, can create a commission, hire staff, even put up a spiffy website. <br> In the future, if we want to reduce the deficit, we will have to change the frame of the debate. We will have to widen the discussion from the deficit to the overall economy. We will have to shift from a bean-counting focus on cuts to a larger consideration of what the federal government does and how it goes about doing it. And we will have to shift, also, into a larger consideration of new and better ideas for our future. <br> Or let’s take another issue: health care. Sure, Medicare is eating up the budget, but the elderly are sick. <br> Meanwhile, the regulators and the litigators have neutralized most of the private capital available for Alzheimer’s research, as well as for drug development in general. If we could cure Alzheimer’s, we could raise the retirement age. And, by the way, create a whole new job-creating industry built around that cure. <br> Unfortunately for all of us, those sorts of creative ideas--economic growth, medical cures, and energy development--are not mentioned in the Bowles-Simpson report. Nor did we get any innovative suggestions, for say, restructuring the federal government’s operating model. 
 Repeal and replace – but also reinvigorate. <br> Last Thursday, Congressional Republicans revealed a new “Pledge to America,” including a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare with commonsense, fiscally sustainable health care reforms that will improve health care and expand access to affordable health insurance. <br> But Republicans should also promote a bipartisan agenda that will strengthen America’s global leadership in the field of biomedical innovation. By creating a better climate for medical innovation today, policymakers will reap huge dividends from more high paying biotech jobs, new cures for life-threatening diseases, and new treatments that will help Americans remain healthier and more productive as they age -- reducing the strain on government programs like Social Security and Medicare. <br> A true innovation agenda would start with tax reform. The U.S. corporate tax rate (the world’s highest, at nearly 40 percent) is a job-killer, encouraging companies to outsource jobs and manufacturing capacity to lower-tax countries. Reducing this rate so that it’s closer to (or even better yet, lower than) the OECD average of 26 percent would be a powerful incentive for more companies to invest in biotechnology jobs and facilities in the United States. <br> Finally, we need to modernize the FDA and overcome the gap between the rapid advances in basic science and the dearth of innovative new drugs actually coming to market. Part of the problem, as the FDA’s own leadership and science board has acknowledged, is that the agency is using 20th century regulatory tools to evaluate 21st century medicines. The result is a cumbersome and expensive process that can take a decade and cost hundreds of millions (or billions) of dollars to generate a single FDA-approved drug. <br> Congress should also follow Europe’s lead and fund a joint venture that can help revolutionize how we test and develop new medicines. Budget costs from increased funding for biomedical innovation can be offset in ways that also improve health – for instance, reducing obesity by slashing the billions in annual agricultural subsidies for corn byproducts that flood our grocery stores with cheap junk food. <br> Paul Howard is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the director of its Center for Medical Progress.

 Conservatives, libertarians and other skeptics of big government across America have every reason to be suspicious that Beltway Republicans have yet to come to Jesus.Unfortunately, the 8,000-word Pledge to America released yesterday does little to allay those concerns. Notwithstanding many appealing passages and a sharp homage to the Constitution, the document’s origin and effect leave much to be desired. <br> But it is a fair question whether the GOP establishment in Washington really understands and shares the anti-government sentiment swelling across America, or whether it sees it as a convenient ticket back to the A-list of Washington life and power. <br> First of all, amid a genuine grassroots political wellspring in America, why did the GOP pen a manifesto from the heart of the Beltway establishment? This feels a lot more like an effort to capture, stroke and manage the Tea Party than an effort to effect real reform in the GOP and position it for the years ahead.&nbsp; <br> The Pledge omits talk of serious entitlement reform.There are reports that the member of the GOP House leadership who is most serious about this issue, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), was essentially kept out of the Pledge’s construction.If we cannot talk about entitlement reform in the current political atmosphere, when can we ever?And if reform ideas aren’t presented to the electorate, how can they ever be enacted? <br> Put plainly, the document looks more like a mediocre attempt at a catch-all written by political consultants in Washington. <br> And that brings us to what the Pledge is not.It is not the Contract With America.The Contract was a concise 10-point program that was guided by Newt Gingrich, but which neatly distilled the key ideas impelling grassroots voters and candidates who were challenging the establishment in 1994. It may not have been necessary to repeat the Contract, and each election is different, but there should be no question as to which is the superior political tool.Furthermore, the Contract led naturally to a legislative program after the election.Republicans fulfilled their promises and were seen fulfilling their promises.The Pledge is too sloppy to facilitate this. <br> For now, all we can say with reasonable certainty is that Washington does not understand.This is true not only of Washington’s broad political class, but also of many of its GOP precincts.Hopefully the coming wave will bring with it men and women who intend to be leaders from the outset, not just foot soldiers.&nbsp; 
 Between now and the November 2 election there are several dangers that stand between conservatives and the overwhelming victory that present polls predict. <br> <b>The second threat is that of distraction by “shiny things.” </i>Many issues pop up and politicians and talk show hosts are intrigued and tempted to spend precious minutes talking about new and exciting issues rather than focus on the spending that threatens our future. <br> Why trade a tried and true issue that Democrats cannot escape for new issues that may or not actually move votes—as opposed to flap tongues? And new issues give Democrats an opportunity to separate themselves from the unpopular Obama, Reid and Pelosi. <br> The mosque in Manhattan presented the same danger. Harry Reid of Nevada has voted lockstep with Obama. But when Newt Gingrich announced that a mosque in Manhattan was a central issue for this election...voila….Harry Reid received a “get out of jail free” card where he could posture as a conservative battling Obama. Never mind that a Senator from Nevada cannot undo the First Amendment or stop anyone from building a church, synagogue, temple or mosque anywhere. <br> When you are losing—you want distractions.<br />When you are winning—you do not want distractions. <br> As soon as the dust begins to settle on the November 2 election the movement must be prepared for two projects. <br> In 1995, the Contract with America was the exoskeleton that held the Republicans together in the House and Senate for two years. <br> This must not happen again. The movement and Republican congressmen should create a contract with America for 2012 and invite would-be presidential contenders to sign on. No more “going with the flow” or whoever becomes the GOP’s nominee. He or she gets to be president. <br> And lastly, the moment the November 2 election is settled, grown up Republicans and conservatives should immediately focus on 2012 and 2014 to plan the path to a 60-vote majority in the Senate. A House majority is a good start. A Senate majority is nice. But only a House majority and 60 plus votes in the Senate ensure control of the agenda in Washington, D.C. 
 In 2001 and 2003, President Bush and the Republican Congress cut taxes for everyone. Like the Reagan tax cuts and the Kennedy tax cuts before them, the Bush tax cuts are historical events that help define today’s tax reality. <br> The current federal income tax system is a heavy burden on work, saving, investment and entrepreneurial risk taking, and therefore it is a positive hindrance to reviving the U.S. economy and creating new jobs. It should be scrapped. <br> Of course, any serious discussion of taxes cannot take place in isolation from a larger debate over public spending; the reason government levies taxes to begin with. How much of the nation’s income should government confiscate for public spending? What programs should be cut and what programs, if any, should be expanded? <br> As a general proposition, history informs us that once marginal tax rates rise above 30 percent, they become demonstrably counterproductive. John Maynard Keynes thought any tax rate over 25 percent was counterproductive. Adding additional layers of taxation on top -- as we do currently with the corporate income tax (soon to have the highest corporate tax rate in the world), taxes on dividends and capital gains makes a bad situation economically intolerable. People work, save and invest less, and they take fewer entrepreneurial risks. <br> When tax rates are lowered, the share of taxes paid by upper-income individuals and businesses rises as they bring their money back into productive activity, which benefits everyone. <br> In the 1960s, after the Kennedy tax rate reductions cut the top marginal tax rate from 91 percent to 70 percent, the share of taxes paid by those earning more than $50,000 rose from 11.6 to 15.1 percent. <br> By contrast, today’s top rate remains 35 percent. It is time to cut tax rates across the board once again. As Jack Kemp used to say, “If you want to ‘soak the rich,’ cut their tax rates.” <br> “It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now … Cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.” <br> Such action to revive economic growth would set the stage for a grand national debate in 2012 where serious long-term reforms could be put on the table, including entitlement reform, which would lower long-term spending and permanently eliminate deficits. <br> Lawrence A.

 Like the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, oil spill victims are about to get kicked by the IRS while they are down. <br> After Katrina, many New Orleans residents found that the shortage of carpenters made rebuilding their homes within arbitrary IRS time deadlines impossible. To wait meant that insurance company payments would count as taxable income and a lot of people chose to rebuild in other cities where carpenters and homebuilders were not in such short supply. It hurt New Orleans and hurt our citizens. <br> The economies of our Gulf Coast states will be hard hit enough because of the ripple effect of lost incomes and damage to fishing, oil production and tourism. The IRS should not compound this damage with tax bills on those who are hardest hit. <br> Both the White House and Congress have the power to help by immediately ordering the IRS to forgo tax bills on emergency relief payments to oil spill victims. Common sense and simple compassion require us to take this step. The question is: can common sense trump the usual rigidity of tax policy and the self-interests of those who think that revenue to the federal government is always more important than the pursuit of happiness—or even survival—by our citizens. <br> Individually, we may not be able to do a lot now about damage that has already been done to our waters and shorelines, but we sure can do something about further damage by the IRS to those who now face a hard road in recovering from that damage. Our Online Tax Revolt marchers will immediately begin a journey to New Orleans and will stay there, digitally, until this tax relief has been achieved. <br> Ken Hoagland is chairman of the FairTax National Victory Campaign and the Online Tax Revolt.

 In his Tuesday address to the nation, President Obama used the Gulf of Mexico tragedy to twist the facts, bend the truth, and attempt to capitalize on a national disaster to push job-killing energy tax legislation. Here are six mistruths presented by the president. <br> However, the president has not taken the first and easiest step to allow other countries to assist in the clean-up efforts by waving the Jones Act. Based on the 1920 Merchant Marine Act all goods shipped between U.S. ports must be transported in U.S.-built, U.S.-owned and U.S. -manned ships – yet another gift to Big Labor. President George W. Bush waived the Jones Act to allow assistance from foreign countries during the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita almost immediately. <br> He continued by saying, “I have issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling. I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs.” Apparently, the potential loss of 120,000 jobs and as many as 46,200 supporting jobs becoming idled by the moratorium, during the worst recession our country has experienced, is just a mere “difficulty” for the men and women whom these rigs employ. Glad to see the president has his priorities in line. <br> Yet he must have forgotten that 80 percent of the first $1 billion spent on grants to wind energy companies in the Recovery Act went to foreign firms and jobs to build turbines overseas. In the second round of government grants, 79 percent of the $2.1 billion in grants went to companies based overseas; of this money, $2.9 billion went to wind facilities. <br> For example, in Florida, the DeSoto Solar Center was supposed to be the “largest solar power plant in the United States,” according to President Obama. The center received $150 million from the Recovery Act. After using 400 construction workers to build the site, the Solar Center now employs only two people. These jobs are simply not sustainable. <br> The Inspector General found the jobs impact “has not materialized” and the Government Accountability Office found the application of costly Davis-Bacon wage requirements equates to over $57,000 per home nationwide. How this helps the economy is yet to be proven. <br> The real effects the president refers to are <i>not</b> something our economy can afford. If his vision is passed into law, gasoline prices will rise 58 percent (or $1.38), natural gas prices will rise 55 percent, heating oil prices will rise 56 percent, electricity prices will rise 90 percent and a family of four can expect their per-year energy costs to rise by $1,241. <br> Rather than using this tragedy for political gain, the president should support an “all of the above” energy approach that incorporates a diverse variety of energy sources without mandates, subsidies, or taxes that artificially skew the market in favor of one form of energy over another. <br> Brian Johnson is federal affairs manager at Americans for Tax Reform. 
 The “tax extenders” package is up again this week in the U.S. House of Representatives. The extenders package’s basic purpose is to prevent tax deductions and credits from expiring for businesses and families. But in Speaker Pelosi’s Washington, stopping these tax increases for another year means imposing other, permanent tax hikes somewhere else. By way of this strategy, Congressional Democrats have set up an annual, permanent, new set of tax hikes on legislation that “must pass.” This time, the concurrent tax offsets will take the form of marginal income tax rate hikes. <br> All tax hikes are bad for the economy, but some are downright catastrophic. The latter is on display in this year’s extenders package as the “pay-fors.” According to published reports, there are two main tax hikes in the bill: taxing “carried interest” capital gains more like ordinary income, and imposing the Medicare payroll tax on service-sector Subchapter S-corporation profits. <br> Democrats argue that the “carried interest” the manager has earned is simply wages in disguise. This is factually inaccurate. In fact, this money is the result of investment appreciation of an asset like a stock or a building—in other words, it is plainly a capital gain. When the investment manager realizes this gain, he rightfully pays taxes at the capital gains tax rate under current law. <br> Not being ignorant cattle unwittingly led to the slaughter, investment fund managers won’t simply “eat” this tax hike. The most likely scenario is that the rest of the partners—limited parties such as defined benefit pension plans, university endowments, and charitable trusts—will see their share of the profits shrink. The true incidence of this tax hike will come in the form of underfunded pensions, endowments, and charities. <br> This tax hike will have one major impact—S-corporation owners will draw more capital out of their companies in order to pay Uncle Sam. The owners themselves won’t be hurt at all—it will be the business which suffers through a capital drain. <br> In both cases—the carried interest tax hike and the S-corporation tax hike—there’s an interesting phenomenon of unintended consequences. In seeking to hike taxes on “greedy” investment partnership managers, Congress actually reduces the value of stocks owned by Americans’ pension plans and the endowments of our universities and charitable foundations. In seeking to hike taxes on those who dare to start profitable and job-creating small businesses, Congress will in fact only impoverish the capital reserves of those businesses, depressing productivity-enhancing investments, killing jobs, and lowering wages for those still lucky enough to have a job. <br> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/us/grover-norquist.htm#r_src=ramp" class="r_lapi">Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform.</i> 
 In an interview with CNBC’s John Harwood on Wednesday, President Obama refused to rule out the imposition of a value added tax (VAT) on Americans. <br> In fact, the White House has <i>never</b> ruled out the possibility of a VAT, which may explain why the president is now attempting to alter the terms of his central campaign promise. <br> “And one thing we have not done is raise <i>income taxes </b>on families making less than $250,000. That’s another promise we’ve kept.” <br> “And one thing we haven’t done is raise income taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year -- another promise that we kept.” <br> Pulling the wool over our eyes with an altered tax pledge and a complacent media would allow the Obama administration two significant -- albeit deceptive -- achievements. First, it would retroactively absolve Obama from his previous violations of the pledge. In the health care bill Obama signed into law, there were at minimum seven tax hikes that unquestionably hit families making less than $250,000 – from the individual mandate tax to the excise tax on indoor tanning sessions. And let’s not forget the pledge-breaking tax increase signed into law sixteen days into his presidency: a 156 percent hike in the federal excise tax on tobacco. Courtesy of his new claim that his campaign pledge applied only to income taxes, Obama could pretend he is in full compliance (But even with the goal posts moved, he would still be in violation due to Obamacare’s restrictions on medical itemized deductions). The ruse has certainly worked since its debut on April 10, with Obama escaping any specific scrutiny focused on the altered terms of his pledge. <br> Because the president made the “any form of tax increase” promise to the American people, he has a responsibility to stand up and renounce all of the VAT flirtations of his advisors and appointees. During his Wednesday interview with CNBC, he had the ideal opportunity to bring the matter to a close once and for all. Obama was asked point blank by Harwood if Americans should think of his middle class tax promise “as lasting for the entirety of your presidency – you would never accept tax increases for that group? Or is it something for the initial phase of your presidency -- now you take account again of where the deficit is and make a different decision?”Instead of slamming the door shut on the very notion of a tax hike, Obama pivoted and concluded that he would “wait for the fiscal commission to provide me what their best recommendations are.” <br> There should remain no mystery as to why the president is attempting to rewrite the terms of his tax pledge. Whether he gets away with it is another story. 
 Did you file your federal income taxes on or before April 15? Almost 50% of American households won’t be paying any federal income tax this year, and the reasons why have profound implications for our democracy as well as our economy now. <br> Of course, we are accustomed to the idea that high income earners pay more in taxes both in absolute terms and as a percentage of their incomes. But taxing only the top half of a society is not normal progressive taxation. Instead, the recent changes to our tax system are an example of politicians using the tax code for their own political ends. In this case, the so-called progressive Democratic politicians are using “tax reform” to grow their political base by creating a group of Americans that pay no federal income tax. <br> The so-called progressive Democratic politicians are rational actors too. By taking more and more Americans off the federal tax rolls, they are creating a permanent base of supporters for themselves. These politicians may claim to support increased government spending because of their concern for the less-fortunate but--hey, it also happens to be in their own political self-interest. And these politicians will continue to spend on these programs until our nation goes bust because they want to keep their jobs and grow expensive programs for their political base. <br> Under the Obama administration, many Americans accustomed to paying their share of federal taxes are being taken off the tax rolls. Recent tax law changes mean that for the first time, in 2009, a family of four making $50,000 can pay no federal income tax at all. This family may not change its behavior and outlook immediately from its taxpaying days. But the family’s economic incentives are now to keep America taxing and spending. And a family at this income level has surely suffered in this recession, but should they really pay <b>no federal income tax </i>at all? <br> The so-called progressive politicians have turned John Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country” on its head. And telling so many Americans that they don’t need to make sacrifices for our government, as we are now saying, is dangerous new territory for our nation and for the health of our democracy and economy. <br> <span style=" color: #ED1C24;">Fox Forum is on Twitter.

 To add even more bite to the new “Contract from America” from a coalition of Tea Party activists, here are sound bites I recommend to spread the message. Feel free to add your own. <br> Finally, to summarize the whole Contract From America: “We prefer the wisdom of our Founding Fathers to the tyranny of Big Brother.” 
 Every so often, we get a reminder about what’s <b>really</i> important. We get nudged as to what we should be thinking about--and worried about. That is, not just what we find interesting, or what we’re getting paid to work on, but what’s vital, not only to ourselves and our family and friends--but to our whole country. Newt Gingrich delivered such a message Tuesday morning. The topic was America’s survival as a free country, and we all should pay attention. <br> But on Wednesday morning, the headlines in the MSM were almost giddy, in the wake of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit” in Washington, D.C: “46 nations join U.S. in nuclear pact,” blared The Washington Post. “Obama Vows Fresh Proliferation Push as Summit Ends,” bannered The New York Times. And The Post added a glowing sidebar story, headlined, “On world stage, Obama at ease as seminar leader.” Indeed, it all sounds great, that all those nations are committing to eliminate loose nuclear material--until one reads the fine print. Even The Post conceded, “The commitments are voluntary… reaching the goal will be difficult.” <br> No, said Gingrich. It’s fine to seek to corral nuclear material wherever possible, to thwart proliferation and keep bombs out of the hands of terrorists, but it’s dangerous to extend treaty-making to unverifiable arms control, to say nothing of arms elimination. That would put America at grave risk. So when Obama and his aides talk about eliminating nuclear weapons altogether, they are practicing “self-delusion,” declared the former Speaker of the House. The Obamans are acting, Gingrich continued, as if they believe that treaties can take the place of strong defense, that words can replace reality. But in fact, the administration is engaged in an “absurd charade,” putting America at risk. As the Georgia Republican reminded us, nearly eight decades ago, in 1933, the world’s diplomats were meeting in Geneva, working on arms control, even as Adolf Hitler was taking power in Germany. It was a “fantasy,” Gingrich declared, that someone such as Hitler would abide by any sort of arms control treaty. <br> As Gingrich reminded us, the most pie-in-the-sky of all the treaties of that era was signed in 1928, when the leading powers of the world came together to ink the Kellogg-Briand http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg–Brian_dPact treaty, which outlawed war. Yup, the world came together to sign a treaty declaring that war was a no-no. The US and 54 other countries were signatories; the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty 85:1. And yet, strangely enough, war was not ended. Indeed, the Kellogg-Briand treaty has never been repealed; Uncle Sam, along with just about every other country in the world, has simply ignored the treaty in innumerable conflicts since. The point here is not to mock good intentions, but rather to remind all of us that common sense matters more than lofty sentiments. If Hitler is on the loose, other countries need military defense, not scraps of paper. <br> And yet the Germans, the Soviets, the Japanese, and all the other aggressor nations had perfectly happy to come to meetings and sign treaties ofr peace and arms control, including the Kellogg-Briand pact, illegalizing war. <br> As Gingrich also reminded us, even more dangerous countries, such as North Korea and Iran--rogue states that even the Obamans don’t think we can trust--were not a part of the negotiations. And neither, of course, was Al Qaeda. So even in the best possible scenario, if every country at the Nuclear Security Summit decided to follow the Golden Rule, the worst nations, and the worst terrorists, would be all the more tempted to acquire nukes, because then the pariahs would become the great powers. <br> Just last week, Obama signed a different deal, in Prague, agreeing with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev to limit the two countries’ nuclear weapons. That’s nice in theory, but does anybody seriously think that the Russians will abide by the terms of any nuclear deal? Indeed, even as Obama was smiling it up with Medvedev, pro-Russian forces were overthrowing a pro-American government in Kyrgyzstan. What-stan? Kyrgyzstan is a former piece of the Soviet empire in Central Asia, which means that it is strategically located near not only Russia, but also China, India, and Iran. Moreover, America has a military base there, used to supply our troops in Afghanistan. Yet now there’s a good chance that the Russians, having reasserted much of their old Soviet power in Kyrgyzstan, will seek to expel the U.S., just as they did a few years ago in nearby Uzbekistan. A different American president might have thought that Kyrgyzstan was important, and suggested that, at minimum, things would not be right between the U.S. and Russia until the situation was resolved. <br> Yes, it’s a dangerous world, full of evil dictators and clever terrorists, as well as countries that just don’t like us. Unfortunately, as Gingrich observed, citing the history of poor American predictions about nuclear programs in Pakistan and India, the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies “are as likely to be wrong as they are likely to be right.” So a prudent president must look to common sense, guided by historical perspective, even more than to briefing books and rosy scenarios. Because while it’s bad that other nations are trying to trick us, it’s far worse when we trick ourselves. <br> So it’s not just America’s fate that is at stake. If the current president seems to prefer pleasant illusion over stark reality, we are all at risk, everywhere. That’s a prospect worth paying attention to, even at the price of a little upset. Better worry now than mourn later. 
 Former House Speaker (and Fox News contributor) Newt Gingrich went to New Orleans the other day and, in a speech to Republican activists and leaders called President Barack Obama was “the most radical president in U.S. history.” <br> You might think that a president who comes out of America’s leftist traditions and organizations, who successfully maneuvered a national health care bill through Congress, who has called for the global elimination of nuclear weapons and has an agenda to dramatically expand both the size and scope of the federal government, would be pleased to be seen as such. Based on the reaction to Gingrich’s observation, this is not the case. <br> This, of course, could have disastrous consequences for Obama in the 2012 elections – as it already promises to curtail severely the Democratic majorities in Congress. Having campaigned as a centrist he must govern as one, or at least have the American people believe that is what he is doing. <br> For example, the White House wants people to believe that the recent dip in the national unemployment rate is a vindication of Obama’s economic policies. Rather, he suggests, people would do well to remember that the White House’s own projections said that, if approved, the stimulus package would keep the unemployment rate from rising above 8 percent and that they do not have a convincing explanation for why they were so far off the mark. <br> It is deceptive to argue that Obama is a centrist. Rather, as Gingrich suggests, he sits atop a secular, socialist machine that seeks to enlarge the power of the American government in order to remake American society and reshape its values. To deny this is to deny the American people the opportunity to have a meaningful discussion about the country’s future and to make informed choices come the next election. 
 Today, April 9, is Tax Freedom Day. <br> In theory, everything we earn for the rest of the year is ours to keep. <br> Tax Freedom Day measures the average American’s percentage of the year’s income that he or she has to fork over in taxes. There are some Americans who pay little or no tax or bureaucrats who actually get paid by our tax dollars. You, taxpaying American, are shouldering their load as well as your own, so you are not off the hook today. <br> Last year Americans worked 42 days to pay for the cost of federal regulations. Federal regulations cost us more than 10 percent of our incomes. Those costs are embedded by law in products and services and the wily politicians hope that we will direct our anger at the companies forced by regulations to include features we as consumers didn’t ask for, couldn’t say no to and might not want at all. <br> There are two ways to limit the cost of government. The first is to change the Congress and the White House and elect a government that will actually focus on the size of government. The second is to move from a high spending state to a low spending state. Connecticut citizens work 250 days to pay for government—total government spending plus the regulatory burden. New Yorkers, 243. New Jerseyans, 249. These taxpayers can save a month of one’s income each year by moving. South Dakotans work 201 days a year. Texans, 213. Nevadan’s, 216. <br> The goal of the left in America is to trick Americans to focus on the deficit. Here the left has a solution: higher taxes, specifically a Value Added Tax. We must keep our focus on total government spending and the solution to the problem is then clear. Spend less. <br> <i>Fox Forum is on Twitter. Follow us @fxnopinion.</i> 
 While nationally, all eyes are on the government takeover of the health care industry, a proposal to ban the use of salt in restaurant cooking has New York’s chefs and restaurateurs up in arms. <br> They have found an ally in the White House in President Obama, who is going much further than joining his wife in advocating healthy food choices from the White House garden. The president’s idea of taxing soda and sugar-sweetened beverages as part of the health care overhaul quickly fizzled, however this hasn’t stopped the advancement of the nanny staters’ agenda. <br> So far, two rounds of related grants have been announced - a first round of $120 million went to states and territories in early February, and a second round of $372 million has just been awarded to 44 local communities last week. So what are you getting out of it? <br> While descriptions for some of the latest projects funded under the program sound almost laughable -- what exactly do you think they mean when they talk about “increasing point-of-decision health prompts at stairwells and elevators in public venues”? -- it becomes abundantly clear that this is a concerted effort to advance government control over our consumption decisions when reviewing the CDC’s guideline document for grantees. <br> The code words for pushing for tax increases in the grantee guidelines are “evidence-based pricing strategies to discourage tobacco use” and “changing relative prices of healthy vs. unhealthy items.” Of course that only becomes clear after reviewing the references used in CDC’s supporting documentation, but then again, why would they want to advertise that they’re planning to spend our money to raise our taxes to expand control over our personal lives? <br> I’ll leave the answer up to you. In the meantime, let me welcome you to the Nanny States of America. 
 For many Americans the distance between what they believe is best for the nation and what government actually does has become an infuriating chasm that was never meant to exist in a representative government designed to reflect the will of the majority. <br> Married people pay higher rates than singles living together, income is commonly double and tripled taxed, pastors are told what they can and can’t say from the pulpit and foreign competitors enjoy significant cost advantages over American producers because of our tax system. <br> So what if both the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the congressional committee that actually writes the tax laws got their own tax returns wrong? So what if just obeying federal tax laws costs taxpayers more than $300 billion a year in compliance costs? So what if Congress’ error in failing to index the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation now threatens to define as “wealthy” those with as little as $80,000 annual income? So what if Warren Buffet’s salary-earning secretary pays a higher tax rate than her billionaire boss? <br> This is why more than a thousand people an hour have been joining a digital tax rebellion marching on Washington at www.onlinetaxrevolt.com. FairTaxers, Flat Taxers, Reagan tax reformers and many others are being pulled together to bring another Boston Tea Party to Washington, D.C. on April 15. While people may disagree on the best solution, there is widespread understanding that the American people cannot win back control of their government until the federal tax system is either repaired or ripped out by the roots and replaced. <br> Two years ago, under-funded then-presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee caught tax reform lightning in an Iowa bottle and was catapulted to a first place finish in the Iowa Caucus. Mitt Romney and John McCain were burned by the same lightning when they repeated the same old tired and now unbelievable income tax reform promises. No, the entire election did not turn on tax reform but Mike Huckabee electrified voters when he made the FairTax, a national consumption tax to replace the broken income tax system, a center plank of his campaign. That decision marked Huckabee as one of the first among our recent politicians to turn his back on what is increasingly seen as self-dealing in Washington that damages the future of the nation and the best interests of individual citizens. <br> Ken Hoagland, author of “The FairTax Solution”, is chairman of the Online Tax Revolt and theFairTax national victory campaign.

 <b>The Mount Vernon Statement
 With the usual Beltway fanfare, President Obama released his FY 2011 budget this morning. What does it say about where the country is going under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid leadership? What’s going to happen with taxes? Has the president learned any lessons from his party’s electoral defeats in November and January? <br> ometimes, these numbers jumped around (higher spending under Carter, higher taxes under Clinton, etc.), but this has been the gravitational pull that we seem to keep coming back to.Under the Obama budget, taxes are scheduled to rise from 14.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 19.6 percent of GDP in 2020 (higher than the historical average of 18 percent). Spending is scheduled to fall slightly from 24.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 23.7 percent in 2020 (much, much higher than the historical average of 21 percent of GDP). The national debt will hit over 77 percent of our economy in 2020, which would be the highest level since 1950, when we were paying off World War II. <br> President Obama hasn’t gotten that message, or at least, if he has, it doesn’t show up in the budget. Rather than enacting meaningful spending program reforms that would bring federal expenditures back to their late-Clinton levels, he puts forward minor spending restraint gimmicks. His spending cuts section comes out to less than one-tenth of one percent of federal spending per year. Even worse, many of his spending reductions are actually tax increases on oil and gas companies. <br> Now attention shifts to the Congress. It’s ultimately going to be up to them. Our lawmakers will ultimately decide which tax hikes will go through at the end of the year. They decide which new taxes are going to become law to pay for unionized ditch-digging and other “stimulative” activities. They appropriate the money. Congress—not the president—will have to answer to the American people in the fall. If they give the same big government pitch that Creigh Deeds, Jon Corzine, and Martha Coakley did, there may be a very different budget atmosphere in Washington next year. 
 The first year of the Obama administration is over and the president’s State of the Union address is scheduled for Wednesday, January 27. Now is a good time to ask, how has President Obama done -- from a fiscal perspective -- during his first year in office? <br> The country was also in a recession and trying to avoid an economic free fall when President Obama took the oath of office. This represented a stark contrast to the state of the economy when President Bush (43) was sworn in. <br> Again following the Congress's lead, shortly after entering office President Obama signed a fiscal 2009 appropriations bill that provided for a 8.3 percent increase in discretionary spending, including an over 10 percent increase in funding for the Congress. All this at a time when core inflation was low and going down! In fairness, this bill was initially developed by the Congress during the Bush (43) administration. However, only President Obama had a veto pen when it arrived on his desk. He signed it but promised more fiscal discipline in the future. <br> Unfortunately, the summit turned out to more show than substance. As a result, nothing much came of it despite the fact that there was a pretty clear consensus that a credible Social Security reform effort could receive bipartisan support. The administration and the Democratic leadership in Congress had evidently already decided to push health care reform as their top domestic priority. <br> Another very troubling action was the federal government's decision to guarantee about $5 trillion dollars in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt in the face of significant pressure from our nation's two largest foreign creditors (i.e., Japan and China). This puts taxpayers on the hook for any losses that will result over time. It also demonstrates the leverage that our foreign lenders can exert on us. <br> And now the administration says it will get tough in its fiscal 2011 budget proposal. It will be interesting to see how tough they will get. After an over 20 percent increase in the base level of discretionary spending, tough should mean cutting and eliminating programs with a resulting reduction in the base level of discretionary spending. I seriously doubt that will be the case.<br />Looking back, the president's domestic policy agenda during his first year was focused heavily on attempts to achieve health care reform. However, to the concern of many Americans, the related legislation involved a further expansion of the federal government's role as well as hundreds of billions in federal spending and taxation over a ten year period. -- This despite the fact that the federal government already had over $38 trillion in unfunded promises relating to Medicare alone! <br> As the president prepares to address the nation before a joint session of Congress this week, his prospects for achieving comprehensive health care reform have declined dramatically. At the same time, the public's concern regarding escalating deficits and debt and our increased reliance on foreign lenders has risen even further. As a result, President Obama is feeling pressure to take steps to demonstrate his concern for fiscal responsibility in actions rather than words. <br> The administration is also clearly correct that it will require a special process in order to be able to make the tough choices associated with additional budget controls, reform of current social insurance programs, health care cost reduction, reprioritization of other spending, and tax reform that will generate additional revenues. All of these efforts must be undertaken and acted on if we expect to put our nation on a more prudent and sustainable fiscal path. <br> It is clearly preferable for such a special body to be established by law rather than by Executive Order. Having it be established by statute will help to ensure bipartisan buy-in to the process and the members who are appointed. In addition, the only way to ensure that the commission's recommendations will be considered and voted on is if the Congress is required by law to do so. Importantly, in the final analysis the Congress must vote on any related recommendations and the President must decide to sign or veto any related bill in order for the commission of task force's recommendations to become law. Therefore, the process is clearly Constitutional despite assertions by some to the contrary. <br> Our fiscal time bomb is ticking and time is not working in our favor. Therefore, in 2010 President Obama must continue to focus on what can be done to help ensure a sustainable economic recovery and to address our high level of unemployment. At the same time, he must also put a process in place in early 2010 that will facilitate making the tough choices needed to put our federal finances in order and avoid a super sub-prime crisis that would result if our foreign lenders lose confidence in our willingness and ability to act. Any recommendations that are adopted by the Congress and signed by the president should be implemented once the economy recovers and we make meaningful progress on unemployment. President Obama should also discontinue any efforts designed to create new entitlement programs or promises when the federal government has already made tens of trillions in unfunded promises already.<br />The time for talk is over. The time for action is now. 
 While House and Senate health care negotiators meet behind closed doors to put together a final reconciled package (much to the dismay of taxpayers who had been promised that they’d be privy to the negotiations) another transparency scandal has come to light. <br> Taxpayers should not be on the hook to pay for government propaganda campaigns, and Americans for Tax Reform and its Center for Fiscal Accountability have asked Jonathan Gruber to swiftly return the money he has been awarded under his contract with HHS to taxpayers.From the letter to Gruber: <br> Your engagement with the government to publicly tout a massive spending program is akin to public lobbying campaigns for which consulting firms are being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on behalf of their (private-sector) clients. The fact that in your case the client was the Administration paying you hundreds of thousands of dollars makes your actions highly unethical. Taxpayers clearly deserve better than having their tax dollars spent on political propaganda. <br> But apparently even Gruber's assertion that he provided the information regarding his affiliation with the government “when asked” seems to only be partially true. While he may have disclosed the contract to the New England Journal of Medicine, on Saturday, January 9, The New York Times printed an editors’ note stating that Gruber committed a breach of contract: <br> Needless to say, taxpayers and the journalists Gruber sat down with alike have every reason to be outraged, and taxpayers deserve a refund. 
 What a difference a year makes. The 2010 Senate landscape has been rocked by North Dakota Democrat Senator Byron Dorgan’s stunning announcement Tuesday that he would not seek reelection come November. Retirement announcements from Connecticut Democrat Senator Chris Dodd and Colorado Democrat Governor Bill Ritter came soon after, the latest indicators of a worrisome electoral outlook for Democrats. <br> Dorgan has been getting away with this act for years, so why jump ship now? Putting aside any personal reasons, with Democrats misreading their mandate and overreaching in their control of the House, Senate, and presidency, it became more difficult for Dorgan to disguise his true nature. Dorgan went against the will of his constituents by voting for the Senate health care bill: a recent Rasmussen poll showed 64 percent of North Dakotans oppose the bill. Like former South Dakota Senator Tom Daschle in 2004, Dorgan became exposed for who he is. <br> North Dakota has had an all-Democratic congressional delegation since 1987, something of a paradox in this solidly red state: The last time a Democrat won the popular vote was Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 landslide; the governorship has been in Republican hands since 1993; and the GOP not only enjoys broad majorities in the state House and Senate but controls every statewide office save one. <br> Meanwhile, the state’s other Senator, Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, may think he can sit back and weather the storm until he’s up for reelection in 2012. But if Hoeven eventually wins Dorgan’s seat, trouble lies ahead for Conrad. Just as the high visibility of health care forced North Dakotans to say to themselves, “Dorgan is to the left of me,” a Republican like Hoeven casting opposite votes will leave Conrad exposed and force him to defend his record, day after day, for nearly two years. Naked to the wind, and no longer able to band together with Dorgan, Conrad will have trouble pretending his positions are “moderate” or “reasonable.” 
 When the Senate voted 60-39 to proceed to debate Harry Reid’s 2000 page collection of taxes and mandates and new regulations on America’s health care the nation learned several lessons. <br> Second, everything Barack Obama’s handlers put up on his teleprompter during the 2008 campaign turns out to be a lie. Everything. The goal of this legislation is not to make health care more affordable for all Americans. The Reid legislation does nothing to reduce costs—unless you count the hidden plans for future rationing of such things as mammograms. <br> Third, this isn’t about health care at all. It's about raising taxes and increasing government spending and government make-work jobs.<br />The first Obama/Reid/ Pelosi legislation was to extend the Bush bank bailout with an additional $350 billion. The second Obama/Reid/Pelosi bill was to spend $787 billion on a collection of pork barrel earmarks. The third Obama/Reid/Pelosi bill was to increases taxes and spending about a trillion to increase the costs of energy and gasoline—to force you to drive less and heat and light your home less. This “health bill” is just another tax and spend and regulate bill. The title is different from the fist three bills. And it is even more expensive than the first three. But it is just more of the same. <br> Reid has instructed those Senators who are voting against the interests of their citizens (and have voters informed enough to be unhappy about this vote) to pretend that this is just a procedural vote. There will be another final vote after the legislation has been amended. But Reid wants the final bill passed before Christmas. Reid/ Pelosi and Obama have claimed they had a plan for the past year. Why have they hidden their plans from voters until now and pretend that they are beginning a real debate over the holiday season? They count on Americans being busy and distracted. They plan to buy or bully 60 votes again soon.<br />With $2.5 trillion in new spending and fortunes to be made or lost in the web of regulations and executive powers in the 2,074 pages of small print there will be very grateful special interests willing to reward those 60 votes for a government takeover of our health care. Still, an open wallet did not save New Jersey tax and spend Democrat Governor Corzine from defeat November 3. 
 <span style=" font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">Last fall Barack Obama campaigned promising change.Many Americans wanted change. They wanted to change Washington.But Obama meant something very different. He wanted to use Washington to change America.Having the government take over hospitals, doctors, health insurance and life and death decisions is not what most Americans thought they were voting for.&nbsp;</font> <br> <span style=" font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">When Obama said &cent;‚&Acirc;&quot;reform he clearly meant &cent;‚&Acirc;&quot;take over. Reform the auto companies. Reform the banking system. Obama would use our tax dollars so he could buy and control whole industries.</span> <br> <span style=" font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">President Obama was brutally honest when he said the government run &cent;‚&Acirc;public option would be like the Post Office. We have, Obama pointed out, a government run post office and privately run UPS and FedEx. Therefore you have choice. Sort of. The federal government taxes UPS and FedEx. The government-run post office does not pay federal or state corporate income taxes or local property taxes. FedEx and UPS do. And it is against the law for you to try and send a first class letter through anyone other than the post office. Well if the government option can tax its competitors and can pass laws to create a monopoly--how is this real choice?</font> <br> <span style=" font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">Would the U.S. government ration health care if they ran the health care system? Well, president Obama has already given us the answer.The post office, his model for a public health care system, is losing money (Interesting question how a monopoly loses money). What is the post office response to losing money? Becoming more efficient? No. They will ration post office care by closing on Saturdays. Years ago they rationed by ending twice daily delivery of the mail. Now when you get sick, the government may be closed on Saturdays. Rationing.No fun if you are sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br> <span style=" font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">All this pain for what?</font> <br> <span style=" font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">Second, we need to reform tort law--stop the trial lawyer billionaires from suing your doctor and hospital to push up the costs of your health care. Obama, Reid and Pelosi owe the trial lawyer billionaires a great deal. They cannot say no to them. So no reform there. Some suggest that such reforms would save billions in legal fees but also tens of billions in lower costs of so called &cent;‚&Acirc;&quot;defensive medicine forced by the trial lawyers.</font> <br> <span style=" font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">Health care is too expensive in America.That is because it is taxed, regulated and sued too much. We need less government in between us and our doctors.Fewer parasitical trial lawyers and more competition free from government created monopolies.</font> 
 Taxpayers will sadly discover that this year will be one month shorter than last year. Why? Bailouts, big budgets, cap and trade energy costs and government medicine move Cost of Government Day one month later than last year. <br> With Cost of Government Day falling on Aug. 12 this year, American workers had to work 224 days out of the year to meet the cost imposed on them by government. In other words, for 2009 the cost of government consumes a whopping 61.34 percent of national income. <br> The dates for the states' Cost of Government Days vary greatly. Alaska comes earliest at 192 days (July 11) and Connecticut, as in previous years does not arrive until much later, forcing workers in the Nutmeg State to work until Sept. 7 -- a full 250 days. <br> The largest component of the total cost of government, according to the report, is federal spending, which consumes 30.36 percent of national income this year and forces the average American worker to work 111 days out of the year just to pay for this component of COGD. <br> In conjunction with the fiscal year 2010 budget, the financial market bailout packet that brought us TARP and the disgraceful trillion dollar spending and debt package Congress passed under theguise of economic stimulus have set taxpayers up for a year in which federal spending has reached a record 28.5 percent of GDP. <br> In light of the ongoing assault on the part of tax-and-spend politicians who are at it with reckless abandon, the scope of this year's Cost of Government Day Report has been expended to include a number of additional case studies the purpose of which is to explore the effects the implementation of certain policies has had or would have on the 2009 COGD. <br> How do we get to an earlier Cost of Government Day? <br> The first order of business should be: When you're in a hole, stop digging. Government needs to get out of the business of being the insurer of last resort. Consequently, the TARP program should be ended immediately and all un-appropriated stimulus funds should be rescinded, as proposed by the Republican Study Committee's REBOUND Act. <br> President Obama and his tax-and-spend posse may try to have you believe otherwise, but the nascent <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/politics/tea-party.htm#r_src=ramp" class="r_lapi">Tea Party Movement, and the reaction of taxpayers at town halls all over the country are a clear sign that Washington's tax and spend policies are not in line with what America wants. Moving Moving toward an earlier Cost of Government Day may be an uphill battle, but it is one worth waging. 
 The House Democrats released their long-awaited draft health care reform bill today, and every rumor about what tax hikes would be included was true--and then some. My friend Ryan Ellis over at Americans for Tax Reform posted the details. <br> Combined with President Obama's plan to repeal the Bush tax cuts on schedule in 2011, this would mean hiking the top marginal capital gains tax rate from 15 percent to 25.4 percent--much higher than Obama promised on the campaign trail, and near the 28 percent rate from before the 1997 Bill Clinton tax cuts. Such a tax hike would slam the brakes on capital formation and wallop capital markets with another gut punch just as they are finally beginning to recover from the financial crisis. It would also dramatically inhibit badly needed business investment. <br> Such punitive income tax rates would be a huge impediment to business activity throughout the economy, especially for the small and medium-sized business that create nearly all of the new employment that we need to lead us out of the recession. <br> There would also be a new tax on individuals who don't have health insurance, flying in the face of President Obama's key primary campaign promise not to require people to be insured. That tax would be another 2.5 percent of AGI. <br> The tax hikes in this bill represent the last piece of the puzzle--along with loose monetary policy and high government spending--to repeat the key economic blunders of the 1970s, with all the misery that came with them. 
 Wed, 27 May 2009 21:15:14 +0000 </span><em>By Phil KerpenPolicy Director, Americans for Prosperity</strong> <br> --------------- <br> What is the VAT? It's a type of national sales tax that is collected in pieces throughout the production chain, instead of being collected all at once at the cash register like a retail sales tax. In theory, sales taxes like the VAT are pretty good taxes because they are broad-based, difficult to evade, and minimize economic distortions. In practice, they are the ATM machine for runaway government growth, because they are largely invisible to the public and they can raise huge amounts of money in very small chunks, thus minimizing the effective political opposition that generally keeps taxes in check. <br> The U.S. tax system is clearly a mess, and badly in need of meaningful tax reform. That reform, however, needs to in the direction of simplicity and lower rates. Many conservatives believe, with good reason, that we should abolish the IRS, end income taxation, and adopt a national sales tax of some kind--most would prefer a national <strong>retail </em>sales tax, which is the heart of the Fair Tax proposal. Some, perhaps, would be happy with a VAT, which functions much like a sales tax. Such a proposal is not without its virtues, but the enormous risk associated with it is that we end up with a national sales tax on top of our existing income tax system. <br> Trillions of dollars of bailouts, stimulus, spending, unfunded entitlement obligations, and an appetite for a Washington takeover of health care have us on a collision course for a national bankruptcy unless we adopt a huge new tax (cap-and-trade is another one, by-the-way, although the VAT could be even more expensive) or finally start to get a handle on runaway spending. The current tax system simply will not bear enough revenue to pay for these trillions of dollars of obligations. If we don't want to accept a European-style nanny state and the lower standards of living that come with it, we need to cut all this spending and forget about a Washington takeover of health care. And we need to shoot this VAT trial balloon down, quickly. 
 Wed, 29 Apr 2009 05:00:49 +0000 </span><em>By Patrick ColabellaCertified Public Accountant, Ed.D <br> Is it proper for a democracy to have a tax law people just don't understand? We have evolved so far in every aspect of technology except for taxation. The income tax is an industrial revolution concept that has long since passed its functionality and sadly, mandatory education does not include taxation in its curriculum, so most of us are tax illiterates. Why that is so is not the issue. More important is how politicians abuse the complexity to socially engineer us and punish some, something King George tried to do in 1773. The income tax is the subtle master lever behind what is now becoming Socialist America. With the use of the earned income credit, the income tax is now shockingly a routinely used entry-level welfare entitlement. Interestingly, by the treasury's own calculations, abuse of the earned income credit costs the government over $6.5 billion in fraud annually. <br> Briefly, the Withdrawals Tax is based on a single rate of tax that funds all levels of government, federal and local, collected by EFT on withdrawals from taxpayers' bank accounts, like an ATM usage charge or Easy Pass. The estimated tax rate is 5% but may be higher based on government budget needs; the rate would be adjusted by act of Congress. The lower tax rate is achieved by expanding the tax base but higher rates may be needed as budget needs arise. The tax is progressive and levied against individuals and businesses alike. This means there are a threshold and a graduated amount of withdrawal before you begin and as you pay the tax. Your paycheck will get deposited without income tax withholding. You can use all types of debt, tax-free. The loan repayments are taxed instead.

Instead, they received net payments from the tax system equal to 3.8% of total income taxes. In other words, the bottom 40% paid negative 3.8% of total federal income taxes. <br> These relative tax burdens were actually the result of Reagan Republican supply side economics that began with Reagan and Jack Kemp in the 1970s and 1980s, continued through Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America, and further played out with the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. <em>Reagan and his Republicans in fact had already abolished income taxes on Obama's working people or working class when Obama came into office, and had almost abolished them for the actual middle class. </strong> <br> It was, in fact, Ronald Reagan who first proposed in the 1970s the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) that has done so much to reduce income tax liabilities for lower income people. As president, he cut federal income tax rates across the board for all taxpayers by 25%. He also indexed the tax brackets for all taxpayers to prevent inflation from pushing workers into higher tax brackets. <br> Newt Gingrich's Contract with America adopted a child tax credit of $500 per child that reduced the tax liabilities of lower income people by a higher percentage than for higher income people. President Bush doubled that credit to $1,000 per child, and made it refundable so that low-income people who do not even pay $1,000 in federal income taxes could still get the full credit. Bush also adopted a new lower tax bracket for the lowest income workers of 10%, reducing their federal income tax rate by 33%. He cut the top rate for the highest income workers by just 11.6%, from 39.6% to 35%. <br> What Obama has added to the mix, his tax cut for 95% of Americans, turned out to be a miserable $400 per worker tax credit, less than $8 per week. That tax credit actually will not reduce taxes at all for the bottom 40% of income earners who were already not paying federal income taxes, because you cannot cut taxes for someone who is not paying taxes. <br> Obama also said yesterday that his $400 per worker tax credit will save or create over half a million jobs. But it will actually save or create exactly zero jobs. That is because borrowing $400 from the private sector to give someone else $400 does not add anything to the economy on net. Moreover, the tax credit does nothing to change the incentives that govern the economy. To change the incentives to save, invest, start businesses, expand businesses, create jobs, and produce, you have to reduce tax rates, not send workers $400 checks. That is what Reagan did, and that is why his economic program created a 25 year economic boom. 
 Wed, 15 Apr 2009 16:45:28 +0000 </span>Today, April 15, as millions of anti-tax/pro-limited government activists are peacefully gathering at tea parties to protest the Nanny State--will Big Brother be watching? <br> But it not the only such report. A similar such report was released in Missouri, from a state-government-run Fusion Center, a law-enforcement consortium which targeted Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and Chuck Baldwin, among many other law-abiding conservatives and libertarians. <br> Fusion Center, of course, is simply a fuzzy-sounding name for state-funded surveillance. And it's state-funded surveillance, of course, with a distinctly liberal politically-correct tilt--aimed at smearing right-of-center politicking as being first cousins to violence and terrorism. It's a bad rap, of course, but it's a popular rap among liberals who wish to push conservative dissent off to the fringe. <br> So that's some progress in Missouri. But it is not enough for Governor Nixon to simply say that the document has been recalled. The state of Missouri should, in fairness to all its citizens, should terminate those who had anything to do with the creation and distribution of this document. <br> Because if nobody is really punished--if the retraction (if there is one) is simply a mumble-mouthed pro-forma (with a wink), then nothing will be achieved, and the taxpayers will once again be subsidizing their own surveillance and the further loss of their freedom.

The word can be used in the context of play-acting (a pretend role) but that's not appropriate for a president, even if it's been tried. <br> A president plays a role as a real person, a performer, and depending on how good or bad the performance is, it forms the basis of a judgment about where that person ranks in history--on a scale of accomplishments, style, persuasion and credibility. Presidents slip in and out of roles according to changing circumstances and their own choices (good or bad). <br> <strong>Reformer</em> <br> <em>The archetypical reformer president was Theodore Roosevelt, who broke up big business trusts, pressured Congress to pass laws for drug labeling and meat inspection, increased the size of the navy, and set aside 194 million acres for national parks and preserves. John McCain spoke often of admiring Theodore Roosevelt, but Obama won by portraying himself as a better potential reformer than McCain--selling himself as a unique agent of change and hope.</span></strong> <br> The reformer is a potent role because it is designed to suggest activist leadership that brings change for the good of followers and society. It taps into dissatisfactions with current leadership efforts. Obama convincingly cast himself in the reformer role as the best anti-George W. Bush candidate and in that role he beat both Hillary Clinton in the primary and John McCain in the general election. <br> During inauguration week and thereafter Obama and his advisers will continue to cast Obama in the reformer role that helped get him elected. Playing this role also buys Obama time and good will as he attempts the Herculean job of cleaning up the messes he is inheriting, starting with the economic downturn. <br> With Obama's communication skills, he is a convincing role player. But at some point, the rubber will meet the role and Obama must in fact rather than just in words put America on the right track that the public seeks. <br> What advice would you give Obama for his inaugural address, as he plays his leadership role and defines the right track for the country going forward?

 In this web-exclusive commentary, "Sunday Morning" contributor Nancy Giles says House Speaker John Boehner's planned lawsuit against President Obama because "the president has not faithfully executed the laws" deserves an appropriate response: <br> Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) attends a press conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.,June 18, 2014. <br> In this web-exclusive commentary, "Sunday Morning" contributor Nancy Giles says House Speaker John Boehner's planned lawsuit against President Obama because "the president has not faithfully executed the laws" deserves an appropriate response: <br> I have issues with John Boehner. I don't mind that he cries easily; in fact, it's kind of sweet, though I wish his tears led to some kind of action. Any kind of action. <br> When he took the gavel after Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker in our history, he received a ton of attention: interviews, write-ups, even magazine covers -- way more than Pelosi, who (whether you liked her policies or not) was a way more effective Speaker. <br> Times are tougher for Mr. Boehner these days. He's consistently bullied and challenged by members of his own party, and as Speaker of the House, it turns out he's really a good follower. <br> And who does he end up following? The squeakiest, looniest, "fringe-iest" Members of the House. What's with that? <br> And then there was the phone call incident: in case you missed it, on Election Night 2012, after President Obama was declared the winner and Mitt Romney conceded the election, the President put in two calls: one to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the other to Speaker John Boehner. We'll never know what the President would have said to the two top Republicans in Congress, because he was told that both McConnell and Boehner were asleep. It was past their bedtime. <br> Call me crazy, but if the leader of the free world calls, don't you think it might be important enough to get out of bed? What's with that? <br> Now, after almost four years "leading" the House Republicans to a record number of blocked votes, subcommittees and hearings, 54 votes to repeal, amend, or just somehow get their hands around the Affordable Care Act, and a government shutdown that cost the economy an estimated $24 billion (according to the financial ratings agency Standard Poors), Speaker Boehner has topped himself. He wants the House of Representatives to sue President Obama for his use of executive actions. <br> According to Speaker Boehner: <br> Now that's funny. Article 2 of that same Constitution says that among the President's other powers, he "shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session." <br> And speaking of not faithfully executing the laws, let's talk about Congress. <br> Congress has many duties; a key one is to represent we, the people in what are basically the biggest town hall meetings in the U.S.A. But the main job of Congress, according to Section 8 of the Constitution? "To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution..." <br> Make all laws. That's part of their job description! But if you're not willing to debate, if you consistently block votes from coming to the floor, if you've tried 54 times to mettle with an existing law that the majority of this country is in favor of, if instead of passing laws that help those most hurting you funnel money to top income earners, if you shout about being "fiscally responsible" while spending millions of dollars on Congressional hearings, if you legislate with double standards depending on who is President, and if the 112th Congress was the least productive one since World War II, then you're not doing your job. <br> That tactic, by the way, of accusing someone else of what you yourself are doing, is called "projective identification." (I knew that Psych 101 class would come in handy some day!) <br> So I'm wondering: Can the president counter-sue John Boehner? Or the entire House of Representatives? <br> Can we sue? And can Judge Judy officiate? Please? <br> <strong>For more info:

 (TomDispatch) I used to be a serious Republican, moderate and business-oriented, who planned for a public-service career in Republican politics. But I am a Republican no longer. <br> (TomDispatch) I used to be a serious Republican, moderate and business-oriented, who planned for a public-service career in Republican politics. But I am a Republican no longer. <br> There's an old joke we Republicans used to tell that goes something like this: "If you're young and not a Democrat, you're heartless. If you grow up and you're not a Republican, you're stupid." These days, my old friends and associates no doubt consider me the butt of that joke. But I look on my "stupidity" somewhat differently. After all, my real education only began when I was 30 years old. <br> This is the story of how in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and later in Iraq, I discovered that what I believed to be the full spectrum of reality was just a small slice of it and how that discovery knocked down my Republican worldview. <br> I always imagined that I was full of heart, but it turned out that I was oblivious. Like so many Republicans, I had assumed that society's "losers" had somehow earned their desserts. As I came to recognize that poverty is not earned or chosen or deserved, and that our use of force is far less precise than I had believed, I realized with a shock that I had effectively viewed whole swaths of the country and the world as second-class people. <br> No longer oblivious, I couldn't remain in today's Republican Party, not unless I embraced an individualism that was even more heartless than the one I had previously accepted. The more I learned about reality, the more I started to care about people as people, and my values shifted. Had I always known what I know today, it would have been clear that there hasn't been a place for me in the Republican Party since the Free Soil days of Abe Lincoln. <br> Where I Came From <br> I grew up in a rich, white suburb north of Chicago populated by moderate, business-oriented Republicans. Once upon a time, we would have been called Rockefeller Republicans. Today we would be called liberal Republicans or slurred by the Right as "Republicans In Name Only" (RINOs). <br> We believed in competition and the free market, in bootstraps and personal responsibility, in equality of opportunity, not outcomes. We were financial conservatives who wanted less government. We believed in noblesse oblige, for we saw ourselves as part of a natural aristocracy, even if we hadn't been born into it. We sided with management over labor and saw unions as a scourge. We hated racism and loved Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., particularly his dream that his children would "live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." We worried about the rise of the Religious Right and its social-conservative litmus tests. We were tough on crime, tough on national enemies. We believed in business, full stop. <br> I intended to run for office on just such a platform someday. In the meantime, I founded the Republican club at my high school, knocked on doors and collected signatures with my father, volunteered on campaigns, socialized at fundraisers, and interned for Senator John McCain and Congressman Denny Hastert when he was House Majority Whip Tom DeLay's chief deputy. <br> We went to mainstream colleges -- the more elite the better -- but lamented their domination by liberal professors, and I did my best to tune out their liberal views. I joined the Republican clubs and the Federalist Society, and I read the Wall Street Journal and the Economist rather the New York Times. George Will was a voice in the wilderness, Rush Limbaugh an occasional (sometimes guilty) pleasure. <br> Left Behind By the Party <br> In January 2001, I was one of thousands of Americans who braved the cold rain to attend and cheer George W. Bush's inauguration. After eight years hating "Slick Willie," it felt good to have a Republican back in the White House. But I knew that he wasn't one of our guys. We had been McCain fans, and even if we liked the compassionate bit of Bush's conservatism, we didn't care for his religiosity or his social politics. <br> Bush won a lot of us over with his hawkish response to 9/11, but he lost me with the Iraq War. Weren't we still busy in Afghanistan? I didn't see the urgency. <br> By then, I was at the Justice Department, working in an office that handled litigation related to what was officially called the Global War on Terror (or GWOT). My office was tasked with opposing petitions for habeas corpus brought by Guantanamo detainees who claimed that they were being held indefinitely without charge. The government's position struck me as an abdication of a core Republican value: protecting the "procedural" rights found in the Bill of Rights. Sure, habeas corpus had been waived in wartime before, but it seemed to me that waiving it here reduced us to the terrorists' level. Besides, since acts of terrorism were crimes, why not prosecute them? I refused to work on those cases. <br> Jeremiah Goulka writes about American politics and culture.

They got themselves all excited about Michele Bachmann, and Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich (seriously). They even voted for Rick Santorum, again and again and again. The Ron Paul people never gave up. <br> When all was said and done, Romney's money bought him the nod. That did not mean, however, that Republicans ever could or would come to love him. <br> But they do love Paul Ryan. <br> On the floor of the Tampa convention hall, as the moment of the congressman from Wisconsin's address approached, the delegates could not help themselves. <br> "I'm feeling like it's 1980," New York Republican Party chairman Ed Cox told me just minutes before Ryan spoke. "Just like 1980, with Reagan." <br> Why? "I've felt it since Paul Ryan came on the ticket." <br> A few feet away, the godmother of Republican social conservatism, Phyllis Schlafly pronounced herself "very satisfied" with the ticket. <br> Why? "I really like Paul Ryan." <br> And so it was, delegation to delegation, section to section, across the hall where Republicans gathered for their fortieth national convention. <br> A month ago, Mitt Romney looked like a loser. And even if the GOP ticket is not exactly soaring in the polls, Republican spirits have been soaring since Ryan was added to the ticket. <br> Why? Because Paul Ryan isn't just, as Ed Cox suggests, rather Reaganesque in looks and demeanor. He's rather Reaganesque in his approach to reality. <br> Ryan does not speak hard truths. He tells Republicans stories that they like to hear. Even if they are not true. <br> Ryan began the most-anticipated address of the convention with a biographical soliloquy that referenced his factory-town roots in Janesville, Wisconsin. <br> "President Barack Obama came to office during an economic crisis, as he has reminded us a time or two. Those were very tough days, and any fair measure of his record has to take that into account. My home state voted for President Obama. When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory," Ryan told the convention. <br> "A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: 'I believe that if our government is there to support you.... this plant will be here for another hundred years.' That's what he said in 2008," continued Ryan. "Well, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year." <br> True. Obama spoke the words that Ryan quoted. But Ryan's clear suggestion that Obama -- or his policies -- had something to do with the plant closure was a lie. <br> The government that was not there to support the Janesville workers was the administration of George W. Bush. GM announced and implemented the closure of the plant during Bush's presidency. <br> When a newly elected President Obama rushed to save the domestic auto industry, and perhaps to renew the prospects of shuttered plants like the one in Janesville, the man whose campaign Ryan is now propping up wrote an op-ed titled "Let Detroit [and, presumably Janesville] Go Bankrupt." <br> And since we're on the subject of government failing the workers in Paul Ryan's hometown, surely it is relevant to bring up the congressman's repeated votes for free-trade agreements that members of Janesville's United Auto Workers Local 95 warned would undermine and ultimately shutter their workplace. <br> A man who would use his hometown as a prop and then try to deceive the country about the causes of its circumstance has a certain appeal to Republican delegates who cut their political teeth making the case for trickle-down economics and weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. <br> Ryan actually pushed the envelope, peddling new fantasies, like the spin that says: "Obamacare comes to more than 2,000 pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees, and fines that have no place in a free country." <br> This will come to news as news to Britain, Canada, Germany and other American allies that somehow keep the light of liberty shining even as they guarantee all citizens access to quality healthcare. <br> Come to think of it, there are quite a few rules associated with Medicare. Yet Ryan -- who has for years championed the radical deconstruction of the program -- came off like Lyndon Johnson's long-lost twin Wednesday night, as he preached no compromise in the defense of a government-organized healthcare system. <br> John Nichols, a pioneering political blogger, is a Washington correspondent for The Nation.

 (TomDispatch) We're at the edge of the cliff of deficit disaster! National security spending is being, or will soon be, slashed to the bone! Obamacare will sink the ship of state! <br> (TomDispatch) We're at the edge of the cliff of deficit disaster! National security spending is being, or will soon be, slashed to the bone! Obamacare will sink the ship of state! <br> Each of these claims has grabbed national attention in a big way, sucking up years' worth of precious airtime. That's a serious bummer, since each of them is a spending myth of the first order. Let's pop them, one by one, and move on to the truly urgent business of a nation that is indeed on the edge. <br> Spending Myth 1: Today's deficits have taken us to a historically unprecedented, economically catastrophic place. <br> This myth has had the effect of binding the hands of elected officials and policymakers at every level of government. It has also emboldened those who claim that we must cut government spending as quickly, as radically, as deeply as possible. <br> In fact, we've been here before. In 2009, the federal budget deficit was a whopping 10.1% of the American economy and back in 1943, in the midst of World War II, it was three times that -- 30.3%. This fiscal year the deficit will total around 7.6%. Yes, that is big. But in the Congressional Budget Office's grimmest projections (PDF), that figure will fall to 6.3% next year, and 5.8% in fiscal 2014. In 1983, under President Reagan, the deficit hit 6% (spreadsheet) of the economy, and by 1998, that had turned into a surplus. So, while projected deficits remain large, they're neither historically unprecedented, nor insurmountable. <br> More important still, the size of the deficit is no sign that lawmakers should make immediate deep cuts in spending. In fact, history tells us that such reductions are guaranteed to harm, if not cripple, an economy still teetering at the edge of recession. <br> A number of leading economists are now busy explaining why the deficit this year actually ought to be a lot larger, not smaller; why there should be more government spending, including aid to state and local governments, which would create new jobs and prevent layoffs in areas like education and law enforcement. Such efforts, working in tandem with slow but positive job growth in the private sector, might indeed mean genuine recovery. Government budget cuts, on the other hand, offset private-sector gains with the huge and depressing effect of public-sector layoffs, and have damaging ripple effects on the rest of the economy as well. <br> When the economy is healthier, a host of promising options are at hand for lawmakers who want to narrow the gap between spending and tax revenue. For example, loopholes and deductions in the tax code that hand enormous subsidies to wealthy Americans and corporations will cost the Treasury around $1.3 trillion in lost revenue this year alone -- more, that is, than the entire budget deficit. Closing some of them would make great strides toward significant deficit reductions. <br> Alarmingly, the deficit-reduction fever that's resulted from this first spending myth has led many Americans to throw their support behind de-investment in domestic priorities like education, research (PDF), and infrastructure -- cuts that threaten to undo generations of progress. This is in part the result of myth number two. <br> Spending Myth 2: Military and other national security spending have already taken their lumps and future budget-cutting efforts will have to take aim at domestic programs instead. <br> The very idea that military spending has already been deeply cut in service to deficit reduction is not only false, but in the realm of fantasy. The real story: despite headlines about "slashed" Pentagon spending and "doomsday" plans for more, no actual cuts to the defense budget have yet taken place. In fact, since 2001, to quote former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, defense spending has grown like a "gusher." The Department of Defense base budget nearly doubled in the space of a decade. Now, the Pentagon is likely to face an exceedingly modest 2.5% budget cut in fiscal 2013, "paring" its budget down to a mere $525 billion -- with possible additional cuts shaving off another $55 billion next year if Congress allows the Budget Control Act, a.k.a. "sequestration," to take effect. <br> But don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen. It's likely that lawmakers will, at the last moment, come to an agreement to cancel those extra cuts. In other words, the notion that our military, which has been experiencing financial boom times even in tough times, has felt significant deficit-slashing pain -- or has even been cut at all -- is the Pentagon equivalent of a unicorn. <br> What this does mean, however, is that lawmakers heading down the budget-cutting path can find plenty of savings in the enormous defense and national security budgets. Moreover, cuts there would be less harmful to the economy than reductions in domestic spending. <br> Mattea Kramer, a TomDispatch regular, is senior research analyst at the National Priorities Project and lead author of the new book "A People's Guide to the Federal Budget."

 (The New Republic) The Republican Party's alleged "war" against women is fast emerging as a major trope of the 2012 elections. And the charge is largely true: As the GOP has become increasingly conservative, so too has it become increasingly hostile to feminism and insensitive to women's issues. <br> (The New Republic) The Republican Party's alleged "war" against women is fast emerging as a major trope of the 2012 elections. And the charge is largely true: As the GOP has become increasingly conservative, so too has it become increasingly hostile to feminism and insensitive to women's issues. <br> But Democrats have not merely been horrified bystanders wringing their hands as this "war" has unfolded. The Democratic Party has actively encouraged the GOP's descent into antifeminism. And though Democrats have reaped considerable gains from the fallout, their efforts have often ultimately been to the detriment of the country's women. <br> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/women-candidates-to-make-inroads-in-congress/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Women candidates to make inroads in Congress</span><span class="link">Obama team slams Romney, Walker on women's issues</span><span class="link">Seeing an opening, Obama touts pro-women message</span> <br> As various accounts have pointed out, the Republican Party for most of its history was broadly supportive of women's rights and aspirations, at any rate by the standards of the times. A Republican Congress endorsed the amendment giving women the vote in 1919, and 80 percent of the state legislatures that approved it were Republican-controlled. The party instituted gender-based affirmative action in 1940 by requiring the Republican National Committee to have one woman and one man from each state, decades in advance of similar reforms by the Democrats. Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, was the only woman senator for 24 years, and became the first woman to run for president. Dwight Eisenhower appointed more women to top posts than John F. Kennedy did. <br> The GOP's stance shifted in the 1970s: Republicans played to the backlash against Roe v. Wade and feminism in the later part of that decade, and Ronald Reagan gratified the religious right by abandoning the GOP's long-held support for the Equal Rights Amendment. The bitter struggles by Republican women to combat their party's rightward tilt and accompanying opposition to women's rights have been amply chronicled by the historians Tanya Melich and Catherine Rymph, among others. The latest example was Senator Olympia Snowe, who, in choosing not to seek reelection, pointed out that the GOP's rigid and intolerant image turns off moderate, pro-business women who believe in limited but effective government. <br> Snowe's view is shared by quite a few GOP leaders, including Mitt Romney, who are well aware that the "gender gap" could prove fatal to the party's electoral chances in the fall elections. But efforts to downplay abortion in favor of economic issues have been undone by those Republicans who organized the infamous all-male panel on birth control and the Virginia proposal for transvaginal ultrasound probes (not to mention Rush Limbaugh's misogynist rants and Rick Santorum's momentarily surging candidacy). <br> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-strikes-down-oklahoma-ultrasound-law/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Judge strikes down Oklahoma ultrasound law</span><span class="link">Poll: Virginia voters opposed to ultrasound bill</span><span class="link">Idaho Senate passes abortion ultrasound mandate</span> <br> It's worth noting, however, that the Democratic Party has had no interest in trying to cool partisan debate over women's issues, and every interest in making sure that no significant Republican feminist position emerges. The episode that best illustrates the Democratic approach in this regard was the successful effort to end the political career of Maryland Republican Congresswoman Connie Morella. <br> Morella, a former English professor and state legislator who also managed to raise nine children, was one of the leading feminists in Congress and among the most liberal House Republicans. She sponsored important legislation on domestic violence and women's health, while opposing conservatives on gun control, gay rights, conservation, and abortion. She was also one of only six Republicans to vote against authorizing George W. Bush's military action in Iraq. Her ability to work across the aisle made her a key player in bipartisan reform coalitions. But after Republicans took control of the House in 1994, Morella's representation of some of Washington D.C.'s most affluent and liberal suburbs made her one of the Democrats' leading targets. The Democratic-controlled Maryland legislature redrew her district to ensure that, as the state senate president gloated, "If she runs, she loses." <br> The Congresswoman nonetheless chose to run for a ninth term in 2002. The Republican Party rallied around her: Bush held a fundraiser for her, the conservative Washington Times endorsed her, and the RINO-hunting Club for Growth was persuaded to give her a pass. The reason Morella was so important for the GOP was not only because she was a consistent vote in favor of free trade, economic growth, and the Bush tax cuts, but because she helped counter the charge that the GOP was anti-woman. <br> It is to the Republican Party's credit that it recognized how Morella contributed an important element of diversity in the caucus. But the National Organization for Women endorsed her Democratic opponent, on the grounds that "the ascension of right-wing leadership in the House" made Morella irrelevant. Morella narrowly lost the election and never ran for public office again. Democrats gained a seat, while Republicans lost a vital measure of heterogeneity. <br> NOW's actions at that time were intensely partisan, which was perhaps understandable, since most of the organization's funds and support came from Democrats. But the organization, by turning its back on Morella, in effect declared that feminism was no longer a bipartisan cause and that Republican women almost by definition could not be good feminists. The blowup over the Susan G. Komen Foundation's defunding of Planned Parenthood earlier this year provided further confirmation that women's organizations caught up in partisan quarrels will have to side with the Democrats. The unfortunate upshot is that, as feminism ceases to be advocated by at least some people in both parties, it becomes a narrower cause and loses force in American life. <br> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-complicit-in-gops-anti-women-agenda/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Click here to continue reading</span> <br> Geoffrey Kabaservice is the author of "Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, from Eisenhower to the Tea Party."

 After watching Congress flounder around for an entire year and manage to accomplish nothing, I've come up with my own reform plan. Just create a second Congress. <br> After watching Congress flounder around for an entire year and manage to accomplish nothing, I've come up with my own reform plan. Just create a second Congress. <br> How do you do that? Hey, it's a campaign year, you can promise anything! <br> Here's a broad outline about how it would work: members of this Congress would be elected for one year - and barred from ever running again. <br> Since no one would have to worry reelection, they could dive into all the heavy lifting - entitlement reform, deficit reduction, tax policy, and rebuilding our roads and bridges and schools. <br> It's not exactly a new idea - I sort of modeled on the first Congress. Getting reelected was the last thing on those guys' minds. They were worried about being HANGED if it didn't work out. So they put all their chips on the line and went for it. <br> With my new Congress doing the work, what would we do with the old Congress? Well, they'd still be there. We'd just strip them of all power and no longer pay them. <br> With nothing to do, they could devote themselves full-time to what they do best - plotting against one another, dunning people for money, cranking out press releases, issuing declarations, dreaming up excuses, threatening to shut down the government every month or so, and otherwise finding ways to avoid doing anything that actually mattered to anyone but them. <br> Since it would no longer cost us anything, instead of feeling disgust, we might be actually moved to look kindly on them. We might even say, "Now THAT'S entertainment!" 
 Mitt Romney is the least appealing front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination since Herbert Hoover convinced an appropriately skeptical Grand Old Party to renominate him in 1932. <br> Mitt Romney is the least appealing front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination since Herbert Hoover convinced an appropriately skeptical Grand Old Party to renominate him in 1932. <br> And Hoover, for all his faults, was a far more commendable figure than the Bain Capitalist will ever be. <br> Romney has scant personal appeal, as polling and anecdotal evidence confirms on a daily basis. After pondering several options for the most ironically absurd headline of the week, the editors of the satirical newspaper the Onion chose for their current edition: <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/romneymania-sweeps-america,27155/">Romneymania Sweeps America. <br> Romney, pro-choice before he was anti-choice, prohealthcare reform before he was antihealthcare reform, has no ideological appeal to a party of purists. <br> And Romney, now fully identified as the poster boy for crony capitalism, rapacious greed and tax avoidance, has an increasingly limited appeal as a potentially electable Republican nominee in November. As former Florida Governor Charlie Crist said after the former Massachusetts governor won Tuesday night's Florida primary, the Republican fight so far -- and the fight from here on out -- "has to have a negative impact" on party unity and Romney's ultimate prospects. <br> Even with Tuesday night's Florida win, Romney has yet to show that he has what it takes to unify a majority of Republicans behind his candidacy. He has not done that in any of the primary and caucus states that have voted thus far; nor is he anywhere near doing that in national polls. This explains why the candidates who got the majority of Florida votes -- Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul -- will stay in a race where 95 percent of Republican National Convention delegates are still to be chosen. <br> On Tuesday night, Gingrich backers, as enthusiastic as ever, held up signs that read: "46 States to Go!" Promising a "people power" versus "money power" race through the rest of those states, Gingrich portrayed himself as the "conservative alternative" to Romney, "the Massachusetts moderate." <br> Special Section: Election 2012<br><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/romneys-fla-win-inevitability-restored/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Romney's Fla. win: Inevitability restored</span><span class="link">Romney to get Secret Service protection</span> <br> Of the two-thirds of Florida primary voters who told exit pollsters they support the Tea Party movement, 60 percent rejected Romney. Among the almost 70 percent of Florida primary voters who identified as conservatives, the overwhelming majority rejected Romney. Indeed, the frontrunner only beat Gingrich among self-identified conservatives by 4 points. And, among the one-third of Florida primary voters who identified themselves as "very conservative," Gingrich won 43 percent to just 29 percent for Romney. <br> But don't cry for Romney. He may not have much in the way of genuine appeal to the Republican base. <br> What Romney does have is money. Lots of it. More money in campaign accounts and Super PAC cash flows than the rest of the candidates combined. And he is spending it, wildly. Even before todays Florida primary, it was reported that Romney was outspending his closest rival, former House Speaker Gingrich, by roughly $12 million. <br> Specifically, the Romney campaign spent $6.9 million to air commercials on the states broadcast and cable channels as of Monday morning. Romneys Restore Our Future Super PAC spent a reported $8.5 million on the same channels. Total: $15.4 million. <br> For Gingrich, it was $1.6 million in spending by the campaign and $2.2 million by his Winning Our Future Super PAC. Total: $3.8 million. <br> Romney spent unprecedented amounts for a primary, while his opponents did not. That explains Romneys win in Florida, not his modestly more muscular debate performances. Indeed, if the quality of debate performances mattered, Rick Santorum, whose recent appearances have been his strongest, would have won the state. But Santorum did not have the money. Neither, realistically, did Gingrich. And Ron Paul never really played in Florida; having decided weeks ago to place his bets on caucuses in Maine and Nevada. <br> When the final accounting is finished, it is entirely possible that Romney spent more than all the other candidates on the Florida GOP primary ballot. <br> But he did much more than that. Romney spent at historic levels in Florida. <br> Consider this: in 1960, according to the Federal Communication Commission, John Kennedy and Richard Nixon spent a total of $10,052,322 on political commercials during the course of the entire campaign. Romney and his Super PAC overshot that by at least $5 million. <br> Money matters in politics. And it bought Romney a little love. <br> But not a majority. <br> In Florida Tuesday night, Romney was winning 46 percent to 32 percent for Gingrich, 13 percent for Santorum and 7 percent for Paul. <br> So far, Romney has not gotten anywhere near 50 percent of the vote in any caucus or primary state. <br> Indeed, 75 percent of Iowa caucus goers rejected Romney. <br> In New Hampshire, 61 percent of primary voters rejected Romney. <br> In South Carolina, 72 percent of primary voters rejected Romney. <br> And in Florida, after record spending, Romney still was rejected by 53 percent of Republican primary voters. <br> The Romney rejection rate in Florida tells the real story, not just of what happened in the Sunshine state but of where this race is headed. <br> At this point in the race, and with his advantages, Romney should be breaking the 50 percent barrier. In 2000, for instance, George W. Bush hit the 50 percent mark after the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, with a 51 percent finish in Delaware and a 53 percent finish in South Carolina. And Bush maintained majority or near-majority support from there on out. As the partys nominee, Bush won the 2000 electionwith an assist from Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris and family friends on the US Supreme Court. <br> In contrast, in 1996, it took Bob Dole eleven primary and caucuse contests before he broke the 50 percent level. As the Republican nominee, Dole lost, overwhelmingly. <br> Similarly, in 2008, John McCain went through the better part of a dozen caucus and primary states before breaking the 50 percent mark. As the Republican nominee, McCain lost, overwhelmingly. <br> Appealing to the majority of caucus and primary voters early on matters, particularly in Republican races. Unlike the Democrats, who are more familiar as a party with drawn-out nominating processes, the Republicans have to work very hard to pull together a coalition of billionaires and under-employed opponents of abortion rights. They need time to make this happen. <br> So the Florida results provide important indicators regarding the 2012 race. <br> But they weren't the indicators Romney claimed in a "victory" speech that still followed on a contest where most voters opposed him. <br> Referencing exit polls from Florida, Erick Erickson noted that: "Fifty-seven percent of Republican voters said they want a different choice. That does not spell excitement or unity headed into November." <br> Romney is likely to be the Republican candidate against Barack Obama. But, despite a Florida "win," he still cannot present himself as the candidate who a majority of Republicans are willing to accept (however grudgingly) as their nominee. <br> To get there, Romney is going to have to spent a lot more of his money. His SuperPACs are going to have to spend a lot more of their money. And core conservatives are going to have to overcome a lot more of their reservations about the least appealing frontrunner in the modern history of the Republican Party. 
 Though it is distressing to be enduring such a dismal election campaign, it is not unprecedented. As both parties prepare to spend a billion dollars either reelecting a president most Americans do not think deserves to be reelected, or a challenger most of his fellow Republicans dont think can win (and as in most things, the public may well be right on both counts), it is easy to find the whole process discouraging. <br> Though it is distressing to be enduring such a dismal election campaign, it is not unprecedented.

Asset-stripping and the reconfiguration and relaunch of companies isnt industrialism and job-creation like building Microsoft, but it is part of legitimate corporate rationalization, produced strong gains for Romneys investors, and is a more estimable career than that of most politicians. Obama would have made the same points, but Newts gibbering will make excellent fodder for the presidents reelection ads against Romney, and an unseemly swan song for Gingrichs active political career (unless he wants to be the Harold Stassen of the new millennium). <br> Gail Collins of the New York Times is a lively writer and usually the first musket to flame from the undergrowth at each new blip of a Republican non-Mitt in the polls. She referred to the continuing non-Mitts last week as candidates who could not be elected president if they were running against Millard Fillmore. In writing this, she mistakenly implied that she thought Romney could defeat President Fillmore; that Fillmore was a markedly more unsuccessful president than Barack Obama; that she might civilly describe more impressive Republicans; and that Fillmore had ever been elected president or had even been a major-party nominee to that office. <br> Millard Fillmore, a former congressman from western New York State, was elected vice president as the running mate of Gen. Zachary Taylor in 1848. It was one of only two presidential victories for the Whig party among 13 Democratic victories between Jefferson in 1800 and Buchanan in 1856. By 1848, the American house was so divided on the slavery issue that both parties chose nominees to national office who had ambiguous views on the question, like 1990s nominees to the Supreme Court who had no paper trail on abortion. Victorious commanders from the jokey wars of the time (William H. Harrison, Taylor, Lewis Cass, Franklin Pierce, Winfield Scott, John C. Frmont) and dissembling political rous (Martin Van Buren, James K. Polk, Fillmore, William R. King, Buchanan) were favored. More substantial figures such as Henry Clay and Stephen A. Douglas could not hold together a coalition of supporters and opponents of slavery. From the retirement of Andrew Jackson in 1837 to the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in 1861, the only successful president was the astute, slippery, and colorless former Speaker and Americas first dark horse, Polk, who won the Mexican War (adding a million square miles to U.S. territory), settled the northwest frontier with the British and Canadians, and stabilized treasury and tariff matters. <br> Fillmore helped pass the Compromise of 1850 worked up by Clay, Douglas, and Daniel Webster, and sent Commodore Perry to open the ports of Japan. It was a defensible record that may well bear comparison with Obamas, given that this president at the end of this term will have added about $2,000 of debt for every man, woman, and child in the country, in order to wrestle unemployment back to where he found it, while partially disarming America unilaterally and possibly welcoming Iran into the nuclear club. (On past form, Ms. Collins would be just as scathing of the Republicans if the contestants for the nomination were Lincoln, TR, Ike, and Reagan.) <br> The point is we are back to unimpressive candidates waging campaigns that duck the main issues. Obama is cranking up to inflict a class war on the country, with the assistance of the egregious huckster Warren Buffett, Omahas most overworked aphorist and noisiest municipal export since the B-29. The prospect is too much even for William Daley, outgoing White House chief of staff and scion of a family that has brought political chicanery and skullduggery in Chicago to the verge of immaculate corruption. <br> Of course there have been other candidate droughts in the past. Most contestants for national office between Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt were estimable Civil War generals who were unambitious, prudent presidents who let America be America. Immigrants poured into the United States, commerce boomed, and what was already the worlds largest national economy put up staggering rates of GDP and productivity growth (i.e., a rate of about 8.5 percent economic growth in the 1880s). Innovative and imaginative presidents need not have applied, and didnt. <br> Having defeated Woodrow Wilsons attempt to bring America into the world and make it safe for democracy, and, through Prohibition, having handed one of Americas largest industries (alcoholic beverages) to the underworld, the Republicans allowed the growth of such a gigantic speculative bubble, especially in equity values, that when the bust came, a system that did not guarantee bank deposits and had no direct relief for the unemployed could not withstand it. <br> And in foreign affairs, the great vision of international organizations and collective security having been dismissively rejected, much was made of mindless naval disarmament (that greatly advantaged our subsequent enemies) and the harebrained Kellogg-Briand Pact that purported to outlaw war. Then as now, the reward for such vapid posturing was the Nobel Peace Prize, and Frank Kelloggs was as dubiously earned as have been those given to Jimmy Carter, Al Gore, and Barack Obama. In foreign as in domestic matters, the price of poor and evasively procrastinating government proved to be desperately steep when the reckoning came. <br> America, though still the worlds greatest country, is in decline and retreat. Some of that may be prudent retrenchment, but it is overcommitted to the fraud of the service-industry economy that adds no value, and so conventional economic recovery wont be enough. America has shot the spending bolt for inducing traditional economic recovery. And the administration is shrinking defense spending, the best form of economic stimulus, instead of reforming entitlements. It is chasing votes with a tawdry fable of redistribution. And the presumptive challenger came late and half-heartedly to tax simplification and is dancing around entitlement reform like a flame-seeking moth, without alighting on it. <br> Public education is in shambles; medical care is a feast for two-thirds and a famine for the rest. American lawyers are a steroid-bloated cartel and criminal justice is presided over by a judiciary that has been preening itself while the Bill of Rights has been shredded by the prosecutocracy. The financial industry is in a pale of disgrace as profound and richly deserved as the contempt almost uniformly attached to the political class. Everyone believes in the Constitution, but it isnt working very well and none of the candidates is seriously addressing these points. <br> Mitt Romney would be among the most improbable saviors any important country ever sent for. But he may now be all that stands in the way of an accelerating descent into nether regions. Certainly, the United States will revive and go on to great things. But while awaiting the gladsome day of that relaunch, it may be advisable to defy the national medias ostentatious atheism and recognize the truth of the last czars last prime minister that it is time to pray. Voting seems not to be working. 
 America's more or less free-market capitalism is not under threat from Marxist-Leninism: That system's demonstrated failures have consigned it to the ash-heap of history. Nor is it under threat from China's system of managed economy plus political repression: We can't even abide police breaking up a disease-infested occupy-something-or-other encampment. It is not even under threat from socialism, the hysterical charges of some anti-Obama extremists notwithstanding. <br> America's more or less free-market capitalism is not under threat from Marxist-Leninism: That system's demonstrated failures have consigned it to the ash-heap of history.

It is not even under threat from socialism, the hysterical charges of some anti-Obama extremists notwithstanding. <br> Which is what makes the behavior of the leaders of our financial sector so inexplicable. Start with a few widely agreed facts. The financial sector does not have a recent history of which it can be proud. Investment banks bet their own money that the mortgage bubble would burst while at the same time advising their clients to buy mortgage-backed securities. Managers of our largest banks took on risks they did not understand, safe in the knowledge that they were too big to fail--that the government would have no choice but to bail them out in order to avoid a cataclysm, or at least a deep recession. Compensation was decoupled from performance, with failed executives tottering off onto their country clubs' golf courses after pocketing multimillion-dollar bonuses and being awarded the use of company jets and office facilities. <br> Some idea of the mindset of the leaders of the financial community can be gleaned from their response to criticism. Lloyd Blankfein, head of Goldman Sachs, claimed to be doing "God's work," a linking of God and Mammon that might have come as a surprise to the Lord. Charles "Chuck" Prince III, soon to be defrocked as CEO of Citigroup and sent packing with multimillions in payoffs, pensions, and perks after a reported $64 billion decline in the value of the bank over which he presided, explained the intellectually demanding risk analysis techniques he applied in his work: "When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing." So were the passengers on the Titanic when it hit that iceberg. <br> Meanwhile, income inequality increased. We are not sure of all the reasons for this development, but we do know that it is in part because globalization brought millions of dollar-a-day workers into the international economy to compete with American workers; in part because the premium for skills and training was rising as the political class ceded control of the American education system to dirigiste teachers' unions that prevented needed adaptations to the new world; and in part because money talks in the rooms in which the tax code is twisted to the advantage of special interests. Worse, mobility fell, creating an atmosphere ripe for an embattled president to declare class war rather than take on entrenched interests, i.e., unions fighting to prevent entry into trades and to preserve extortionate pensions; bankers willing to pour millions into Obama's campaign coffers in return for prestigious photo-ops and appointments to meaningless committees; billionaires pressing him to increase taxes on families with relatively modest incomes while their capital gains and deal-generated profits receive gentler treatment at the hands of the tax collector. <br> None of these ills seems curable in the face of entrenched opposition by members of the financial and business communities, and other interest groups. The Democrats quite predictably defend the trade unions that fund them, and what they see as the disadvantaged, never mind that that group now includes wealthy older people who would be offended if their Social Security and medical benefits were reduced a trifle by means testing. The Republicans see no reason why the very, very wealthy should have their tax burden increased a bit, their corporate clients should lose their special tax benefits, or the lucky winners of the gene lottery should pay higher taxes on their inheritances. The result of this crony capitalism--each party with its own cronies--is a lack of radicalism, a you-don't-gore-my-ox-and-I-won't-touch-your-sacred-cow system. <br> Enough whining. As Lenin asked, "What is to be done?" Voter action at the polls is clearly indicated, although the appalling lack of choice--a Democrat wedded to the economics of the past, and either a clearly nutty or a cautious, establishment Republican technocrat--suggests that the radical change the moment calls for will not come from the political class, at least until the young Turks in the Republican party mature while, we hope, remaining, well, young Turks. So what is to be done is what can be done--remove some of the most glaring defects in the capitalist system, starting with the financial sector. That will take conservative support for change--support not only from the conservative punditry, but from the business community. <br> Recall: The titans of finance are not well positioned to display a lack of sympathy for those suffering from the consequences of their errors. They still hold their jobs only because the taxpayers bailed them out, with the Fed providing $1.2 trillion of public money on top of other bailout funds, the alternative--watching the financial system melt down--being too gruesome to contemplate. No good saying that without Wall Street there would be no Main Street. The facts are that Main Street is littered with shuttered shops, while appallingly managed banks have survived, and that the foreclosure rate in Greenwich, Connecticut, the preferred home of hedge fund managers and those financial executives who prefer sweeping lawns to the sweeping penthouse views favored by some of their colleagues, is far below the national average. <br> Yet, pick up your daily paper for the sort of anecdotes that sometimes trump data. Bank of America hires a debt collection agency that a Florida judge finds illegally harasses widows to pay the credit-card debts of their deceased husbands. Here is part of the report in the Wall Street Journal: <br> Bank of America and other major U.S. lenders hand over accounts of the deceased to firms specializing in death-debt collection. The collection firms then zero in on family members who they think might agree to pay some of what the dead person owed even though they have no legal obligation to do so . . . duping relatives into thinking they have to pay the debts of the deceased. <br> One anecdote should not be the basis of policy. But such an anecdote backed by numerous tales of homeowners who failed in their attempts to negotiate easier terms so as to avoid foreclosure tells something about the insensitivity of leading bankers to the threat posed to the capitalist system by the difficulties faced by millions of Americans. These bankers might do well to cast an eye over the magazine rack of their local newsstand, where Consumer Reports's cover blares, "Fight Back Against Your Bank." We're not talking the Nation or the New Republic here, but the stuff which middle-class America reads. <br> Sure, it is easy to say people should never have bought homes they cannot afford. But many of these people could indeed afford those homes in the opinion of the banks that lent them the money, before securitizing their mortgages into bundles that the rating agencies saw as virtually riskless--triple-A rated--and passing them off to investors. Many were simply the victims of a financial calamity they did not produce, others of globalization and inept trade policy that allowed China's currency manipulators to destroy their jobs, still others of government programs that lured them into buying homes that would prove beyond their means, especially when the low, starter-interest rates willingly offered by the banks ratcheted up. <br> The odd part of the banks' preference for foreclosure over mortgage restructuring is that they end up with houses they cannot manage and lawns they cannot mow, properties that become rundown with dire consequences for entire blocks and neighborhoods, and that end up being sold for a fraction of their value. True, foreclosure does avoid moral hazard, an advantage not to be ignored. But that advantage has to be weighed against the costs of a wave of foreclosures. I wonder if those bankers, with the wisdom of hindsight, would have preferred a bit of moral hazard to the failure of Lehman Brothers. Most important is the failure of the bankers to ask themselves what sort of policy towards foreclosures is consistent with the long-term acceptability and survival of American capitalism. And the failure of Republican politicians to ask themselves just why they support banks' opposition to allowing bankruptcy judges to include mortgage obligations when they restructure the debts of those seeking bankruptcy protection, as many Democrats propose. Executives of American Airlines are applauded by the financial community for their shrewd use of the bankruptcy laws to get out from under their contractual obligations. Homeowners who do the same thing are considered immoral. <br> Most surprising are the objections of leaders of the banking community to quite sensible reforms, their willingness to sacrifice long-term support for the market system to the desire for short-term profits. It is true, for example, that higher capital requirements for banks, requirements that "don't go nearly far enough" according to John Cochrane, finance professor at the University of Chicago, will reduce their profits. That is so--but only because requiring banks to hold more capital reduces the risk of failure or the need for bailouts, risks that have until now been borne by taxpayers. <br> Also difficult to understand is their failure to comprehend that some practices, such as imposing retroactive increases in interest rates on bank credit cards, are deeply objectionable to consumers, even if technically justifiable. And their failure to realize that large bonuses at a time when 25 million Americans can't find any or enough work are an excess they might want to forgo in the interests of maintaining support for the system that has been kind to them--including bailing them out when they hit the rocks. One investment bank warned its highflyers not to be seen in Porsche showrooms, so it's not as if these bonus recipients are unaware that something potentially unpleasant is brewing out there in the world beyond their office towers. <br> Bankers are not alone in their failure to understand that something must be done to prevent the opposition to many features of the current system from creating an atmosphere that will support "reforms" so draconian that the resulting system will retain few of the virtues of the existing one. The corpocracy at times seems equally obtuse, as when its leaders call for repeal of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley law that make it easier for shareholders to rid themselves of underperforming directors, and require that directors be truly independent, rather than chums of the CEO, especially when serving on compensation committees. The breaking of the link between performance and reward that results from friends-of-the-CEO boards of directors does as much to undermine capitalism's claim to legitimacy as financiers' obtuseness about their responsibility to act as if they are members of a society that extends beyond executive dining rooms and country clubs. <br> I am not one who sees in the Occupiers the wave of the future. They are not the real worry to those of us who fear for the future of market capitalism in America. It is the failure of the major beneficiaries of the capitalist system to understand that openness to reform, combined with a bit of restraint when carving up the huge pie that capitalism is capable of producing, is the best way to head off those people who would alter market capitalism beyond recognition by imposing punitive taxes, onerous regulations, investment-distorting subsidies, along with a bloated government. Those folks are dangerous enough to America's future prosperity without being handed the gift of obtuse opposition to needed change. 
 Usually at years end, were supposed to look back at events just passed -- and forward, in prediction mode, to the year to come. But just look around you! This moment is so extraordinary that it has hardly registered. People in thousands of communities across the United States and elsewhere are living in public, experimenting with direct democracy, calling things by their true names, and obliging the media and politicians to do the same. <br> Usually at years end, were supposed to look back at events just passed -- and forward, in prediction mode, to the year to come. But just look around you! This moment is so extraordinary that it has hardly registered. People in thousands of communities across the United States and elsewhere are living in public, experimenting with direct democracy, calling things by their true names, and obliging the media and politicians to do the same. <br> The photo of the two of them offers just a peek into a single moment in the remarkable period were living through and the astonishing movement thats drawn in well, if not 99% of us, then a striking enough percentage: everyone from teen pop superstar Miley Cyrus with her Occupy-homage video to Alaska Yupik elder Esther Green ice-fishing and holding a sign that says Yirqa Kuik</em> in big letters, with the translation -- occupy the river -- in little ones below. <br> The woman with the stolen-votes sign is referring to them. Her companion is talking about us, all of us, and our fundamental principles. His sign comes straight out of Genesis, a denial of what that competitive entrepreneur Cain said to God after foreclosing on his brother Abels life. He was not, he claimed, his brothers keeper; we are not, he insisted, beholden to each other, but separate, isolated, each of us for ourselves. <br> Think of Cain as the first Social Darwinist and this Occupier in Austin as his opposite, claiming, no, our operating system should be love; we are all connected; we must take care of each other. And this movement, hes saying, is about what the Argentinian uprising that began a decade ago, on December 19, 2001, called politica afectiva, the politics of affection. <br> If its a movement about love, its also about the money they so unjustly took, and continue to take, from us -- and about the fact that, right now, money and love are at war with each other. After all, in the American heartland, people are beginning to be imprisoned for debt, while the Occupy movement is arguing for debt forgiveness, renegotiation, and debt jubilees. <br> Sometimes love, or at least decency, wins. One morning late last month, 75-year-old Josephine Tolbert, who ran a daycare center from her modest San Francisco home, returned after dropping a child off at school only to find that she and the other children were locked out because she was behind in her mortgage payments. True Compass LLC, who bought her place in a short sale while she thought she was still negotiating with Bank of America, would not allow her back into her home of almost four decades, even to get her medicines or diapers for the children. <br> We demonstrated at her home and at True Compasss shabby offices while they hid within, and students from Occupy San Francisco State University demonstrated outside a True Compass-owned restaurant on behalf of this African-American grandmother. Thanks to this solidarity and the media attention it garnered, Tolbert has collected her keys, moved back in, and is renegotiating the terms of her mortgage. <br> If whats been happening locally and globally has some of the characteristics of an uprising, then there has never been one quite so pervasive -- from the scientists holding an Occupy sign in Antarctica to Occupy presences in places as far-flung as New Zealand and Australia, So Paulo, Frankfurt, London, Toronto, Los Angeles, and Reykjavik. And dont forget the tiniest places, either. The other morning at the Oakland docks for the West Coast port shutdown demonstrations, I met three members of Occupy Amador County, a small rural area in Californias Sierra Nevada. Its largest town, Jackson, has a little over 4,000 inhabitants, which hasnt stopped it from having regular outdoor Friday evening Occupy meetings. <br> A little girl in a red parka at the Oakland docks was carrying a sign with a quote from blind-deaf-and-articulate early twentieth-century role model Helen Keller that said, The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt within the heart. Why quote Keller at a demonstration focused on labor and economics? The answer is clear enough: because Occupy has some of the emotional resonance of a spiritual, as well as a political, movement. Like those other upheavals its aligned with in Spain, Greece, Iceland (where theyre actually jailing bankers), Britain, Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, Libya, Chile, and most recently Russia, it wants to ask basic questions: What matters? Who matters? Who decides? On what principles? &nbsp; <br> Stop for a moment and consider just how unforeseen and unforeseeable all of this was when, on December 17, 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian vegetable vendor in Sidi Bouzid, an out-of-the-way, impoverished city, immolated himself. He was protesting the dead-end life that the 1% economy run by Tunisias autocratic ruler Zine Ben Ali and his corrupt family allotted him, and the police brutality that went with it, two things that have remained front and center ever since. Above all, as his mother has since testified, he was for human dignity, for a world, that is, where the primary system of value is not money. <br> Compassion is our new currency, was the message scrawled on a pizza-box lid at Occupy Wall Street in Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan -- held by a pensive-looking young man in Jeremy Ayerss great photo portrait. But what can you buy with compassion? <br> Quite a lot, it turns out, including a global movement, and even pizza, which can arrive at that movements campground as a gift of solidarity. A few days into Occupy Wall Streets surprise success, a call for pizza went out and $2,600 in pizzas came in within an hour, just as earlier this year the occupiers of Wisconsins state house had been copiously supplied with pizza -- including pies paid for and dispatched by Egyptian revolutionaries. <br> The Return of the disappeared <br> During the 1970s and 1980s dictatorship and death-squad era in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Central America, the term the disappeared came to cover those who were kidnapped, held in secret, tortured, and then often executed in secret. So many decades later, their fates are often still being deciphered. <br> In the United States, the disappeared also exist, not thanks to a brutal army or paramilitaries, but to a brutal economy. When you lose your job, you vanish from the workplace and sooner or later arrive at emptiness in your day, your identity, your wallet, your ability to participate in a commercial society. When you lose your home, you disappear from familiar spaces: the block, the neighborhood, the rolls of homeowners.&nbsp; Often, you vanish in shame, leaving behind friends and acquaintances. <br> At the actions to support some of the 1,500 mostly African-American homeowners being foreclosed upon in southeastern San Francisco, several of them described how they had to overcome a powerful sense of shame simply to speak up, no less defend themselves or join this movement. In the U.S., failure is always supposed to be individual, not systemic, and so it tends to produce a sense of personal devastation that leaves its victims feeling alone and lying low, even though they are among legions of others. <br> The people who destroyed our economy through their bottomless greed are, on the other hand, shameless -- as shameless as the CEOs whose compensation shot up 36% in 2010, during this deep and grinding recession. Compassion is definitely not their currency. <br> The word occupy itself speaks powerfully to the American disappeared and the very idea of disappearance. It speaks to those who have lost their occupation or the home they occupied. In its many meanings, its a big tent. It means to fill a space, take possession of it, employ oneself, busy oneself, fill time. (In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the verb had a meaning so sexual it fell out of common use.) It describes the state of being present that the Occupy movements General Assemblies and tent camps have lived out, a space in which -- as Mohamed Bouazizi might have dreamed it -- the disappeared can reappear with dignity. <br> Occupy has also created a space in which people of all kinds can coexist, from the homeless to the tenured, from the inner city to the agrarian. Coexisting in public with likeminded strangers and acquaintances is one of the great foundations and experiences of democracy, which is why dictatorships ban gatherings and groups -- and why our First Amendment guarantee of the right of the people peaceably to assemble is being tested more strongly today than in any recent moment in American history. Nearly every Occupy has at its center regular meetings of a General Assembly. These are experiments in direct democracy that have been messy, exasperating and miraculous: arenas in which everyone is invited to be heard, to have a voice, to be a member, to shape the future. Occupy is first of all a conversation among ourselves. <br> To occupy also means to show up, to be present -- a radically unplugged experience for a digital generation. Today, the term is being applied to any place where one plans to be present, geographically or metaphorically: Occupy Wall Street, occupy the food system, occupy your heart. The ad hoc invention of the peoples mic by the occupiers of Zuccotti Park, which requires everyone to listen, repeat, and amplify whats being said, has only strengthened this sense of presence. You cant text or half-listen if your task is to repeat everything, so that everyone hears and understands. You become the keeper of your brothers or sisters voice as you repeat their words. <br> Its a triumph of the here and now -- and its everywhere: the Regents of the University of California are mic-checked, politicians are mic-checked, the Durban Climate Conference in South Africa had occupiers and mic-check moments. Activism had long been in dire need of new modes of doing things, and this year it got them. <br> A mouthful of truth <br> Before the Occupy movement arrived on the scene, political dialogue and media chatter in this country seemed to be arriving from a warped parallel universe. Tiny government expenditures were denounced, while the vortex sucking our economy dry was rarely addressed; hard-working immigrants were portrayed as deadbeats; people who did nothing were anointed as job creators; the trashed economy and massive suffering were overlooked, while politicians jousted over (and pundits pontificated about) the deficit; class war was only called class war when someone other than the ruling class waged it. Its as though we were trying to navigate Las Vegas with a tattered map of medieval Byzantium -- via, that is, a broken language in which everything and everyone got lost. <br> Then Occupy arrived and, as if swept by some strange pandemic, a contagious virus of truth-telling, everyone was suddenly obliged to call things by their real names and talk about actual problems. The blather about the deficit was replaced by acknowledgments of grotesque economic inequality. Greed was called greed, and once it had its true name, it became intolerable, as had racism when the Civil Rights Movement named it and made it evident to those who werent suffering from it directly. The vast scale of suffering around student debt and tuition hikes, foreclosures, unemployment, wage stagnation, medical costs, and the other afflictions of the normal American suddenly moved to the top of the news, and once exposed to the light, these, too, became intolerable. <br> If the solutions to the nightmares being named are neither near nor easy, naming things, describing reality with some accuracy, is at least a crucial first step. Informing ourselves as citizens is another. Aspects of our not-quite-democracy that were once almost invisible are now on the table for discussion -- and for opposition, notably corporate personhood, the legal status that gives corporations the rights, but not the obligations and vulnerabilities, of citizens. (One oft-repeated Occupier sign says, Ill believe corporations are people when Texas puts one to death.) <br> The Los Angeles City Council passed a measure calling for an end to corporate personhood, the first big city to join the Move to Amend campaign against corporate personhood and against the 2009 Supreme Court Citizens United ruling that gave corporations unlimited ability to insert their cash in our political campaigns. Occupy actions across the country are planned for January 20th, the second anniversary of Citizens United. Vermonts independent Senator Bernie Sanders, whos been speaking the truth alone for a long time, introduced a constitutional amendment to repeal Citizens United and limit corporate power in the Senate, while Congressman Ted Deutch (D-FL) introduced a similar measure in the House. <br> Only a few years ago, hardly anyone knew what corporate personhood was. Now, signs denouncing it are common. Similarly, at Occupy events, people make it clear that they know about the New Deal-era financial reform measure known as the Glass-Steagall Act, which was partially repealed in 1999, removing the wall between commercial and investment banks; that they know about the proposed financial transfer tax, nicknamed the Robin Hood Tax, that would raise billions with a tiny levy on every financial transaction; that they understand many of the means by which the 1% were enriched and the rest of us robbed. <br> This represents a striking learning curve. A new language of truth, debate about what actually matters, an informed citizenry: thats no small thing. But we need more. <br> We ae the 99.999% <br> I was myself so caught up in the Occupy movement that I stopped paying my usual attention to the war over the climate -- until I was brought up short by the catastrophic failure of the climate negotiations in Durban, South Africa. There, earlier this month, the most powerful and carbon-polluting countries managed to avoid taking any timely and substantial measures to keep the climate from heating up and the Earth from slipping into unstoppable chaotic change. &nbsp; <br> Its our nature to be more compelled by immediate human suffering than by remote systemic problems. Only this problem isnt anywhere near as remote as many Americans imagine. Its already creating human suffering on a large scale and will create far more. Many of the food crises of the past decade are tied to climate change, and in Africa thousands are dying of climate-related chaos. The floods, fires, storms, and heat waves of the past few years are climate change coming to call earlier than expected in the U.S. <br> In the most immediate sense, Occupy may have weakened the climate movement by focusing many of us on the urgent suffering of our brothers, our neighbors, our democracy. In the end, however, it could strengthen that movement with its new tactics, alliances, spirit, and language of truth. After all, why have we been unable to make the major changes required to limit greenhouse gases in the atmosphere? The answer is a word suddenly in wide circulation: greed. Responding adequately to this crisis would benefit every living thing. When it comes to climate change, after all, we are the 99.999%. <br> But the international .001% who profit immeasurably from the carbon economy -- the oil and coal tycoons, industrialists, and politicians whose strings they pull -- are against this change. For decades, theyve managed to propagandize many Americans, in and out of government, into climate denial, spreading lies about the science and economics of climate change, and undermining any possible legislation and international negotiations to ameliorate it. And if you think the eviction of elderly homeowners is brutal, think of it as a tiny foreshadowing of the displacement and disappearance of people, communities, nations, species, habitats. Climate change threatens to foreclose on all of us. <br> The groups working on climate change now, notably 350.org and Tar Sands Action, have done astonishing things already. Most recently, with the help of native Canadians, local activists, and alternative media, they very nearly managed to kill the single scariest and biggest North American threat to the climate: the tar sands pipeline that would go from Canada to Texas. Its been a remarkable show of organizing power and popular will. Occupy the Climate may need to come next. <br> Maybe Occupy Wall Street and its thousands of spin-offs have built the foundation for it. But perhaps the greatest gift that it and the other movements of 2011 have given us is a sharpening of our perceptions -- and our conflicts. So much more is out in the open now, including the greed, the brutality with which entities from the Egyptian army to the Oakland police impose the will of rulers, and most of all the deep generosity of spirit that is behind, within, and around these insurgencies and their activists. None of these movements is perfect, and individuals within them are not always the greatest keepers of their brothers and sisters. But one thing couldnt be clearer: compassion is our new currency. <br> Nothing has been more moving to me than this desire, realized imperfectly but repeatedly, to connect across differences, to be a community, to make a better world, to embrace each other. This desire is what lies behind those messy camps, those raucous demonstrations, those cardboard signs and long conversations. Young activists have spoken to me about the extraordinary richness of their experiences at Occupy, and they call it love. <br> In the spirit of calling things by their true names, let me summon up the description that Ella Baker and Martin Luther King used for the great communities of activists who stood up for civil rights half a century ago: the beloved community. Many who were active then never forgot the deep bonds and deep meaning they found in that struggle. We -- and the word we encompasses more of us than ever before -- have found those things, too, and this year we have come close to something unprecedented, a beloved community that circles the globe. 
 Jon Corzine's testimony before the House agriculture committee may mark the definitive end to the Democratic party's love affair with Wall Street. <br> Jon Corzine's testimony before the House agriculture committee may mark the definitive end to the Democratic party's love affair with Wall Street. <br> Once upon a time, Wall Street bankers were Republicans. Not terribly ideological, they preferred whenever possible a minimum of taxation, regulation, and government in general, but they didn't make a fetish of it. As the GOP moved right starting in the mid-1960s the east coast Republican establishment began to crumble, and by the late 1980s it was mostly gone. These silk stocking conservatives had been driven out of the Republican party by asocial agenda that frightened them, abudget deficit that threatened their livelihoods, and a base that increasinglyviewed moderates as RINOs ("Republicans In Name Only"). <br> By theearly 1990sWall Street wasready togo Democratic. In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307959759/ref=rdr_ext_tmb">Back To Work</em>, former President Bill Clinton writes, <br> In crafting his first budget bill, Clinton was mindful of the bond market to such a degree that James Carville famously complained, "I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope or as a .400 basball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody." <br> The Wall Street-Democratic Party love affair came out of the shadows andinto the sunlightwhen Robert Rubin,former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs,became Treasury secretary. The economy was booming, the budget deficit was disappearing, and all was right with the world. The romancedeepened through most of the aughts, so much so that in 2010 Rich Lowry of National Review <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/229614/wall-street-democrats/rich-lowry">complained, "the Democratic majority was bought and paid for by Wall Street and corporate money." In 2008 the finance sector actually gave more to the Democrats than to the Republicans, something that hadn't happened since 1990. <br> It all started to come apartin the late aughts asDemocratsrealizedthat Rubin's distaste for financial regulation (and that of his deputy and successor, Larry Summers, which was more pronounced) had contributed to the 2008 financial meltdown,in partbecause Rubin and Summers had outmaneuvered Brooksley Born, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, when she wanted to regulate derivatives. Summers (who wasn't from Wall Street but was a Rubin acolyte)became director of the National Economic Council during President Barack Obama's first two years in office and the economy floundered. That deepened the alienation between Democrats and Wall Street. <br> Passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law drove thelovebirds further apart as Wall Streetenlisted Republican goonsfirst to weaken the bill (and succeeded in many instances) and then to neuter it bypressuring federal agencies to write regulations that created as little accountability as possible. <br> Protesters occupied Wall Street. <br> President Obama called bankers "fat cats." <br> Leon Cooperman, a Goldman Sachs veteran who now runs a hedge fund, circulated a whiny letter complaining about Obama's "divisive, polarizing tone" that went viral. <br> Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), a reliable Wall Street champion for years, voted for Dodd-Frank, and just last week Schumer announced that income inequality will be the Democrats' central issue for 2012. <br> And now Jon Corzine, a former Goldman Sachs CEO, Democratic senator, and Democratic governor, is testifying before the House Agriculture committee about the collapse of MF Global and the disappearance of $1.2 billion in customer funds. The House is Republican, of course, but committee Democrats and Republicans alike are asking, in various ways, "How the hell can you not know where the money went?" <br> The love affair is over. 
 What was Fox News to do when Barack Obama went to Kansas and delivered a speech that echoed the "New Nationalism" address Teddy Roosevelt used to renew and redefine his political prospects? Obama's oratory was not quite as radical as that of the former Republican president, but it was close enough is spirit and content to create concerns on the part of Fox commentators that the current president might be tapping into the rich vein of American progressive populism that actually moves the masses. <br> What was Fox News to do when Barack Obama went to Kansas and delivered a speech that echoed the "New Nationalism" address Teddy Roosevelt used to renew and redefine his political prospects? Obama's oratory was not quite as radical as that of the former Republican president, but it was close enough is spirit and content to create concerns on the part of Fox commentators that the current president might be tapping into the rich vein of American progressive populism that actually moves the masses. <br> Obama had the quote right. And he had the history right. <br> What was Fox to do? <br> No problem. They dismissed Teddy Roosevelt as a socialist. <br> Once the details of Obamas speechone of the most effective and well-received of his presidencywere made available, Fox News political editor Chris Stirewelt explained: What Teddy Roosevelt was calling for was a sort of a socialistic nationalism, in which the government would take things away from people who got things that he didnt think they should have [and] give it to the working man. They talk about the square deal, fairness, all of these new mandates for governmentsomething the Republican Party has walked away from in very decided fashion certainly since the Reagan era in terms of what the role and purpose of government is. This is Obama embracing a Republican icon of a bygone era. <br> Fox host Megyn Kelly picked up on the theme: Teddy Roosevelt was calling for something akin to a socialist nationalism. Why would President Obama want to do anything that would associate himself with that word socialist which has been used against him by so many of the Republican presidential candidates, among others. <br> Yes, Stirewelt responded, I think the biggest thing [Obama] is trying to do is shame the Republicans. Hes trying to say: Look, one of your own, a great hero of yours thats on Mount Rushmore, he was a socialist. He called for this sort of socialist nationalism. Why are you people not being like him? Why are you not following in his footsteps?&thinsp; <br> Obviously, continued Stirewelt, this is not an unalloyed good thing for the president to line up with this sort of progressivism, and this sort of liberalism and socialism that has become so much maligned and so much disliked in the modern American political discourse. <br> On Fox Business News, the discussion turned to a claim that <a href="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201112070003">were seeing the return of socialism combined with nationalsm. <br> So Roosevelt was socialistic, and Obama is adopting socialist nationalism by borrowing a page from the Republican commander-in-chief whom the most recent Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, hailed as his heroas have Republican nominees in every election since the former presidents passing in 1920. <br> The notion that the Republican Roosevelt was a socialist would have come as news to the old Rough Riderand to the socialist stalwarts of his time. <br> When Roosevelt ran for the presidency in 1904 (as a Republican incumbent) and again in 1912 (as the leader of the renegade Republicans who formed the Progressive Bull Moose Party), he faced determined opposition from Socialist Party nominees. Indeed, the 1912 campaign saw Eugene Victor Debs win the highest portion of the vote ever accorded to a Socialist candidate: 6 percent. <br> Roosevelt, in his New Nationalism speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, did outline an agenda that supported the establishment of programs like Social Security and Medicare, protections against discrimination, union rights and expanded democracy. In effect, he was arguing for what, under his fifth cousin, Franklin, would come to be known as the New Deal. <br> Some of those proposals were promoted by the Socialist Party in the early years of the twentieth century, which certainly made arguments in its platforms for safety-net programs. But so, too, did moderate Republicans and Democrats. After the Gilded Age of robber barons and corporate monopolies, there was mainstream support for tempering the excesses of laissez faire capitalism. They werent proposing socialism in any form that Karl Marx might recognize but they were arguing for fairness and responsibility. <br> We grudge no man a fortune in civil life if it is honorably obtained and well used, Roosevelt said in 1910. However, recalling the language of the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, Roosevelt added, It is not even enough that it should have gained without doing damage to the community. We should permit it to be gained only so long as the gaining represents benefit to the community. <br> Thats hardly a radical notion. It simply says that the accumulation of great wealth ought not come at the expense of society. Or, as Obama explained in Osawatomie, Now, just as there was in Teddy Roosevelts time, theres been a certain crowd in Washington for the last few decades who respond to this economic challenge with the same old tune. The market will take care of everything, they tell us. If only we cut more regulations and cut more taxesespecially for the wealthyour economy will grow stronger. Sure, there will be winners and losers. But if the winners do really well, jobs and prosperity will eventually trickle down to everyone else. And even if prosperity doesnt trickle down, they argue, thats the price of liberty. Its a simple theoryone that speaks to our rugged individualism and healthy skepticism of too much government. It fits well on a bumper sticker. Heres the problem: it doesnt work. Its never worked. <br> This is not some grand redistributionist scheme. It is economic realism. It is the vision of responsible wealth that was broadly accepted by Main Street Republicans until the advocates for a new Gilded Age bought themselves a Tea Party movement. <br> Roosevelt spoke for Main Street when he said 111 years ago: The essence of any struggle for healthy liberty has always been, and must always be, to take from some one man or class of men the right to enjoy power, or wealth, or position, or immunity, which has not been earned by service to his or their fellows. That is what you fought for in the Civil War, and that is what we strive for now. <br> Barack Obama is echoing that line, speaking a bit more softly and carrying a bit less of a big stick than Teddy Roosevelt.

 After staging elections last November, Myanmar has begun to release political prisoners and work with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. That has earned political rewards, such as Clinton's visit starting late Wednesday, the first by the top U.S. diplomat in 56 years. <br> But the new government, still dominated by the military, has scarcely begun to fix the mistakes made since it took power in 1962, and fighting between the army and ethnic minorities who want more autonomy has intensified since the elections. <br> While Myanmar's nascent political reforms hold promise, economic changes will be just as important to arrest the decline of what was one of Southeast Asia's most prosperous countries but now rated on a key U.N. index as the region's least developed. <br> The military began opening the economy in the 1990s, after the 26-year socialist rule of the late dictator Ne Win, but the investment it has attracted has mostly been for its own benefit including to build a remote and opulent new capital city where the government relocated to in 2005. <br> Ne Win's eccentricities extended to issuing currency notes divisible by the supposedly auspicious number nine, and Myanmar retains a Byzantine exchange rate system. The official rate of the kyat currency is about 12,000 percent over market value. <br> That has helped a kleptocracy to flourish. By accounting exports of natural gas and other resources at that rate which is largely ignored in day-to-day transactions the government is believed to have underreported billions of dollars in revenues. <br> In the past two years, the government has accelerated its privatization of state enterprises and assets, but liberalization has not translated into a level playing field. Buyers of key holdings have been military-run corporations and government cronies. <br> Transparency International, a Germany-based private group that campaigns against corruption, ranked Myanmar 176 out of 178 countries in its 2010 global index on graft equal with Afghanistan and one place above last-placed, lawless Somalia. <br> In his inaugural speech in March, President Thein Sein, promised tax and financial reforms to promote small and medium-size enterprises and to narrow the gap between rich and poor. <br> There has been little substantive change so far, but a team of International Monetary Fund advisers visited in November, to discuss plans to unify the exchange rate regime and lift restrictions on current international payments and transfers. A follow-up mission is expected early next year. <br> Sean Turnell, an expert on Myanmar's economy at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, said adopting the market exchange rate as the sole rate would have profound implications for the country by making the foreign exchange earnings of state-owned enterprises transparent. <br> "It is not just a technical issue, but could be seen as a fundamental reform of the country's political economy," he said. <br> Implementing such reforms would be a complex business and would likely require support from international financial institutions, currently blocked by Western sanctions. <br> But solving Myanmar's economic problems could pale next to the challenge of its ethnic conflicts. <br> Minorities scattered around Myanmar's western, northern and eastern frontiers make up nearly one-third of the 55 million people. Various splinter groups representing an array of ethnicities the Karen, Shan, Kachin, Mon, Chin, Arakanese, Wa, Karenni, Paluang, Pa-O and Lahu have all taken up arms at some point. <br> Some of the rebellions have endured even longer than military rule. Some the groups have reached cease-fires with the military, but none have won political power. <br> Last year's elections offered a glimmer of hope. Myanmar now has local assemblies, and ethnic parties are represented in them and to a small degree in the federal parliament. <br> But a ham-fisted attempt to get ethnic armies to become government-led border guards led to the collapse this year of long-standing cease-fires with two key groups, the Shan State Army-North and the Kachin Independence Army. The fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people. Clashes continue in Kachin State in the country's far north. <br> That has compounded a humanitarian blight that has sent 140,000 minority refugees into neighboring Thailand since the 1980s and uprooted many more. Reports of horrific military abuses the burning of villages, rape by soldiers and using civilians as minesweepers have seeped out of the isolated country's borders for years, and fueled calls for a U.N.-backed commission to investigate possible war crimes. <br> Frustrated by the government's failure to offer serious negotiations, a number of the traditionally fractious armed groups this summer formed a coalition to strengthen their hand. <br> Ahead of Clinton's visit, a government delegation held peace talks with representatives from five armed groups, including the once-powerful Karen National Union and the Shane State Army-South. <br> Whether they will lead anywhere remains to be seen. Previous talks and cease-fires have foundered, and the military would be reluctant to grant the autonomy within a federation the minorities want. 
 Senior officials dont define administrations; presidents do, by making the strategic decisions that reshape events. For the latest confirmation of this age-old truth, we need look no farther than Jackie Calmess excellent article on Tim Geithner, the one economic advisor Obama fought to keep. <br> Senior officials dont define administrations; presidents do, by making the strategic decisions that reshape events. For the latest confirmation of this age-old truth, we need look no farther than Jackie Calmess excellent article on Tim Geithner, the one economic advisor Obama fought to keep. <br> From the moment he was elected, Obama had two agendasthe agenda of choice, on which he had waged his campaign, and the agenda of necessity, forced upon him by events. In effect, Geithner was arguing that the latter would require the president-elect to defer much of the former. Obama responded by deciding to do both, simultaneously. That is the choice that led to a year spent on measures such as health insurance reform and cap-and-trade legislation. While the former was successful and the latter failed, both initiatives no doubt measurably contributed to the Democrats 2010 mid-term debacle. <br> Of course, many of these moves would have required a modicum of cooperation from Republicans, something that was evidently in short supply during Obamas first term. But he might have gotten them to go along with a tougher stance toward the banks, as the nascent Tea Party revolt was demanding, and perhaps a firmer policy toward China, which even Mitt Romney is now advocating. Many liberals probably would be unwilling to trade the administrations accomplishments in extending health insurance (however flawed they see it as being), for any of the economic options Ive listed. But if growth doesnt pick up over the next year and Obama ends up as a one-term president, his supporters will long ask themselves what might have beenif he had accepted the logic of his situation and played the hand he was dealt. <br> Bio: William Galston is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a contributing editor for The New Republic.

 HAVANA The lot in teeming Central Havana used to be the neighborhood eyesore: The shattered ruins of an abandoned building was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and rats, then it was cleared in favor of a dreary parking lot and government-run food stand. <br> HAVANA The lot in teeming Central Havana used to be the neighborhood eyesore: The shattered ruins of an abandoned building was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and rats, then it was cleared in favor of a dreary parking lot and government-run food stand. <br> Today, it is home for independent sellers hawking brightly colored clothing, wristbands and earrings as salsa music booms and a line of bicycle taxi drivers forms at the gate to wait for fares. <br> This week's announcement establishing a real estate market for the first time in 50 years comes just a month after a similar opening for vehicles, and newly empowered entrepreneurs speak excitedly of the changes. <br> "I've been an independent worker two times, once before in the 1990s," said Andres Lambreto Diaz, a 38-year-old clothing seller at the Central Havana bazaar who has seen earlier free-market openings abruptly slammed shut when Fidel Castro reversed course. "I think this time it's for real." <br> Many of the reforms merely acknowledge what had long been black-market realities, and they still fall short of the fundamental free-market transformations seen in other communist countries such as Vietnam and China. But collectively, the changes have loosened the government's iron grip over all aspects of the economy. <br> "This is one of the most visible economic reforms, with a direct impact on Cuban lives," said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a Cuban-born economist who teaches at the University of Denver. <br> A little over a year has passed since the government declared that many more people would be allowed to go into business for themselves and even hire employees. <br> The housing and automobile laws have come on schedule, but some announced changes have been delayed, most notably a plan to eliminate 500,000 government jobs, extend bank credits and allow for mid-sized cooperative companies. <br> Other reforms that were floated are still just ideas, such as proposals to relax travel restrictions and create a system of credit for private businesses. And there has been little visible progress on a wholesale market to supply entrepreneurs, though officials said from the beginning that would take years. <br> Officials have shown some sensitivity to popular feedback, modifying the tax code to make things easier for new entrepreneurs and repeatedly changing laws to help new private restaurants be more profitable. <br> That kind of flexibility has been rare during Cuba's half-century-long embrace of Marxist theory. <br> Agricultural reform in the 1960s redistributed land from huge farms to medium-size ones and it enjoyed moderate success before being abandoned by the government, said economist Rafael Romeu, head of the Washington-based Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy. <br> In the 1980s a six-year experiment with private farmers markets was scrapped, as Fidel Castro complained that unscrupulous middlemen were buying up the food and reselling at higher prices. <br> Castro grudgingly allowed independent workers to begin doing business for themselves after the collapse of the Soviet Union brought Cuba to the brink of economic ruin, then taxed and regulated them nearly into extinction in the late 1990s when the worst of the crisis was over. <br> But Fidel is no longer in charge. His brother Raul Castro has repeatedly said that while he has no intention of scrapping Cuba's socialist model, there's no turning back from his reforms. <br> Analysts say the changes so far do not do enough. For example, the housing law's immediate aim is to help redistribute existing homes, allowing big families crammed into tiny apartments to move into larger spaces now occupied by just a few people. <br> Without significant improvements in investment, supplies of construction materials and incentive to make money, it's not clear there will be much new construction to solve Cuba's underlying problem: a housing deficit estimated at between 500,000 to 1.6 million units on an island of 11 million people. <br> "So far there hasn't been an all-embracing change in philosophy by the government in Cuba. What they're doing is really tinkering with sectors," said Paul Hare, a lecturer in international relations at Boston University who was British ambassador to Cuba in 2001-2004. <br> The 80-year-old Raul Castro is walking a tightrope, eager to reform the country before it is too late, but cautious to not move so fast that the state loses control over the process, as happened in the Soviet Union and other Soviet Bloc nations. He has said repeatedly that Cuba will change "without pause, but without haste." <br> Nonetheless, several Cuba observers said that once started, reforms tend to snowball and could spill beyond the realm of pure economics. <br> "The liberalization of these markets will ignite new demands for reforms," Lopez-Levy said. "In the long run, the question will be: How long can the economic genie be out of the bottle without people asking for more substantive political reform?" 
 We've been at war for decades now -- not just in Afghanistan or Iraq, but right here at home. Domestically, it's been a war against the poor, but if you hadn't noticed, that's not surprising. You wouldn't often have found the casualty figures from this particular conflict in your local newspaper or on the nightly TV news. Devastating as it's been, the war against the poor has gone largely unnoticed -- until now. <br> We've been at war for decades now -- not just in Afghanistan or Iraq, but right here at home. Domestically, it's been a war against the poor, but if you hadn't noticed, that's not surprising. You wouldn't often have found the casualty figures from this particular conflict in your local newspaper or on the nightly TV news. Devastating as it's been, the war against the poor has gone largely unnoticed -- until now. <br> The Occupy Wall Street movement has already made the concentration of wealth at the top of this society a central issue in American politics. Now, it promises to do something similar when it comes to the realities of poverty in this country. <br> By making Wall Street its symbolic target, and branding itself as a movement of the 99%, OWS has redirected public attention to the issue of extreme inequality, which it has recast as, essentially, a moral problem. Only a short time ago, the "morals" issue in politics meant the propriety of sexual preferences, reproductive behavior, or the personal behavior of presidents. Economic policy, including tax cuts for the rich, subsidies and government protection for insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and financial deregulation, was shrouded in clouds of propaganda or simply considered too complex for ordinary Americans to grasp. <br> Now, in what seems like no time at all, the fog has lifted and the topic on the table everywhere seems to be the morality of contemporary financial capitalism. The protestors have accomplished this mainly through the symbolic power of their actions: by naming Wall Street, the heartland of financial capitalism, as the enemy, and by welcoming the homeless and the down-and-out to their occupation sites. And of course, the slogan "We are the 99%" reiterated the message that almost all of us are suffering from the reckless profiteering of a tiny handful. (In fact, they aren't far off: the increase in income of the top 1% over the past three decades about equals the losses of the bottom 80%.) <br> The movement's moral call is reminiscent of earlier historical moments when popular uprisings invoked ideas of a "moral economy" to justify demands for bread or grain or wages -- for, that is, a measure of economic justice. Historians usually attribute popular ideas of a moral economy to custom and tradition, as when the British historian E.P. Thompson traced the idea of a "just price" for basic foodstuffs invoked by eighteenth century English food rioters to then already centuries-old Elizabethan statutes. But the rebellious poor have never simply been traditionalists. In the face of violations of what they considered to be their customary rights, they did not wait for the magistrates to act, but often took it upon themselves to enforce what they considered to be the foundation of a just moral economy.<br> <br> Being poor by the numbers <br> A moral economy for our own time would certainly take on the unbridled accumulation of wealth at the expense of the majority (and the planet). It would also single out for special condemnation the creation of an ever-larger stratum of people we call "the poor" who struggle to survive in the shadow of the overconsumption and waste of that top 1%. <br> Some facts: early in 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 14.3% of the population, or 47 million people -- one in six Americans -- were living below the official poverty threshold, currently set at $22,400 annually for a family of four. Some 19 million people are living in what is called extreme poverty, which means that their household income falls in the bottom half of those considered to be below the poverty line. More than a third of those extremely poor people are children. Indeed, more than half of all children younger than six living with a single mother are poor. Extrapolating from this data, Emily Monea and Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution estimate that further sharp increases in both poverty and child poverty rates lie in our American future. <br> Moreover, in 2006, interest payments on consumer debt had already put more than four million people, not officially in poverty, below the line, making them "debt poor." Similarly, if childcare costs, estimated at $5,750 a year in 2006, were deducted from gross income, many more people would be counted as officially poor. <br> Nor are these catastrophic levels of poverty merely a temporary response to rising unemployment rates or reductions in take-home pay resulting from the great economic meltdown of 2008. The numbers tell the story and it's clear enough: poverty was on the rise before the Great Recession hit. Between 2001 and 2007, poverty actually increased for the first time on record during an economic recovery. It rose from 11.7% in 2001 to 12.5% in 2007. Poverty rates for single mothers in 2007 were 49% higher in the U.S. than in 15 other high-income countries. Similarly, black employment rates and income were declining before the recession struck. <br> In part, all of this was the inevitable fallout from a decades-long business mobilization to reduce labor costs by weakening unions and changing public policies that protected workers and those same unions. As a result, National Labor Board decisions became far less favorable to both workers and unions, workplace regulations were not enforced, and the minimum wage lagged far behind inflation. <br> Inevitably, the overall impact of the campaign to reduce labor's share of national earnings meant that a growing number of Americans couldn't earn even a poverty-level livelihood -- and even that's not the whole of it. The poor and the programs that assisted them were the objects of a full-bore campaign directed specifically at them. <br> Campaigning against the poor <br> This attack began even while the Black Freedom Movement of the 1960s was in full throttle. It was already evident in the failed 1964 presidential campaign of Republican Barry Goldwater, as well as in the recurrent campaigns of sometime Democrat and segregationist governor of Alabama George Wallace. Richard Nixon's presidential bid in 1968 picked up on the theme. <br> As many commentators have pointed out, his triumphant campaign strategy tapped into the rising racial animosities not only of white southerners, but of a white working class in the north that suddenly found itself locked in competition with newly urbanized African-Americans for jobs, public services, and housing, as well as in campaigns for school desegregation. The racial theme quickly melded into political propaganda targeting the poor and contemporary poor-relief programs. Indeed, in American politics "poverty," along with "welfare," "unwed mothers," and "crime," became code words for blacks. <br> In the process, resurgent Republicans tried to defeat Democrats at the polls by associating them with blacks and with liberal policies meant to alleviate poverty. One result was the infamous "war on drugs" that largely ignored major traffickers in favor of the lowest level offenders in inner-city communities. Along with that came a massive program of prison building and incarceration, as well as the wholesale "reform" of the main means-tested cash assistance program, Aid to Families of Dependent Children. This politically driven attack on the poor proved just the opening drama in a decades-long campaign launched by business and the organized right against workers. <br> This was not only war against the poor, but the very "class war" that Republicans now use to brand just about any action they don't like. In fact, class war was the overarching goal of the campaign, something that would soon enough become apparent in policies that led to a massive redistribution of the burden of taxation, the cannibalization of government services through privatization, wage cuts and enfeebled unions, and the deregulation of business, banks, and financial institutions. <br> The poor -- and blacks -- were an endlessly useful rhetorical foil, a propagandistic distraction used to win elections and make bigger gains. Still, the rhetoric was important. A host of new think tanks, political organizations, and lobbyists in Washington D.C. promoted the message that the country's problems were caused by the poor whose shiftlessness, criminal inclinations, and sexual promiscuity were being indulged by a too-generous welfare system. <br> Genuine suffering followed quickly enough, along with big cuts in the means-tested programs that helped the poor. The staging of the cuts was itself enwreathed in clouds of propaganda, but cumulatively they frayed the safety net that protected both the poor and workers, especially low-wage ones, which meant women and minorities. When Ronald Reagan entered the Oval Office in 1980, the path had been smoothed for huge cuts in programs for poor people, and by the 1990s the Democrats, looking for electoral strategies that would raise campaign dollars from big business and put them back in power, took up the banner. It was Bill Clinton, after all, who campaigned on the slogan "end welfare as we know it." <br> A movement for a moral economy <br> The war against the poor at the federal level was soon matched in state capitols where organizations like the American Federation for Children, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the Institute for Liberty, and the State Policy Network went to work. Their lobbying agenda was ambitious, including the large-scale privatization of public services, business tax cuts, the rollback of environmental regulations and consumer protections, crippling public sector unions, and measures (like requiring photo identification) that would restrict the access students and the poor had to the ballot. But the poor were their main public target and again, there were real life consequences -- welfare cutbacks, particularly in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, and a law-and-order campaign that resulted in the massive incarceration of black men. <br> The Great Recession sharply worsened these trends. The Economic Policy Institute reports that the typical working-age household, which had already seen a decline of roughly $2,300 in income between 2000 and 2006, lost another $2,700 between 2007 and 2009. And when "recovery" arrived, however uncertainly, it was mainly in low-wage industries, which accounted for nearly half of what growth there was. Manufacturing continued to contract, while the labor market lost 6.1% of payroll employment. New investment, when it occurred at all, was more likely to be in machinery than in new workers, so unemployment levels remain alarmingly high. In other words, the recession accelerated ongoing market trends toward lower-wage and ever more insecure employment. <br> The recession also prompted further cutbacks in welfare programs. Because cash assistance has become so hard to get, thanks to so-called welfare reform, and fallback state-assistance programs have been crippled, the federal food stamp program has come to carry much of the weight in providing assistance to the poor. Renamed the "Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program," it was boosted by funds provided in the Recovery Act, and benefits temporarily rose, as did participation. But Congress has repeatedly attempted to slash the program's funds, and even to divert some of them into farm subsidies, while efforts, not yet successful, have been made to deny food stamps to any family that includes a worker on strike. <br> The organized right justifies its draconian policies toward the poor with moral arguments. Right-wing think tanks and blogs, for instance, ponder the damaging effect on disabled poor children of becoming "dependent" on government assistance, or they scrutinize government nutritional assistance for poor pregnant women and children in an effort to explain away positive outcomes for infants. <br> The willful ignorance and cruelty of it all can leave you gasping -- and gasp was all we did for decades. This is why we so desperately needed a movement for a new kind of moral economy. Occupy Wall Street, which has already changed the national conversation, may well be its beginning. 
 Janesville, Wisc. - Paul Ryan's fans don't want to take "no" for an answer. <br> Janesville, Wisc. - Paul Ryan's fans don't want to take "no" for an answer. <br> An elderly veteran, one of his final questioners at his final townhall on Friday afternoon in Kenosha, sounds a little curmudgeonly when asking Ryan to do more to help young veterans get jobs and expand domestic energy production. The man is pleased with Ryan's answers, but the agitation in his voice rises during his final question. <br> "Why don't you run for president and lead us out of this mess?" <br> In response to these questions, Ryan thanks his fans for the sentiment, but the typically articulate congressman brushes off their pleas without much explanation. <br> Ryan reads the form and laughs along with his chief of staff Andy Speth, who is driving Ryan's Chevy Suburban.I rattle off some of the flaws of the current candidates and ask him if Republicans disappointed with the field are wrong to be disappointed. "You think I'm going to answer that question?" Ryan replies."The field we have is the field we're going to have. It's not going to change." <br> Ryan came to his own final decision not to run after a hike in Colorado with his wife Janna on Sunday, August 21."My family was supportive of me whatever I wanted to do," he says. "It was really a gut thing."Ryan says that originally "we had a longer timeline in mind to process this decision," but the August 16 report by Steve Hayes on Ryan's presidential considerations "sort of accelerated my [decision]--I didn't want to dramatize this thing, string it out." <br> As with most gut decisions, Ryan can't really explain it logically."From a competitive and intellectual standpoint, the idea of the race was intriguing to me for sure," Ryan says."It made sense in my mind, but it has to make sense in your heart and your gut as well. I don't know how else to describe it," he says. "My gut has never been wrong" about such decisions. <br> But even without the "fire in the belly," wouldn't he have had as good or better of a shot at winning than the others in the race?"I don't think a lack of faith in the ability of other candidates is enough of a reason," Ryan says. "And more to the point, these candidates were new, you know. I didn't know how Rick Perry was going to do." <br> "Romney hadn't been fully tested," at the time of his decision, Ryan continues. "They had one or two debates maybe. He keeps winning these debate tests. He's pretty capable and strong and resilient in those things." <br> Ryan's decision not to run for president means that when the GOP selects a nominee Ryan willrelinquishhis role as the most important Republican in America (a role he took on following the release of his Medicare-reforming budget in April).But it's clear that in Ryan's second act--prosecuting the case against Obama, boosting the eventual GOP nominee, and shaping the agenda--he still intends to play a big part. <br> Asked if he's concerned that his work on the budget will have been for nothing if the GOP nominee runs away from entitlement reform, Ryan replies, "I don't think he will. I don't think he can." <br> "Well, I guess from a federalism standpoint, I understand that point," Ryan says with a laugh. He doesn't back off of his judgment about Romneycare, but says the issue is irrelevant."I don't think this question matters that much anymore because Romney's been very clear that he's against Obamacare and he's going to repeal it. So I for a second don't worry about whether he's going to shy away from repealing the president's health care law." 
 It's a legislative reality largely missing in the furious political debate now unfolding along all-or-nothing lines, in which Obama tries to assign Republicans part of the blame for a dismayingly weak economy while the GOP tries to avoid it. <br> "Last week, all the Republicans in the Senate got together and blocked the jobs bill," the president said this week after his bus rolled, campaign-style, into Millers Creek, N.C. "They refused to even debate it." <br> He cited a poll that said about 63 percent of Americans "support the ideas in this jobs bill," then he asked, "So why is it that 100 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against it?" He added, "It doesn't make any sense." <br> The morning after, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell rebutted. <br> "He's trying to change the topic," the Kentucky senator said of Obama. "He wants to deflect attention from that 1.5 million job loss" since he took office. "For two years, the president got everything he wanted from the Democrats in Congress," McConnell added. <br> In the political argument, both sides play loose with the facts. <br> Despite Obama's rhetoric, it was Senate Democrats who forced a rewrite of the jobs bill last week. And even now, it's unlikely he has enough support within his own party to assure a majority. <br> And despite McConnell's claim, Obama settled for less than he wanted from Congress in an economic stimulus bill early in 2009, agreeing to a concession in exchange for Republican votes critical to passage. <br> Political debate aside, significant parts of the legislation seem on track to pass by year's end, when payroll tax cuts enacted a year ago and unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire. <br> The proposed renewal of the payroll tax cut, at $179 billion over a decade, is the largest single item in the legislation and has drawn no significant opposition from Republicans. <br> A proposal to give employers a break on payroll taxes, a $69 billion provision, could pass, as well. <br> An extension of unemployment insurance, likely to pass, carries a price tag of $48.5 billion. <br> Far less likely to become law, given Republican opposition, are the president's requests for $50 billion over a decade for transportation projects, $35 billion to help the states hire teachers and first responders, $30 billion for school modernization and $15 billion for a neighborhood stabilization fund. <br> Nor do Republicans show any interest in accepting the millionaires' surtax that would pay the entire cost of the measure. <br> The parts that draw bipartisan support and the parts that do not all generate significant support in public opinion polls. That explains why Democrats maneuver constantly to force Republicans to vote on them, requiring them to choose between what is politically popular on the one hand, and their aversion to tax increases and higher federal spending on the other. <br> As an example, 75 percent of the public support the use of federal funds to let states hire teachers and first responders, according to a CNN/ORC survey released Tuesday and cited instantly by Democrats. <br> Yet there is ample polling that shows the country is suspicious of more spending and larger government. In the survey that Democrats cited, a 59-36 majority said the president's policies are more likely to fail than to succeed. <br> While the legislative maneuvering grinds on, Obama travels widely, sometimes aboard Air Force One and occasionally along roads that lead to towns rarely visited by presidents. <br> With the exception of Texas, his itinerary consists of states he won in 2008. In all cases, unemployment is higher than when he took office. <br> North Carolina, where the president spoke on Monday, had joblessness of 10.4 percent in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from 9.7 percent in January 2009. <br> Virginia, where the president had two speeches on Tuesday, had unemployment of 6 percent when Obama took office, 6.3 percent in August. <br> The other states include Pennsylvania: unemployment at 7 percent in January, 2009 but 8.2 percent now. Ohio: 8.8 percent then, 9.1 percent now. Colorado, 6.6 percent then, 8.5 percent now; Washington, 7.8 percent then, 9.3 percent now; California 10.1 percent then, 12.1 percent now and Florida, 8.6 percent then and 10.7 percent now. <br> Confronting numbers like that, Obama on Tuesday offered what he called a comparison. <br> Republicans, he said, "want to gut environmental regulations. They want to roll back Wall Street reform so that we end up with the same financial system we had that got us into this mess in the first place. And they want to repeal health care reform so that 30 million people won't have health insurance. <br> "That is what they call their 'Real American Jobs Act.' It's inspiring stuff," he taunted. <br> Not at all, of course, which is why McConnell insisted otherwise. <br> " The president I think has become convinced that the economy is not likely to be much better a year from now. So he has started the campaign 13 months early, and he's trying to convince the American people that it's anybody else's fault but his." <br> WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress will almost certainly approve the 
 The presidential campaign was heating up, and the progressives in office were nervous about their chances of holding the White House. It was unclear at first which contender for the Republican nomination would get the nod, but when the candidate eventually was chosen they denounced him as "a confirmed and hopeless reactionary." <br> The presidential campaign was heating up, and the progressives in office were nervous about their chances of holding the White House. It was unclear at first which contender for the Republican nomination would get the nod, but when the candidate eventually was chosen they denounced him as "a confirmed and hopeless reactionary." <br> And indeed, Warren G. Harding has come to be thought of as one of the worst presidents America has ever had. Yet the truth about his presidency is quite the opposite. He achieved a good deal more in the two and a half years he served before his sudden death than many presidents accomplish in a full term. A popular newspaper publisher and senator from Ohio, Harding won the presidency in a landslide, with 60 percent of the popular vote, the highest share ever recorded up until that time. The handsome, warm, gregarious, and modest Harding was a natural politician, known in the Senate for his ability to bring opposing sides together. He was as different from his predecessor--the by-then unpopular Woodrow Wilson, perceived by many as a rigid, unapproachable ideologue--as one could possibly be. <br> The outlook was certainly bleak for America when Harding took office in 1921. The country's entry into World War I in 1917 had resulted in an economic bubble. Wartime demand kept employment, wages, and profits high, while the Federal Reserve inflated the money supply. Under Wilson, not only the Army and Navy but the entire federal government grew at a fast clip, and the national debt skyrocketed, from around $1 billion in 1914 to $24 billion in 1920. <br> When the war ended in November 1918, Wilson's lack of planning for demobilization meant that four million soldiers were sent home under chaotic conditions with little money and few benefits. Demand fell, bringing bankruptcies, business closures, and rising unemployment. During the depression of 1920 to 1921, industries cut back production, many of them running half-time. The drastic drop in wholesale prices hit farmers hardest, causing the price of farmland to collapse. When African-American soldiers returned home after fighting abroad for democracy and couldn't find jobs, they felt they were once again being relegated to second-class status. The result was race riots throughout the Midwest's industrial belt. <br> To Harding, America was an exceptional country whose citizens enjoyed equal opportunities to develop their abilities, and whose success ultimately depended on a dynamic free market. At no time did these principles stand in such stark relief as in 1920, three years after the Bolshevik Revolution. During the campaign, Harding delivered his message to over 600,000 people who traveled to Marion, Ohio, to hear him speak from his front porch. Some of them were African Americans, a majority of whom supported the Republicans, the party of Lincoln. He told them: <br> Abroad, particularly in Russia, there has grown up the idea that by some impossible magic a government can give out a bounty by the mere fact of having liberty and equality written over its door, and that citizenship need make no deposit in the bank of the common weal in order to write checks upon the bank. Here at home we have had too much encouragement given to the idea that a government is a something for nothing institution. . . . It is only in a country where the merit, capacity and worth of men and women are recognized and rewarded that merit, capacity and worth are developed. <br> You and I, and good Americans of whatever color, blood or creed, know that the aspiration of all men is equal opportunity, and that no injustice known to man can be greater than that of the tyranny and autocracy that . . . enslaves all men and all their ambitions and all their freedom. <br> Harding was inaugurated on March 4, 1921, and he immediately tackled the crisis. He called for a special joint session of Congress, to take place before the legislators were officially scheduled to convene. At the session, Harding laid out his agenda and priorities. His ambitious program included: tax reform, continued tariff protection, legislation to help farmers, creation of a national budget system to help get government spending under control, construction of a great merchant marine, a system of national highways for interstate commerce and the "motor car" (financed with local and state bond issues), encouragement of aviation technology for civilian and military purposes, increased federal participation in international cable and radio transmissions, a Veterans' Bureau, and a Department of Public Welfare to help women and children. <br> Harding also called for a federal antilynching law, to "rid the stain of barbaric lynching from the banner of a free and orderly representative democracy." And he proposed creation of an interracial commission to promote better relations between the races. Woodrow Wilson had introduced segregation into the federal government; Harding urged his cabinet to appoint qualified blacks to their departments, and in speeches he attacked the Ku Klux Klan. The legislation he championed, however, came to naught. When the Republican majority in the Senate was ready to pass the antilynching law Harding favored (the Dyer Bill), Southern Democrats killed it with a filibuster. The proposal for an interracial commission died in committee. <br> But at the top of the president's list was setting the country's economic house in order. During the war, he told his former colleagues, "our expenditures were so little questioned, the emergency was so impelling, appropriation was so unimpeded that we little noted millions and counted the Treasury inexhaustible. . . . A continuation of such a course means inevitable disaster." A way must be found, he continued, "to restrict our national expenditures within the limits of our national income, and at the same time . . . lift the burdens of war taxation from the shoulders of the American people." <br> To help achieve his goals, Harding was determined to put together a stellar cabinet, and for the most part he did. To instill confidence in the business community he chose Andrew Mellon as secretary of the Treasury. He picked Herbert Hoover to be his secretary of commerce. He admired Hoover's work as head of the American Relief Committee during the war and believed he could help the country gain access to new world markets. Charles Evans Hughes, former governor of New York, was tapped to be secretary of state and Henry C. Wallace secretary of agriculture. <br> Harding had originally wanted Charles G. Dawes to be his Treasury secretary. Dawes, a banker and successful businessman, had served as President McKinley's comptroller of the Treasury and had a reputation for efficiency and for getting results. Harding had been intrigued by a magazine article Dawes had written entitled "How a Presi-dent Can Save a Billion Dollars." After the election, he asked Dawes to come to Marion and offered him his first cabinet appointment, secretary of the Treasury. But Dawes rejected the offer. If Harding was truly interested in balancing the budget and reducing the debt, he told him, the secretary of the Treasury was not the man to do it. It would have to be done through legislation providing for an executive budget. If such an act were passed, then Dawes wanted to head the Budget Bureau. <br> There was general agreement in Washington that the federal budget process was a mess. For over a hundred years each department had submitted its own budget with little coordination or control. Wilson had tried to get a bill passed dealing with the budget process, but had failed. Now Harding stepped up. The Budget and Accounting Act passed on June 10. It placed the new Budget Bureau--predecessor to today's Office of Management and Budget--in the Department of the Treasury, but made it accountable to the president. Harding appointed Dawes its director. Dawes agreed to take the job on two conditions: that he would have the president's complete support and that he would serve for only one year, allowing him to set up effective operating procedures so that the bureau could carry on without him. <br> On June 24 a meeting was held in the auditorium of the Interior Department attended by the president, Vice President Calvin Coolidge, the cabinet, and 1,200 bureau and division chiefs. Harding began by telling his audience, "There is not a menace in the world today like that of growing public indebtedness and mounting public expenditure." It was imperative that this trend be reversed. Dawes then explained that the purpose of the new bureau was to help all present get rid of the "fat" in their budget requests, and to reduce unnecessary expenditures. The bureau was to be nonpartisan and existed only to gather information and inform the president. He then asked those in the audience on whom he could count to please stand up. Everyone stood. <br> Dawes was not in a good mood at the next meeting. While he was receiving cooperation in his campaign for economy from many quarters, it was being sabotaged in others. To make his point he held up two brooms: one an Army broom made to Army specifications, the other a Navy broom made to Navy specifications. The Army had 350,000 surplus brooms, and the Navy needed 18,000. But the Navy rejected the suggestion that they take the Army's excess brooms because those were wrapped with twine instead of wire. In the end, the Army sold their surplus brooms at low prices to speculators who turned around and sold them at a hefty profit, and the Navy went out and bought new brooms at top prices. If such a thing had occurred in a private business, Dawes said, the person responsible would have been immediately fired. <br> By the time Dawes's year was up in June 1922, the federal budget had been balanced, revenues exceeded expenditures, and the public debt had been reduced. Dawes had exceeded his promise to help the president save a billion dollars: Federal spending had dropped from $6.3 billion in 1920 to $5 billion in 1921 and then $3.3 billion in 1922. When Dawes left, he took two brooms home with him as mementoes. <br> While Harding had presented Congress with the nation's first coordinated federal budget, he had also approved passage of the Revenue Act of 1921, which eliminated the World War I excess-profits tax, settled on a corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, brought the top marginal income tax rate down from 73 percent to 58 percent, decreased surtaxes on incomes above $5,000, and provided increased exemptions for families. <br> Harding was consistent in his dedication to fiscal responsibility, even when he knew it would be unpopular and go against his own instincts. Such was the case with the bonus voted by Congress for World War I veterans. Harding's pledge to cut taxes conflicted with the desire of Congress and the public to grant the veterans a generous bonus, paid for with deficit spending. Harding felt so strongly about the issue he appeared before a special joint session of Congress to make his case. While he sympathized with the impulse to grant the bonus, the country needed tax relief to get back on its feet and could not afford to do both. If Congress wanted the bonus, it would have to find the revenues to pay for it. <br> Congress was shocked that the president would oppose the bonus, and many Republicans were furious with him, since they would shortly face an election. But Harding vetoed the bill, as he had said he would, writing that while the nation owed much gratitude to those who had served, the burden of high taxes affected every American citizen. "To add one-sixth of the total sum of our public debt for a distribution among less than 5,000,000 out of 110,000,000, whether inspired by grateful sentiment or political expediency, would undermine the confidence on which our credit is [built] and establish the precedent of distributing public funds whenever the proposal and numbers affected make it seem politically appealing to do so." <br> Blythe's account was accurate. Harding's policies, put into practice by men like Charles G. Dawes, succeeded in turning the country around. This was not easy with a fractious Republican party at odds over regional and economic issues. Nevertheless, Harding cut income tax rates for Americans at every income level. According to economist Benjamin Anderson, employment and businesses rallied as a result of "a drastic cleaning up of credit weakness, a drastic reduction in the costs of production, and on the free play of private enterprise." <br> It had been Harding's hope that inequality of income would decrease as foreign markets expanded, creating more economic opportunities; he worked hard with Herbert Hoover and Charles Evans Hughes to achieve this. Harding also modified his position on the tariff, coming to favor a degree of flexibility. He entered the White House having won an overwhelming mandate. He succeeded in healing a divided country by combining fiscal conservatism with some socially progressive attitudes. His efforts to end lynching and his belief in racial equality showed him to be more enlightened than many of his countrymen. They entitle him to be regarded as one of the first modern civil-rights presidents. <br> The policies of Harding and his successor Calvin Coolidge were undone in the 1930s, when President Hoover adopted the statist measures that laid the foundations for what would become the New Deal. With the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a new kind of welfare state was created, and progressivism began once again to flourish. Surveying the situation in 1940 after the economy's downturn and what people were beginning to call a new Roosevelt depression, Dawes penned a warning: <br> Some day, a President, if he is to save the country from bankruptcy and its people from ruin, must make the old fight over again, and this time the battle will be waged against desperate disadvantages. Against him will be arrayed the largest, strongest, and most formidably entrenched army of interested government spenders, wasters, and patronage-dispensing politicians the world has yet known. <br> Dawes was prescient. As the old fight is once again being waged, we can only hope that the president Americans elect in 2012 will be as much of a "reactionary" as Warren G. Harding--and as much of a success. 
 With former pizza magnate Herman Cain suddenly<u><span>running second
 Former pizza magnate Herman Cain's upset victory in the September 24 Florida Republican straw poll, and his subsequent rise to a competitive third place position in at least one national poll, are being generally interpreted as a function of GOP voter unhappiness with previous "top-tier" candidates (Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and arguably Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul). In particular, Rick Perry's series of ever-deteriorating debate performances have apparently made more than a few conservative base voters restless, creating at least a temporary opening for the smooth and genial Cain, who has always been popular with the Tea Party crowd. <br> Former pizza magnate Herman Cain's upset victory in the September 24 Florida Republican straw poll, and his subsequent rise to a competitive third place position in at least one national poll, are being generally interpreted as a function of GOP voter unhappiness with previous "top-tier" candidates (Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and arguably Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul). In particular, Rick Perry's series of ever-deteriorating debate performances have apparently made more than a few conservative base voters restless, creating at least a temporary opening for the smooth and genial Cain, who has always been popular with the Tea Party crowd. <br> But something a bit more profound than happy feet (and the perpetual desire to refute "liberal media" claims of latent racism) may be driving Republicans in Cain's direction. His relentless advocacy of a comprehensive overhaul of the federal tax code, bearing the catchy moniker of "9-9-9," is getting serious attention in the conservative chattering classes. That's happening for two pretty obvious reasons. <br> First, the increasing nastiness of the Romney-Perry competition, and perhaps even some fatigue with the entire field's monotonous Obama-bashing, has created a natural desire for a more positive campaign focused on what Republicans propose rather than what they oppose. As conservative opinion-leader Erick Erickson argued after Cain's Florida straw poll win: <br> They voted for Herman Cain because he is not running against Barack Obama so much as he is running for an America he believes in and that other people can get excited about. People love Herman Cain's optimism. They love his vision. They love his 9-9-9 plan. <br> The last is key. Herman has an articulated, easy to remember plan for economic recovery in his 9-9-9 plan. Quick! What is Mitt Romney's plan? Jon Huntsman's? Rick Perry's? Michele Bachmann's? They all, more or less, have them, but they are not readily memorable or easy to understand. <br> Herman Cain is consistently conservative, he is running for something, not against someone, and he is the most optimistic candidate on stage. <br> Second, Republicans are sensitive to Democratic claims, amplified recently by Barack Obama's attacks on Republican obstructionism, that their party has no real plan for reviving the economy. Obama's consistent lead in the polls against all the Republican candidates (with the occasional exception of Mitt Romney) even as his approval ratings sink has to be alarming to conservative elites who are smart and honest enough to acknowledge that the president is beginning to succeed in his efforts to make 2012 a "comparative" rather than a "referendum" election. Hence, even for Republicans who don't take Cain seriously as a viable presidential candidate, praising him for being a candidate of great substance with very specific plans for the economy is good for the cause. <br> The plan itself is a variation on the "Fair Tax" concept, which would replace existing payroll and income taxes with a flat national consumption tax. This hardy perennial of conservative tax schemes, which experts, even on the right, tend to deride as impractical and impossibly regressive, remains popular with the conservative rank-and-file. Cain has long been a Fair Tax fan, and frankly describes 9-9-9 as a way station to ultimate establishment of a Fair Tax. <br> Specifically, 9-9-9 would replace the current federal income, estate, and payroll taxes with a 9 percent corporate tax, a flat 9 percent income tax, and a 9 percent national sales tax. So it would simultaneously achieve a number of conservative goals in tax policy: abolition of the "death tax;" elimination of progressive income tax rates; and a general shift from taxes on income to taxes on consumption. A friendly <i>Washington Times guestimate suggested that 9-9-9 would "only" reduce current total federal revenues by about $360 billion. Whether that's accurate or not, by eliminating the earned income and family tax credits, and by imposing a national sales tax, Cain's plan would without question boost taxes on the working poor to a very significant extent. The impact of a national sales tax on already-struggling state and local governments that rely on the same type of taxes is impossible to calculate, but would be considerable as well. <br> And that helps explain a third and less obvious appeal generated by Cain's 9-9-9 plan: It uniquely scratches an itch among conservatives for a tax code that not only reduces taxes on businesses and high earners, but also demands more from those "lucky duckies" (as the Wall Street Journal once famously called them) at the bottom of the income scale who don't currently pay income taxes. Those who watched Rick Perry's August announcement speech in South Carolina may recall the odd moment when the Texan paused in the midst of a tirade against taxes of any kind to rail at the "injustice that nearly half of all Americans don't even pay any income tax." This reverse-class-warfare battle cry has also been a staple of Michele Bachmann's rhetoric. So now comes a candidate with an actual "plan" to accomplish this purpose--with the added bonus that he happens to be an African-American, providing protection against liberal suspicions that conservatives are turning the working poor into the "welfare queens" of the 21st century. <br> Of course, none of these attractions are enough to make Herman Cain the Republican presidential nominee. He doesn't have a lot of money or organization; has less experience in public office than Sarah Palin; has been known to commit gaffes and exhibit ignorance of foreign policy; and has yet to get the kind of scrutiny and criticism that has already knocked Rick Perry down a notch or two. But his current bout of popularity is not just a matter of conservatives punishing Rick Perry for his bad debate performances or his criticism of his rivals' "heartless" attitudes towards the children of illegal immigrants. At the moment, Cain is the man with the plan. &nbsp; <br> Ed Kilgore is a special correspondent for The New Republic. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

It bills its mission as "rebuilding the middle class"--i.e., the "people willing to work hard and play by the rules." (What are those rules? I always wonder.

 Just days after Congress averted a much-discussed debt limit crisis that some feared would produce a market crash and an economic catastrophe, older fears of a double-dip recession have quickly reemerged.

 The most distressing outcome of the deficit hysteria gripping Washington may be what Barack Obama has revealed about himself. It was disconcerting to watch the president slip-slide so easily into voicing the fallacious economic arguments of the right. It was shocking when he betrayed core principles of the Democratic Party, portraying himself as high-minded and brave because he defied his loyal constituents. Supporters may hope this rightward shift was only a matter of political tactics, but I think Obama has at last revealed his sincere convictions. If he wins a second term, he will be free to strike a truly rotten grand bargain with Republicans&ldquo;pragmatic compromises that will destroy the crown jewels of democratic reform. <br> The most distressing outcome of the deficit hysteria gripping Washington may be what Barack Obama has revealed about himself.

If he wins a second term, he will be free to strike a truly rotten grand bargain with Republicans&ldquo;pragmatic compromises that will destroy the crown jewels of democratic reform. <br> The president has done grievous damage to the most vulnerable by trying to fight the GOP on its groundaccepting the premise that deficits and debt should be a national priority. He made the choice more than a year ago to push aside the real problemthe vast loss and suffering generated by a failing economy. <br> As a conservative reformer, Obama embraced a bizarre notion of balance. The budget cuts he first proposed would have punished the middle class and vulnerable three times with a big stick, shrinking Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits while hitting the wealthy only once with a modest tax increase. When Democrats complained that this wasnt fair, Obama adjusted the shared sacrifice to a dollar-for-dollar ratio. Take a dollar from working stiffs who need these programs, take a dollar from the superrich who dont need a tax break. How fair is that? <br> The mendacity has a more fundamental dimension. Obama helped conservatives concoct the debt crisis on false premises, promoting a claim that Social Security and other entitlement programs were somehow to blame while gliding over the real causes and culprits. Social Security has never contributed a dime to the federal deficits (actually, the government borrows the trust funds huge surpluses to offset its red ink). <br> This mean-spirited political twist amounts to blaming the victims. There should be no mystery about what caused the $14 trillion debt: large deficits began in 1981, with Ronald Reagans fanciful supply side tax-cutting. Federal debt was then around $1 trillion. By 2007 it had reached $9 trillion, thanks to George W. Bushs tax cuts for the wealthy and his two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, plus the massive subsidy for Big Pharma in Medicare drug benefits. The 2008 financial collapse and deep recession generated most of the remainder, as tax revenues fell drastically. Obamas pump-priming stimulus added to the debt too, but a relatively small portion. <br> Whatever supposed solutions Congress eventually enacts, the misleading quality of the debt crisis should become widely understood once the action is completed. The debt and deficits will probably keep expanding, because the economy will remain stagnant or worse, with near 10 percent unemployment and falling incomes, and that is fundamentally what drives deficits higher. It should become obvious that deficit reduction did nothing to revive economic growth or to create jobs. In fact, cutting federal spending may make things worse, because it withdraws demand from the economy at the very moment when demand for goods and services is woefully inadequate. <br> At some point, then, the president will have to change his tune. Instead of mimicking the penny pinchers, Obama will have to say something about the nations real problemthe sick economy and the terrible consequences facing millions of families. But its not clear he will have much to say beyond small-bore suggestions and the usual pep talks. If he does a sudden about-face and proposes big ideas for job creation, will anyone believe him? <br> The White House evidently thinks its good politics for 2012 to dismiss the left and court wobbly independents. Obama no doubt assumes faithful Democrats have nowhere else to go. Its true that very few will wish to oppose him next year, given the fearful possibility of right-wing crazies running the country. On the other hand, people who adhere to the core Democratic values Obama has abandoned need a strategy for stronger resistance. That would not mean running away from Obama but running at himchallenging his leadership of the party, mobilizing dissident voices and voters, pushing Congressional Democrats to embrace a progressive agenda in competition with Obamas. <br> To be blunt, progressives have to pick a fight with their own party. They have to launch the hard work of reconnecting with ordinary citizens, listening and learning, defining new politics from the ground up. People in a rebellious mood should also prepare for the possibility that it may already be too late, that the Democratic Partys gradual move uptown is too advanced to reverse. In that event, people will have to locate a new homea new force in politics that speaks for them. 
 The broad outlines of this agreement have been clear for a while. And theyve been clear because, as the date for reaching the debt ceiling approached, the White House lost nearly all of its leverage. The Republicans were willing to risk an economic catastrophe and Obama was not. Given that, I'm not sure the president in the final days should have pushed Republicans harder, thereby risking the immediate, devastating effects of government reaching its debt limit. <br> Meanwhile, the actual deal seems considerably better than reports early on Sunday suggested. It would reduce deficits in two stages first, by enacting around $900 billion in cuts to discretionary spending; second, by calling for up to $1.5 trillion in additional deficit reduction. Congress would have the option of filling in the programmatic details of that $1.5 trillion, based on the recommendations from a new bipartisan commission. Absent that, or the approval of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, automatic spending cuts would take effect. <br> But those are also the details. Take a step back and look at the big picture. It still looks ugly. <br> That first round of cuts to discretionary spending might reduce some waste, but it would also undermine vital government services. At the same time, it would deplete the opportunities for easy spending reductions, making it more likely that second round of cuts had an equal, or harsher, impact.As Robert Greenstein, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed out in a recent statement about a different proposal, theres just no way to enact spending reductions of this magnitude without imposing a lot of pain. And contrary to the common understanding in the Washington cocktail party circuit, pain does not simply mean offending certain political sensibilities. Pain means more people eating tainted food, more people breathing polluted air, more people pulling their kids out of college, and more people losing their homes -- in other words, the hardships people suffer when government can't do an adequate job of looking out for their interests. <br> More immediately, but equally troubling, this agreement would not address our most pressing economic problem: lack of jobs. On the contrary, by reducing deficits starting next year, this deal would do the very opposite of what virtually every mainstream economist now believes we should do: increase consumer demand by pumping more money into the economy. At one point, the debt ceiling agreement included promises to extend unemployment insurance and renew a break on the payroll tax. Those two would have provided a modest but very real boost to the economy (not to mention financial relief to people who need it). This deal would do neither. <br> Is Obama to blame? Ive been among his staunchest defenders in situations like these. I know it's easier to second-guess these decisions from the cheap seats.I realize the country is more conservative than I am. I appreciate the difficulty of fighting Fox News, the Koch brothers, and the filibuster all at once. The failure to get a public option in health care reform and the inability to secure a second major stimulus have been frustrating, but theyve also reflected broader political realities including, frankly, a failure by progressives to apply enough political pressure on Congress. <br> Obama was up against those same forces in the debt ceiling debate. But this time, I think, it's impossible not to second-guess his decisions. Why didn't he demand Republicans raise the debt limit, the way Congress has routinely for previous presidents, and stand by that when Republicans inevitably refused? Why didn't he spend more time criticizing Republicans for their values and priorities rather than trying to find accommodations with them? Why didn't he play up the possibility of the 14th Amendment, if only to increase his leverage?Imagineif the president had, from the very beginning, laid out a few key principles and stuck to them:No tying the debt ceiling to deficit reduction; no attacks on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security; no deficit reduction without higher taxes on the rich. <br> No, I can't be sure he would have secured a better deal. And, yes, Obama said all of those things at one time or another. (His speech at George Washington University remains one of the best I've heard him, or any contemporary politician, give.) But politics is about using focus and repetition to reach the general public. And for the last few months the White House has subordinated these messages to its broader, overarching theme:That Obama is the grown-up in the room, the one who can rise above all the partisan bickering in Washington to do what must be done.However appealing that message may have been to the political independents that certain strategists covet,it suggested this was not a fight about priorities but about responsibility. It underplayed and ultimately undermined the power of congressional Democrats, both at the negotiating table and on the public stage. It was soothing when, I suspect, it needed to be polarizing. <br> Unlike some of my friends, I don't believe Obama adopted this approach primarily because he thought it would improve his prospects for re-election. As I have written previously, I give the president a lot more credit than that, morally and intellectually. My guess is that he pursued this strategy because he didn't want to poison the atmosphere for negotiations and believed (genuinely, accurately) that moderate entitlement cuts should be part of a balanced deficit reduction agreement.But the atmosphere was poisoned from the start and Republicans were never going to support a balanced agreement. He was trying to do the right thing when it was not possible to do the right thing. It may not have made for bad politics, but it certainly made for bad policy. <br> This story isn't over, of course. The deal hasn't passed, the details are still a bit murky, and, beyond that, new issues beckon. Expiration of the Bush tax cuts would make this deal look a lot better in retrospect, by providing the revenue it so sorely lacks. Another effort to boost the economy, perhaps involving that extension of jobless benefits and payroll tax relief, would certainly make this whole drama more palatable.The one unambiguously good thing about this deal is that it would raise the debt ceiling enough to remove it as an issue until 2013. That would reduce the Republicans' leverage, particularly on issues (like expiration of the Bush tax cuts) when doing nothing is the best policy outcome. <br> According to<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/with-deal-announced-the-white-house-makes-its-case/2011/03/03/gIQA86yKmI_blog.html">Greg Sargent, the Obama Administration is now making this point explicitly in its defense. And that's encouraging. These issues could present Obama with what my colleague Jonathan Chaitcalls a "golden ticket" -- a chance to pursue good policy and good politics, in ways that would make this whole debt ceiling episode seem a lot less unpalatable.But achieving these goals would entail a series of high-profile battles. I'm not sure whether Obama really wants to fight them -- or whether he'd do what it takes to win. 
 President Obama does not care much about deficits -- other than worrying that big debt might matter in his reelection campaign. 
 As the debt-ceiling showdown heads into its final stages, the political maneuvering has intensified, with both sides seeking to gain the upper hand in the public-relations war. Leaders from both parties know the stakes in this fight are very, very high; confrontations of this sort tend to become defining moments in political life, for good or ill. At this stage, anything could still happen, with many scenarios still in play. But for Republicans, there are reasons to worry that this showdown could be headed toward a political and fiscal debacle if they are not very careful. <br> As the debt-ceiling showdown heads into its final stages, the political maneuvering has intensified, with both sides seeking to gain the upper hand in the public-relations war.

 Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum is ardently anti-gay and has an acute talent for tapping into the homophobic imagination of social conservatives.&ldquo;Man on child, man on dog, incest, priests with 3-year-olds, polygamy, the welfare of children, the decline of Western civilizationif its in the vocabulary of anti-gay hysteria, Santorum has been there, done that. <br> Laugh awayfor now he has the support of just two percent of Republican votersbut remember, Santorum wasnt always just for shits and giggles. Before he crashed and burned in his race for a third Senate term, Santorum was considered a golden boy of the GOP. He had won four elections in a row in a swing state against well-financed Democrats. He was the youngest member of the GOP Senate leadership and for much of the early 2000s, one of its most frequent TV spokesmen. <br> Most importantly, Santorum was the baby face of compassionate conservatism and an important architect of its signature pieces of legislation. As head of the House GOP Task Force on Welfare Reform, Santorum wrote key parts of what became the landmark 1996 welfare reform bill signed by Bill Clinton. He championed No Child Left Behind and proposed the Santorum Amendment to it, which attempted to insert teaching on the theory of intelligent design. Along with Democrat Dick Durbin, Santorum crusaded for increasing US spending on the global fight against HIV/AIDS, especially if it went to church groups and controversial abstinence-only programs. He considered enlarging the US role in fighting AIDSintegral to "American exceptionalism," and he earned the praise of Bono, among others, for his advocacy. Throughout it all, he worked behind the scenes to increase government funding for faith-based social services. <br> As conservative pundit Kathleen Parker lamented in September 2006, when it was clear that Santorum would go down to Bob Casey, Santorum has been the conservatives point man for the worlds disenfranchisedthe poor, the sick and the meek. If he loses, the face of compassionate conservatism will be gone. <br> Parker was right. Nobody on the right talks of compassionate conservatism anymore, especially now that the Tea Party is running the show. In part thats because it collapsed on its own internal contradictions. As an ideology, compassionate conservatism championed state support for social justice to fight poverty, illiteracy or disease, for examplebut it opposed the state doing that work itself. In practice, that meant turning the state into a giant, heavily-politicized pass-through mechanism that redistributed tax-payer dollars to private charities and corporations without meaningful accountability. Because compassionate conservatism is rooted in Christian missionary zealotry, it inevitably engaged in social engineeringabstinence-only sex education and discrimination against gays and lesbians, for example. And most importantly for the Tea Party right, it ran up the deficit. Along with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, for Tea Party conservatives, it is the most visible symbol of how Bush went wrong, corrupting real conservatism with profligate cronyism. <br> Thats the real reason why Santorums candidacy seems so laughable now. Hes a relic from another time, one marked by plentitude and optimism, when conservatives embraced a global role for the US, attempted to hijack American progressivism and above all, needed a new brand to bring them back from the mean years of straight-up bashing welfare queens and fags with AIDS (see Jesse Helms). Santorum fulfilled that role, speaking of Americas great and charitable mission to aid the poor while retaining enough smiling hatred to stoke the old base. It didnt really make sense then. It really doesnt make sense now. 
 Wiser Republicans know better: The central issue in the campaign was Ryans Medicare proposal, and thats why they lost. But they still havent faced the full truth. In the previous cycle, Democrats made two claims: Republicans were misrepresenting their health care plan, and the people would change their minds when they learned more about it. The first was true, but the second wasnt, and surveys show that it still isnt. Now Republicans are offering the same two claims, and again, while the first is true, the second isnt. The unpopularity of the Ryan Medicare proposal reflects a public judgment about its substance that isnt likely to change very much. If Ryan himself had been running in NY 26 this year, he might have lost. And I dont see how Republicans can reframe the unpopular facts away by next year. Just how, exactly, do you spin a plan that over the next two decades, according to CBO, will shift more than two-thirds of total costs to future Medicare beneficiaries?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> But Democrats made a third argument in favor of their health care reform: The status quo wasnt an option, and the Republicans hadnt offered a serious alternative. They were right. Now Republicans are saying the same thing about Medicare, and theyre right too. Democrats havent faced the hard truth that the current program isnt close to being sustainable and that weve run out of easy answers. But dont take my word for it; read the 2011 report of the six Medicare Trustees, four of whom are members of Obamas cabinet. <br> One of its findings has been widely reported: The Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2024, five years sooner than the 2010 report anticipated, and that Medicares long-term deficit has increased. Believe it or not, thats the good news. The Trustees emphasizefirmly and repeatedlythat they are required to base their projections on current law, key provisions of which are unrealistic. In the first place, current law mandates a 29 percent cut in reimbursements to physicians as of January 2012. Congress has overridden similar requirements every year since 2003, and few expect a different outcome this time around. Second, current law assumes unprecedented improvements in health care productivity, resulting in significant reductions for Medicare outlays. The Trustees cite the strong possibility that these productivity gains wont materialize and that actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the projections shown in this report, possibly by quite large amounts. The alternative, they say, is inadequate reimbursements to hospitals, nursing facilities, and home health agencies that would force 15 percent of them to run at a loss by 2019. In that case, they would have to withdraw from providing services to Medicare beneficiaries, merge with other provider groups, or shift substantial portions of their Medicare costs to their non-Medicare, non-Medicaid payers. <br> Many Democrats are dead-set against cuts to Medicare beneficiaries. The Trustees find that even using the assumptions of current law, closing the gap with revenues alone would require an immediate increase of 24 percent in the tax rate. Using assumptions they regard as far more realistic, that figure rises to 74 percent. (Conversely, closing the gap by reducing benefits would require a cut of 17 percent, assuming current law, or 36 percent with more plausible assumptions.) <br> Its much harder to save Medicare with revenues than it would be for Social Security.First, while theres a cap on taxable earnings under Social Security that could be raised or eliminated, theres no such cap for Medicare. Second, starting in 2013, high-income taxpayers are already scheduled to pay a healthy surtax of 0.9 percent on everything they earn above $200 thousand (for individuals) and $250 thousand (for married couples.)And as the Trustees point out, because these thresholds arent indexed for inflation, more and more workers over time will end up paying the higher rate. <br> Benefit-cut averse Democrats might concede, of course, that there is a problem, but we have more than a decade to solve it. In the meantime, we still have the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to keep the benefits flowing. But there are two difficulties with this strategy of delay. First, with every year of inaction, the problem gets bigger and the options less palatable. And second, as the Trustees point out, the Trust Fund is an accounting device with real-world fiscal consequences. The Hospital Insurance part of Medicare is already paying out more in benefits each year that it receives in revenues, and the difference is made up by interest earnings on trust fund assets and by redemption of those assets. But because those assets are in fact U.S. government debt obligations, Both of these financial resources for the HI trust fund require cash transfers from the general fund of the Treasury, placing a further obligation on the budget. <br> If Ryans proposal is unacceptable, but the status quo is unsustainable, what is to be done? To begin answering that question, we cant do much better than taking the bipartisan Domenici-Rivlin proposal as our point of departure and figure out ways of refining and improving it. But theres a huge stumbling-block at the threshold: the American people dont believe that the status quo is unsustainable. Until they do, theyll reject not only the Ryan plan, but also alternatives that are far more balanced and less draconian. So both political parties face, and cannot avoid, the bedrock challenge of every democracy: persuading the people, who are the ultimate arbiters of whats possible, to accept a bitter truth and its necessary consequences.

 It is widely understood that the American middle class has fuzzy boundaries. Many relatively poor and relatively rich people identify as middle-class. In an ambitious 2008 survey, the Pew Research Center found that an extraordinary 53 percent of Americans described themselves as middle class. Yet it's also clear that within this diverse, sprawling middle class, there are some households that are better off than others. College-educated households, for example, have largely been spared the scarring effects of unemployment and underwater mortgages. And upper-middle-income households, a group that overlaps fairly closely with the college-educated middle class, have seen fairly healthy improvements in their standard of living in recent years. This is a group that has a great deal, and a great deal to lose. <br> It is widely understood that the American middle class has fuzzy boundaries.

And upper-middle-income households, a group that overlaps fairly closely with the college-educated middle class, have seen fairly healthy improvements in their standard of living in recent years. This is a group that has a great deal, and a great deal to lose. <br> In recent years, a number of progressive historians and political scientists have been making the case that American political life is dominated by the ultra-rich. The recent obsession with the billionaire Koch brothers is only the most vivid example of this phenomenon. In Winner-Take-All Politics, the political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson link the evolution of the U.S. economy from the late 1970s through the present to the rising political influence of the top 1 percent of the income distribution. In their view, key members of this group have actively sought to deregulate the economy, to undermine the power of organized labor, and to advance regressive tax policies. The end result, they argue, has been a policy environment hostile to the interests of the middle class. <br> Naturally, conservatives will object to Hacker and Pierson's take on the decades-long effort to free the American economy, which we see as crucial to American prosperity. In the absence of deregulation, the declining influence of organized labor, and a tax policy designed to spur work, conservatives generally believe that the country as a whole, including the working and middle classes, would have fared far worse in a more competitive global economy. Indeed, if there is a social group that has been a barrier to good public policy, one can make a strong case that it isn't the ultra-rich but the upper middle class, a group we'll loosely define as households earning between $100,000 and $250,000. <br> There is no denying that Americans in the top 0.01 percent of the income distribution have more potential for political influence than those earning $150,000. This influence is channeled through campaign donations and also through charitable giving, particularly to nonprofits devoted to shaping the ideological environment. Just as the Koch brothers have donated to various libertarian causes, their opposite numbers at the Ford Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, the Soros Foundations, elite research universities, and countless other lesser-known organizations have devoted themselves to providing intellectual support for the expansion of the welfare state. It is very difficult to tease out which side has had the most cumulative influence over time. <br> What we can say with confidence is that in any given election the top 0.01 percent has less collective political weight than the upper middle class, simply by virtue of the fact that there are more voters in the upper middle class. These voters tend to be more active as volunteers and as small donors than other Americans, and they are heavily concentrated in professions -- media, the upper echelons of the public sector, higher education -- that further magnify their influence. In Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State, Columbia University statistician Andrew Gelman and his colleagues found that Republicans in heavily Republican states tend to win elections with a coalition of middle-class and upper-income voters, while Democrats in heavily Democratic states tend to win elections with a coalition of voters drawn from all income groups. In effect, upper-middle-class voters are always represented in the winning coalitions, regardless of region. <br> Voters in households earning more than $100,000 constituted 26 percent of the 2008 electorate. By any standard, President Obama performed very well with this bloc in 2008. In the 2010 House elections, in contrast, voters in over-$200,000 households chose Republicans over Democrats by a margin of 64 to 34 percent, while $100,000 to $200,000 households favored Republicans by a more modest 56 to 43 percent margin. The president's political advisers are keenly aware of the fact that Democrats need to improve their performance with these voters or face defeat in 2012. This helps explain the profound irrationality of the Obama administration's approach to key public-policy questions. <br> One of the most fascinating aspects of the Obama era has been the elevation of a $250,000 annual household income to an almost mythical status. The magic number was first introduced by Hillary Clinton in 2008, when she defined $250,000 as the upper bound of the middle class. That same year, Barack Obama pledged to cut taxes on all households earning less and to raise them, ever so slightly, on those earning more. Given that 49 out of 50 households earned less than $250,000 that year, there is no question that the cutoff number chosen was politically shrewd. As the Democratic nominee promised a panoply of new social programs, ranging from a health-care entitlement to an expensive effort to foster a green economy, he also made it clear that only one out of 50 households would pay for all that new spending and for reducing the deficits that had widened during the Bush years.

 A mixture of Republican stubbornness and Democratic timidity has brought us to this point. Democratic leaders could have passed a budget before the 2010 elections or during the lame-duck Congress, when they held large Congressional majorities, but by punting on the issue, they empowered the new House Republican majority, whose number-one issue in the 2010 election was cutting government spending. In February 2011, House Republicans passed $60 billion in spending cuts for 2011 by targeting the usual suspectseliminating funding for Planned Parenthood, preventing the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, blocking the implementation of healthcare reform, cutting off support for NPR, PBS and AmeriCorps. Their bill looked much more like an effort to defang longtime opponents and score political points than a responsible attempt to actually balance the budget or create jobs. Goldman Sachs predicted that the plan would halt economic growth by 1.5 to 2 percentage points in the coming year, while Moodys forecast it would cost 700,000 jobs. <br> Since then, Congress has twice temporarily kept the government running, and it looked as if John Boehner and Congressional Democrats had recently struck a deal to cut $33 billion from the budget for 2011-2012. But Boehner denied there was any deal, and promptly upped the number to $40 billion in cuts. Every time a deal looks imminent, the GOP raises the stakes, in the hopes that Democrats will take the bait (a pretty good assumption, given the deal reached to extend all the Bush tax cuts in December 2010). And these negotiations have been held in secret, so no one actually knows what any final deal will entail (how reassuring). Shutdown or not, the public is unlikely to be happy with the final outcome. <br> What would a shutdown look like? Heres how CBS News described what happened in 1995: <br> The shutdown resulted in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of passport and college applications, the closure of national parks (including the Grand Canyon), failure to process new Medicare claims and the suspension of many government services. In addition, 760,000 federal workers were furloughed during the impasse. (Their pay was reinstated when Mr. Clinton signed a measure to fund the government in early 2006.) The Office of Management and Budget estimated that the 21-day shutdown, together with a six-day partial government shutdown in November 1995, ended up costing more than $1.25 billion. <br> Another shutdown could force troops to fight without pay and would likely imperil the countrys fragile economic recovery. It would make both parties appear like squabbling adolescents (even more than they already do) and reinforce the belief that Washington is ungovernable, which would ultimately hurt President Obama, who wants to seem like a bipartisan problem-solver. Thats why Obama pollster Cornell Belcher told me a few months ago that that a shutdown today would be devastating for both parties. <br> Despite the alarming projections of how the House Republican budget would harm the country, its the Democrats who have been on the defensive during the budget debate, principally because President Obama has declined to seriously engage in the discussions or outline an alternative narrative on the economy that is distinct from the GOP. Though they hold only one house of Congress, House Republicans act like theyre in control of the entire government, with little pushback from the White House or Senate Democrats. Both parties now endorse the idea that spending cuts are the best cure for our ailing economy, even though there is no evidence that is the case. <br> Obama has said that he was perceived as too much of a <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2010/1013/Obama-utters-words-tax-and-spend-liberal.-Republicans-drool">tax and spend liberal Democrat in the last election, so his administration has moved to the right as a resultdespite the fact that poll after poll shows that the public believes the unemployment rate is a far more pressing problem than the deficit. The White House, in particular, has effectively surrendered in the war of ideas, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote recently. It no longer even tries to make the case against sharp spending cuts in the face of high unemployment. Throughout this budget fight, weve been having the wrong economic debate, as my colleague Katrina vanden Heuvel noted this week. Both our political and media class are guilty of focusing obsessively on spending cuts while ignoring the publics overriding priority: jobs. <br> House Republican Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, an instant media darling, raised the stakes of the debate this week by finally unveiling his radical budget plan for 2012 amidst much fanfare and coverage. Heres how the Economic Policy Institute characterized what Ryans plan would do: <br> The budget, among other things, includes a plan to privatize Medicare by forcing recipients to buy insurance on the open market, to gut Medicaid by shifting costs to states and reducing funding, to cut taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, and to reduce the nations ability to make needed investments by capping overall levels of federal spending. The plan would not only put the fragile recovery at risk, but it would also undermine economic growth and job creation for years. <br> This budget is impressive in its ability to not only inflict maximum harm on the economy, but to concentrate that harm on those most in need. This will not only cost the economy hundreds of thousands (and perhaps millions) of jobs over the next five years, it will also destroy the social safety net and undermine policies that support the middle class. <br> Two-thirds of the cuts in Ryans plan, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, would harm programs like Medicare and Medicaid that help lower-income Americans. None other than Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress, admitted this week that Congress will never balance the budget without raising taxes, an argument few Republicans will make and Democrats vacated when the Obama Administration agreed to temporarily extend the Bush tax cuts. <br> Boxed in by the GOP, the Obama administration may have no choice but to cut a bad deal with Boehner in order to avoid another government shutdown. But that doesnt mean Democrats cant aggressively critique Ryans plan and begin to frame the budget fight on their terms for 2012. Just because Obama kicked off his re-election campaign with a substanceless video doesnt mean he can afford to be MIA on the biggest issue of the day. 
 House Republicans are still finalizing their formal blueprint for government spending over the next ten years. But, on Fox News Sunday, Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan confirmed what several media outlets reported last week: The Republicans will propose to transform Medicare from a government-run program into what most people would call a voucher system. They will also propose to convert Medicaid from an entitlement to a block grant. <br> House Republicans are still finalizing their formal blueprint for government spending over the next ten years. But, on Fox News Sunday, Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan confirmed what several media outlets reported last week: The Republicans will propose to transform Medicare from a government-run program into what most people would call a voucher system. They will also propose to convert Medicaid from an entitlement to a block grant. <br> Johnson was the president who, in 1965, signed the legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid: No longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine," Johnson said at the signing ceremony. "No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years. <br> Read those quotes carefully, because they spell out the covenant that Johnson made with the American people on that day: A promise that the elderly and (certain groups) of the poor would get comprehensive medical insurance, no matter what. <br> Will the new Republican plan faithful to that covenant? We havent seen the details, obviously, so it's impossible to know. But Ryan told Fox News that the proposal for Medicare will be very similar to the one he crafted with Alice Rivlin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and then the Office of Management and Budget. <br> The Ryan-Rivlin plan is a form of premium support: If it became law, the government would, starting a decade from now, provide each senior with a sum of money, payable toward the purchase of an insurance policy. (Seniors already on Medicare when the plan took effect could remain in the traditional program.) <br> Ryan insists the new Republican plan is not a voucher scheme per se, because of how the money would get from the government to the insurers. He also says private insurers are more efficient than government programs. Those are debatable propositions, but put those issues aside. <br> The key question is whether the new scheme would make the same guarantee of comprehensive, affordable coverage that Medicare does. The answer would seem to be no. Princeton University economist Uwe Reinhardt, among the most respected health care experts anywhere, explained the distinction while analyzing the Ryan-Rivlin plan for the New York Times: <br> The situation with Medicaid is a bit different, because it is a federal-state partnership. Washington provides most of the money and sets most of the rules, while states actually manage the program. But Medicaid, too, is based on a promise: The promise that anybody who qualifies for the program because of low income will get a comprehensive insurance policy. <br> If Ryan has his way, would the government keep this promise? Again, there's no way to be sure right now. But, on Fox, Ryan confirmed that he and his fellow Republicans would propose to change Medicaid from an entitlement to a block grant--which, as I noted on Friday, means giving the states a lump sum of money, with much more freedom to spend the money as they choose. If a state decided to offer less than comprehensive coverage or to limit enrollment below federal guidelines, it would presumably have the power to do it. <br> This isnt my opinion, by the way. Its the opinion of most analysts who have looked at the Ryan-Rivlin plan. Here is Paul Van de Water of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: <br> Ryan says drastic changes are necessary because, if current trends continue, the financial burden of Medicare and Medicaid will exceed our willingness to bear it. Hes almost surely right about the financial burden. Allowed to grow at present rates, without reform, the cost of Medicare and Medicaid will require us to devote more and more tax dollars and, indirectly, more and more private health care dollars--well beyond the point most Americans would consider reasonable. <br> But there are other, more balanced ways to make Medicare and Medicaid more affordable--ways that incorporate the more redeeming features of Ryan-Rivlin, perhaps, but only alongside reforms that attack the root causes of higher medical spending while preserving the fundamental promise LBJ made in 1965. There are even ways to do it with a voucher program, although it wouldn't be my first (or second) choice. <br> But is that what the Republicans intend--to keep America's promise to seniors and to the poor? Based on Ryan's latest statements, it seems unlikely. 
 After many feints in this direction dating back to 1996, Newt Gingrich seems to be finally preparing a run for president. <br> A few years later, having fathered two children with his high school math teacher (whom he had married at the age of 19), Gingrich returned to Georgia and launched his electoral career, running for Congress in 1974 and again in 1976. His incumbent opponent was John Flynt, an old-fashioned conservative Democrat best known for being on the League of Conservation Voters Dirty Dozen list of environmental reactionaries. Unlike many Georgia Republicans who sought to out-flank Dixiecrats by coming across as better-bred right-wing extremists, Gingrich ran to Flynts left, emphasizing environmentalist and reform themes, and enlisting significant support from liberal Democrats. Unfortunately for him, these were the two worst election cycles for Georgia Republicans since the 1950s (the Watergate election of 1974 and Jimmy Carters Georgia landslide of 1976), and he lost narrowly both times. <br> But then Flynt retired, just as Gingrichs form of liberal Republicanism was falling out of fashion nationwide, in the run-up to Ronald Reagans election as president in 1980. When Gingrich ran for Congress again in 1978, this time against a more conventional Democrat, he reinvented himself as a fighting conservative focused on anti-tax and anti-welfare messages. He also burnished his conservative credentials by heading up a statewide group opposed to President Carters Panama Canal Treaty, a major right-wing (and specifically Reaganite) cause at the time. Gingrich won as a newly minted conservative, riding a conservative trend in his state and the country. Its hard to know whether his earlier liberal persona, which seemed consistent with his private behavior and the polyglot crew of environmentalists he hung out with at West Georgia, or his later conservative incarnation was more genuine. But it is clear his turn to the right was well timed, and launched him not only into Congress but into a career as a national political celebrity. <br> From the moment he arrived in Congress, Gingrich aligned himself with a rapidly growing group of young supply-side Republicans, and became especially well known for advocating confrontational tactics against Democrats, to the chagrin of his old base of moderate-to-liberal supporters back home (many of them were also close to Gingrichs wife, whom he divorced in 1980 while she was recovering from cancer, after a bitter financial dispute). He was also an energetic purveyor of right-wing agitprop: As a staffer in the Georgia governors office during that period, I recall having to find a nice way to reject his pleadings that the state officially declare a Lessons of Granada Day to impress upon schoolchildren and the citizenry at large the importance of that great Reagan military victory. By the mid-to-late 1980s, when Gingrich began his climb into the House Republican leadership, he was considered more a threat to the traditional mores of the congressional GOP than to Democrats. His own ideology, now staunchly conservative but sprinkled with vague futurist themes (I see myself as representing the conservative wing of the postindustrial society he once said), was nicely attuned to the Morning in America times. <br> Gingrich, of course, rose to the summit of power in 1994 and then quickly descended into infamy when he lost a humiliating budget battle with Bill Clinton, and subsequently attempted to impeach the president over Monica Lewinsky amid revelations about an extramarital affair of his own. But the lesson of Gingrichs early years is that he has a jewelers eye for a political opening and a willingness to transform himself as necessary to exploit such opportunities when they arise. This could be one of those times: Because the 2012 Republican field is exceedingly weak in ways that would benefit Gingrich, he could end up in a surprisingly good electoral position if he decides to run. <br> Take Iowa, where ostensible frontrunner Mitt Romney is likely to put in a minimal effort (given his upset loss to Mike Huckabee in 2008), and popular Fox News contributors Huckabee and Palin may not show up at all because they prefer to keep their day jobs. According to a recent analysis by Iowa Republican insider Craig Robinson, Gingrich actually ranks first in terms of positioning for the Iowa Caucus: He has already spent considerable time there, along with other early caucus and primary states, and cozied up to the states very powerful Christian Right faction by writing a book alleging an abandonment of God by American liberal elites. Moreover, one of his ideological heresies that annoys conservatives elsewherehis longtime support for ethanol subsidiesis actually a big plus in Iowa. If he wins or places there, and then survives Nevada and New Hampshire, he could do well in the Southern primaries thanks to his ties to the region. <br> More generally, he has positioned himself well to take advantage of a number of issues that obsess the modern right. In addition to courting the Christian Right and describing the Obama administration as a secular socialist machine,
 Jonathan Chait is a senior editor at the New Republic.<br>Politico has an interesting feature about the fear among conservatives that their campaign to canonize Ronald Reagan has turned their hero into a post-ideological hero, rather than an embodiment of conservative values. A specimen of this fear is Steven Hayward's National Review essay, Reagan Reclaimed," castigating liberals for an ideological kidnapping of Ronaldus Magnus. <br> Before I wade into this, I should summarize my view of Reagan. I don't think he was a great president. The main accomplishment which he's credited, winning the Cold War, is one in which his policies contributed a very small amount. The most important cause of the fall of the Soviet Union by far was its failed, unsustainable political and economic system, which would have eventually collapsed regardless of American policy. (It's interesting that conservatives' mania for crediting Reagan with the fall of the USSR has required them to downplay the inherent faults of communism, which you'd think they'd naturally emphasize.) <br> The second factor, a distant second, is the postwar containment architecture, created by Harry Truman and maintained by every president through George H.W. Bush, which including a military commitment to defend Western Europe, a series of anti-Soviet alliances, military support for governments threatened with communist invasion and occasional diplomatic or military support for anti-communist guerillas. A third factor, far less significant than the second, was Reagan's incremental ratcheting up of the bipartisan containment policy, which may have slightly hastened the Soviet crackup. <br> Domestically, Reagan had two main accomplishments. One was to legitimize the religious right as a powerful Republican constituency, a change that has continued to reverberate through American politics. The second was to legitimize massive, non-emergency deficits: <br> When Dick Cheney batted down a concern about red ink at an internal policy meeting of the Bush administration by insisting "Reagan proved deficits don't matter," he was expressing a perception that has transformed Republican politics ever since. <br> Now, it's true that the Reagan policies I've described were right-wing ones which alienated liberals at the time and to this day, and have made him a beloved figure on the right. <br> The source of the revisionism is that, in two of those areas, Reagan reversed himself completely. In foreign policy, he alienated the right by pursuing a detente policy with the USSR. Domestically, his administration recognized that the formula of higher defense spending plus huge tax cuts was a recipe for total fiscal disaster. Reagan agreed to a series of large tax hikes after 1981, and in 1986 signed a tax reform that, while lowering nominal rates, increased the share of taxes paid by the rich. <br> All of these things would be totally anathema to the modern GOP. (The Bowles-Simpson commission proposed a tax reform similar to Reagan's, and a handful of Republicans were willing to accept it only in return for large spending cuts.) The liberal case for Reagan, then, is that, after introducing new, previously unthinkable right-wing policies, he pragmatically abandoned them as a failure. Conservatives have since pretended that they were Reagan's consistent policy as part of a successful effort to entrench them as unchallenged party dogma. <br> The right's reaction to this revisionist account is an attempt to preserve the myth of Reagan as right-wing purist. Heyward, in National Review, repeats the charge -- "He raised taxes! He talked to the Soviets and reached arms agreements!" -- but seems to think that putting sarcastic exclamation points after these facts is sufficient to refute them. Heyward's refutation focuses on the fact that Reagan and the left did not like each other much at the time, which doesn't refute the point. <br> The closest Heyward comes to explaining away Reagan's turn away from (what we now regard as) conservatism is to note that "He expressed disappointment in his diary in 1983 when the Greenspan commission on Social Security came in with a conventional tax-hiking plan to keep the system alive." Right, except he wound up supporting it. <br> The idea of Reagan as dissident to his own administration's policies actually dates back to the Reagan administration itself, when conservatives complained that the president had been captured by moderate advisors. They even formulated a slogan, "Let Reagan be Reagan," to express their belief that the administration's policies did not represent Reagan's preferences. <br> I happen to think conservatives were correct about this. But, then, I think Reagan frequently had little idea what his administration was doing. Lou Cannon's masterful Reagan biography portrayed the man as utterly disengaged from the details of governance: <br> "The sad, shared secret of the Reagan White House was that no one in the presidential encourage had confidence in the judgment or capacities of the president." <br> "Pragmatists and conservatives alike treated Reagan as if he were a child monarch in need of constant protection." <br> "Reagan's reliance on metaphor and analogy for understanding made him vulnerable to arguments that were short on facts and long on theatrical gimmicks." <br> "He made sense of foreign policy through his long-developed habit of devising dramatic, all-purpose stories with moralistic messages, forceful plots, and well-developed heroes and villains." <br> "The more Reagan repeated a story, the more he believed it and the more he resisted information that undermined its premises." <br> "Ronald Reagan's subordinates often despaired of him because he seemed to inhabit a fantasy world where cinematic events competed for attention with reality." (Those excerpts were culled from Rick Hertzberg's classic 1991 review-essay about Reagan.) <br> The trouble with the conservative view of Reagan as internal dissident to the Reagan administration is twofold. First, it requires us to construct an alternate definition of "Reaganism" that is defined by diary entries and other expressions of Reagan's private thoughts, as opposed to the actual Reagan administration policies. <br> Second, conservatives deny the obvious corollary to #1: Reagan was intellectually detached and/or suffering from early Alzheimer's symptoms during his presidency. Indeed, they regard this as a scurrilous lie, even as they wave off huge swaths of his policy as the manipulations of aides working against his wishes. I have never seen a conservative attempt to reconcile these two key elements of the Reagan liturgy. Ultimately, Reagan worship is an exercise in creating politically useful myths for the conservative movement.By Jonathan Chait: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic.

Hartung is the director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation and the author of Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex (Nation Books, January 2011.This piece originally appeared on TomDispatch. <br>Have you noticed that Lockheed Martin, the giant weapons corporation, is shadowing you? No? Then you haven't been paying much attention. Let me put it this way: If you have a life, Lockheed Martin is likely a part of it. <br> True, Lockheed Martin doesn't actually run the U.S. government, but sometimes it seems as if it might as well. After all, it received $36 billion in government contracts in 2008 alone, more than any company in history. It now does work for more than two dozen government agencies from the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. It's involved in surveillance and information processing for the CIA, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Pentagon, the Census Bureau, and the Postal Service. <br> Oh, and Lockheed Martin has even helped train those friendly Transportation Security Administration agents who pat you down at the airport. Naturally, the company produces cluster bombs, designs nuclear weapons, and makes the F-35 Lightning (an overpriced, behind-schedule, underperforming combat aircraft that is slated to be bought by customers in more than a dozen countries) -- and when it comes to weaponry, that's just the start of a long list. In recent times, though, it's moved beyond anything usually associated with a weapons corporation and has been virtually running its own foreign policy, doing everything from hiring interrogators for U.S. overseas prisons (including at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and Abu Ghraib in Iraq) to managing a private intelligence network in Pakistan and helping write the Afghan constitution. <br> A For-Profit Government-in-the-Making <br> If you want to feel a tad more intimidated, consider Lockheed Martin's sheer size for a moment. After all, the company receives one of every 14 dollars doled out by the Pentagon. In fact, its government contracts, thought about another way, amount to a "Lockheed Martin tax" of $260 per taxpaying household in the United States, and no weapons contractor has more power or money to wield to defend its turf. It spent $12 million on congressional lobbying and campaign contributions in 2009 alone. <br> Not surprisingly, it's the top contributor to the incoming House Armed Services Committee chairman, Republican Howard P. "Buck" McKeon of California, giving more than $50,000 in the most recent election cycle. It also tops the list of donors to Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-HI), the powerful chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the self-described "#1 earmarks guy in the U.S. Congress." <br> Add to all that its 140,000 employees and its claim to have facilities in 46 states, and the scale of its clout starts to become clearer. While the bulk of its influence-peddling activities may be perfectly legal, the company also has quite a track record when it comes to law-breaking: it ranks number one on the "contractor misconduct" database maintained by the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington-DC-based watchdog group. <br> How in the world did Lockheed Martin become more than just a military contractor? Its first significant foray outside the world of weaponry came in the early 1990s when plain old Lockheed (not yet merged with Martin Marietta) bought Datacom Inc., a company specializing in providing services for state and city governments, and turned it into the foundation for a new business unit called Lockheed Information Management Services (IMS). In turn, IMS managed to win contracts in 44 states and several foreign countries for tasks ranging from collecting parking fines and tolls to tracking down "deadbeat dads" and running "welfare to work" job-training programs. The result was a number of high profile failures, but hey, you can't do everything right, can you? <br> Under pressure from Wall Street to concentrate on its core business -- implements of destruction -- Lockheed Martin sold IMS in 2001. By then, however, it had developed a taste for non-weapons work, especially when it came to data collection and processing. So it turned to the federal government where it promptly racked up deals with the IRS, the Census Bureau, and the U.S. Postal Service, among other agencies. <br> As a result, Lockheed Martin is now involved in nearly every interaction you have with the government. Paying your taxes? Lockheed Martin is all over it. The company is even creating a system that provides comprehensive data on every contact taxpayers have with the IRS from phone calls to face-to-face meetings.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1568584202/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">
 Rebecca Solnit is the author of 13 books, including last year's A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities that Arise in Disaster, and this year's Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas This piece originally appeared on TomDispatch.<br>After the Macondo well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, it was easy enough (on your choice of screen) to see a flaming oil platform, the very sea itself set afire with huge plumes of black smoke rising, and the dark smear of what would become five million barrels of oil beginning to soak birds and beaches. <br> Infinitely harder to see and less dramatic was the vast counterforce soon at work: the mobilizing of tens of thousands of volunteers, including passionate locals from fishermen in the Louisiana Oystermen's Association to an outraged tattoo-artist-turned-organizer, from visiting scientists, activist groups, and Catholic Charities reaching out to Vietnamese fishing families to the journalist and oil-policy expert Antonia Juhasz, and Rosina Philippe of the Atakapa-Ishak tribe in Grand Bayou. And don't forget the ceaseless toil of the Sierra Club's local environmental justice organizer, the Gulf Coast Restoration Network, the New Orleans-born<a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n15/rebecca-solnit/diary">poet-turned-investigatorAbe Louise Young, and so many<a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/37828/bp-hires-prison-labor-clean-spill-while-coastal-residents-struggle">morethan I can list here. <br> I think of one ornithologist<a href="http://birding.typepad.com/gulf/">I metin Grand Bayou who had been dispatched to the Gulf by an organization, but had decided to stay on even if his funding ran out. This mild-mannered man with a giant pair of binoculars seemed to have some form of pneumonia, possibly induced by oil-fume inhalation, but that didn't stop him. He was among the thousands whose purpose in the Gulf had nothing to do with profit, unless you're talking about profiting the planet. <br> The force he represented mattered there, as it does everywhere -- a force that has become ever more visible to me as I live and journey among those who dedicate themselves to their ideals and act on their solidarities. Only now, though, am I really beginning to understand the full scope of its power. <br> Long ago, Adam Smith wrote about the "invisible hand" of the free market, a phrase which always brings to my mind horror movies and Gothic novels in which detached and phantasmagorical limbs go about their work crawling and clawing away. The idea was that the economy would somehow self-regulate and so didn't need to be interfered with further -- or so still go the justifications for capitalism, even though it took an enormous armature of government interventions to create the current mix of wealth and poverty in our world. Your tax dollars pay for wars that make the world safe for giant oil corporations, and those corporations hand over huge sums of money to their favorite politicians (and they have so many favorites!) to regulate the political system to continue to protect, reward, and enrich themselves. But you know that story well. <br> As 2010 ends, what really interests me aren't the corrosions and failures of this system, but the way another system, another invisible hand, is always at work in what you could think of as the great, ongoing, Manichean arm-wrestling match that keeps our planet spinning. The invisible claw of the market may fail to comprehend how powerful the other hand -- the one that gives rather than takes -- is, but neither does that open hand know itself or its own power. It should. We all should. <br> The Iceberg Economy <br> Who wouldn't agree that our society is capitalistic, based on competition and selfishness? As it happens, however, huge areas of our lives are also based on gift economies, barter, mutual aid, and giving without hope of return (principles that have little or nothing to do with competition, selfishness, or scarcity economics). Think of the relations between friends, between family members, the activities of volunteers or those who have chosen their vocation on principle rather than for profit. <br> Think of the acts of those -- from daycare worker to nursing home aide or the editor of TomDispatch.com -- who do more, and do it more passionately, than they are paid to do; think of the armies of the unpaid who are at "work" counterbalancing and cleaning up after the invisible hand and making every effort to loosen its grip on our collective throat. Such acts represent the relations of the great majority of us some of the time and a minority of us all the time. They are, as the two feminist economists who published together as J. K. Gibson-Graham noted, the nine-tenths of the economic iceberg that is below the waterline. <br> Capitalism is only kept going by this army of anti-capitalists, who constantly exert their powers to clean up after it, and at least partially compensate for its destructiveness. Behind the system we all know, in other words, is a shadow system of kindness, the other invisible hand. Much of its work now lies in simply undoing the depredations of the official system. Its achievements are often hard to see or grasp. How can you add up the foreclosures and evictions that don't happen, the forests that aren't leveled, the species that don't go extinct, the discriminations that don't occur? <br> The official economic arrangements and the laws that enforce them ensure that hungry and homeless people will be plentiful amid plenty. The shadow system provides soup kitchens, food pantries, and giveaways, takes in the unemployed, evicted, and foreclosed upon, defends the indigent, tutors the poorly schooled, comforts the neglected, provides loans, gifts, donations, and a thousand other forms of practical solidarity, as well as emotional support. In the meantime, others seek to reform or transform the system from the inside and out, and in this way, inch by inch, inroads have been made on many fronts over the past half century. <br> The terrible things done, often in our name and thanks in part to the complicity of our silence or ignorance, matter. They are what wells up daily in the news and attracts our attention. In estimating the true make-up of the world, however, gauging the depth and breadth of this other force is no less important. What actually sustains life is far closer to home and more essential, even if deeper in the shadows, than market forces and much more interesting than selfishness. <br> Most of the real work on this planet is not done for profit: it's done at home, for each other, for affection, out of idealism, and it starts with the heroic effort to sustain each helpless human being for all those years before fending for yourself becomes feasible. Years ago, when my friends started having babies I finally began to grasp just what kind of labor goes into sustaining one baby from birth just to toddlerhood. <br> If you do the math, with nearly seven billion of us on Earth right now, that means seven billion years of near-constant tending only to get children upright and walking, a labor of love that adds up to more than the age of this planet. <br> That's not a small force, even if it is only a force of maintenance. Still, the same fierce affection and determination pushes back everywhere at the forces of destruction. <br> Though I'm not sure I could bring myself to watch yet again that Christmas (and banking) classic It's a Wonderful Life, its premise -- that the effects of what we do might best be gauged by considering what the world would be like without us -- is still useful. For the American environment, this last year was, at best, a mixed one. <br> Nonetheless, polar bears got some protection and the building of at least one nuclear power plant was prevented; the work of groups like the Sierra Club continued to keep new coal-fired power plants at bay; and Californians defeated a sinister oil-company-sponsored initiative, to name just a few of the more positive developments. Erase all the groups at work on the environment, hardly noticed by the rest of us, and it would have been a massacre. 
 Gary Younge, the Alfred Knobler Journalism Fellow at The Nation Institute, is the New York correspondent for the Guardian and the author of No Place Like Home: A Black Briton's Journey Through the Deep South (Mississippi) and Stranger in a Strange Land: Travels in the Disunited States (New Press). <br>Shortly before I first came here some fifteen years ago, I asked a local how people would react to a black man with a British accent. "When they hear your voice, they'll add twenty points to your IQ," he said. "But when they see your face, they won't." <br> With some white conservatives, I've noticed, the gulf between what they see and what they hear can widen into an unbridgeable chasm. The affect of Englishness-hauteur, refined behavior and aristocracy (none of which I possess)-is something they aspire to, or at least appreciate. Blackness, on the other hand, is not. <br> And so when I introduce myself as a journalist from England I occasionally prompt a moment of synaptic dysfunction. The overwhelming majority get over it. But every now and then they say, "Really? I don't hear an accent." <br> "If you beat your head against the wall," the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci once wrote, "it is your head that breaks, not the wall." <br> To avoid an almighty headache I try to shut the conversation down: "Well, I can't explain that. But let's get on with the interview." <br> But they won't let it go. "Where in England?" "Were you born there?" "How long have you been here?" <br> The sad truth is that even when presented with concrete and irrefutable evidence, some people still prefer the reality they want over the one they actually live in. Herein lies one of the central problems of engaging with those on the American right. Cocooned in their own mediated ecosystem, many of them are almost unreachable through debate; the air is so fetid, reasonable discussion cannot breathe. You can't win an argument without facts, and we live in a moment when whether you're talking about climate change or WMD, facts seem to matter less and less. <br> I'm not referring to false consciousness here (insisting that people don't know what's best for them, which doesn't seek to understand but to infantilize them) but instead the persistent, stubborn, willful refusal to acknowledge basic, known, verifiable facts and the desire to make misinformation the cornerstone of an agenda. <br> The examples are legion. Most of those who believe that Obama is a Muslim (roughly one in three Republicans) also loathe his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. But Muslims don't have pastors. They also claim that Obama's 1981 trip to Pakistan as a student is evidence of his Islamic militancy and his dubious beginnings: he must have used a foreign passport, since the country was on a "no-travel list" at the time. It wasn't. In fact, in August that year the US consul general in Lahore encouraged Americans to visit, and before that, on June 14, the New York Times Travel section had run a 3,400-word piece explaining that Americans could get thirty-day visas at airports and border crossings. <br> That these falsehoods are proxies for racism is true but beside the point. After all, the right Swiftboated John Kerry and Whitewatered the Clintons before him. Obama's race and ethnicity merely provide an easier target, and the growing strength of Fox, the web and talk-radio mean that these slings and arrows travel faster and farther. But if Obama can't convince the right of these basic facts, what hope does he have of persuading them to support his economic and foreign policies? <br> The principle of compromise is fine and, given the recent election, inevitable. But you can negotiate only with those who engage in good faith. In the absence of that, Obama should expend less effort trying to win the right over and more trying to win us back. <br> For these fabrications gain currency only when real change proves elusive. The number who believe Obama is a Muslim has leapt 50 percent since before his election, during which time the economy has lagged. Meanwhile, whatever the inadequacies of the healthcare reform, once it passed all talk of "death panels" ceased. <br> Faced with the option of believing something that's not true or gaining tangible benefits like a job or healthcare, most people will take the latter. However petulant, ignorant or gullible people might be, most would prefer to hold on to their jobs, homes and health than their illusions. The problem is that Obama's failure to deliver gives little incentive to exchange fiction for fact. <br> Now more than ever the only way for Obama to bring about progressive change is by mobilizing his base. If the right can surge when Democrats have the presidency and both houses of Congress, there is no reason the left can't just because the GOP has the House. Indeed, now that Republicans have some power, they're easier to expose. That's what makes Obama's "compromise" on tax cuts such a strategic blunder. There will rarely be a better opportunity to lay bare the GOP's class priorities (let alone the sketchiness of its deficit-busting credentials). <br> "We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue," wrote George Orwell in his essay "In Front of Your Nose." "And then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right. Intellectually, it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time: the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield." <br> Obama needs to get out there and fight. <br> By Gary Younge Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Robert Scheer is the author of The Great American Stickup: How Reagan Republicans and Clinton Democrats Enriched Wall Street While Mugging Main Street (Nation Books). <br>The sight of Bill Clinton back on the White House podium defending tax cuts for the super-rich was more a sick joke than a serious amplification of economic policy. How desperate is the current president that he would turn to the great triangulator, who opened the floodgates to banking greed, for validation of the sorry opportunistic hodgepodge that passes for this administration's economic policy? A policy designed and implemented by the same Clinton-era holdovers whose radical deregulation of the financial industry created this mess in the first place. <br> As a candidate running against Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama quite accurately excoriated the economic policies of the Clinton years when the Democratic president united with congressional Republicans, led by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, to obliterate sensible regulations of the New Deal. The result, as candidate Obama noted in March 2008, has been chaos: <br> "Unfortunately, instead of establishing a 21st century regulatory framework, we simply dismantled the old one-aided by a legal but corrupt bargain in which campaign money all too often shaped policy and watered down oversight. In doing so, we encouraged a winner-take-all, anything-goes environment that helped foster devastating dislocations in our economy." <br> These dislocations were authorized when Clinton signed off on the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which reversed the Glass-Steagall Act's separation between the high rollers of investment banking and the properly conservative, insured and regulated activities of commercial banks entrusted with the life savings of ordinary folks. With a stroke of a pen that he then presented as a gift to Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill, Clinton opened the door to the too-big-to-fail monstrosities that have caused so much misery. <br> Back in 1999, even though he had been warned of the coming financial instability, foreshadowed by the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, Clinton was giddy in signing the bill: "Over the past seven years we have tried to modernize the economy," he enthused. "And today what we are doing is modernizing the financial services industry, tearing down those antiquated laws and granting banks significant new authority." <br> A year later Clinton signed off on the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, advanced most fiercely by his treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, who has been the dominant personality setting economic policy for Obama. Titles 3 and 4 of that act summarily exempted from the surveillance of any existing regulatory agency or laws all of the newfangled financial gimmicks-the collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps-that have proved so toxic to the jobs and homes of tens of millions of Americans. <br> In his rambling and somewhat incoherent comments on the economy at the White House last week, Clinton attempted to explain away the failure of the banks to use the money that the government has made available to them to shore up housing and create jobs. As an aside, in commenting on community banks, Clinton touched on the mortgage security mess that his law enabled, but he still doesn't seem to get his connection with the problem: "some of them may have a few mortgage issues unresolved, most of that mortgage debt has been offloaded to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or has vanished into the cyber-sphere with those securitized subprime mortgages. I don't like the securities, but they happened." <br> What gibberish. The mortgage-backed securities didn't just happen. Clinton signed legislation freeing those securities from any effective government regulation. Most Americans' homes, which represented their dreams and savings, were turned into gambling chips in the Wall Street casino on a scale unknown and indeed unthinkable before the Clinton presidency. What has vanished is the equity of homeowners. As for the offloading to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that represents at least a $700 billion burden on taxpayers who have had to bail out those government-sponsored agencies that became totally corrupt on Clinton's watch. <br> The bottom line on the Clinton legacy is that the census now finds an all-time high of 44 million Americans living under the poverty line, bringing us back, as a percentage of the population, to Bill Clinton's first two years in office. One big difference is that thanks to Clinton's so-called welfare reform program, there is no longer a significant federal anti-poverty program, and the plight of the poor is now a problem for the state governments, which also have been impoverished thanks to the bursting of the Clinton bubble. <br> As a candidate, Obama laid responsibility for the meltdown on the bipartisan deregulation of the Clinton years: "This loss has not happened by accident. It's because of decisions made in boardrooms, on trading floors and in Washington. Under Republican and Democratic administrations, we failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices. We let the special interest put their thumbs on the economic scales." <br> That's the path Clinton followed after his party's electoral reversal after he had been in office two years, a fact that made it all that more ominous to witness the great triangulator back on a White House podium. <br> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. <br> By Robert Scheer Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 John Nichols writes about politics for The Nation.<br>The debate about the future of Social Security has opened, and how progressives respond will decide whether the United States is a civil society or a pirate state where the government's primary role is to take from the poor and give to the rich. <br> So far, the response has been mixed. The signals from the Obama White House are bad, with the president indicating openness to "compromises" that would compromise the legacies of the New Deal, the Fair Deal and the Great Society. In contrast, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, key Congressional Democrats, labor unions and activist groups are raising all the right objections. <br> The spark for the debate was the release of a statement from the co-chairs of the president's Fiscal Commission-the high-powered committee charged by President Obama with developing strategies for balancing budgets and addressing deficits and debts-that indicates they are leaning toward implementing the sort of rigid austerity schemes that would ruin the US economy. <br> The Commission is not due to make any serious proposals until December, at the earliest. But the statement from former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, a supposedly sensible Republican, and former Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, a North Carolina Democrat who tried without success to get elected to the Senate, suggests that the commission has adopted the fraudulent calculus that says every federal program is more of less equally wasteful, and thus equally "on the table" for cutting. Those cuts, to their view, would begin with deep cuts in Social Security benefits and a hike in the retirement age to 69. Where would it end? The proposal by Simpson and Bowles to tear the safety net gives Wall Street speculators precisely the opening they have been seeking to make a grab for the biggest corporate-welfare payout ever: privatization of Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. <br> The White House response did not inspire confidence in the administration's determination to maintain the commitments made by Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. <br> "The president will wait until the bipartisan fiscal commission finishes its work before commenting. He respects the challenging task that the co-chairs and the commissioners are undertaking and wants to give them space to work on it. These ideas, however, are only a step in the process towards coming up with a set of recommendations and the president looks forward to reviewing their final product early next month," said White House spokesperson, Bill Burton. <br> The Progressive Change Campaign Committee described the statement as representative of the "weak, 'I won't pick a fight on even the most obvious of issues,' loser mentality that will be DISASTER for Democrats if continued through 2012." <br> In contrast, the group pointed to Pelosi's response as "the type of bold fighting attitude Democrats will need to WIN in 2012." <br> "This proposal is simply unacceptable," said Pelosi. <br> "Any final proposal from the Commission should do what is right for our children and grandchildren's economic security as well as for our nation's fiscal security, and it must do what is right for our seniors, who are counting on the bedrock promises of Social Security and Medicare. And it must strengthen America's middle class families-under siege for the last decade, and unable to withstand further encroachment on their economic security." <br> Those were themes echoed by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who said: "The chairmen of the Deficit Commission just told working Americans to 'Drop Dead.' Especially in these tough economic times, it is unconscionable to be proposing cuts to the critical economic lifelines for working people, Social Security and Medicare. Some people are saying this plan is just a 'starting point.' Let me be clear, it is not. This deficit talk reeks of rank hypocrisy: The very people who want to slash Social Security and Medicare spent this week clamoring for more unpaid Bush tax cuts for millionaires." <br> "What we need to be focusing on now is the jobs deficit," Trumka continued. "Working families already paid for Wall Street's party that tanked our economy. If we actually want to address our economic problems, we need to end tax breaks that send American jobs overseas and invest in creating jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and green technologies." <br> Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Ral M. Grijalva, also focused on the need to scrap the Bush tax cuts. "Real budget reform must begin by allowing the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest two percent of earners to expire, as they were always designed to do. This would reduce the debt by at least $680 billion over the next ten years, according to the Department of the Treasury," he said. "The middle class has already been hit extremely hard by the ongoing economic downturn and the housing crisis. The last thing we should do is take more money out of their pockets in the name of a conservative tax cut agenda that favors the wealthy over the rest of us."Grijalva was harsh in his criticism of the commission's approach. <br> "If the co-chairs of the deficit commission were dead set on gutting Social Security and Medicare from the beginning, they could have saved time and effort by releasing this proposal the day after the commission was formed. Instead, we have waited through nine months of backroom negotiations only to be told that the American people will have to tighten their belts another notch while defense spending continues to grow and corporate bonuses continue to expand," he said. "The path this plan would set is not good for the public. Congress should be having a realistic, productive conversation right now about how to reduce our budget deficit and maintain a secure retirement system for those who have earned it. Instead, we're debating a proposal from a commission dedicated to cutting crucial social programs and reducing corporate and upper-income taxes at the same time. This is not a recipe for a healthier American economy." <br> US Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, promised a fight. <br> "The Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan is extremely disappointing and something that should be vigorously opposed by the American people. The huge increase in the national debt in recent years was caused by two unpaid wars, tax breaks for the wealthy, a Medicare prescription drug bill written by the pharmaceutical industry, and the Wall Street bailout. Unlike Social Security, none of these proposals were paid for. Not only has Social Security not contributed a dime to the deficit, it has a $2.6 trillion surplus," argued Sanders. <br> "It is reprehensible to ask working people, including many who do physically-demanding labor, to work until they are 69 years of age. It also is totally impractical. As they compete for jobs with 25-year-olds, many older workers will go unemployed and have virtually no income. Frankly, there will not be too much demand within the construction industry for 69-year-old bricklayers," explained Sanders. "Despite all of the right-wing rhetoric, Social Security is not going bankrupt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Social Security can pay every nickel owed to every eligible American for the next 29 years and after that about 80 percent of benefits."The senator outlined a better plan for saving Social Security-and the US economy. <br> "If we are serious about making Social Security strong and solvent for the next 75 years, President Obama has the right solution. On October 14, 2010, he restated a long-held position that the cap on income subject to Social Security payroll taxes, now at $106,800, should be raised. As the president has long stated, it is absurd that billionaires pay the same amount into the system as someone who earns $106,800," said Sanders. "With the richest people in this country getting richer and the middle class in decline, it is absurd that billionaires pay the same amount into the Social Security system as someone who earns $106,800." <br> Sanders is right. And President Obama needs to recognize that fact.To help him do so, MoveOn.org has launched a campaign to: "Tell [President Obama] that Americans will not stand for this Deficit Commission report and he must reject it immediately." <br> "If we want to get serious about the deficit, we need to get the economy growing again, and make sure the richest 2 percent of Americans pay their fair share. Instead, this plan cuts taxes for the rich and corporations substantially," argues MoveOn. "Slashing health care for seniors and veterans, and cutting Social Security benefits for millions of folks who are struggling, all to pay for lower taxes for the rich is just plain wrong." <br> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. <br> By John Nichols Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Robert Lipsyte is a former New York Times sports columnist and Jock Culture correspondent for TomDispatch.com. His memoir, An Accidental Sportswriter, will be published next year. This article originally appeared on TomDispatch.<hr width="50%">Old sportswriters are always being asked for tips on big games. Here's one for the biggest game on the schedule: never vote for a jock. <br> This is particularly good advice in a political season whose starting line-up includes Chris Dudley, a former NBA back-up center running for governor of Oregon; Linda McMahon, co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment running for senator from Connecticut; and Heath Shuler, a former NFL quarterback, scrambling for a third-term as a member of the House from North Carolina. They are already campaigning to fit into the woeful tradition of Jim Bunning, Jesse Ventura, Tom Osborne, and Vinegar Bend Mizell, athletic role models whose narcissism, ignorance, and conservatism helped them make a seamless transition from entertaining people to exploiting them. <br> Keep in mind that the sports-industrial complex tends to produce narrow-minded, self-centered, ethically-challenged mercenaries who are deeply submissive to established authority while being fiercely dedicated to winning by any means possible. Or as one of my old political advisors, Sam Hall Kaplan, a former New York Times and Los Angeles Times reporter, puts it: "A pol who learned as an athlete just who ultimately butters his bread can be counted on to continue to wave to the crowds while doing the bidding of the owners." And the owners these days, thanks to the umpires (...er, Supreme Court) are likely to be unnamed billionaire warlords donating to rightwing candidates through dummy organizations that have no requirement to open their books to the voters. <br> Let's get this year's rare exception to my No-Jock mandate out of the way right now. Alan Page, running again for Associate Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, is that rare all-star on the field and on the high bench. <br> As Jay Weiner, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816670382/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">This Is Not Florida: How Al Franken Won the Minnesota Senate Recount</em>, reminds us: "One of the wisest and most pointed legal opinions to come out of the recount" of that embattled 2008 election was written by "a picture of Black Robed Dignity" who had once been a "Purple People Eater." Defensive tackle Page had a 15-season National Football League Hall of Fame career, mostly with the Minnesota Vikings on that fearsome purple-uniformed defensive line.Two other Democrats, both out of office now, once earned my own grateful votes -- New York Governor Mario Cuomo (minor league baseball) and Senator Bill Bradley (two championships with the New York Knicks).<br>But after that, a team of losers. <br> Mostly Republican, Mostly Busts <br> Leading off our sorry starting line-up for 2012 is Heath Shuler, a Blue Dog Democrat and real-estate investor. He was also a former Washington Redskins and New Orleans Saints quarterback, rated by ESPN in 2004 as the fourth-biggest NFL draft bust of all time and the 17th biggest "sports flop" of the past 25 years. Of course, those are not good enough reasons to vote against him (unless you happened to root for one of his teams).But here's a good reason: his vote against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because health-care reform could be detrimental to the economy. He was for what he termed "common-sense incremental change" which, in reality, meant slowing the game down until time runs out. <br> Of further concern is Shuler's membership in "The Family," that creepy D.C. frat of evangelical Christian right-wingers like Senators Tom Coburn and Jim DeMint, and Congressmen Zach Wamp and Bart Stupak, and such hypocritical God-Squadders as John Ensign, Chip Pickering, and Mark Sanford. Shuler has bunked down in their infamous locker room, the so-called "C Street house." Jeff Sharlet, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316091073/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">C Street: The Fundamentalist Threat to American Democracy</em>, writes about The Family's "explicit dedication to the ruling class" in America and abroad, and also links the group to Uganda's murderous anti-homosexuality bill. <br> Shuler may be an even worse politician than he was a pro athlete. His predecessors in the Jock House, all Republicans, were certainly a mixed bag. Jack Kemp, an MVP quarterback in the old American Football League, who twice led the Buffalo Bills to the championship, served nine terms. A basically decent and intelligent man, Bush the First's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Bob Dole's vice-presidential running mate, Kemp was a Reagan supply-sider whose major piece of legislation, the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut, helped put the trickle in trickle-down economics while the guys up top enjoyed the waterfall. <br> After Kemp, the roster only grows weaker with Wilmer (Vinegar Bend) Mizell, a left-hander in his nine-year major league pitching career and a right-winger in three terms from North Carolina; Jim Ryun, one of the world's greatest milers and one of the most conservative Kansans to reach the Congressional Oz since Toto ran the Yellow Brick Road; and Tom Osborne, a former NFL wide receiver who, before scoring his House seat, coached Nebraska for 25 years, famously with stars who should have been in jail. (He once asked me, "Would you rather they were on my team or in your neighborhood?") As a three-term representative, he received a lifetime rating of 83 from the American Conservative Union. <br> The Big Boys <br> Back to the jock-pol lowlights of 2012: Chris Dudley was a strong rebounder and shot blocker for several teams over 16 seasons, a tribute to his athleticism, but he was also the NBA's all-time second-worst foul shooter (the mark of a weak work ethic), setting the league record for 13 missed free throws in a row. This is not a good enough reason to vote against him for governor of Oregon.And the jury (actually it's an IRS matter at the moment) is out on the $350,000 tax deduction he took for allowing a local fire department to burn down a 4,500-square-foot house on his property. He later built an 8,500-square-foot home on that scorched earth plot and so ignited a campaign controversy: Was it legal or just another example of an entitled jock bending the rules? <br> Still, no blatant foul. Yet. <br> On the other hand, his positions on the environment and the minimum wage put him out of bounds -- or rather, when it comes to the environment, his studiously ominous lack of a position. Throughout his campaign he has dodged questions about natural resources and global warming ("Global warming exists. And mankind contributes. How much? I don't know") for a good reason: timber and agricultural interests are his major financial backers. According to Jeff Mapes in the Oregonian, "Jon Isaacs of the Oregon League of Conservation Voters noted that in addition to supporting higher logging levels, Dudley has said he is against a permanent ban on oil drilling off the Oregon coast and opposes Ballot Measure 76, which would continue the 15% diversion from lottery profits for parks and wildlife habitat." <br> Like most jocks, Dudley is not sensitive to the people in the grandstands. He can say (or joke?) that he understands "minority" concerns, having been a white man in the predominately black NBA, and he can say, "It doesn't make sense that our waitresses are getting tips plus the highest minimum wage in the country." Not exactly slam dunks, either of them.At 6 feet 11 inches tall, Dudley's height puts him in the same league with at least two oversized jock-governors, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura, who initially rose through the ranks of sports, and may yet encourage Charles Barkley to run for governor of Alabama in 2014 as he has promised/threatened for years. Currently a sportscaster, Barkley is an NBA Hall of Famer and, more important for a politician, a member of the media's all-interview team. He's best known for a Nike ad in which he said, "I am not a role model." <br> Hall Kaplan, who covered Schwarzenegger's first gubernatorial campaign for a local Los Angeles TV station, sums up the Gubernator's California years this way: "The jock's need to dominate and to win at any costs certainly applies to his term of office. He has shown little initiative and little imagination, while playing to the crowds and the cronies. Particularly onerous has been the deep cuts in public education while declining to face up to the need for progressive tax reform."Weiner, who had a close-up view of Ventura while working as a reporter at the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, summed up the former Minnesota governor, Dudley's other potential role model, this way: he "could not separate the faux professional wrestling world from the real political and public policy world. To him, all the world was a stage and not the hard work of compromise. You just don't strike deals with Hulk Hogan, ya know. You win or you lose, or you jump off the ropes and cause a stir. Or, as Ventura did, you leave the political arena because you're not the center of attention anymore." 
 Noam Scheiber is a senior editor of The New Republic.<br>There are moments when Scott Brown evokes a 12-year-old boy who woke up one day in a politician's body-as if the Tom Hanks character in Big had asked that fortune-telling machine for a Senate seat. He certainly has the 12-year-old's vernacular. <br> Stumping for John McCain at a small Christian college in March, the junior senator from Massachusetts opined, "If you told me five months ago that I'd be standing here in front of you, I would say, 'You're full of it.''' He also has the 12-year-old's gee-whiz sensibility. After learning that he'd made Time magazine's list of the world's 100 most powerful people, Brown exclaimed to The Boston Globe, "I didn't realize it was in the world. Lady Gaga's number four, so let's be real.'' <br> As a senator, he seems most excited by activities that appeal to the prepubescent mind. "As soon as his hip gets better, we're going to do some bike-riding,'' he said in April when asked about his relationship with his new buddy, John Kerry. <br> So let's stipulate that Brown isn't the most sophisticated member of the U.S. Senate, and that he isn't likely to distinguish himself for his intellectual heft. (A "lack of command on some policy details" is how his hometown paper puts it.) He is nonetheless self-aware enough to realize that he is uniquely well-positioned to influence policy in Congress. "So, last night I got off the plane and then Tim Geithner calls me on the phone," he said in a recent radio interview. "He just called me a minute ago, too. Obviously, I am the key vote.'' <br> In fact, Brown is almost certainly understating his influence. As the 41st Republican in an institution that requires 60 out of 100 votes to pass legislation, he's had the power to stop, or at least massively slow down, everything from health care to financial reform. But Brown actually looms much larger than even this calculus would suggest. In his concerns, priorities, and, maybe most important, his confusion about the economy, Brown has come to represent the average voter in 2010. If Democrats are going to be successful this November, they'll have to figure out a way to seize the territory that Brown currently holds. <br> A recent Globe poll illustrates the point nicely, crowning Brown the most popular politician in his overwhelmingly Democratic state. According to the poll, Brown's favorable/unfavorable split is 55-18, versus 52-37 for Kerry and 54-41 for Barack Obama. Brown accomplishes this feat on the strength of his appeal to independents (55-11) and a surprisingly robust showing among Democrats (41-32). Given that Democratic candidates are highly unlikely to win many Republican votes this fall, they'll have to limit their defections among Democrats and carry independents in order to hold Congress. Judged against Brown's performance in Massachusetts, they are currently failing at this task. <br> Granted, Brown's celebrity explains part of his appeal. He was a nobody who, against all odds, won what was effectively a two-man race with the president in January-with the whole world looking on. The sheer cinematic quality of this victory-and, let's face it, his good looks-made him a household name. <br> Still, it would be a mistake to dismiss Brown's popularity as a function of his checkout-counter-mag cache. In fact, Brown has been following a simple formula for building public support as a Republican: Toe as right-wing a line as you can without alienating the political middle. To take the subject of his interactions with Tim Geithner, Brown has used his influence as a pivotal Senate vote to extract loopholes for financial firms (like easing restrictions on their investments in hedge funds) and to beat back a tax on big banks. But, in the end, there's little doubt he'll embrace the financial reform bill. In a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, voters said they'd be more likely to back a member of Congress who supported the bill by a 53-29 margin. (There's no polling data available for Massachusetts, but the margin would presumably be even more skewed there.) No surprise, then, that Brown told a local TV station over the Fourth of July break that "he's liking what I see" on the final compromise. <br> Brown's approach to the economy is far more interesting. When the NBC poll asked respondents what the federal government's top priority should be, "job creation and economic growth" ranked first with 33 percent, well ahead of "the Gulf Coast oil spill and energy" (22 percent), and the "deficit and government spending" (15 percent). Predictably, Brown has sometimes supported legislation that would ease voters' concerns about jobs. One of his first acts as a senator was to vote for a $15-billion Democratic measure giving companies a payroll tax-break if they hire unemployed workers. <br> More often, though, Brown has used voters' labor market anxieties as cover for opposing legislation, not supporting it. Like other Republicans (and some Democrats), he protested during the health care debate that Congress should fix its attention on jobs instead. In June, when the president invited him to the Oval Office to take his temperature on cap-and-trade, Brown replied that he wanted to keep the focus on jobs. And so on. <br> Perhaps most intriguingly of all, Brown has sometimes exploited anxiety about jobs as a reason to oppose jobs-related legislation. In doing so, he's picked up on a paradox that defines the political zeitgeist: Even though Americans are more concerned about jobs than anything else, they don't seem to appreciate the factors that help create them. In the same NBC poll in which voters overwhelmingly say jobs should be the government's top priority, they also say, by nearly a two-to-one margin, that they'd prefer the government attend to the deficit even if it delays the economic recovery. So, according to the poll, voters care much more about jobs than the deficit, but much more about the deficit than the economy. Where exactly are the jobs supposed to come from? 
 James K. Galbraith is author of The Predator State: How Conservatives Abandoned the Free Market and Why Liberals Should Too. He teaches at The University of Texas at Austin.<center><br><br>The financial crisis in America isn't over. It's ongoing, it remains unresolved, and it stands in the way of full economic recovery. The cause, at the deepest level, was a breakdown in the rule of law. And it follows that the first step toward prosperity is to restore the rule of law in the financial sector. <br> First, there was a stand-down of the financial police. The legal framework for this was laid with the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 and the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000. Meanwhile the Basel II process relaxed international bank supervision, especially permitting the use of proprietary models to value complex assets-an open invitation to biased valuations and accounting frauds. <br> Key acts of de-supervision came under Bush. After 9/11 500 FBI agents assigned to financial fraud were reassigned to counter-terrorism and (what is not understandable) they were never replaced. The Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision appeared at a press conference with a stack of copies of the Code of Federal Regulations and a chainsaw-the message was not subtle. The SEC relaxed limits on leverage for investment banks and abolished the uptick rule limiting short sales to moments following a rise in price. The new order was clear: anything goes. <br> Second, the response to desupervision was a criminal takeover of the home mortgage industry. Millions of subprime mortgages were made to borrowers with undocumented incomes and bad or non-existent credit records. Appraisers were selected who were willing to inflate the value of the home being sold. This last element was not incidental: surveys showed that practically all appraisers came under pressure to inflate valuations in order to make deals happen. There is no honest reason why a lender would deliberately seek to make an inflated loan. <br> Mortgages were made with a two-or three-year grace period, with a low, fixed interest rate called a "teaser." These were not real mortgages; they were counterfeits, whose value would collapse when exposed. As with any counterfeit, the profits came early, when the bad paper was first sold. <br> After the grace period, rates would reset, and the lenders knew that the borrowers, who were already stretched by their initial payments, would either refinance or default. If they refinanced, that would mean another mortgage origination fee. And if they defaulted, well ... on to step three. <br> Third, the counterfeit mortgages were laundered so they would look to investors like the real thing. This was the role of the ratings agencies. The core competence of the raters lay in corporate debt, where they evaluate the record and prospects of large business firms. The value of mortgage bonds depended on the behavior of tens of thousands of individual borrowers, whose individual quality the ratings agencies could never check. So the agencies substituted statistical models for actual inquiry, and turned a blind eye to the fact that the loans were destined to go bad. <br> Fourth, the laundered goods were taken to market. The investment and commercial banks transformed the bad mortgages into bonds, obtained the AAA ratings, and sold the stinking mess to American pension funds, European banks and anyone else who took the phrase "investment grade" at face value. (Later chumps would include the Federal Reserve.) The European crisis now underway is a direct result, as their banks and investors, stung by losses on American mortgage bonds, are dumping their risky Greek public debt and seeking the safety of U.S. Treasury bills. <br> When the crisis went public in August 2007, Henry Paulson's Treasury took every step to prevent the final collapse from happening before the 2008 elections, extracting billions from the Federal Housing Authority and from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to relieve the pressure on bank balance sheets. It worked until it didn't. In September 2008 the collapse of Lehman triggered the collapse of American International Group (AIG) and the steps that led to the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and to the effective nationalization of the commercial paper market, meaning that the Federal Reserve has become the primary short-term funder of major American corporations. <br> Upon taking office, President Obama had a chance to change course and didn't take it. By seizing the largest problem banks, the government could have achieved clean audits, replaced top management, cured destructive compensation practices, shrunk a bloated industry, and cut the banks' lobbying power and therefore their capacity to obstruct financial reform. The way to write-downs of bad mortgage debt and therefore to financial recovery would have been opened. 
 Irwin M. Stelzer is a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard, director of economic policy studies at the Hudson Institute, and a columnist for the Sunday Times (London).<br>We are all Greeks now. Or so it would seem if we are guided by the gyrations of share prices. Or if we believe that today's Greece is tomorrow's United States. <br> After all, we are running Grecian-style deficits, our debt-to-GDP ratio is approaching the magic 90 percent mark that stifles growth and makes it more difficult to bring the budget deficit under control, and the effective U.S. tax rate on new corporate investment is estimated by economists Duanjie Chen and Jack Mintz of the University of Calgary in Canada to be almost twice an 80-nation average. With no room to raise taxes, and no political will to cut outlays, it is not unreasonable to worry that America might decide to print money to pay off its creditors, triggering inflation. <br> At a minimum, the Greek tragedy has focused attention on America's river of red ink, even though the parallels are far from exact.Worse still, analysts have begun to explore the extent of U.S. exposure to Europe's problems. The Bank for International Settlements says American banks hold more than $1 trillion in European debt, and J.P. Morgan's economists estimate that the eurozone accounts for 14 percent of U.S. exports. The question now, and one that can't be answered until the fog lifts over Athens and Brussels, and we have a better grasp on the eurozone's policy response to its problems, is whether what is going on in Europe will roll out across the world just as the seemingly tiny problem of sub-prime mortgages engulfed the world economy. <br> The feeling around Wall Street is that the European Central Bank is being too slow to follow the UK and the U.S. policy of quantitative easing, that the eurocracy is unable to respond quickly to a crisis, and that therefore the danger of contagion, as it is called, is very real, with even the U.S.'s stronger economy at risk of infection. My own view is that we are having a crisis of confidence, which will ease as the reality of the recovery trumps the fear of Greeks bearing dicey IOUs. <br> Pity that this new nervousness about Europe, to which we can add concern that the Chinese regime is engineering an economic slowdown to head off the bursting of a credit bubble, is taking some of the shine off the recovery now clearly underway in the U.S. The jobs situation has turned around. Last month some 290,000 new jobs were created, about 230,000 of them in the private sector. The job creation data for February and March were re-estimated: The initial report that 148,000 jobs were created in those months has been upgraded to 269,000. The improved job market has attracted an additional 805,000 people into the Labour market, which explains the uptick in the unemployment rate from 9.7 percent in March to 9.9 percent in April. That is typical of an economic recovery. <br> President Obama rushed to the television cameras to announce these gains, as always pointing out that "there is more work [read: 'spending'] to be done." Since some 17.1 percent of all workers are either looking for jobs or too discouraged to continue doing so, he is in the nice position of taking credit for the progress, while leaving the door open to further stimulus measures. <br> Jobs Picture Brightening <br> The jobs market, of course, reflects what is going on in the economy, which seems to be in the midst of a broad-ranging recovery, albeit in some instances from a very low base. The Institute of Supply Management reports sharp increases in manufacturing output and new orders, and public sector outlays drove the construction index up a bit -- good news for a troubled sector, bad news for taxpayers who will have to foot the bill for many projects that don't add very much to the nation's wealth. <br> The auto industry is seeing sales pick up, with Ford leading the way after having refused government handouts. But sales have not picked up enough to head off the likely return of discounts and special deals this summer. The auto recovery is rolling out into other industries, most obviously makers of parts such as emissions control devices. Don't celebrate quite yet: Chrysler is still losing money, and GM has yet to repay $50 billion of the funds received from the government last year. Toyota has its much-publicized quality and safety problems. Still, the outlook is infinitely better than it has been for years, which is good news for media companies that have sorely missed the heavy advertising programs of the car makers. <br> Auto showrooms are not the only places enjoying greater consumer traffic. Consumers are snapping up appliances, the iPad's sales of one million units being the most publicized. A survey by the National Association of Business Economists found that 57 percent of respondents are experiencing an increase in demand, while only 6 percent say demand is falling. <br> Good News, Bad News <br> There is more good news from companies reporting profits increases and shops and malls experiencing an increase in traffic. Enough, in fact, to make a one-handed economist smile happily. Unfortunately, there are few such, so there is the inevitable "on the other hand." The housing market has been benefiting from tax breaks for new home buyers and support of the mortgage market by the Federal Reserve Board and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, aptly called GSEs, government supported enterprises. The tax break has expired, the Fed is reducing its support of the mortgage market, and Freddie Mac, the nation's second-largest provider of residential mortgage funds, is asking congress for an additional $10.6 billion in federal aid after losing $6.7 billion in the first quarter of this year. Just how much all of this will affect the very tentative recovery in the housing market only a braver man than this writer would predict. <br> Then there are the problems created by a wildly expansive fiscal policy. The current recovery would be threatened if interest rates were to rise significantly. That is not outside the realm of possibility, given our ongoing deficits, investors' worries about sovereign debt, and the rating agencies' warnings that the U.S. had better get its house in order or face a downgrade. <br> Add to this the virtual certainty that when the president's debt reduction commission reports in December -- not coincidentally after the November elections -- it will recommend tax increases that will be piled on top of the added costs small and medium-size businesses face from the health care "reform." Not a recipe for rapid growth. <br> Still, economists at Goldman Sachs are predicting that the current 3 percent growth rate, after falling to 1.5 percent in the second half of this year, will re-accelerate to the 2.5 -3.5 percent range in 2011, as "Fed policy remains easy and the multiplier effects from earlier fiscal policies are still rippling through the economy." Which doesn't speak too well for prospects after the Fed tightens and Obama is forced to reduce deficit spending. But that's for later. Now, spring is sprung, the economy is on the move, and Greece remains far away. <br> (The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.) <br> By Irwin Stelzer: Reprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard

Steven Attewell is a doctoral student in the history of public policy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br>Will the passage of healthcare reform provide a boost to Obama's popularity and the chances of holding on to a Democratic majority in the fall? The question preys on the minds of many progressives, even those who find the White House lacking in zeal for causes on the left. <br> The alternative would mean polarization, at best. At worst, it could be a return to the dark days of Republican rule from which we have escaped all too recently. To be sure, the failure to pass the healthcare bill would have been a catastrophe. The measure was a significant test for the base of the Democratic Party. Could a leadership that stumbled badly on the banks, mortgage cramdowns and credit card regulation actually provide something of tangible benefit to the working people of this nation? <br> Before this victory, Obama's position was not unlike that of Roosevelt as he approached his first midterm in 1934. FDR stabilized the banking system through a more conservative series of reforms (the banking holiday, the Emergency Banking Act and Glass-Steagall) than many had hoped for; he succeeded in passing legislation that was supposed to address the recession systematically (the Agricultural Adjustment Act and National Industrial Recovery Act roughly paralleling the stimulus bill in terms of what they were supposed to accomplish). <br> But these policy victories notwithstanding, FDR hadn't addressed the needs of the more than 10 million unemployed. His answer to this critique came in the fall of 1933 with the creation of the Civil Works Administration, which under the leadership of Harry Hopkins succeeded in directly employing 4.3 million people between Thanksgiving of 1933 and 1934. While the CWA was only a temporary program, it sent a message to workers who had voted for a New Deal in 1932 that the president was trying to make a difference for them. <br> Heading into the midterm elections of 2010, Obama has something concrete to show for his leadership, and that cannot be discounted. What matters more than anything at this juncture is how quickly the concrete benefits of healthcare reform start to flow to the millions of Americans in desperate need of help. Many of the bill's most important provisions do not kick in for many years, but others--the elimination of pre-existing conditions, the ability to enroll dependent children up to the age of 26--will be in effect by September, and they speak to the needs of middle-class voters, who have to be kept in the political fold. Whether this will be enough is hard to say. <br> Social Security was passed in 1935, but the benefits it promised did not start to flow until 1940 for the small first group of retirees. It was not until the '50s that something approximating universal coverage became a reality, and even today nonworkers are not covered in their own right. African-Americans were robbed of Social Security benefits, even if they had worked all their lives, because the exclusions that were built into the original legislation to placate Southern politicians who threatened to veto the whole package were not reversed for decades. <br> As it happens, Social Security was fairly popular from its inception, largely because it was sold as a contributory insurance policy rather than a "handout" or act of charity toward the elderly poor and because it offered something for (almost) everyone. But it took time before it was fixed in the social policy firmament to the point where its opponents were silenced. Some of them are still with us, as the proposals for privatization demonstrated not long ago. <br> Once American families begin to depend on the safety net--whether for retirement, higher education or healthcare--the popularity of these provisions becomes very hard to diminish, even by those committed to unraveling them. This is, no doubt, why opponents of healthcare reform are so eager to snarl it up in the courts or rally the base for repeal. They too are students of history. They know that if American families start to rely on these new forms of health insurance, to factor them into their household ledgers, the reforms will become entrenched to the point of no return. <br> In the meantime, we can expect a high level of conflict, obfuscation, court challenges and tea parties designed to rally the conservative base and delay the implementation of healthcare reform. This too is a familiar story. Indeed, virtually every episode in the development of the American welfare state has been surrounded by contentious politics, and in many instances the opposition won the day. <br> Historical Precedent <br> In the 1940s FDR and New Deal Democrats hoped to establish universal healthcare and a "cradle to grave" welfare state through the Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill. But they were torpedoed by Congressional opposition, as was the establishment of a "right to a job" when the Full Employment bill was gutted in committee. Harry Truman's Fair Deal--which sought to build on the New Deal by including healthcare, public housing and a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission to prevent racial discrimination--was largely blocked by a Republican Congress. <br> But it wasn't just the political class that split over the New Deal. Ordinary middle-class citizens were deeply torn as well. Much as they wanted FDR to save them from the ravages of the Depression, those on the left saw him as tepid and too cozy with employers. They denounced Roosevelt for lowering wages, failing to nationalize the banks and edging away from his commitment to "the forgotten man." <br> On the "ordinary" right, farmers in the heartland who avoided the relief rolls decried their neighbors who accepted public benefits (other than Agricultural Adjustment Administration checks), while small shopkeepers and accountants bemoaned the loss of tax dollars from their paychecks to support the indolent even as they filled the grocery orders paid for by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. Opinion polls from the 1930s make it clear that a majority of the country was sure that the unemployed could find work if they really wanted it. Most of all, the rejection of cash relief, of any policy that smacked of support for the able-bodied nonworker, was nearly universal. Public employment was more widely embraced and grew in popularity as the ravages of the Depression left fewer and fewer alternatives in the labor market. <br> As historians like Jason Scott Smith have noted, programs like the Works Progress Administration were often embraced by people who were otherwise hostile to government expenditures. Many moderate and conservative voters adopted the reverse NIMBY view that other New Deal projects might be wasteful boondoggles but the WPA project in their district was indispensable. We can see the modern echo of this attitude in conservative Republicans who voted against the stimulus bill as a spending orgy but were happy to hand out giant cardboard checks in their home districts for projects financed from stimulus funds. <br> Similar objections to social programs were raised during the Johnson years. Medicare was probably the most important innovation of the Great Society, but when Johnson worked overtime to pass the original legislation, public support for the idea waffled. In 1962, 70 percent of Democrats and 48 percent of Republicans surveyed in the National Election Studies thought that "government ought to help people get doctors and hospital care at low cost." By 1964, when a historic Medicare proposal passed in the Senate, Democratic support had declined to 60 percent and Republicans weighed in with 29 percent. The same survey asked respondents if they preferred providing health insurance for the elderly by allowing them to buy private plans or if they thought government should finance a program through Social Security. In 1962, 55 percent supported the idea of government-financed health plans; by 1965, that number had dropped to 46 percent. Eventually, however, as people began to rely on the program's benefits, support began to build. Today, Medicare garners strong and steady backing from the public. Indeed, it is a "third rail" that politicians approach at their peril. Obama's Republican opponents vowed to prevent even a single dollar in cuts to Medicare, and tea party protesters shouted, "Keep your government hands off my Medicare!" <br> For some time to come we can expect the firestorm of opposition to healthcare reform that is unfolding today to persist, even from people who stand to benefit from the provisions of the new law. The rose-colored glasses through which we sometimes view the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society often obscure how contentious the debates were or how long they continued after the passage of key legislation. We should not be deterred by the noise coming out of the tea party. The weight of history is against them. <br> (The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.)By Katherine S.

 P.J. O'Rourke, a contributing editor toThe Weekly Standard, is author, most recently, of Driving Like Crazy. <br> Barack Obama is more irritating than the other nuisances on the left. Nancy Pelosi needs a session on the ducking stool, of course. But everyone with an ugly divorce has had a Nancy. She's vexatious and expensive to get rid of, but it's not like we give a damn about her. Harry Reid is going house-to-house selling nothing anybody wants. Slam the door on him and the neighbor's Rottweiler will do the rest. And Barney Frank is self-punishing. Imagine being trapped inside Barney Frank. <br> The secret to the Obama annoyance is snotty lecturing. His tone of voice sends us back to the worst place in college. We sit once more packed into the vast, dreary confines of a freshman survey course-"Rocks for Jocks," "Nuts and Sluts," "Darkness at Noon." At the lectern is a twerp of a grad student-the prototypical A student-insecure, overbearing, full of himself and contempt for his students. All we want is an easy three credits to fulfill a curriculum requirement in science, social science, or fine arts. We've got a mimeographed copy of last year's final with multiple choice answers already written on our wrists. The grad student could skip his classes, the way we intend to, but there the s.o.b. is, taking attendance. (How else to explain this year's census?) <br> America has made the mistake of letting the A student run things. It was A students who briefly took over the business world during the period of derivatives, credit swaps, and collateralized debt obligations. We're still reeling from the effects. This is why good businessmen have always adhered to the maxim: "A students work for B students." Or, as a businessman friend of mine put it, "B students work for C students-A students teach."It was a bunch of A students at the Defense Department who planned the syllabus for the Iraq war, and to hell with what happened to the Iraqi Class of '03 after they'd graduated from Shock and Awe. <br> The U.S. tax code was written by A students. Every April 15 we have to pay somebody who got an A in accounting to keep ourselves from being sent to jail. <br> First Taxes, then Health Care <br> Now there's health care reform-just the kind of thing that would earn an A on a term paper from that twerp of a grad student who teaches Econ 101. <br> Why are A students so hateful? I'm sure up at Harvard, over at the New York Times, and inside the White House they think we just envy their smarts. Maybe we are resentful clods gawking with bitter incomprehension at the intellectual magnificence of our betters. If so, why are our betters spending so much time nervously insisting that they're smarter than Sarah Palin and the Tea Party movement? They are. You can look it up (if you have a fancy education the way our betters do and know what the unabridged Oxford English Dictionary is). <br> "Smart" has its root in the Old English word for being a pain. The adjective has eight other principal definitions ranging from "brisk" to "fashionable" to "neat." Only two definitions indicate cleverness-smart as in "clever in talk" and smart as in "clever in looking after one's own interests." Don't get smart with me. <br> The other objection to A students is what it takes to become one-toad-eating. A students must do what teachers and textbooks want and do it the way teachers and texts want it done. Neatness counts! A students are very busy. <br> Such brisk apple-polishing happens to be an all-too-good preparation for politics. This is because a student's success at education and a politician's success at politics are measured mostly by input rather than outcome. Yes, one got elected. Yes, the other became class valedictorian. But to what end? It can take decades to measure the outcome of an education. Did the A student at architecture school become a respected partner at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, or did he become Albert Speer? Likewise with politics. Did Woodrow Wilson's meddling in Europe wreak havoc upon the globe? We wouldn't know for 20 years. Did Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal totally destroy the fabric of American society? We're not absolutely certain even now. Meanwhile Woodrow Wilson, FDR, the class valedictorian, and Albert Speer were inputting like crazy. <br> </poll> <br> The C student starts a restaurant. The A student writes restaurant reviews. The input-worshipping universe of the New York Times is like New York itself-thousands of restaurant reviews and no place we can afford to eat.Let us allow that some intelligence is involved in screwing up Wall Street, Washington, and the world. A students and Type-A politicians do discover an occasional new element-Obscurantium-or pass an occasional piece of landmark legislation (of which the health care reform bill is not one). <br> Smart people have their uses, but our country doesn't belong to them. As the not-too-smart Woody Guthrie said, "This land was made for you and me." The smart set stayed in fashionable Europe, where everything was nice and neat and people were clever about looking after their own interests and didn't need to come to America. The Mayflower was full of C students. Their idea was that, given freedom, responsibility, rule of law and some elbow room, the average, the middling, and the mediocre could create the richest, most powerful country ever. <br> Thus in America nobody loves a smart-ass. What's interesting about Obama is that he didn't start out being one. Lips (and academic records) are sealed at Occidental College and Columbia, but Obama doesn't seem to have been an A student as an undergraduate. He learned to "make it or fake it" at Harvard Law where he graduated magna cum laude. Worse than an A student is somebody pretending to be one, witness Al Gore.However, perhaps I should hold my tongue and temper my ire. I have just received my junior high school daughter's report card. She's an A student. I questioned her, and it turns out so is every one of her girlfriends including the numbskull jock and the complete feather-brain who's besotted with Justin Bieber. <br> I can't imagine what kind of input my daughter's school is measuring (although I assume my daughter delivers it via Twitter). But when input is valued enough, America turns into that blissful land of social justice so desired by Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and Barney Frank-outcomes are equal at last. I'm old-fashioned in my criticism of Barack Obama. He graduated from Harvard Law in the 1990s, barely yesterday. I'd forgotten the wonderful progressiveness of the American educational system. We're all A students now. <br> (The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.)By P.J. O'Rourke: Reprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard 
 Noam Scheiber is a senior editor of The New Republic.<hr width="50%">Ever since George W. Bush massively cut taxes back in 2001, squandering much of the $5.6 trillion, ten-year surplus he inherited from Bill Clinton, liberals have assumed that the fiscal game was rigged. Conservatives had been explicit about their starve-the-beast strategy-the practice of creating large deficits through tax cuts in order to force future spending cuts. By playing along, the thinking went, Democrats would only further enable irresponsible behavior-a bit like negotiating with terrorists. Why kill yourself balancing the budget, as Bill Clinton did, if the next Republican is just going to slash taxes again? <br> The fear of conservative high jinks persists to this day, which is one reason liberals have responded coolly to President Obama's deficit-cutting commission. In fact, many suspect the right is up to something even more sinister-a "doubling down on starve-the-beast," as Paul Krugman<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/opinion/22krugman.html?em=pagewanted=print" target="_blank">put it recently. "Depriving the government of revenue, it turns out, wasn't enough to push politicians into dismantling the welfare state," Krugman wrote. "So now the de facto strategy is to oppose any responsible action until we are in the midst of a fiscal catastrophe."Krugman is almost certainly onto something. I suspect, as he does, that Republicans believe precipitating a fiscal crisis will force Democrats to roll back entitlement spending (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security), which would be both politically unpopular and the realization of the right's dearest policy fantasy. It's an altogether brilliant, if diabolical, plan. Except for one minor flaw: There's a good chance it could vaporize the GOP. <br> The thing to keep in mind about economic crises is that parties who solve them tend to survive and even prosper over the long-term, even if they sometimes suffer short-term pain. Conversely, parties who fail to solve them tend to face political calamity. The case of Democrats and Republicans during the Great Depression is the most familiar example, but hardly the only one. In the last decade-and-a-half, persistent economic crises have sent ruling cliques and parties into the wilderness in Indonesia, Argentina, and Turkey. Even in Japan, which effectively had a one-party monopoly since the 1950s, the recurring economic problems of recent years have given the opposition DPJ a chance to govern. The failure of Democrats in the United States and Labor in Britain to address the economic sclerosis of the 1970s helped lay the groundwork for the conservative ascendance of the 1980s. <br> So let's say Republicans keep forcing the country toward the fiscal crisis some of them are quietly rooting for: They refuse to sign off on any package of tax increases and spending cuts while they're out of power, and they insist on cutting taxes when they're in power. At some point, investors in U.S. bonds will presumably decide they're unlikely to be repaid-that the U.S. is either headed toward default or runaway inflation. At that point, interest rates would spike and we'd be in for a deep recession. <br> Now, crises being unpredictable phenomena, let's assume the day of reckoning is just as likely to come during a Democratic administration as a Republican administration. What then? Well, if the bomb goes off under a Democratic president, I suspect the crisis would get solved. The Democratic base doesn't exactly love the idea of cutting entitlement spending-The New York Times<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/us/politics/23fiscal.html?ref=todayspaperpagewanted=print" target="_blank">recently reported that the mere whiff of Social Security benefit cuts had spawned organized progressive opposition, including a well-funded group called "Social Security Works." But the antipathy isn't strong enough, nor is the left powerful enough, to force Democratic politicians to take the option off the table. <br> Indeed, many Democratic moderates, like<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/us/politics/23fiscal.html?ref=todayspaperpagewanted=print" target="_blank">House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and<a href="https://conrad.senate.gov/pressroom/record.cfm?id=276762" target="_blank">Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, have openly mused about the possibility of Social Security benefit cuts. (A handful of these Democratic deficit hawks-including Bill Clinton, Bob Rubin, and Peter Orszag-will be gathering at the Peterson Institute in late April to chew over fiscal fixes.) For that matter, the health care bill Congress just passed includes<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62J1FS20100322" target="_blank">hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare. So far as I can tell, no Democrat is at risk of being primaried for supporting it. <br> Likewise, no one likes to raise taxes, especially no one who depends on moderate voters to get elected. But Democrats have found that raising taxes is hardly political death. Bill Clinton raised taxes as part of his 1993 fiscal package and still cruised to re-election in 1996. Yes, the 1994 midterms weren't exactly an advertisement for the political benefits of tax increases. (Though that year's Democratic route is way over-determined, and I suspect the tax-hikes ranked behind half-a-dozen other causes.) But the point is that a Democrat can both raise taxes as president and live to tell about it. <br> If the GOP's in Charge? <br> On the other hand, what if a Republican is president when the fiscal crisis strikes? To be blunt, I think the economic situation would benearly hopeless.Since 1992, when, according to conservative lore, George H.W. Bush's broken no-new-taxes pledge cost him re-election, basically no national Republican has dared contemplate the possibility of tax increases, much less vote for them. And you can delete the "basically" if you're talking about the last several years. The party's anti-tax jihadis are so influential there's simply no future-or, more precisely, no funding source-for anyone who defies them. <br> Straight-jacked by his or her base, a Republican president facing a fiscal crisis would have to rein in the deficit entirely through spending cuts. But that would be even less doable than raising taxes. In 2005, George W. Bush's presidency effectively ran aground over the cuts he proposed to Social Security. The Gingrich revolution hit a wall a decade earlier over proposed cuts in Medicare. In both cases, the cuts under discussion were far smaller than anything a Republican president would have to embrace if tax increases were a no-go. Long story short: Democrats have enough flexibility with their base, and enough credibility with the political center, to respond to a crisis. The GOP has neither. <br> And then there's the really bad news for the GOP: My assumption that a fiscal crisis is just as likely to strike a Democratic as a Republican administration is almost certainly wrong, for some of the same structural reasons I describe above. Because moderates and fiscal hawks enjoy significant influence within the party-particularly at the elite level-most Democratic administrations are going to make marginal progress on the deficit. Obama is a case in point. Despite his domestic policy ambitions, the recent health care reform modestly pares back the deficit in its first decade, and makespotentially significant inroads in its second decade. Bond traders are likely to reward such moves even if they don't solve the country's deepest fiscal problems. At the very least, the bond markets aren't likely to melt down over them. <br> But Republican administrations can't even make this incremental progress because the pressure on them to cut taxes is too great, and because they have no political cover to cut spending. Worse, the next Republican won't have the one advantage George W. Bush enjoyed, which was an enormous surplus to play with. Which means a future Republican's tax cuts will turn a pretty lousy deficit picture into a dire one. And that, in turn, is very likely to trigger a crisis. After all, the history of such episodes is that once you add a spark to the kindling, you're very quickly engulfed by flames. That's because of the relentlessly self-fulfilling dynamics at work: a certain fraction of bondholders panics and starts selling, which raises interest rates and lowers bond prices, thereby terrifying a broader group of bondholders, who then join the sell-off and on and on until you're Argentina. <br> Of course, we can't be sure about the political fallout. Times change-if nothing else, the news cycle moves a lot faster today than it did in 1970, to say nothing about 1930. Maybe the Republicans would recover after a few years out of power. On the other hand, being the party that's associated forever more with America's own third-world style debt crisis can't exactly be good for the brand. <br> So, yes, like Krugman, I'm concerned that the Republican Party really might cast us into the abyss as part of some spectacularly misguided political strategy. But the one thing I'm emphatically not worried about is that it might somehow help the GOP. <br> By Noam Scheiber: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and editor, most recently, of Makers of Ancient Strategy: From the Persian Wars to the Fall of Rome. <br> President Obama, in the tradition of progressive Democratic leaders, believes governments should ask their countries' more economically fortunate citizens to be responsible for helping the less well-off. <br> But the president seems to fail to acknowledge that there are plenty of actions an individual can take to avoid becoming part of that growing crowd of "less fortunate." Instead, in Obama's world, there exists a simple zero-sum melodrama of victims and oppressors. <br> If recent poll numbers are correct, many Americans find that life in the real world is a lot more complicated than the near-constant us-vs.-them rhetoric about bad-guy insurers, surgery-hungry doctors, reckless financiers, greedy bankers, heartless corporations, and tight-fisted employers who con and hurt the blameless good guys now in need of President Obama's all-knowing, benevolent government help. <br> Surely life is too complex to be such a fairy-book morality tale. <br> Take finance. Of course, we are all still furious at the speculators on Wall Street for the September 2008 meltdown. But not all Americans took out subprime mortgages for homes at inflated prices. So why must some continue to pay their underwater mortgages to keep their homes, while others, as victims, may not have to? <br> Everyone should pay some income tax. So why does the administration talk about raising rates sharply and adding even more taxes on the 5 percent who already pay 60 percent of all federal income-tax revenue? <br> Health care also is also poorly defined by Obama's simplistic view of a noble public victimized by a few greedy insurers. Some Americans budget $100 to $200 each month for high-deductible, private catastrophic health plans. That means they pass on some consumer purchases to ensure they won't get stuck without coverage for an unexpected operation or accident. In other words, people make choices about how they allot their resources; they are not always just victims who are cruelly denied, or cannot afford, some sort of basic health insurance. <br> One reason so many Americans were against federalizing their health care is that those who do avoid some medical risks - alcohol and drug use, poor diet, obesity, or lack of exercise - are, in some cases, asked to pay for the health problems of those who don't. <br> Obama may now take on immigration reform in the same bipolar fashion. He decries the present policy toward illegal immigration and cites heartbreaking stories about workers forced to toil in the shadows by profit-hungry employers and an indifferent public. But again, we hear no mention by Obama of the role of human choice and individual responsibility. <br> When one breaks the law by entering the United States without proper authority and then continues to live as an illegal alien, choices are made that have many unfortunate consequences, both for oneself and for society at large. A failure to learn English or a decision to send back thousands of hard-earned dollars to Mexico or Latin America can only compound the dilemma of living without legal certification. <br> In all these cases, Obama commendably wants to help the less fortunate. But he seems to care far less for those who act responsibly - except to demonize them if they question whether it is fair or wise to subsidize those who at times don't. <br> The president would surely improve his standing if he urged Americans to buy fewer DVDs and instead more insurance plans - or to avoid drugs and drink, or not to borrow money that they have no desire or ability to pay back, or not to enter the United States in the first place without a proper visa. <br> Here I do not mean just offering the usual presidential generic good advice and platitudes, but tougher talk - backed up by decisions on policy - about the inability of any government always to make right the freely incurred bad choices of its citizens. <br> Then when things unexpectedly get rough, my bet is the American people will be more than happy to help the unfortunate. <br> By Victor Davis Hanson: Reprinted with permission from National Review Online

An overturned, black Chevy Suburban with out-of-state license plates was blocking traffic on the quiet Boulevard John Paul II that runs through the city's sleepy western suburbs. <br> When local police commander Juan Jos Navarro Rincn and his three colleagues arrived, they saw two men who did not appear to be hurt, removing AK-47 assault rifles and police uniforms from the crashed vehicle to a white Nissan sport utility vehicle (SUV) parked nearby. Navarro Rincn called for reinforcements. He was about to arrest the pair when two other cars came to an abrupt stop just up the road. Three gunmen climbed out and opened fire with automatic weapons. Navarro Rincn was killed instantly. Three other officers also died. <br> The killings, dubbed "Black Thursday" by the local press, were the first shootings of police officers in Aguascalientes by drug gangs. Until then, Aguascalientes had been a quiet place, immune to the violence that was raging in cities along the U.S.-Mexico border and elsewhere in the country. The firefight sparked a manhunt throughout the state's rocky plateaus, involving some five dozen federal police patrol cars and a military helicopter. Later that day, with the gunmen and the drivers of the escape vehicles captured and in police custody, Aguascalientes State Attorney Xavier Gonzlez Fisher tried to reassure the rattled public. He told the media that the burst of violence was an isolated incident. "Aguascalientes is quiet, is at peace... this does not happen every day." For a long time, his words might have served as an accurate description of the state of affairs in Aguascalientes. But the incident was a telltale mark that the bloody, corrosive nexus of drugs, crime, and corruption growing malignantly along the Mexico-U.S. border has metastasized to regions previously immune to this cancer. <br> The Drug War Moves North</b> <br> In some respects, the Mexican problem is the result of Colombia's successful war on the Cali and Medelln drug cartels in the 1990s. Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the notorious leader of the Medelln Cartel, was gunned down by police commandos in 1993. Brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, who formed and ran the Cali Cartel, were captured in 1995, and later extradited to the United States to serve 30-year prison sentences. Although the Cali and Medelln cartels continued to operate, the removal of their leaders weakened them and created an opening for Mexican organized crime groups, such as the Guadalajara Cartel led by Miguel "El Padrino" ("the Godfather") ngel Flix Gallardo and his successors, to seize control of the lucrative North American drug trade. <br> The Guadalajara Cartel and similar groups had traditionally moved the Colombian drugs north. Flix Gallardo cultivated friendships with politicians, businessmen, and journalists, as well as with other drug lords. Distributing power and spoils, he built a nationwide trafficking network whose members rarely resorted to violence. Under Flix Gallardo's system, territories were carved out for local chieftains, and whenever another group needed access to his region, a tribute was paid. Though he was captured by the Mexican government in 1989, Flix Gallardo remained in charge, orchestrating meetings and dividing territory from prison. It was ultimately a failing effort. With the Guadalajara Cartel's ringleader locked up and the Colombians under attack, others started developing their own drug operations from scratch -- covering transportation, warehousing, and, eventually, the sale of the product itself. <br> Barry R. McCaffrey, former director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy, testified before the Senate that the "Colombians paid the Mexican trafficking organizations $1,500 to $2,000 for each kilogram of cocaine smuggled to the United States." But during the 1990s, as a more chaotic arrangement began to take shape, the Colombian and Mexican trafficking groups established a new deal allowing the Mexicans to receive a percentage of the cocaine in each shipment as payment for their transportation services. "This 'payment-in-product' agreement enabled Mexican organizations to become involved in the wholesale distribution of cocaine in the United States," McCaffrey observed. This also ended the Colombians' monopoly and set the stage for the war that followed. <br> As the Mexican cartels expanded their control over the drug supply chain, revenues exploded. There are no precise historical figures describing the size of the business. But, by any account, there was an enormous amount of money to be made. In 2002, former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft described the size of the U.S. drug market, reporting that Americans spent $62.9 billion on drugs in 2000. More than half ($36.1 billion), was spent on cocaine -- of which an estimated 90 percent transits through Mexico. In 2009, the U.S. National Drug Intelligence Center estimated that Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking organizations generated somewhere in the range of $17 billion to $38 billion annually in gross wholesale proceeds from drug sales in the United States. By comparison, Google's worldwide revenue in 2009 was $23.6 billion. <br> As earnings shot up, so did violence. Starting in the mid-1990s, drug gangs in Mexico grew more independent and began fighting for more control and larger territories. A decades-long war, which has claimed some 20,000 lives so far, broke out between Flix Gallardo's lieutenant, Joaqun "El Chapo" ("Shorty") Guzmn, currently Mexico's most wanted person, and rival drug lords. Gone was Flix Gallardo's divide-and-conquer approach, replaced by intimidation, brazen violence, and the executions of officials and anyone else who dared stand in the way. By 2004, the war had reached a simmer: the first mass graves started to appear in Mexico, and newspapers carried accounts of gruesome killings involving beheadings and acid. In the border town of Nuevo Laredo, more than 100 people were murdered from January to August, 2005. <br> President Vicente Fox had taken a relatively soft approach to combating the violence, but all that changed when President Felipe Caldern took office on December 1, 2006. Within weeks, some 6,500 troops were dispatched to the state of Michoacn (along the country's mid-Pacific coast) to curtail drug violence. It was of little avail. McCaffrey testified in 2009 that "squad-sized units of the police and [Mexican] army have been tortured, murdered, and their decapitated bodies publicly left on display." Media accounts appeared describing instances where police auctioned their loyalty to the highest bidder. Today, some 45,000 Mexican troops -- about a quarter of the standing army -- are engaged in a domestic war with drug cartels, which shows no signs of abating anytime soon. <br> Rise of the New Cartels <br> Amid such seemingly indiscriminate violence, it's critical to understand who is fighting whom, and to have a little history of the major players today. The Mexican drug wars have seen the rise of two dominant cartels, which have elevated indiscriminate violence and coercion to levels previously unimaginable. The Sinaloa gang is the country's largest cartel, based on the volume of drugs it moves. It grew out of the coastal state of Sinaloa, once known for its poppy fields and opium gum produced by Chinese immigrants. Now it is produced by hundreds of thousands of Mexican campesinos. The Sinaloa Cartel operates up Mexico's Pacific coast and along the U.S. border -- from Tijuana in the west, to Ciudad Jurez and Nuevo Laredo in the east. Since a different chief, or capo (the Mexican cartels have adopted the same terminology as their mafia counterparts), controls each territory, the Sinaloa Cartel has also become known as "The Federation." But at the top of the chain sits Flix Gallardo's former lieutenant, "El Chapo" Guzmn; Forbes magazine estimates his wealth at $1 billion. The U.S. government is offering a $5 million reward for his capture.

His piece originally appeared on TomDispatch..<br>What if the Tea Party ruled? Imagine a land, let's call it Glennbeckistan, where white, patriarchal, religiously zealous, Tea Party-type patriots hold a super-majority in both houses of the legislature, sit in the governor's mansion, and control most local governments. It's a place so out of sync with the rest of the nation that states' rights and even secession are always on the agenda. It's a place where gun-ownership trumps all other rights, climate change is considered an insidious socialist conspiracy, and a miscarriage can be investigated as a potential crime. Welcome to Utah. <br> Our rightwing red-state legislature just finished its annual 2010 session. So-called message bills challenged the federal government's right to govern federal lands, enforce gun controls, legalize abortion, and mandate health reform. In addition, Utah's lawmakers cut the education budget, raised tuitions, and slashed services to the disabled. In fairness, state legislators across the nation, faced with disastrous drops in revenue, have likewise slashed social services and balanced budgets on the backs of the poor. In Utah, however, they also shelved pensions for public employees. That they could take such draconian action is instructive -- organized labor is weak here, unions being another manifestation of creeping socialism. Utah's history of labor organizing, or grass roots and civil rights organizing for that matter, is anemic compared to most of America. This is the place, after all, where IWW radical Joe Hill was arrested and executed. <br> Although Utah may be unique in some ways, Republican leaders here want the rest of the nation to be more like us. In fact, a survey of the 2010 Utah legislative session could be considered a trailer for a movie the national Republican base would like all Americans to star in. This movie would be for the Tea Party movement what Avatar is to tree huggers. <br> Hot-Tubbing With a Naked Fifteen-Year-Old <br> Before we get to this movie's best scenes, let's identify some of the actors: The posse that goes after the bad guys -- the black-hatted Obamacrats -- are easy to identify. They wear white hats (and skins). They also wear their superior principles like shiny badges, and they claim to be the underdogs in this script, even while acting like schoolyard bullies. And the bad guys? In our state, they're nowhere in sight unless you're looking at Glenn Beck's chalkboard. <br> Demonizing opponents is a creative activity for the posse and paranoia comes in endless variations, so the bad guys could be tax-and-spend liberals, illegal immigrants, gays (or at least those following "the gay agenda"), non-Republican blacks, federalists, socialists, environmentalists, pornographers, feminists, or those nature worshippers who believe in evolution. The cast of evil-doers changes each year. <br> So this year, for example, immigrants and gays got a break. Proposed bills to scuttle Salt Lake City's new nondiscrimination ordinances were shelved until a future session of the state legislature -- the Utah-based Mormon church is already catching enough flack for its support of Proposition 8 that banned same-sex marriage in California. Further antagonizing the national gay community just now was deemed unwise. Immigrants were beaten up enough in last year's session. <br> The good guys are easy to recognize because they're the ones constantly telling the audience how good they are. Sadly, as is so often the case with holier-than-thou-heroes, there are visible stains on the white hats. In fact, the 2010 session was bookended by scandal. As the doors opened, Sheldon Killpack, the State Senate majority leader and an outspoken proponent of tougher drunk-driving laws, was busted for drunk-driving. He promptly resigned. 
 Katha Pollitt's writing has appeared in many publications, including The New Yorker, The London Review of Books, the Washington Post and the New York Times. Her new book of poems, The Mind-Body Problem, has just been published by Random House.<br>My favorite moment of the whole child abuse scandal in the Catholic Church was when Father Klaus Malangr suggested that Peter Hullermann, the redoubtable German pedophile priest, might be sent to work in a girls' school. No boys, no molestation. Or, in churchly language, no occasion of sin. Problem solved! Plus, the good father would spend his life warding off female cooties. Malangr must not have heard about priests--and they do exist--who abused both male and female children. Nor had he learned the lesson of Watergate: the cover-up is worse than the crime. <br> The church has yet to learn that lesson. There is a positively Nixonian smarmy truculence in the response of church hierarchs to the ongoing scandal, which now involves Pope Benedict XVI himself. On Palm Sunday, New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan urged worshipers at St. Patrick's Cathedral to show "love and solidarity for our earthly shepherd now suffering some of the same unjust accusations, shouts of the mob and scourging at the pillar, as did Jesus." <br> On his blog, Dolan explains that what gets Catholics angry is not just the molestations themselves but also that "the sexual abuse of minors is presented as a tragedy unique to the Church alone." Oh, really? Does the name Mary Kay Letourneau mean nothing to him? This man needs to read the tabloids, which have for years featured an endless parade of molesting teachers, doctors, dentists, therapists and scout leaders. To go by the news, looking at child pornography on one's office computer is so common, it's a wonder anyone finds the time to abuse real kids. At this late date I doubt anyone is unaware that the sexual abuse of children is a widespread phenomenon. <br> The difference is, when other professionals who work with children are caught out, justice takes its course. People are fired. Licenses are lost. Reputations are ruined. Sometimes jail is involved. No human institution is perfect, and it would be foolish to suggest that incidents are always investigated and that abusers who don't happen to be priests are never protected by colleagues or superiors. Still, it's probably safe to say that if a principal was accused of overlooking a child molester in his classrooms or recycling him to other schools, nobody would compare his suffering to Christ's. <br> And nobody would be asking for his views about sex, reproduction, women, homosexuality or healthcare either. The moral authority granted the Catholic Church in the secular world is for me the most repellent aspect of the current crisis. <br> In the succinct words of Jodi Jacobson, editor of RHRealityCheck.org, "Why is a pedophilia-ridden, pedophilia-hiding, child-abusing Church allowed to write laws controlling women's rights?" To which one might add: what gives a church in which celibacy is equated with holiness, in which males have almost all the power, the right to a place at the table where laws are made about women's bodies? The same institution that has dealt so indulgently with its ordained pedophiles had no problem excommunicating a Brazilian mother who sought an abortion for her 9-year-old daughter, raped and impregnated with twins by her stepfather, or pushing for laws in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Chile banning abortion even to save the woman's life. <br> Most Catholics take a flexible view of the church's teachings on sexuality. They use birth control--how else could Italy, Spain and Poland have among the lowest birthrates in the world? They divorce and remarry, use condoms to prevent STDs, undergo in vitro and other banned fertility treatments and even have abortions. Yet there were the bishops, holding the whole healthcare reform bill hostage to their opposition to abortion rights, advising on the crafting of language right in the halls of Congress. And as Jacobson details, it was the Conference of Catholic Bishops that worked alongside Republican Congressmen Chris Smith, Joe Pitts and Mike Pence to insert last-minute language denying HIV-positive women access to contraceptives and favoring abstinence-only-until-marriage policies in the 2008 President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. <br> There isn't much that non-Catholics can do to force the church to abandon its 2,000-year-old misogynistic ways. We can't force it to ordain women and married men, or value a woman's life over a fertilized egg, or see homosexuality as something other than, in Pope John Paul II's memorable words, "intrinsic moral evil." Catholics themselves will have to do that, whether by leaving the church in numbers large enough to get the bishops' attention or by organizing within it, like Catholics for Choice, Women-Church Convergence or the international group We Are Church. <br> But certainly the rest of us can demand that the Obama administration, Congress and government generally stop catering to the Vatican. The bishops can't even make their own flock obey their outmoded and cruel rules and regulations, so why should they exercise power over the entire country? The United States should not have an ambassador to the Holy See in Rome any more than it has an ambassador to the Diocese of Canterbury or the Satmars of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. And if the church wants to interfere with the making of laws, it should lose its tax-exempt status. <br> In February Bishop Margot Kaessmann, the first woman to head the German Protestant Church and a much-admired public figure, was caught running a red light while intoxicated. There was a lot of sympathy for her, even in the conservative media, which disagreed with her liberal and antiwar views, and she received the support of the church's governing body. Nonetheless, within four days Kaessmann resigned, saying that her moral authority had been so compromised she could no longer do right by her high office. Maybe Pope Benedict and his bishops could learn something from her example. <br> By Katha Pollitt:Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Benjamin Domenech, a former speechwriter and political appointee at the Department of Health and Human Services, is managing editor of Health Care News. <br>At the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond today, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell signed the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act, flanked by Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and VA Health Sec. Dr. Bill Hazel (the former head of the Inova system) among others. <br> "We all agree that we must expand access to quality health care and reduce costs for all Virginians. However, that should not be accomplished through an unprecedented federal mandate on individuals that we believe violates the U.S. Constitution," said McDonnell, who was also careful to point out that the act received the votes of leading Democratic state senators and the Democratic House Minority Leader. <br> But Sen. Ron Wyden has an interview with the Huffington Post today claiming that acts like the one McDonnell signed (pending in 30+ states as ballot initiatives or amendments) and the associated legal threats from Attorneys General over the individual mandate are pointless, given that states can simply "opt out" of the individual mandate requirement. Update from Wyden's office added below. <br> Here's what Wyden tells Sam Stein: <br> Speaking to the Huffington Post on Tuesday, Wyden discussed - for one of the first times in public - legislative language he authored which "allows a state to go out and do its own bill, including having no individual mandate" provided that, as Wyden puts it, "they can meet the coverage requirements of the bill." <br> "Why don't you use the waiver provision to let you go set up your own plan?" the senator asked those who threaten health-care-related lawsuits. "Why would you just say you are going to sue everybody, when this bill gives you the authority and the legal counsel is on record as saying you can do it without an individual mandate?" <br> Sen. Wyden is one of the few politicians in either party who understands health care policy, and he's an honest, smart, and hard-working guy. But there are a number of problems with what he is saying here, even if we take it seriously. <br> The Wyden language - found in the bill here (side note: I actually think some of this language originates from a Maria Cantwell amendment in the Finance Committee, and called Wyden's office to confirm, but they haven't gotten back to me yet) - provides, as he says, that "if a state can demonstrate that they can meet the criteria - particularly on cost containment, improving the delivery system," they can get a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services. It would be up to Secretary Sebelius if this was in force today to determine what criteria must be met. <br> I checked with my colleague at Heartland, senior legal fellow Maureen Martin, about this. She says that "Senators can say whatever they want about what statutes mean. Whatever they say is irrelevant. In the end, the courts will decide what statutes mean. Whatever Congress or the President say about the meaning of statutes is totally irrelevant. Courts look at the exact language of statutes and decide what they mean. So intent of Congress is irrelevant. It matters only what the statutes say and how that is interpreted. I'm not sure this point is well understood by the public." <br> There are of course a number of questions to be raised here about standing, but also about whether the waiver is adequate protection if it is only possible for a five year gap, and subject to the discretion of the HHS Secretary. My colleague John Graham at the Pacific Research Institute points out that "applying for a waiver" is not the same as "opting out" - he presumes the HHS Secretary would grant a waiver if a state imposed single-payer, such as in California and some other states. <br> Yet even presuming states wanted to do something pro-market, they would only be able to apply for these waivers starting in 2017, and the waivers in question would have to meet standards for "cost containment" and "improving the delivery system" - standards which can be very fluid. As with any regulatory issue that shifts at the whim of the party in power, this will almost certainly lead to more litigation as to what all of these terms mean for the states in terms of tangible, measurable standards. <br> Nor can states be made exempt from the tax increases for individuals and employers, the cuts in Medicare, the newly expanded unfunded liabilities in Medicaid, and a host of other aspects of this bill. Of course states could set up their own programs to cover people, but that would be a waiver almost no state would want to accept, given that they can't prohibit their taxpayer dollars from going to fund this reform elsewhere. <br> That's hardly a full opt out. What's more, an exemption from the individual and employer mandates really can't take place at a state level without raising a host of other legal issues. The whole point of the health freedom act in Virginia is not that the state is acting in its own defense, but that it requires the state to act as a legal matter in the defense of an individual being compelled by the federal government to purchase a product or suffer a fine. <br> I'm unconvinced, and I assume the AGs are as well. Wyden's statement is essentially offering a political answer to a Constitutional question. Saying that these legal issues are unimportant because a state government may exempt its citizens from the individual or employer mandate requirements doesn't help a citizen or employer whose state fails to act. <br> Taken as a whole, one thing is clear: a lot of lawyers and judges will be answering these questions in the months and years to come. <br> Update: The very pleasant folks at Wyden's office got back to me. Here's the answer on how the exemption would work: you could only get an exemption approved by the Secretary of HHS if you prove you can cover more people with your non-individual mandate plan, while also meeting their new requirements for coverage (in other words, not by turning to a catastrophic + HSA plan or something along those lines). <br> In other words, it is hard to see all but a few rare circumstances where a state would apply for this exemption and move toward a pro-market solution. You would have to prove that you would have a greater number of people purchase a product than you would by legally requiring them to purchase that product. <br> By Ben Domenech: Reprinted with permission from The New Ledger. 
 I understand that conservatives will work to repeal the health bill. But we should also understand that there has to be a Plan B, particularly given the difficulties involved in repealing any legislation of this size and significance. <br> David Frum has written a column for CNN.com outlining how he thinks the right should work to reform the reform. <br> (1) Frum zeroes in on the problem posed by the marginal taxes, implicit and explicit, embedded in the proposal. Greg Mankiw has written persuasively on this subject for a long time. I couldn't agree more that we need to work on the revenue sources. Trimming if not eliminating the tax exclusion strikes me as the best way to go. <br> Suffice it to say, I'm skeptical as to the wisdom of using carbon tax revenues to pay for health coverage, not least because, as Northwestern University sociologist Monica Prasad has argued, this will likely undermine the efficacy of the carbon tax as an environmental tool. Then there is the fact that a carbon tax has many other downsides, as Jim Manzi has argued. But this is a side issue. <br> (2) Frum then argues that Republicans should stop defending employer-based health coverage. I certainly think that conservatives should stop doing so, and the new health legislation makes this easier: because of the horizontal equity problem it introduces - the fact that working and middle class households receive far more generous subsidies on the exchanges than through the traditional employer-based system - I assume that the employer-based system will unravel, not least because the system of employer penalties is both weak, confusing, and a ripe target for repeal. Indeed, Frum seems to call for accelerating this process in (4), when he writes: <br> style="padding-left: 30px;"Uninsured employees have now through the exchanges been provided an easy and even subsidized way to buy their own coverage. There is no justification for the small-business fine: Republicans should press for repeal. <br> The trouble, of course, is that this would mean that the cost of premium subsidies will prove far higher than the CBO's analysis suggests. And that in turn means that we'll need more tax revenues. <br> (3) Frum offers another idea I strongly endorse, and I can imagine a bipartisan coalition developing around it over time: <br> This, however, means that we'll need a better reinsurance mechanism, a subject to which we'll return. <br> I would add something else: the sliding scale subsidies will likely prove extremely difficult to administer, leaving aside the problem posed by the implicit marginal tax rates. As far as urgent problems go, I'd place that high on the list. <br> Basically, I think that conservatives don't fully appreciate that we're now in a genuinely new terrain. There are some decent scenarios for how this might play out - Ross Douthat outlined one of them in his blog yesterday: <br> He then goes on to say that this happy scenario isn't very plausible. But we can certainly make it more likely by pressing for reforms of the reform. <br> By Reihan Salam: Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 John Nichols writes about politics for The Nation magazine as its Washington correspondent. <br> For more than a year, President Obama remained on the sidelines of the health care debate -- chiming in now and again with sometimes-inspired, sometimes-disappointing rhetoric about broad values while members of Congress did the heavy lifting. <br> Now, the president has finally weighed it with "a plan." <br> But it is not enough. <br> The White House is making a big deal about what's being labeled "The President's Proposal," which the administration announced with much fanfare Monday. According to the White House, the Obama plan does a lot: <br> It makes insurance more affordable by providing the largest middle class tax cut for health care in history, reducing premium costs for tens of millions of families and small business owners who are priced out of coverage today. This helps over 31 million Americans afford health care who do not get it today - and makes coverage more affordable for many more. <br> It sets up a new competitive health insurance market giving tens of millions of Americans the exact same insurance choices that members of Congress will have. <br> It brings greater accountability to health care by laying out commonsense rules of the road to keep premiums down and prevent insurance industry abuses and denial of care. <br> It will end discrimination against Americans with pre-existing conditions. <br> It puts our budget and economy on a more stable path by reducing the deficit by $100 billion over the next ten years - and about $1 trillion over the second decade - by cutting government overspending and reining in waste, fraud and abuse. <br> But the real news is what it does not do. <br> Despite urging from House leaders and a growing number of senators, "The President's Plan" does not include a public option. <br> Nor does it bow in any meaningful way to progressive proposals to expand access to Medicare and Medicaid. <br> In other words, the president has opted for the Senate's exceptionally compromised approach, rather than the bolder bill produced by the House. This is not exactly shocking. The president abandoned serious discussion of the public option several months ago. But the failure to even reference moves to develop a federally-funded alternative to private insurance represents a clear embrace of the Senate stance. <br> Obama does tinker with some of the worst elements of the Senate bill. For instance, he proposes eliminating the special deal regarding Medicare spending in Nebraska that was cut to win the vote of Senator Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska. <br> Obama also proposes to delay until 2018 the tax on high-end insurance plans that was passionately opposed by organized labor. One place where Obama's embrace of the Senate bill is good news is on the issue of reproductive rights. <br> The president's plan retains Senate language that is less restrictive regarding the use of federal money for abortion than what is contained in the House bill. <br> When all is said and done, however, "The President's Plan" is the Senate bill with the rough edges shaved off. <br> That's not exactly great news, as the Senate bill was not exactly a great bill. In fact, it has been condemned by serious reformers as a huge payoff for existing insurance and health-care industries that contains no real mechanism (in the form of a public option) for holding then to account. So: Is "The President's Plan" the final bill? <br> The president's aides admit that this "plan" is really just a framing document for the bipartisan, televised health care summit where Obama will meet with Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate to discuss reform. <br> "This is the opening bid for the health meeting," says White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer. "We took our best shot at bridging the differences. It makes some strong steps to improving the final product... The president is coming to the meeting with an open mind." <br> In other words, this is where the president's head is at as of Monday, February 22. <br> It's good that Obama has finally produced a proposal. <br> It's bad that Obama has not produced a stronger proposal. <br> But what really matters now is keeping up the pressure for improvements -- especially along Medicare-for- All lines -- as the long debate over health-care reform enters the next stage. <br> To that end, Congressman Eric Massa, D-New York, an ardent backer of real reform -- in the form of a single-payer plan -- offers these suggestions to frustrated activists: <br> "So here we are in the middle of February, 2010. The House and Senate have passed health care bills similar in less important sections but differing on crucial aspects. What now? <br> "I suggest a "three track" approach." <br> "The first is that in the short term, we support any realistic initiatives to improve either existing bill. And we also endorse new single bills, such as one removing the anti-trust protection for private health insurance and medical malpractice insurance firms. Another should end private insurance exclusions because of pre-existing conditions and annual and life-time caps on benefits. I am working on these now." <br> "The second track is for activists to work hard in states where single-payer healthcare has the greatest public support. A national agency should coordinate local action and raise national funds for those states best positioned to be successful. Concentration of funding and organizing on these "best bets" states is crucial." <br> "Success in even one state would be monumental. <br> "Third is a complementary federal track. We support a bill allowing the federal government to recognize and encourage, with money and technical assistance, integrated state systems meeting certain criteria. States should be allowed to fully incorporate their existing Medicaid and SCHIP programs and funding into a single comprehensive program, and qualify for additional federal dollars. In such cases, private insurance becomes subordinate to this public program. Parallel to this, a bill expanding age eligibility for Medicare is crucial." <br> "At the same time we must point out that this approach requires neither individual nor employer mandates. The only requirement is that every enrolled citizen pay toward the general cost of health care." <br> "Finally, we must continue to make logically sound, careful arguments for health reform, using the best data and studies." <br> "That means focusing on the health needs of 300 million Americans. Individual cases can be used, but only to illustrate conclusions based on a wide range of data." <br> "By doing all these together, progress is still possible." <br> Massa's been working with Progressive Democrats of America and other groups to keep the pressure on Congress and the White House to do more. Massa's message is a good one. Even those who might disagree with him on specifics should recognize that "The President's Plan" is not the final word. <br> It is important that Obama is still talking about trying to repair a broken health care system. And it is important that some of what he is saying has merit. <br> Of course, his cautious approach may be frustrating. But frustration with this president is not exactly a new experience. Progressives need to recognize that, while Obama will not lead, he but may yet be led in the right direction. <br> What Obama has done is frame the debate a bit more. Now, real reformers must provide a better frame -- and focus. To that end, they must increase the pressure on the president and Congress to abandon the worst compromises and to seek the best fixes. <br> By John Nichols:Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Jeffrey H. Anderson, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, is director of the Benjamin Rush Society.<br>In yet another interview in connection with a major sporting event-this time, the Super Bowl-President Obama proposed yet another unorthodox manner of addressing a political problem: this time, a bipartisan half-day health care summit on live TV. Why hold such a meeting nearly a year into the health care debate? "Well," he told Katie Couric, "I think that what I want to do is to look at the Republican ideas that are out there." <br> This would seem to be a good, if grossly overdue, idea. Unfortunately, the prospects for a real back-and-forth exchange look bleak. Couric asked Obama if he'd be willing "to start at square one," and he took pains not to answer. Subsequently, White House aides made it clear that the president would be bringing his own health care bill to the table. Then, the day after the president's interview, his secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, stated that the president's proposal wasn't really conducive to being accepted in part or rejected in part. Sebelius said, "I think the president remains committed to the notion that we have to have a comprehensive approach, because the pieces of the puzzle are too closely tied to one another." She added, "Pieces of the puzzle are necessarilytied together if you have a comprehensive approach." <br> So if the president already has his own comprehensive bill in hand, and its interlocking pieces are not really subject to refinement, revision, or removal, one wonders exactly what Republicans' role at the summit is. Is it to convince President Obama that they have a better plan, which he should therefore substitute in its entirety for his own? Sebelius offered another possibility, noting that the president is willing to "add various elements" to his bill. In other words, while his bill cannot be redesigned or made smaller, it can be made bigger-provided that the Republicans have what he thinks are good ideas to add. <br> This bizarre combination of claims is revelatory of the president's outlook on politics. "Incremental gains" is a phrase foreign to his vocabulary, as is the notion of having Washington solve problems by getting out of the way and unleashing the initiative of individuals or communities. Rather, problems must be solved all at once, comprehensively, nationwide, from the top, by the federal government. This approach is largely divorced from practical considerations or, as Sebelius notes, from compromise. It is the approach of the theoretician, not the practitioner; of the academic, not the statesman; of one who prefers to decree or to gain acquiescence, rather than to negotiate or to persuade. <br> Obama is far more comfortable with such roles. In a moment of candor, he essentially said as much to Couric: <br> "Look, I would have loved nothing better than to simply come up with some very elegant, you know, academically approved approach to health care [that] didn't have any kinds of legislative fingerprints on it, and just go ahead and have that passed. But that's not how it works in our democracy. Unfortunately what we end up having to do is to do a lot of negotiations with a lot of different people." <br> With the possible exception of Woodrow Wilson, can you imagine any of our prior presidents having said that? <br> Our democratic process, our separation of powers, and our federalist design frustrate Obama. But, far from being unfortunate, the negotiations and multiple levels of approval that they require, from a myriad of different citizens, is largely what secures our liberty-protecting it from those who would otherwise impose their own comprehensive goals from their lofty theoretical perches. The Founders were surely not Obama's intellectual inferiors, but they were practical men. The Constitutional Convention was nothing if not high-level give-and-take, tinkering and refining. One imagines Obama showing up at Independence Hall with his own plan in hand (probably adapted from Rousseau's in The Social Contract, with Obama cast in the role of the Legislator) and being surprised when the other delegates resisted his eloquence and, correspondingly, his proposal. <br> The academic mindset-which is not necessarily synonymous with intellectual inquisitiveness-is also conducive to a disconnect from the real world in other ways. Take the following exchange: <br> Couric: "A lot of people, including Democrats, wrote to me saying you campaigned on the slogan "Change you can believe in." But their lives and the ways of Washington, they wrote, haven't changed at all. What would you say to them?" <br> Amazingly, Obama replied: <br> "Well, it's not true that they haven't changed at all. Let's just take-we're sitting in the White House here. Every single person who comes into the White House now is posted on a website, so you know every visitor to the White House. That's never happened in the history of the Republic."Seriously? To be fair, he went on from there, but that was his first response. The "change we can believe in" is that the names of White House visitors are now listed online. <br> The comprehensive approach to problem-solving is at best ineffective and at worst dangerous. When was the last time you heard President Obama talk about local or state solutions? When was the last time you heard him talk about the federal government solving problems by scaling back its role? <br> The president would stand a better chance of success if he could bring himself to consider sensible, targeted solutions designed to achieve incremental but tangible gains. Take the "one-page" alternative for health care reform that has appeared in these pages ("The Small Bill," February 8, 2010). At least three of its seven proposals-ending runaway malpractice lawsuits, allowing Americans to buy insurance across state lines, and allowing companies to offer lower premiums for healthier lifestyles-could be implemented independently, with or without the rest of the bill. All three involve having the government or the legal system get out of the way, thereby enabling health care costs to decline. <br> Two of the other small-bill proposals could be implemented in tandem. We could finally end the unfair tax on the uninsured (and self-insured), giving them a tax-break similar to the one already available to those with employer-provided insurance. And we could pay for this by reallocating some of the federally administered funds that help cover the costs of treating the uninsured, and converting the rest into block-grants to the states. <br> The small-bill approach shows that governing this country need not invite the constant frustrations of crafting "academically approved," federal-government-centered, comprehensive solutions to nearly every imaginable human problem, and then having to face the dispiriting struggle of getting these "elegant" solutions through our "unfortunately" democratic institutions-especially when the people, for some reason, don't want them. <br> By Jeffrey Anderson: Reprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard 
 Steve Fraser is the co-editor of The Rise and Fall of the New Deal Order and author, most recently, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300151438/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">Wall Street: America's Dream Palace. He is Research Associate at the Joseph Murphy Center for Labor and Community Studies at the Graduate Center of the City of New York. This piece originally appeared on TomDispatch. <br> On March 4, 1933, the day he took office, Franklin Roosevelt excoriated the "money changers" who "have fled from their high seats in the temples of our civilization [because...] they know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision and where there is no vision, the people perish." <br> Rhetoric, however, is only rhetoric. According to one skeptical congressional observer of FDR's first inaugural address, "The President drove the money-changers out of the Capitol on March 4th -- and they were all back on the 9th." <br> That was essentially true. It was what happened after that, in the midst of the Great Depression, which set the New Deal on a course that is the mirror image of the direction in which the Obama administration seems headed. <br> Buoyed by great expectations when he assumed office, Barack Obama has so far revealed himself to be an unfolding disappointment. On arrival, expectations were far lower for FDR, who was not considered extraordinary at all -- until he actually did something extraordinary. <br> The great expectations of 2009 are, only a year later, beginning to smell like a pile of dead fish with new rhetoric -- including populist-style attacks on villainous bankers that sound fake (or cynically pandering) when uttered by Obama's brainiacs -- layered on top of the pile like deodorant. Meanwhile, the country is suffering through a recovery that isn't a recovery unless you happen to be a banker, and the administration stands by, too politically or intellectually inhibited or incapacitated to do much of anything about it. A year into "change we can believe in" and the new regime, once so flush with power and the promise of big doings, seems exhausted, vulnerable, and afraid. A year into the New Deal -- indeed a mere 100 days into Roosevelt's era -- change, whether you believed in it or not, clearly had the wind at its back. <br> A Tale of Two Presidencies <br> If, a few days after Roosevelt pronounced them ex-communicant, the "money-changers" were back inside the temple -- "temple," by the way, was how the Federal Reserve used to be known before its recent fall from grace -- no one was too surprised. He, like Obama, was initially worried about alienating big business and high finance. He arrived in the Oval Office, in fact, still a prisoner of his own past and the country's. He believed, for example, in the then-orthodox wisdom of balancing the budget and would never entirely abandon that faith. <br> Not long before he assumed office, his predecessor, Herbert Hoover, vetoed a bill calling for the accelerated payment of bonuses to World War I veterans. Many of them had only recently gathered in makeshift tents on Anacostia Flats in Washington D.C., an army of the destitute, to plead their case. Hoover, to his lasting dishonor, ordered Army Chief of Staff General Douglas McArthur to have their tents set on fire and drive them away at bayonet point. Not long after FDR took the oath of office, he vetoed the same bill. He shared, as well, in a broad cultural repugnance for what was then called "the dole," and today is known as "welfare." <br> The legendary first 100 days of the Roosevelt administration, memorable for a raft of reform and recovery legislation, also prominently featured an Economy Act designed to reduce government expenditures. Fearing the possibility of a break with the commercial elite, the president tried forging a partnership with them, much as Hoover had. As a matter of fact, the first two pieces of recovery legislation his administration submitted to Congress -- the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act -- were formulated and implemented in a way that would seem familiar today. They gave the country's major corporations and largest agricultural interests the principal authority for re-starting the country's stalled economic engines.<br>However, even as the administration tried to maintain its ties to powerful business interests and a traditional fiscal conservatism, it broke them -- and it severed those connections in ways, and for reasons, that are instructive today. <br> *<em>The Glass-Steagall Act: <br> This emergency banking legislation passed during those extraordinary first 100 days separated commercial from investment banking. It was meant to prevent the misuse of commercial bank deposits (other people's money like yours and mine) in dangerous forms of speculation, which many at the time believed had helped cause the Great Wall Street Crash of 1929, prelude to the Great Depression. Today, ever more people wish Glass-Steagall had never been repealed (as it was in 1999), as its absence helped open the door to the financial misadventures that brought us the Great Crash of '08. <br> The bill infuriated what was called, in those days, "the Money Trust," especially the once omnipotent house of Morgan, the dominant member of an elite group of Wall Street firms that had run the financial system since the turn of the century when J.P. Morgan, America's most famous banker, was revered and feared around the world. (Jack, the patriarch's son, was so incensed by New Deal financial reform that he banned all pictures of the President from the bank's premises.) Glass-Steagall, as well as the two Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 which created the Securities and Exchange Commission and left the doyens of the New York Stock Exchange apoplectic, represented real reform, and so were different in kind from TARP and all the other contraptions designed by the Bush and Obama Treasury Departments simply to bail out the financial sector. <br> *<em>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA): <br> Offspring also of those first 100 days, the TVA uplifted a vast, underdeveloped, and impoverished rural region of the country by bringing it electric power, irrigation, soil conservation, and flood control. It introduced the then-alien (and once again alien) idea of government-directed economic planning and development. It left the private utility industry irate at the prospect of having to compete with effective, publicly owned electrical-power-generating facilities. Fast-forward to today when, on the contrary, the private health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, conniving behind closed doors with Obama's people, proved triumphant in a similar confrontation, leaving government competition in the dust. <br> *<em>Jobs: <br> And then there was, as there is again, the question of jobs and how to create them. In 1933, American politicians still took the notion of balancing the budget each year with deadly seriousness. In our present era, every president from Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton to George W. Bush and now, apparently, Barack Obama talks the talk without any intention of walking the walk. What made the Roosevelt moment remarkable was this: balanced-budget orthodoxy notwithstanding, the new administration soon forged ahead with a set of jobs programs that not only implied deficit spending but an even more radical departure from business as usual. <br> Initially, the Public Works Administration (PWA), created as part of the National Industrial Recovery Act, relied on large-scale infrastructure projects farmed out to private enterprise. Undertaking such projects inevitably entailed government borrowing and deficits. Partly for that reason, the PWA proceeded at a glacial pace, put few to work right away, and -- in the way it looked to the private sector to take the lead -- resembled the latest thinking of the Obama administration whose newest tepid suggestions for creating jobs depend almost solely on funneling tax relief to business. <br> Simultaneously, however, the New Deal pursued a more daring alternative. FDR diverted a third of the PWA's budget to the Civil Works Administration (CWA), out of which was born the legendary Civilian Conservation Corps, an agency that deployed hundreds of thousands of unemployed young men to restore the country's forests and parklands. The CWA skipped the private sector entirely and simply put people to work: four million people in the summer and fall of 1933. (That would be the equivalent, today, of ten million Americans back on the job.) <br> During the first nine months of the Roosevelt administration manual laborers, clerks, architects, book-binders, teachers, actors, white and blue collar workers alike became Federal employees. They laid millions of feet of sewer pipe, improved hundreds of thousands of miles of roads, and built thousands of schools, playgrounds, and airports. Harry Hopkins, who ran the CWA, was authorized to seize tools, equipment, and materials from Army warehouses to get the new system up and running. (The Works Progress Administration, a subsequent incarnation of the CWA, would later create eight million jobs on the same principle of public employment.) <br> This isn't even within hailing distance of where the current Administration is now as it frets about the deficit and pledges to freeze domestic spending (and implies, without having the courage to say so, that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security had better watch out). Coming from a regnant Democratic Party this is change we can't or don't want to believe in. <br> Heading Backwards <br> Like Obama, Roosevelt was denounced by his enemies in the Republican Party and the business community as a closet socialist (not to mention a cripple, a Jew, and a homosexual). While the administration would sometimes trim its sails considerably to weather the right wing storm, its general reaction to Republican opposition was the opposite of Obama's. Even during that first year, and at an accelerating pace afterwards, the momentum of the New Deal carried it irresistibly to the left.<br>This was true, in fact, of the whole Democratic Party. The Congress elected in the off-year of 1934 was not only more overwhelmingly Democratic, but the Democrats who won were considerably more progressive-minded. <br> They were far readier to jettison the shibboleths of the old order and press a still cautious President in their direction. By 1936, the essentials of the social welfare and regulatory state were in place, an insurgent labor movement had won the elementary right to organize (while becoming the New Deal's most muscular constituency), and the president was denouncing "economic royalists" and "tories of industry" whose "hatred" for him he "welcomed." <br> Today the Obama administration and the Democratic Party are visibly moving in the opposite direction. They read the lesson of humiliating defeat in Massachusetts and the voluble hostility of the populist right as an advisory to move further to the right. Tacking rightward, tailoring policy to match the tastes of business and finance, cautioning Americans that they'll need to tighten their belts (as if they hadn't already been doing so), adopting the parsimonious sanctimony of the balanced budget, slimming down their great expectations until what little is left mocks the hopes of so many who elected them -- all of this is seen as smart politics. <br> Smart like a chicken. This is the same cleverness that, beginning with Ronald Reagan's triumph, turned the Democratic Party into Republican-lite. Shrewdness like this helps explain, in part, why Obama's inner circle and Democratic leaders took the early, fateful steps that were bound to land them where they find themselves today. <br> Would the Republican right and its tea-party populists -- marginal, mockable political freaks less than a year ago -- have enjoyed their current growth spasm if the administration hadn't been committed to bailing out the very institutions most people considered the villains responsible for running this country into a ditch? Would the Democratic Party have been in imminent danger of losing its faltering grip on Congress had it found the will to pursue serious health-care reform and environmental legislation, or wrestled the financial oligarchy to the mat as Roosevelt did? A long generation spent cowering in the shadows of the conservative ascendancy has left the newly empowered Democrats congenitally incapable of seizing their own historic moment. <br> After a year of feinting to the left without meaning it, how seriously is anyone going to take the administration's latest call to tax the banks or break their addiction to reckless speculation? Even if Obama now means to push ahead with some sort of health-care reform or put some teeth into new financial regulations, he has spent so much political capital moving in the opposite direction and seeking partners where there never were any that his quest, even if genuine, may now be purely quixotic. As for the surge in Afghanistan and the endless war that goes with it, by election time 2010, it's an even bet that it will have further undermined any hopes of a late-inning Democratic Party revival. <br> Conventional wisdom notwithstanding, off-year elections do not always favor the minority party. Indeed, 1934 may be the best example of the opposite effect. Exactly because the New Deal showed itself ever readier to junk the ancien r<em></em>gime, break with economic orthodoxy, and above all say goodbye to its erstwhile corporate friends, it was rewarded handsomely at the polls. None of that apparently will be repeated in 2010, given an administration that seems to be running a New Deal in reverse. <br> By Steve Fraser:Reprinted with permission from TomDispatch. 
 Lawrence Lessig is a professor of law at Harvard Law School, is co-founder of the nonprofit Change Congress.<br>We should remember what it felt like one year ago, as the ability to recall it emotionally will pass and it is an emotional memory as much as anything else. It was a moment rare in a democracy's history. The feeling was palpable--to supporters and opponents alike--that something important had happened. America had elected, the young candidate promised, a transformational president. And wrapped in a campaign that had produced the biggest influx of new voters and small-dollar contributions in a generation, the claim seemed credible, almost intoxicating, and just in time. <br> Yet a year into the presidency of Barack Obama, it is already clear that this administration is an opportunity missed. Not because it is too conservative. Not because it is too liberal. But because it is too conventional. Obama has given up the rhetoric of his early campaign--a campaign that promised to "challenge the broken system in Washington" and to "fundamentally change the way Washington works." Indeed, "fundamental change" is no longer even a hint. <br> Instead, we are now seeing the consequences of a decision made at the most vulnerable point of Obama's campaign--just when it seemed that he might really have beaten the party's presumed nominee. For at that moment, Obama handed the architecture of his new administration over to a team that thought what America needed most was another Bill Clinton. A team chosen by the brother of one of DC's most powerful lobbyists, and a White House headed by the quintessential DC politician. A team that could envision nothing more than the ordinary politics of Washington--the kind of politics Obama had called "small." A team whose imagination--politically--is tiny. <br> These tiny minds--brilliant though they may be in the conventional game of DC--have given up what distinguished Obama's extraordinary campaign. Not the promise of healthcare reform or global warming legislation--Hillary Clinton had embraced both of those ideas, and every other substantive proposal that Obama advanced. Instead, the passion that Obama inspired grew from the recognition that something fundamental had gone wrong in the way our government functions, and his commitment to reform it. <br> For Obama once spoke for the anger that has now boiled over in even the blue state Massachusetts--that our government is corrupt; that fundamental change is needed. As he told us, both parties had allowed "lobbyists and campaign contributions to rig the system." And "unless we're willing to challenge [that] broken system...nothing else is going to change." "The reason" Obama said he was "running for president [was] to challenge that system." For "if we're not willing to take up that fight, then real change--change that will make a lasting difference in the lives of ordinary Americans--will keep getting blocked by the defenders of the status quo." <br> This administration has not "taken up that fight." Instead, it has stepped down from the high ground the president occupied on January 20, 2009, and played a political game no different from the one George W. Bush played, or Bill Clinton before him. Obama has accepted the power of the "defenders of the status quo" and simply negotiated with them. "Audacity" fits nothing on the list of last year's activity, save the suggestion that this is the administration the candidate had promised. <br> Maybe this was his plan all along. It was not what he said. And by ignoring what he promised, and by doing what he attacked ("too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in"), Obama will leave the presidency, whether in 2013 or 2017, with Washington essentially intact and the movement he inspired betrayed. <br> That movement needs new leadership. On the right (the tea party) and the left (MoveOn and Bold Progressives), there is an unstoppable recognition that our government has failed. But both sides need to understand the source of its failure if either or, better, both together, are to respond. <br> At the center of our government lies a bankrupt institution: Congress. Not financially bankrupt, at least not yet, but politically bankrupt. Bush v. Gore notwithstanding, Americans' faith in the Supreme Court remains extraordinarily high--76 percent have a fair or great deal of "trust and confidence" in the Court. Their faith in the presidency is also high--61 percent. <br> But consistently and increasingly over the past decade, faith in Congress has collapsed--slowly, and then all at once. Today it is at a record low. Just 45 percent of Americans have "trust and confidence" in Congress; just 25 percent approve of how Congress is handling its job. A higher percentage of Americans likely supported the British Crown at the time of the Revolution than support our Congress today. <br> The source of America's cynicism is not hard to find. Americans despise the inauthentic. Gregory House, of the eponymous TV medical drama, is a hero not because he is nice (he isn't) but because he is true. Tiger Woods is a disappointment not because he is evil (he isn't) but because he proved false. We may want peace and prosperity, but most would settle for simple integrity. Yet the single attribute least attributed to Congress, at least in the minds of the vast majority of Americans, is just that: integrity. And this is because most believe our Congress is a simple pretense. That rather than being, as our framers promised, an institution "dependent on the People," the institution has developed a pathological dependence on campaign cash. The US Congress has become the Fundraising Congress. And it answers--as Republican and Democratic presidents alike have discovered--not to the People, and not even to the president, but increasingly to the relatively small mix of interests that fund the key races that determine which party will be in power. <br> This is corruption. Not the corruption of bribes, or of any other crime known to Title 18 of the US Code. Instead, it is a corruption of the faith Americans have in this core institution of our democracy. The vast majority of Americans believe money buys results in Congress (88 percent in a recent California poll). And whether that belief is true or not, the damage is the same. The democracy is feigned. A feigned democracy breeds cynicism. Cynicism leads to disengagement. Disengagement leaves the fox guarding the henhouse. <br> This corruption is not hidden. On the contrary, it is in plain sight, with its practices simply more and more brazen. Consider, for example, the story Robert Kaiser tells in his fantastic book So Damn Much Money, about Senator John Stennis, who served for forty-one years until his retirement in 1989. Stennis, no choirboy himself, was asked by a colleague to host a fundraiser for military contractors while he was chair of the Armed Services Committee. "Would that be proper?" Stennis asked. "I hold life and death over those companies. I don't think it would be proper for me to take money from them." <br> Is such a norm even imaginable in DC today? Compare Stennis with Max Baucus, who has gladly opened his campaign chest to $3.3 million in contributions from the healthcare and insurance industries since 2005, a time when he has controlled healthcare in the Senate. Or Senators Lieberman, Bayh and Nelson, who took millions from insurance and healthcare interests and then opposed the (in their states) popular public option for healthcare. Or any number of Blue Dog Democrats in the House who did the same, including, most prominently, Alabama's Mike Ross. Or Republican John Campbell, a California landlord who in 2008 received (as ethics reports indicate) between $600,000 and $6 million in rent from used car dealers, who successfully inserted an amendment into the Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act to exempt car dealers from financing rules to protect consumers. Or Democrats Melissa Bean and Walter Minnick, who took top-dollar contributions from the financial services sector and then opposed stronger oversight of financial regulations. <br> The list is endless; the practice open and notorious. Since the time of Rome, historians have taught that while corruption is a part of every society, the only truly dangerous corruption comes when the society has lost any sense of shame. Washington has lost its sense of shame. <br> As fundraising becomes the focus of Congress--as the parties force members to raise money for other members, as they reward the best fundraisers with lucrative committee assignments and leadership positions--the focus of Congressional "work" shifts. Like addicts constantly on the lookout for their next fix, members grow impatient with anything that doesn't promise the kick of a campaign contribution. The first job is meeting the fundraising target. Everything else seems cheap. Talk about policy becomes, as one Silicon Valley executive described it to me, "transactional." The perception, at least among industry staffers dealing with the Hill, is that one makes policy progress only if one can promise fundraising progress as well. <br> This dance has in turn changed the character of Washington. As Kaiser explains, Joe Rothstein, an aide to former Senator Mike Gravel, said there was never a "period of pristine American politics untainted by money.... Money has been part of American politics forever, on occasion--in the Gilded Age or the Harding administration, for example--much more blatantly than recently." But "in recent decades 'the scale of it has just gotten way out of hand.' The money may have come in brown paper bags in earlier eras, but the politicians needed, and took, much less of it than they take through more formal channels today." <br> And not surprisingly, as powerful interests from across the nation increasingly invest in purchasing public policy rather than inventing a better mousetrap, wealth, and a certain class of people, shift to Washington. According to the 2000 Census, fourteen of the hundred richest counties were in the Washington area. In 2007, nine of the richest twenty were in the area. Again, Kaiser: "In earlier generations enterprising young men came to Washington looking for power and political adventure, often with ambitions to save or reform the country or the world. In the last fourth of the twentieth century such aspirations were supplanted by another familiar American yearning: to get rich." <br> Rich, indeed, they are, with the godfather of the lobbyist class, Gerald Cassidy, amassing more than $100 million from his lobbying business. <br> Members of Congress are insulted by charges like these. They insist that money has no such effect. Perhaps, they concede, it buys access. (As former Representative Romano Mazzoli put it, "People who contribute get the ear of the member and the ear of the staff. They have the access--and access is it.") But, the cash-seekers insist, it doesn't change anyone's mind. The souls of members are not corrupted by private funding. It is simply the way Americans go about raising the money necessary to elect our government. <br> But there are two independent and adequate responses to this weak rationalization for the corruption of the Fundraising Congress. First: whether or not this money has corrupted anyone's soul--that is, whether it has changed any vote or led any politician to bend one way or the other--there is no doubt that it leads the vast majority of Americans to believe that money buys results in Congress. Even if it doesn't, that's what Americans believe. Even if, that is, the money doesn't corrupt the soul of a single member of Congress, it corrupts the institution--by weakening faith in it, and hence weakening the willingness of citizens to participate in their government. Why waste your time engaging politically when it is ultimately money that buys results, at least if you're not one of those few souls with vast sums of it? <br> "But maybe," the apologist insists, "the problem is in what Americans believe. Maybe we should work hard to convince Americans that they're wrong. It's understandable that they believe money is corrupting Washington. But it isn't. The money is benign. It supports the positions members have already taken. It is simply how those positions find voice and support. It is just the American way." <br> Here a second and completely damning response walks onto the field: if money really doesn't affect results in Washington, then what could possibly explain the fundamental policy failures--relative to every comparable democracy across the world, whether liberal or conservative--of our government over the past decades? The choice (made by Democrats and Republicans alike) to leave unchecked a huge and crucially vulnerable segment of our economy, which threw the economy over a cliff when it tanked (as independent analysts again and again predicted it would). Or the choice to leave unchecked the spread of greenhouse gases. Or to leave unregulated the exploding use of antibiotics in our food supply--producing deadly strains of E. coli. Or the inability of the twenty years of "small government" Republican presidents in the past twenty-nine to reduce the size of government at all. Or... you fill in the blank. From the perspective of what the People want, or even the perspective of what the political parties say they want, the Fundraising Congress is misfiring in every dimension. That is either because Congress is filled with idiots or because Congress has a dependency on something other than principle or public policy sense. In my view, Congress is not filled with idiots. <br> The point is simple, if extraordinarily difficult for those of us proud of our traditions to accept: this democracy no longer works. Its central player has been captured. Corrupted. Controlled by an economy of influence disconnected from the democracy. Congress has developed a dependency foreign to the framers' design. Corporate campaign spending, now liberated by the Supreme Court, will only make that dependency worse. "A dependence" not, as the Federalist Papers celebrated it, "on the People" but a dependency upon interests that have conspired to produce a world in which policy gets sold. <br> No one, Republican or Democratic, who doesn't currently depend upon this system should accept it. No president, Republican or Democratic, who doesn't change this system could possibly hope for any substantive reform. For small-government Republicans, the existing system will always block progress. There will be no end to extensive and complicated taxation and regulation until this system changes (for the struggle over endless and complicated taxation and regulation is just a revenue opportunity for the Fundraising Congress). For reform-focused Democrats, the existing system will always block progress. There will be no change in fundamental aspects of the existing economy, however inefficient, from healthcare to energy to food production, until this political economy is changed (for the reward from the status quo to stop reform is always irresistible to the Fundraising Congress). In a single line: there will be no change until we change Congress. <br> That Congress is the core of the problem with American democracy today is a point increasingly agreed upon by a wide range of the commentators. But almost universally, these commentators obscure the source of the problem. <br> Some see our troubles as tied to the arcane rules of the institution, particularly the Senate. Ezra Klein of the Washington Post, for example, has tied the failings of Congress to the filibuster and argues that the first step of fundamental reform has got to be to fix that. Tom Geoghegan made a related argument in these pages in August, and the argument appears again in this issue. (Of course, these pages were less eager to abolish the filibuster when the idea was floated by the Republicans in 2005, but put that aside.) 
 This article was written by Pejman Yousefzadeh of The New Ledger.</b> <br>It is difficult to catalog just how many contradictions there were in the President's State of the Union address. A President calling for bipartisanship and an end to the permanent campaign gave a speech that was-in tone and in substance-a campaign speech. A President calling for unity gave a speech that practically cried out "all the bad stuff that happened was George W. Bush's fault!" A President calling for a renewal of national purpose spent large amounts of time playing class warfare games, and seeking to turn Americans against Wall Street. That latter activity is an easy one to engage in. But just because something is easy, does not make it right. <br> Above all else, the contradiction most clear in the President's speech was his pretense to a renewed bout of listening to the American people, while at the same time presenting a domestic policy program that seemed to have been crafted before the poll numbers of the President and his party went south, and before Massachusetts elected a Republican to fill the seat once held by Ted Kennedy. Yes, it is good that the President is proposing that we eliminate capital gains taxes on small business investment. <br> But that doesn't make up for the tax that he wants to impose on banks, simply because banks are not popular these days, and despite the fact that many banks have repaid the emergency loans that they got, with interest, and that many of the banks affected by the proposed imposition of the President's new tax never took bailout money in the first place. Yes, it is good that he is advocating an expansion of charter schools. But that doesn't make up for the fact that Democrats-under President Obama's watch, and with his approval-killed the D.C. school choice program because they placed teacher union interests over those of parents and schoolchildren. <br> Much time was spent by the President patting himself, and his Administration on the back for the stimulus bill passed last year. However, the stimulus bill has done little to influence the state of the economy for the better; even <a href="http://newledger.com/2010/01/too-dumb-to-write-columns-for-time/">proponents</em> of the stimulus package are forced to recognize that most of the stimulus money that went out to ordinary Americans got used for bill-paying (thus defeating the purpose of actual stimulus, and that the actual "shovel-ready" projects will not come around until next year, which means that we may well have engaged in stimulus spending that was entirely unnecessary, seeing as how the economy may recover on its own by 2011 without stimulus funds. Stimulus spending is supposed to impact the economy while the economy is still suffering a downturn. Once the economy has recovered, there is no need whatsoever for stimulus spending; in that circumstance, all that is accomplished by such spending is an increase in the federal budget deficit. <br> The most blatant example of the President pretending to hear the American people, while not doing so, came with the discussion of health care reform. Despite the fact that the national mood has turned quite decisively against the President's program, and despite the victory in Massachusetts(!) of a senatorial candidate who ran promising to stop the Democrats' vision of health care reform, the President acted as though nothing had changed politically, and did not give even the slightest amount of lip service to Republican ideas on health care reform-ideas like purchasing health insurance across state lines, or introducing tort reform, which if included in a health care bill, could have given that bill the bipartisan support necessary for passage. <br> As I have written before, the President's promise of a spending freeze-which he repeated during the State of the Union address-is welcome, given the free-spending that went on this past year. But it is not nearly enough; there will not be a return to fiscal health until and unless the United States gets serious about entitlement reform. Unfortunately, there was no discussion whatsoever concerning entitlement reform in the President's speech, and I am willing to bet dollars to donuts that there will be nothing about entitlement reform this year, or any other year during Barack Obama's Presidency, concerning entitlement reform. Nor will Congressional Democrats come out with any important entitlement reform proposals. <br> Perhaps one of the worst instances of demagoguery came with the following passage: <br> ". . . Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests - including foreign corporations - to spend without limit in our elections. Well I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and that's why I'm urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong." <br> This argument is not even close to being true, and it is more than a little embarrassing that a law lecturer who once taught at one of the nation's elite law schools should so thoroughly have botched the description of a Supreme Court ruling. No law professor worth his or her salt would have accepted from a student so misleading a statement about the Citizens United ruling as Barack Obama gave to the country. Justice Alito's dismay concerning the President's demagoguery was entirely justified. <br> The President's speech did not lack statements with which I could agree, and I don't want to cause people to think otherwise. But at the end of it, I was struck by the fact that what Barack Obama said about TV pundits could apply to his own rhetoric. According to the President, these pundits "reduce serious debates into silly arguments, and big issues into sound bites," and as a consequence, "our citizens turn away." If the President wonders why so many of the American people have soured on his leadership, a little over a year after he took office, he need not look further than his own speech for the explanation. <br> By Pejman Yousefzadeh: Reprinted with permission from The New Ledger. 
 Irwin M. Stelzer is a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard, director of economic policy studies at the Hudson Institute, and a columnist for the Sunday Times (London).<br>Enough is enough. That is the message the most reliably Democratic state in America sent to President Obama and his Democratic congress Tuesday when its voters chose Republican Scott Brown to represent them in the U.S. Senate. <br> The majority of Americans style themselves as somewhere between centrist and center-right, and were not happy to see centrist candidate Obama morph into leftist President Obama. He pressed for a government takeover of the health care system, and government involvement in the banking, energy, auto, insurance and other sectors. And he launched a spending spree that will leave future generations to pick up the bill for huge deficits.Never mind that his bank bailouts might have prevented a collapse of the financial system, and at least some of the spending made up for the collapse of private sector investment and consumer spending. All in all, the president's effort to convert America into a European-style social democracy was more than voters could abide. <br> The message from Massachusetts will have a profound effect on economic policy. When the president delivers his State of the Union message next week we will see the new populist Obama -- not the elitist who derided Senator-elect Scott Brown for driving to campaign meetings in his truck. Banks beware: There is more to come in addition to new taxes as Obama appeals to disaffected voters by beating up on bonus-laden bankers. The presidential wish list includes, among other things, a ban on the operation of hedge funds and private equity funds by any "bank backed by the American people." <br> It is easy to deride this as vulgar populism, but that hardly describes their principal proponent, former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. The fact is that too big to fail means a bank is too big, as conservative Carnegie Mellon/American Enterprise Institute economist Allan Meltzer has said, and no populist is he. Republicans who deride such a program had better get their intellectual case in order. <br> We will also see a president who has, to use the Washington word, "pivoted" from "transforming" the economy to cutting the deficit and creating jobs. The president wants to appoint a commission to devise ways of reducing the deficit from double digits to 3 percent of GDP by 2015. But Republicans see this as a way of kicking the problem into the long grass until after the 2010 elections, and implicating their party in the tax increases the president and congressional Democrats favor. The last such commission, created to save the social security (pension) system from collapse, made little progress until President Ronald Reagan and Democratic House leader Tip O'Neill, both likeable, pragmatic politicians, cut a deal. But pragmatism and likeability are in short supply in today's Washington. Still, it seems likely that some form of cooperative effort to restore fiscal sanity will emerge from the on-going negotiations. Despite their disinclination to involve themselves in figuring out ways to pay the bills run up by free-spending Democrats, Republicans will be hard-pressed to refuse cooperation with a commission with a proper remit. <br> So much for the deficit. On to jobs. It is easy for economists, many with tenure at universities, others at investment banks flush with cash, still others ensconced in secure federal government jobs, to say that the jobs market is improving. And it is. But it doesn't feel like that to the 17.2 percent of Americans who are out of work, involuntarily working only part time, or so discouraged that they have stopped looking for jobs. Or to their neighbors, who fear they might be next for the chop. <br> So the president will offer a mlange of alleged job-creating policies ranging from modest tax breaks for companies that add staff and for small businesses, to spending on specific green energy projects, and on infrastructure. However, the words "a second stimulus" will not pass his lips as voters are suffering from buyers' remorse after supporting the first $787 billion package. <br> The drive to bring down the unemployment rate will not stop with the proposals in the president's State of the Union message. The Massachusetts election, in which independent voters deserted the Democrats in droves, increases the party's dependence on the trade unions that have the cash and the manpower to deliver Democrats' core voters in the 2010 congressional and 2012 presidential elections. And those unions are not exactly disciples of Adam Smith. <br> The president has already imposed tariffs on tires and some steel products imported largely from China. The next target of the unions is Chinese-made glass. They point out that the World Trade Center's Twin Towers were sheathed in good old made-in-the-U.S.A. glass, but the building that is springing up to replace it will be covered with glass imported from China. Whether that is because Chinese glass-makers receive government subsidies, as the unions allege, or because the Chinese are more efficient glassmakers, matters less to politicians, and to many Americans, than the symbolism of America's new Freedom Tower being covered in Chinese glass. <br> Add to the mix the fact that many of the world's leading economies are depending on export-led growth to get their economies out of recession, and that the Chinese show no signs of allowing their currency to float upward from the undervalued level at which it is pegged. These countries continue to see Americans as the world's consumers of last resort, while at the same time calling on the U.S. to reduce its trade deficit. <br> What our trading partners see as the export of goods and services, our politicians will see as importing unemployment. True, consumers here benefit from lower-cost imports, even from those subsidized by job-hungry China. Consumers are the winners, workers the losers. And unlike consumers, unions are organized to put pressure on Congress. <br> Policymakers live in dread of "unintended consequences," unanticipated and undesirable results of their actions. One unintended consequence of Scott Brown's election might just be greater reliance on protectionist measures by politicians who believe they have to cut unemployment now, regardless of the long-run consequences. And without increasing spending. <br> Another, and cheerier possibility, is that the Democrats' new need for a bit of bipartisan cooperation from Republicans will produce legislative compromises of the sort that resulted in tax reform during the Reagan years and welfare reform when Bill Clinton occupied the White House, the sort of centrist compromise Americans prefer. <br> By Irwin M.

 As the Democrats hysterically reel away from heath care reform in the wake of Scott ("My daughters are available") Brown's win in Massachusetts, I'd like to suggest the sort of personnel change President Obama needs to make in order to recoup his populist mojo: fire Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and replace him with Conan O'Brien. Why? Because Conan clearly has a grasp of exactly what you should do when, after years of grueling effort, the Man jerks your chain just as you're on the brink of realizing a long-cherished goal. <br> Like a lot of people, I don't really care about these late-night shows or the celebrity "controversies" they generate (if I can stay up that late, I'm watching Colbert or the Maddow rerun anyway). But NBC's Jay Leno/Conan O'Brien saga has started to display the same structural shape--that is, high-handed corporate incompetence in which all nasty consequences are relentlessly shifted onto workers below the perpetrator in the pecking order--that has characterized our nation's financial crisis. And Conan has the cojones to be admirably, even hilariously, petty about it in public. <br> Jeff Zucker, the NBC/Universal chief who juggled Leno and ultimately displaced O'Brien, is--like Goldman Sachs head Lloyd Blankfein when he was holding onto those worthless liens against AIG--the sort of grasping corporate exec who will not make tough decisions and instead ties everyone around him into contractual knots while hoping it will all work out in the end. After promising Conan that if he waited five years The Tonight Show would be his, Zucker pulled the half-baked, absurd gambit of moving Leno to 10 p.m. every weeknight with a terrible show that killed local news ratings and strangled Conan's lead-in. When the network's affiliates complained, Zucker just said "nevermind," and tried at first to squeeze Leno into Conan's first half hour; when that proved to be DOA, NBC agreed to pay the younger star $45 million to just go away. <br> The dollar amounts are spelled with m's instead of b's or t's, but that, writ small, is Obama's conundrum with the banks. Like NBC, American bankers in the boom years could not make a tough decision about the bloated and obviously unsustainable derivatives market because they were reaping huge fees by pushing subprime mortgages. They weren't even able to entertain the notion that their magic algebra couldn't go on forever, much less that it could add up to a Ponzi scheme that would sink the entire economy. They were hoping that some slapdash patch, some absurd dodge, some last-minute fix--like giving Hank Paulson nearly a trillion dollars in TARP money and the keys to the Fed window in the last 10 minutes of George Bush's presidency--would save their butts. <br> It did, too. But when you look at the financial equation the bankers and their friends in the two political parties wrote out for us, you can see immediately that it was a raw deal. The moneymen raked in at least $10 trillion in taxpayer funds as aid to the banks and other financial entities like AIG. Obama assumed in return that he'd get a stimulus bill of about $.8 trillion and the long-needed overhauls of America's health insurance system, environmental policies, and fiscal regulations. He got the .8 (though he had to dedicate a third of it to pointless tax cuts rather than to actual job creation or aid to the foundering states). But when the time came to pass health reform, the political/financial complex dug in their heels. They went so far as to mount a deviously phony-populist slander campaign against reform, with much of the corporate ad money secretly laundered through the Chamber of Commerce, FreedomWorks, and other such fronts. (With today's Supreme Court's decision that corporations may spend as much as they want in ad campaigns for a politician, who needs a laundromat?) <br> So, what Obama needs is a little bit of Conan's anarchic elan. If the banks--who, as Sen. Dick Durbin said of the Congress, "own the place"--won't let him spend money to reform healthcare, he should use his majority to rewrite the tax laws (tax rate changes require only 50 Senate votes and the Vice President's) to take Wall Street's bonus money back. After all, as Rediscovering Values author Jim Wallis said on Jon Stewart last night, the $150 billion that just six banks paid out as bonuses in 2009 could eliminate or postpone all home foreclosures through 2012, or erase the budget gaps in all 50 states. At the least, it could help rebuild Haiti. <br> Yes, O'Brien could show Geithner how it's done. And to paraphrase Scott Brown, Conan is available. <br> By Leslie Savan:Reprinted with permission from The Nation

He is a lawyer in New York City. <br>You can't throw a rock in the blogosphere without hitting a postmortem on Scott Brown's decisive defeat of Martha Coakley for the Massachusetts Senate seat formerly infested by Ted Kennedy and, before him, JFK himself. I may as well add my own. <br> Here are seven lessons to be drawn: <br> 1. Defeat Has Many Fathers: <br> There's an awful temptation to spin the vote for Brown as the result of this cause or that - Coakley was a terrible, gaffe-prone candidate, Brown was a good one, glamorous and hard-working, Democrats were caught napping, voters were upset about Obamacare, voters were spooked by the Underwear Bomber, the special election was strangely timed, the enthusiasm gap, the poor track record of female candidates in Massachusetts, etc. But the fact is, it had to be all of them. <br> Look: In the past three decades, Republicans have won zero Senate races in Massachusetts but have won the Governorship four times with three different candidates. Bill Weld got 50.19% of the vote when he was elected in 1990, Paul Cellucci 50.81% in 1998, and Mitt Romney 49.77% in 2002. (Weld got over 70% of the vote when he was re-elected in 1994). Brown beat Coakley 52-47, meaning that he had the best showing by a non-incumbent top-level statewide Republican in decades. For contrast, in 2006, Deval Patrick carried Massachusetts 56-35, a 21-point margin. In 2008, Barack Obama carried Massachusetts 62-36, a 26-point margin. In other words, <strong>the electorate swung 26 points from the 2006 Governor's race and 31 points from the 2008 presidential race</em>. <br> And turnout was very, very strong for a special election - there were 2,249,026 ballots cast compared to 2,219,779 in the 2006 Governor's race, a regularly scheduled election (2,165,490 votes were cast in that year's Senate race). A special election on a cold day in January outdrawing an Election Day race is surely a sign of an energized and plugged-in electorate, especially in a state where a vast proportion of the population is college students, many of whom were returning from winter break just before or after the election. Brown's showing was so strong and turnout so high, he actually got more votes (1,168,107 to 1,104,284) than John McCain did in a presidential election year (when 3,048,438 votes were cast). <br> A swing that huge can't be, and never is, explained by only one factor. Jim Bunning's re-election campaign in 2004 was every bit as disastrous as George Allen's and Conrad Burns' in 2006, but a favorable environment saved Bunning, while a hostile one helped sink Allen and Burns. Here, similarly, it took a bad environment to make Coakley vulnerable even with all her gaffes and blunders. <br> So, let the condemnations of the Coakley campaign go on, especially how inexcusably she was caught off guard even after Republicans wrested the Governor's races in Virginia and especially New Jersey out of Democratic hands - even if you ascribed those races to poor candidates, that was no reason to think you could safely be a poor candidate. <br> On the issues, it's also been overlooked the extent to which Brown made inroads by pounding Coakley on national security, an issue that suddenly returned to prominence after the Christmas Day arrest of the Underwear Bomber. Brown's campaign believed that this was an under-discussed factor: <br> "Scott Brown's top strategist, Eric Fehrnstrom, told reporters this morning that Brown's demand that terror suspects be tried outside civilian courts had proven a more powerful issue than health care in the Massachusetts senate race. Brown said during the campaign that he didn't believe the Christmas Day bomber should be tried in civilian courts, and said he didn't think waterboarding is torture. He ran an ad arguing that Constitutional rights don't apply to terror suspects." <br> Contrasted to Coakley, who claimed in a debate that there were no terrorists in Afghanistan (not long after the suicide bombing there that reportedly killed several CIA agents) and later griped that she'd had to take too dovish a stance on the Afghan war to survive the primary, At a minumum, Brown succeeded in drawing a contrast on national security without suffering any appreciable damage for taking basically the Dick Cheney position. (The one exit poll taken by a Republican polling firm showed higher voter support for President Obama's position on Afghanistan - a position more hawkish than Coakley's - than Obama's overall approval rating). <br> All of that said, it's positively insane for pundits to ignore the fact that a Brown victory would have been impossible, no matter how inept Coakley's campaign, without widespread voter concern - reflected in national polls for months now - that the national Democrats were headed in the wrong direction on health care and on the size of government. Michael Moynihan at Reason had probably the best roundup of anecdotes on this trend: <br> "I have spent the past few days talking to union members, former Democrats, current Democrats, Kennedy voters, former Deval Patrick enthusiasts, and gay rights campaigners who are - as almost all of them say - Scott Brown supporters worried about the "explosive growth of government." All natives of the commonwealth and reflexively Democratic, they kvetch about spending, taxes, and health care. As one member of a pipefitters union told me, "none of the guys in my union trust that Obama won't hit us with that 40 percent health care tax." <br> What little we have in the way of exit polls corroborates this view: <br> Fifty-two percent of Bay State voters who were surveyed as the polls closed said they opposed the federal health care reform measure and 42 percent said they cast their ballot to help stop President Obama from passing his chief domestic initiative. <br> "I'm not surprised it was the top issue, but I was surprised by how overwhelming an issue it was. It became a focal point for the frustration that has been brewing with voters, and it's a very personal issue that affects everyone," said Tony Fabrizio of Fabrizio, McLaughlin Associates, a Republican firm that conducted the exit poll of 800 voters.According to Fabrizio's findings, 48 percent of Massachusetts voters said that health care was the single issue driving their vote and 39 percent said they voted for Brown specifically because of his vocal opposition to the measure. <br> The fact that many of these voters expressed approval of Obama - 55% - may provide some comfort to the president personally, but it's of no use to anybody else trying to defend votes in favor of his agenda. <br> The reason for this is that Obama and the national Democrats have tried to push the electorate too far too fast in the direction of radical changes to domestic policy even for the voters of the Northeast. One meme emerging on the Left is that Bush was vastly more effective in getting legislation passed with fewer Senators than Obama - but if you look at the extensive record of Bush's first term, as well as the more modest record of his second, what do you see? You see tax cuts, but as Reagan and Clinton illustrated, Presidents usually get their way on tax policy, and the next guy gets his own crack. You see a lot of action on foreign policy and in some cases (the Patriot Act) domestic national security policy, also an area where the country traditionally expects Congress to do what the President wants. You see a battery of bipartisan, centrist or neoliberal legislative actions that nobody would rightly call conservative priorities - No Child Left Behind, McCain-Feingold, Sarbanes-Oxley, the Medicare Prescription Drug bill, the bankruptcy bill, the creation of the Homeland Security Department, various horrible farm bills (Bush's failed immigration bill would have fallen in this category). And you do see a few conservative priorities with broad bipartisan support - the partial-birth abortion ban, the Class Action Fairness Act. <br> But what of agenda items as large and ideologically divisive as Obamacare, cap and trade or the stimulus bill? Social Security reform never got proposed, let alone voted on. School choice was dropped from NCLB. Drilling in ANWR never passed. Bush never even tried to enact deep budget cuts of any kind. If Bush was better at attracting bipartisan support, it's because most of his agenda wasn't the kind of overreach that Obama's is. <br> The supporting evidence backs up the exit poll on the Brown voters's unease at all this. Multiple polls up to the election - polls that had Brown in the neighborhood of his final margin of victory - showed Brown winning around the same proportion of independent voters (about two-thirds) as Bob McDonnell in Virginia and Chris Christie in New Jersey. The consistency of those numbers across different states certainly suggests a broader trend than just the incompetence of Democratic candidates (although it may be especially pronounced in states with unpopular Democratic Governors). <br> The turnout for this election under these circumstances also compellingly suggests that the voters understood perfectly well the stakes, endlessly repeated in the media - that a Brown victory would put an end to the Democrats' carte blanche ability to pass health care and other legislation without making any compromises needed to garner Republican support, and that in particular the health care bill would probably be doomed if Brown won. People may make their minds up about which candidate they like better for a variety of reasons, but nobody drags themselves out of the house in the middle of January to go vote just because one candidate is a good-looking guy with a truck and the other one thinks Curt Schilling's a Yankees fan. <br> We can quote chapter and verse on the polls all day, but the turnout of 2.2 million people speaks more eloquently than any poll. This election mattered, and the voters treated it as if it did. <br> The results will be debated at length, but it's impossible to square the massive size of the turnaround in perhaps the nation's buest state with the idea that the only people concerned about the growth of government are right-wing nutcases. <br> 2. Of RINOs and Tea Parties: One of the underrated factors in Brown's victory was the unanimity of his support from the Right to the center-right. Brown is a moderate Republican of the type who'd draw a primary opponent, and deservedly so, in a state like Utah or South Carolina. Among other things, he's pro-choice and supports the state's Romneycare health plan, and analyses of his voting record showed him to the left of his other GOP colleagues in the Massachusetts state Senate. But unlike the state legislators who ran in special elections in New York's 20th and 23d Districts, Brown drew the united and enthusiastic support of conservative Republicans and "tea party" groups. Why? Partly due to the stakes and symbolism in the election, and partly due to a willingness to tolerate almost anything for a win in Massachusetts - but also because despite Brown's moderation, he was with the Right on opposing the Big Three prongs of Obama's plan for metastatic growth of federal spending and regulation. He vowed to filibuster Obamacare, albeit arguing against it in good part on federalism grounds. He blasted "cap and trade" as an unaffordable tax hike. And he tore into the stimulus, arguing that the stimulus "didn't work" while calling for a spending freeze, and warned that the stimulus money could be a crutch to prevent localities from facing their budget problems sooner. He also signed a no-new-taxes pledge. <br> In short, Brown drew a sharp contrast between his position and that of the Beltway Democrats on spending and the growth of government - and that clear contrast on policy allowed him to keep his own base united while pursuing a basically upbeat campaign of outreach to the center and while departing from standard-issue Republicanism on other issues. His successful campaign underscores the point I've made for some time: as long as a candidate is with the party on its dominant theme (which at present is opposition to runaway government), each election needs to be evaluated on its merits with an eye to finding candidates suited to their local conditions. <br> 3. The High Hard One: As I noted above, the evidence suggests that the political climate and Brown's use of the issues were at least as large a factor in his victory as Coakley's missteps. That being said, Coakley's ham-handed response to Curt Schilling has to make his endorsement of Brown one of the most consequential celebrity endorsements in electoral history, given the extent to which the Schilling gaffe put Coakley off her game in the race's closing news cycles and contributed to the despair and embarrassment of her supporters. (I asked on Twitter for other genuinely impactful celebrity endorsements, and suggestions included Oprah's primary endorsement of Obama, James Brown endorsing Nixon in 1968 and Sinatra endorsing JFK in 1960). Take-home lesson: celebrity endorsements can be distracting and can backfire, but you never know when they'll come in handy - and it's dangerous for a candidate to fire back directly at a popular celebrity. <br> 4. Obama Can't Help You Now: I've written about this at length before after the defeats of Corzine and Deeds, and you can now add Coakley to the list: an appearance by Obama can't save a failing Democrat. Whether or not Obama is a net negative, his presence doesn't seem to be moving the needle in favor of anyone but himself. Note that Bill Owens, the winning Democratic candidate in NY-23, did not have an Obama appearance. <br> 5. Ted Shoulda Quit While He Was Ahead: The Democrats put themselves in the situation of having to call a special election in two ways. First, they changed the law in 2004 to require an election rather than a gubernatorial appointment for an open Senate seat, because if John Kerry beat George W. Bush they didn't want Mitt Romney nominating his replacement. A flagrantly opportunistic effort to change that law back petered out last summer. Second - and Erick Erickson has gotten a lot of flak for saying this on CNN, but it happens to be true - they could have held the election much earlier in a much more favorable political climate if Ted Kennedy had stepped down when it became apparent that he was dying. Ted's insistence on staying in office until his death ended up being the undoing of his party and, perhaps, of his lifelong goal of national government health insurance. <br> 6. Hard Times For The Ladies: Pundits are far too quick to draw conclusions about voter racism/sexism from sample sizes as small as one election, but putting aside Hillary Clinton beating Barack Obama in the Massachusetts Democratic primary in 2008, the record of female politicians at the statewide level in Massachusetts over the past decade has been terrible. Republican Jane Swift, promoted to Governor from Lieutenant Governor when Cellucci left offfice for an ambassadorship, made headlines for giving birth to twins in office, but was so widely mocked and reviled across the partisan and ideological spectrum that she didn't run for re-election. Democratic State Treasurer Shannen O'Brien's campaign against Mitt Romney in 2002 was a flop, and observers generally viewed her as a weak candidate who lost a winnable race and engaged in silly and pointless attacks. GOP Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey got crushed by Deval Patrick in 2006. And now Coakley, who will doubtless be remembered as one of the worst statewide candidates in memory in any state, at least among those who'd been heavily favored to win an election. Women have had plenty of success in statewide office in the Northeast - Jodi Rell, Jeanne Shaheen, Hillary Clinton, Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins - but not in Massachusetts. <br> 7. Nobody's Safe: The biggest impact of this election, beyond what it does to the healthcare bill, is its effect on recruitment, retirement and morale in races around the country - in Indiana, for example, there'd seem few safer red-state Democrats than Senator and former Governor Evan Bayh, but the GOP is now trying to recruit Congressman Mike Pence to challenge Bayh; Pence would be a formidable opponent. Republicans are now fired up for Senate races in Illinois, Delaware and (if George Pataki can be recruited) New York for Senate seats previously held by Obama, Joe Biden and Hillary, respectively. <br> Perhaps the race where the incumbent's fortunes must be most dramatically re-evaluated after Brown's victory is Barbara Boxer's race for re-election in California. Boxer's polls have been in the dumps for some time now; the latest Rasmussen poll shows her with just 46% of the vote against each of her three Republican opponents (the fact that Boxer has drawn three significant opponents - Tom Campbell, Chuck DeVore, and Carly Fiorina - should say something in itself). That said, whenever I've thought about that race or talked to anyone else about it, the usual response is "yes, but it's California." <br> Brown's victory changes all that, at least for 2010, anyway. There's no guarantee that a candidate as arrogant, brittle, thin-skinned and hard-left as Boxer can just bank on a compliant one-party electorate against an energized populist opponent, not in this climate. That doesn't mean Boxer will be easy pickings, by any means - the California GOP is more than capable of self-destruction, and Boxer is a street fighter - but it does mean the effort to challenge her can't just be written off based on the state she's running in. <br> Not if it can happen in Massachusetts. <br> By Dan McLaughlin: Reprinted with permission from The New Ledger. 
 Lydia Depillis is a reporter-researcher for The New Republic.<hr width="50%">The closest thing Congress has to its own Tea Party takes place every Wednesday afternoon, in the Gold Room of the Rayburn House Office building. At 1:15, more than 100 congressmen and one aide each gather for the meeting of the Republican Study Committee, and for a little over an hour, the legislators chat about their latest projects to reduce the size of government-or, at least, to stop the latest Democrat effort to expand it. <br> The RSC, once a huddle on the party's far right, now claims nearly two thirds of the conference as members, and has been launching some of the most strident and effective attacks against Nancy Pelosi's agenda. Joe Pitts, of the bipartisan Stupak-Pitts amendment barring federal money from funding abortion in health care legislation, heads the RSC's values action team. A former RSC chairman, Jeb Hensarling, was at the forefront of the GOP's unanimous opposition to financial regulatory reform. Marsha Blackburn, another active RSC member, became the party's point person to slam action on climate change in Copenhagen. Meanwhile, after years bedeviling House GOP leadership from the right, a former chairman has crashed the leadership's inner circle--and RSC members are the ones generating a suite of ideas that could form the basis of Republican governance should the party take the House back in 2010. <br> In part, the growing prominence of the RSC stems from the GOP's ill fortune: when a party is out of power, its fringes thrive. "I think, in the minority, you're not responsible for governing, you're not as sensitive to the outer edges of your ideological system. " explains RSC member Mike Conaway , of Texas. "You can be a little purer in your ideology than when you're trying to get things done." <br> But this RSC has more than just hot air behind it. The new conservative energy bubbling up in tea party protests and primary challenges around the country isn't particularly friendly to Republicans; a recent poll had Republicans even trailing the Tea Party as a political brand. To those grassroots activists, RSC members-not Michael Steele, in his hamhanded bid for tea party cred -are the good guys. <br> That rapport was on display one evening in early December, when three of the RSC's leading lights-Blackburn, Joe Wilson, and current chairman Tom Price-headlined the Washington, D.C. premiere<span> of Tea Party: The Documentary Film. Price, a slim Georgia orthopedist with a pious mien, features prominently in the movie, and was greeted with cheers. 
 Irwin M. Stelzer is a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard, director of economic policy studies at the Hudson Institute, and a columnist for the Sunday Times London.<br>I have nothing but sympathy for those economists compelled, or who feel compelled, to deliver detailed forecasts of GDP, prices, the value of the dollar, the unemployment rate and other economic variables at the beginning of each year. And this year their crystal balls must be cloudier than ever, witness the wide range of forecasts, some expecting the economy to grow by more than 3%, others foreseeing no growth at all or even a decline in economic activity. <br> A prominent economist, at one time a leading figure on the British Treasury team, recently wrote, "Forecasting errors are largest when the most is happening in the economy." It is difficult to imagine more happening in the economy in 2009 than actually did, and 2010 should be no different. And predicting where the economy is heading is made even more complicated by important known unknowns, and the key role policy will play. <br> Those known unknowns include the possibility that Iran might explode a nuclear device or Israel might make that impossible; Islamic terrorists, who failed in their recent attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit, might succeed in an attack on New York, London or some other major financial center, or on the Saudi oil fields. <br> An even greater source of uncertainty is the policymaking duo of Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke. In 2009 the president poured gallons of red ink over the nation's ledgers, while Bernanke's Fed printed money with which to buy up Obama's IOUs. There are hints that Obama and Bernanke, or both, will reverse course this year. The president says he plans what his staff calls "a pivot" early in the New Year, and will announce plans to rein in spending in the long run, which of course is not quite the same thing as doing it now. And the Fed is pointing to the various techniques available to it to sop up the excess liquidity with which it has flooded the system -- when it deems the time is right. <br> Which means that to predict the economy circa 2010 we are reduced to doing what John Maynard Keynes suggested if we want to pick the winner of a beauty contest -- don't try to pick the prettiest face, try to pick the face the judges will deem the most beautiful (I paraphrase). Guess right on how Obama and Bernanke will see things, and you have a winning prediction of economic activity in the new year. <br> The safest guess is that the president and the Democratic Congress will continue to run up the budget deficit. The House of Representatives already has passed a second stimulus, which dare not speak its name, and the president will soon sign a health care bill that will spill more red ink over the nation's ledgers. Then come unlimited billions for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-government mortgage agencies that account for something like 80% of all new mortgages. <br> Meanwhile, the Fed has made it clear that so long as the unemployment rate stays high, the financial and housing markets remain fragile, and credit remains difficult for small businesses to come by, it will not tighten, at least not a lot. Critics of the president and the Fed argue that the policy of big deficits, continued low interest rates, and money creation has failed. The unemployment rate has risen from 7.6% at the beginning of last year to 10%, and the number of long-term unemployed (out of work for more than 26 weeks) has more than doubled, to almost six million. Throw in mounting foreclosures, hundreds of failed banks, and business' reluctance to invest, and you hardly have a testimonial that Lord Keynes would like etched on his tombstone. <br> To which the response is: because of these policies the financial system did not collapse, the latest report showing a drop in jobless claims will likely be followed by a report that the economy is actually gaining jobs, the housing market is firming up, and even the bloodied dollar is showing signs of strength as investors guess that the recovering economy will drive interest rates up, increasing the attractiveness of dollar assets. <br> My own guess is that all of this means that the wind is blowing in the direction of a continued recovery, to borrow a phrase from my Sunday Times (London) colleague David Smith, and one more rapid than most observers are expecting. Consumers unzipped their purses late in the Christmas shopping season despite the absence of the deep discounting of recent years, and the presence of midwinter storms that kept even the most devoted "mall rats" at home -- shopping on the Internet. Share prices are up, and investors cheerier, in part because they don't take account of inflation when toting up their gains: factor inflation in, and it will take a further share price rise of 25%-30% to get them even with 1999 levels. <br> The important housing sector seems to have bottomed out, with sales of existing homes and prices both up a bit. But here is where policy -- difficult to forecast -- becomes crucial. If the Congress allows existing tax credits for first-time buyers to lapse, and the Fed withdraws its several supports for the mortgage market as it says it will, mortgage rates will rise, perhaps enough to abort a housing recovery that is fragile at best. Both programs are scheduled to end early this year, one in which voters will decide the fates of all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of Senators. It is anyone's guess whether these politicians, many already under pressure because of their support for the unpopular health care bill, will risk allowing these programs to die, and with them their careers in public office. <br> None of this is to say that policy making is all that matters. Far from it. Consumers account for some 70% of U.S. economic activity, and in the end are the ones whose reactions to policies will drive the economy. So it is good news that personal incomes and wages rose last month, and that the savings rate seems to have stabilized at around 5%, high enough to prevent a return to the negative rates of the spendthrift '90s, not so high as to put a crimp in the recovery. <br> Businesses, too, matter. Right now profits are good, and they are sitting on a pile of cash. But uncertainty as to the cost to be imposed upon them by the new health care "reform," the impending carbon cap-and-trade bill, and by the prospect of a huge boost in their tax bills, makes them reluctant to invest and to hire. <br> All in all, it is not unreasonable to guess that the wind will blow in a 2010 that is better for most people than 2009. Except for the congressmen who have to explain to their constituents why the budget deficit is projected to continue at levels that in the long run might well produce a wave of inflation, and for future generations that will have to bear the burden of trillions in government IOUs. <br> By Irwin M.

 Jonathan Chait is a senior editor of The New Republic.<hr width="50%">Does the Republican Party have any ideas? The query may have a familiar ring. Five years ago, the question of substance was demanded incessantly of the Democrats. Indeed, in one of those intellectual fads that periodically sweep through Washington, the political class became obsessed with the notion that conservatives had unambiguously won what everybody was calling "the war of ideas." <br> The notion was everywhere. The right gloated. ("Conservative thought," boasted right-wing foundation maven James Piereson, "has seized the initiative in the world of ideas.") Republicans scolded the opposition. (President Bush chastised Democrats in Congress: "[I]f they have no ideas or policies except obstruction, they should step aside and let others lead.") <br> And Democrats internalized the accusation. ("It makes me realize," observed labor leader Andrew Stern in 2005, "how vibrant the Republicans are in creating twenty-first-century ideas, and how sad it is that we're defending sixty-year-old ideas.") <br> We don't need the benefit of hindsight to grasp how silly it was to claim that the Bush-era Republican Party had risen to power on the crest of policy ideas whose time had come, or that the Democratic Party lacked an agenda of its own. The taunts about Democrats' lacking ideas was less a serious analysis than an attempt to bully the party into cooperating with Bush's plan to gradually privatize Social Security. (Click here to read about the history of conservatives opposing insane progressive ideas, such as women's suffrage and child labor laws.) <br> In reality, both parties have plenty of ideas that they would like to implement if given the political power to do so. Republicans' policy ideas primarily involve cutting marginal tax rates and regulations. The question isn't whether the Republican Party has any ideas. The question is whether the party has any relevant ideas. <br> In the days following the 2008 election, some Republicans predicted that the party would retool itself in response to reality--not just political reality but the actuality of policy challenges. "Republicans," wrote conservative Ramesh Ponnuru in Time, "will have to devise an agenda that speaks to a country where more people feel the bite of payroll taxes than income taxes, where health-care costs eat up raises even in good times, where the length of the daily commute is a bigger irritant than are earmarks." Nothing like that rethinking has happened or will happen. <br> Whatever the merits of President Obama's agenda, it is clearly a response to objectively large problems facing the country. The administration has selected three main issues as the focus of its domestic agenda: the economic crisis, climate change, and health care reform. The issues themselves offer a stark contrast with Bush's 2005 crusade to reshape Social Security. While sold as a response to the program's long-term deficit, the privatization campaign was actually motivated by ideological opposition to Social Security's redistributive role. (Bush refused Democratic offers to negotiate a fix to the program's solvency without altering its social-insurance character.) By contrast, it is impossible to dismiss the problems Obama has chosen to address. In all three areas, the Republican Party has adopted a stance of total opposition, not merely because it disagrees with aspects of Obama's solutions, but because it cannot come to grips with the very nature of the problems of modern American politics. <br> Begin with the economic crisis. The root cause of the collapse, as we all know by now, is that financial firms have grown so large and interconnected that the risks they incur can bring down the rest of the economy, forcing the government to intervene. After some initial support, the Republican response has been to denounce the financial bailout, without making any case that failing to save the financial system would have prevented a far deeper disaster. <br> To some extent, Republicans are simply exploiting populist anger. But the deeper problem lies in the rigidity of conservative ideology. In the most simple and pure market model, a business must be allowed to fail in order for capitalism to function. Once the government begins propping up failed firms, we have embarked upon the road to serfdom and there is no turning back. <br> As a general principle, this is eminently sensible. Yet it cannot accommodate the reality of a financial industry that, left to its own devices, can bring the rest of the economy down with it. David Frum, the former Bush speechwriter turned conservative apostate, recently recounted his attempt to persuade a group of young conservatives that they had to bend their principles in the face of economic calamity. As Frum recalls it, one of the conservative interlocutors replied, "Maybe it was a good thing we weren't in power then--because our principles don't allow us to respond to a crisis like this." <br> To deal with the fallout from the financial collapse, Obama helped shepherd a stimulus package consisting of temporary spending and tax cuts. There is some debate among economists as to the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus, though economic forecasting firms have arrived at a consensus that the stimulus helped cushion the blow of the recession. But the rhetoric within the GOP is utterly disconnected from this academic and professional economic analysis. In the Republican view, the stimulus has either done nothing whatsoever to help the economy, or it has deepened the recession. <br> House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, appearing at a recent public forum, complained that the media were ignoring his party's economic ideas. OK, replied a reporter, what are those ideas? Cantor could only pivot to his political calculation. "The big idea is to get, to get, to produce an environment where we can have job creation again," he replied. "And see, that's where the Obama administration's agenda so clearly disadvantages the Democrats in this upcoming election in eleven months and advantages us." So the "idea" is to exploit public discontent over the economy. <br> Republicans do have an alternative--albeit one they understandably prefer not to discuss in any detail. Senator Jim DeMint introduced a GOP stimulus plan, authored by the Heritage Foundation, that consists of making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adding onto them a series of permanent tax breaks heavily tilted toward corporations and high-income earners. It would cost more than $3 trillion--more than triple the cost of Obama's stimulus--over the next decade, after which point its costs would continue to accrue (whereas the stimulus will end after a few years). This is some sort of ideological brain-stem reflex, not the product of any analysis of the state of the U.S. economy. <br> One observer dismissed DeMint's plan thusly: "It is not innovative or particularly clever. In fact, it's only eleven pages." Oddly enough, this observer was DeMint himself, talking up his proposal in a speech at the Heritage Foundation. On the contemporary right, it is a mark of intellectual integrity that even a massive economic cataclysm would not prompt any revising of one's economic prescription. And, while DeMint speaks from the fringe of the party, his beliefs are by no means confined to it: 90 percent of the current Senate GOP caucus voted for his plan. <br> On climate change, the Republican response has been equally instructive. The largest and most strident bloc of Republican opinion remains deeply skeptical of mainstream climate science. (I don't have the space here to defend the legitimacy of the overwhelming majority opinion among climate scientists. Suffice it to say that if you believe most scientists have fabricated evidence that carbon emissions contribute to rising global temperatures, you won't find these five paragraphs persuasive.) Those Republican legislators who have supported any action on climate change have rallied around a plan to construct nuclear reactors, which, in addition to costing $600 billion and taking a decade to have any effect, would reduce carbon emissions by a mere 12 percent. The one Republican senator who has urged a comprehensive solution, Lindsey Graham, has found himself under severe attack from home-state Republicans and threatened by a primary challenger. <br> Granted, some of the GOP's reticence stems from its alliance with energy interests--a failing that numerous Democrats share. Yet the Republican opposition to limiting carbon-dioxide emissions also closely reflects currents of right-wing thought. <br> A decade ago, nearly all conservatives rejected the connection between carbon emissions and climate change. Though many still do, a growing minority of right-wingers now accepts the mainstream scientific position. However, rather than proceed from that premise to some program of reduced emissions, they have feverishly devised a series of rationales for unlimited carbon use. Some have embraced fantastical geoengineering schemes--massive machines, for example, that would suck carbon out of the sky--with the rabid certainty of a science-fiction nut. Others insist that limiting U.S. emissions will do nothing to help force developing nations to do the same. <br> Still other conservatives argue that the future world will be richer and thus able to cope with whatever calamities a hotter planet will bring.The telling thing here is not that these arguments are provably wrong, though they are highly speculative. It's that those conservatives who have accepted climate-change science immediately jumped to some other reason to oppose government action. These reasons are, in theory, separate logical propositions: The feasibility of creating giant machines to suck carbon out of the sky has nothing to do with the diplomatic question of whether U.S. climate action could influence China to follow suit. <br> Yet virtually no conservative intellectuals seem to settle, even temporarily, on the view that climate change is real and that government regulation is therefore appropriate. They cling to climate-science skepticism like a life preserver, and then, when they can't hold on any more, they grasp immediately for a different rationale. If government intervention appears to be the answer, they must change the question. <br> Finally, there is health care. As on climate change, Republicans long denied that this issue constituted a problem at all. The party line held that the United States has the best health care in the world. (In reality, despite spending vastly more money per person than any other country, the United States ranks highest among 19 advanced countries in deaths by diseases amenable to medical treatment, not to mention the ongoing disaster of the uninsured.) Today, public dissatisfaction with the health care system has forced the GOP to concede, at least rhetorically, that the system is broken. <br> The GOP response? A lot of Republican and conservative reform plans that mostly reflect the right's embrace of the failed market system that created the health care disaster. <br> For numerous well-documented reasons, the market for health care does not work like the market for normal goods. The single largest problem is that tens of millions of people need more health care than they can afford, either because they're too poor, or because they're unhealthy and require inordinately expensive care, or both. The only way to solve this problem is to somehow make the richer and healthier people help pay for the care of the poorer and sicker. <br> The simplest, and arguably best, solution would be for the government to assume the role of paying for everybody's health insurance. Since such a plan couldn't pass Congress, Democrats have settled on a plan to subsidize health insurance for the poor and sick and to protect them from discrimination in the insurance marketplace. To make sure that the system functions effectively, they would also require everybody to get health insurance; that way, healthy people would pay into the system and subsidize the sick. <br> The Republican plans reject these approaches. Either they lack meaningful regulations on discriminating against the sick, or they lack a mandate to bring the healthy into the system; and none provides anything like the necessary funds to make their plans work. Far worse, the Republican plans tear away at the protections that do exist for people with high medical costs. Currently, most people get insurance through their jobs, an arrangement that pools high risks with low risks: Your 25-year-old clerk who plays shortstop for the office softball team pays the same premiums as the asthmatic 57-year-old accountant. The GOP plans usually give people individual tax credits that encourage them to drop out of employer health care and buy it on their own. That's great for the 25-year-old, but the accountant will suddenly be in trouble. <br> The Republicans' favorite reform is to let people buy insurance from any state they want. Currently, states require insurance plans to offer certain basic services--psychiatric benefits, maternity care, and so on. That creates another subsidy from the healthy to the sick--healthy people have to buy insurance that pays for all kinds of care they probably won't need, keeping down the cost for people who do need it. If you let people buy out-of-state insurance, states will lure insurance companies by offering lax requirements, and the healthy will follow. That would allow all the healthy, inexpensive customers to have cheap plans with other inexpensive, healthy people, while sick, expensive customers would get stuck in expensive insurance plans with other sick, expensive customers. <br> Almost nobody takes these plans seriously as legislative proposals. They are a response to the cross-pressures of the general public's demand that the party appear to have a positive vision on health care and the base's demand of fealty to the ideals of the free market. So the House Republican plan would require states to establish plans to cover people with preexisting conditions, but it makes no suggestion for where the funding for such plans would come from. Likewise, the "Health Care Freedom Act," sponsored by DeMint, is funded by repealing the financial bailout and demanding a prompt repayment. If you're wondering what the consequences of immediately repealing the bailout might be, or where this plan would find its financing after the bailout funds ran out, you're missing the point of the exercise. <br> The main role of these plans is to serve as a prop for the disingenuous party talking point that Congress should defeat Obama's plan and "start over" with "real reform." <br> The quintessential moment in the health care debate came when Senator Lamar Alexander objected to Democratic attempts to weed out Medicare waste: "If you're going to find some savings in waste, fraud, and abuse in Grandma's Medicare," he proclaimed, "spend it on Grandma." Consider this as an ethical proposition: Alexander is saying that every dollar of Medicare is sacrosanct, that even those dollars he concedes provide zero public benefit must stay in the program. We live in a country where the occasional appearance of a roving charitable medical clinic will prompt thousands of desperate people to line up in parking lots for hours on end, to help mitigate their suffering. And yet, Republicans will not countenance the shift of even indisputably wasted resources to help them. <br> Partisan self-interest--an accurate belief that Obama's legislative failure offers Republicans the most likely road back to power--surely accounts for some of the party's obstinacy. But at least as powerful is the deepening hold on the GOP of anti-government ideology. <br> Several years ago, I wrote in these pages that the fundamental difference between economic conservatism and economic liberalism is that the former is driven by abstract philosophical beliefs in a way that the latter is not. Conservatives believe that small-government policies maximize human welfare. But they also believe that they increase human freedom. Liberals, by contrast, believe in government intervention only to the extent that it increases human welfare. <br> If liberals could be persuaded that tax cuts would actually increase living standards for all Americans, they would embrace them. (This is why nearly all liberals believe that some level of tax rate, be it 50 or 70 or 90 percent, becomes counterproductive.) If conservatives came to believe that tax cuts failed to increase economic growth, most would still support them anyway, because they enhance freedom. As Milton Friedman once put it, "[E]conomic freedom is an end in itself." <br> For this reason, liberals tend to do a better job at devising policies that maximize human welfare. They do not do a perfect job, nor is there always a singular definition of "human welfare"--some of the thorniest dilemmas of public policy involve trade-offs over whose welfare to maximize. Still, you're going to fare better at maximizing human welfare if that is your sole goal, rather than one of two oft-competing goals. <br> Conservatism can succeed at maximizing human welfare when faced with government failure or some other circumstance that naturally lends itself to ideologically congenial tools, like inflation in the 1970s. But conservatism is plagued by blindness in the face of even textbook cases of market failure.In the graphic below, some of The New Republic's staff have compiled a brief history of conservative opposition to social reform over the last century. It puts on display conservatism's miserable record of predicting the outcome of various liberal reforms, in the social and political as well as economic spheres. <br> One of those items is a diatribe against the passage of Medicare delivered by Ronald Reagan in 1961. Earlier this year, National Review Online editor-at-large Jonah Goldberg called Reagan's address "still fresh today." This is a strange description for even as committed a right-winger as Goldberg. In his speech, Reagan predicted that Medicare would lead to the government dictating how doctors might practice and where they'd live, and that, if it came into law, "[Y]ou and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in America when men were free." <br> Almost certainly, Goldberg did not mean to praise this as a prescient warning of how Medicare would unfold. The title he chose, "The Gipper on Socialized Medicine," suggests that he viewed the speech as a prescient warning about the next step in health care reform. But this is how conservatism tends to operate: In the right-wing mind, the world we live in at any given moment can be described as the free market, the American way of life, perhaps not a perfect world but a cherished and fundamentally free one. The next advance of liberalism will always bring socialism, tyranny, a crushing burden on industry, and other horrors. The previous liberal advances that they or their predecessors greeted with such hysteria are eventually incorporated into the landscape of the free American way of life. <br> Everything that the 1960s right said about Medicare, the contemporary right no longer believes, while fervently believing it will all hold true of health care reform. Similarly, the hysteria of the 1970s right about clean-air regulation no longer plagues the contemporary right, but it grips conservatives when it comes to greenhouse-gas regulation. (Charles Krauthammer: Cap-and-trade "will destroy what's left of the industrial Midwest.") And so it goes. <br> Rush Limbaugh, speaking at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, boasted, "Conservatism is what it is and it is forever. It's not something you can bend and shape and flake and form." This is true of the general principles, but utterly false of the particulars. The specifics of the reform they oppose have been in constant flux for a century--from child-labor laws to integration to health care reform. The tone of apocalyptic hysteria at the prospect of reform remains constant. <br> By Jonathan Chait: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 Richard Grenell served as the spokesman for the last four U.S. Ambassadors to the United Nations: Zalmay Khalilzad, John Bolton, John Danforth and John Negroponte.<br>Nancy Pelosi represents the gayest congressional district in the United States. She also happens to be the most powerful person, woman or man, in the House of Representatives. With one simple directive she can force 435 Members of Congress from across the United States to vote on any piece of legislation she wants. Healthcare legislation, immigration reform, tax increases or gay marriage are all issues that Speaker Nancy Pelosi can choose to have voted on by Congress. She could schedule a vote at 3 a.m. and members would be expected to appear. She alone gets to decide what the House of Representatives votes on and when it votes. <br> But will Pelosi pass the DC gay marriage bill -- one of her district's most important issues -- before the end of the year? What is she waiting for? She has the power to do it immediately and DC needs Congressional approval to move forward with equal rights for all citizens. <br> Nancy Pelosi also has a Democratic partner over in the Senate in Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid has the same power in the Senate with the 100 members that Nancy Pelosi has in the House of Representatives. Together, Pelosi and Reid have a Democratic President in Barack Obama. It isn't an overstatement to say that these three Democrats - Pelosi, Reid and Obama - can force any issue to a vote and make that issue a law. All Pelosi, Reid and Obama have to do is get their own party to go along with their ideas - no Republicans are needed to go along with the Pelosi-Reid-Obama agenda. <br> Not one Republican is needed to enact new laws. None. Zero. <br> So why aren't these three Democrats passing new laws and making changes? Where is the gay marriage law they promised when they were put in charge and the Republicans were run out of office? <br> The answer, of course, is and has always been that America is not ready for gay marriage. Nearly every public poll taken has shown that the electorate, albeit the public at large, is not ready. Pelosi, Reid and Obama are only reading public opinion surveys when they delay votes on gay issues. Even California, the most liberal state in the nation, wasn't able to get the electorate to see the value of equal rights for all. But the nation's capital has and now needs Pelosi's support. <br> What is needed to pass gay marriage is not a Democratic majority - this past year has proven that to be true - but politicians and judges comfortable enough to ignore what the majority of the voters want and do what is uncomfortable, unpopular - and morally right. Equal rights should not be debatable and certainly should not be put to a vote of the people. Would we ask the electorate to vote on whether or not Catholics and Protestants should marry? Of course we would not. <br> The Catholic Church or the local evangelical church should not be forced to bless the new union of a divorced woman if they don't want to. But civil governments don't make the same distinctions. While religious institutions should be able to pick and choose which unions they bless, civil governments should issue marriage licenses to all couples. <br> But the more that the gay leaders raise money for and give unconditional support to Democratic politicians, the more Democratic leaders are encouraged to take gay marriage voters for granted. Anyone who is still holding out for the Democrats to be the gayest political party is now part of the problem. The more gay marriage is made a political issue the longer gays will be treated as less than and unequal. <br> Equal rights should not be a partisan political issue -- so why are all gay leaders in one political party? <br> Nancy Pelosi doesn't have to pay attention to gays because there is no price to pay for ignoring them. <br> By Richard Grenell: 
 Jeremy Scahill, a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute, is the author of the bestselling Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army, published by Nation Books.<br>The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has hired a private corporation to help prepare government reports for Congress about US government contracts with other corporations in Afghanistan. The massive consulting firm Deloitte and Touche was hired on a one year contract signed with the US Army's Contracting Center of Excellence in May for $3.7 million. In the end, the contract could be worth up to $7.5 million, according to federal contract data reviewed by The Nation. In 2008, former Republican Congressman Tom Davis was hired by Deloitte as a Director. Davis once chaired the powerful House Government Reform Committee. <br> As part of its work for SIGAR, according to contracts obtained by The Nation, the firm helps prepare the agency's quarterly reports to Congress, assists in preparing Congressional testimony for agency officials and helps develop SIGAR's responses to "questions for the record" from lawmakers. <br> SIGAR hired Deloitte "as an interim measure while we, as a new organization, built the internal capability we needed to provide the quality reports that the Congress requires," SIGAR spokesperson Susan Phalen told The Nation. "The SIGAR Quarterly Reports require an extraordinary amount of detail and attention." Phalen downplayed Deloitte's role in preparing Congressional reports, saying they "have assisted the SIGAR staff on certain sections of the Quarterly Reports." <br> Deloitte also plays a similar role for several other federal agencies, including preparing reports for the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. TARP was created by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and allows the US Treasury Department to purchase or insure up to $700 billion of "troubled assets." Deloitte also works in a similar capacity for the US Agency for International Development and the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. <br> Danielle Brian, the executive director of the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight sees a direct relationship between Deloitte's increasingly prominent oversight role within the US government and the hiring of former Congressman Davis. "We saw an immediate growth in Deloitte's contracts for oversight functions, especially for special inspectors general, when Davis left the Congress to go work for Deloitte," said Brian. "It's totally predictable. This is the kind of thing that he was encouraging while he was in the Congress. I think this is a real degradation of government." She said Davis's work with Deloitte is the "definition of the revolving door." <br> SIGAR has come under fire recently from a bipartisan group of senators who have called on President Obama to "commence a comprehensive review" of the agency. "In light of the planned increase in the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, we have serious concerns that SIGAR currently may be unable to perform its mission at a time when the need for aggressive, independent oversight is greater than ever," wrote Democrat Claire McCaskill and Republicans Susan Collins and Tom Coburn on December 8 to President Obama. The lawmakers specifically said that SIGAR has had "significant, ongoing difficulty in recruiting adequate, qualified staff." <br> The senators also criticized the agency for not fulfilling its role of focusing on "reconstruction contracting," instead conducting reviews of female participation in the Afghan elections, which the senators said is not SIGAR's job. The senators also decried what they called "the lack of audit and investigative reports," pointing out that only "one of the eight audits performed was a contract audit." <br> According to a "Performance Work Statement" for Deloitte's contract, obtained by The Nation, Deloitte "shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform data collection, data analysis, report design, report formation and project management support to ensure timely publication of the quarterly report to be distributed to Congress...to track the status and maintain accountability of specific funds allocated/designated for the reconstruction of AFGHANISTAN, and to determine how the funds have been spent." <br> The firm, according to the work statement, is also responsible for "Tracking the oversight activities (Audits and Investigations) of other Government agencies having oversight authority of the relief and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan." The contract specifies that Deloitte personnel must have been granted a "SECRET security clearance or an Interim Secret clearance from the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office." <br> "Now we have contractors overseeing the oversight of contractors," said a government oversight official. "It's like a bad '80s movie." Tourang Nazari, a spokesperson for Deloitte, when asked for comment on the firm's work for SIGAR told The Nation, "We do not comment on work we do for clients." <br> Despite descriptions in the Deloitte contract, SIGAR's Phalen denied that Deloitte plays a central role in SIGAR's communications to Congress, saying "SIGAR staff is fully responsible for the writing and final editing of all SIGAR reports," adding that Deloitte "contractors have assisted SIGAR staff, on a interim basis [and it] is limited to graphics production and the drafting of specific sections of the Quarterly Reports." She said all audits and investigative reports are done by official SIGAR investigators. POGO's Brian, however, contradicted that. "They're actually writing the copy," she said. "To me the most pure example of what a government person should be doing is communicating between an inspector general and the Congress. The idea you hire an outside contractor to do that is, to me, obscene." <br> SIGAR was created by President George W. Bush, who appointed its current head, Marine Major General Arnold Fields, in June 2008. SIGAR has thirty auditors in Afghanistan and the United States. Its budget of $23 million seems stunningly low given the extent of government contracting in Afghanistan. According to federal records, the US paid some $6.7 billion to contractors for work in Afghanistan in 2008. That figure does not include contracts in Pakistan over which SIGAR has no official mandate. More than $5 billion has been allocated for Afghanistan reconstruction in the Supplemental Appropriation of 2009. Meanwhile, according to the most recent Department of Defense census, there are more than 104,000 private contractors on the US government payroll in Afghanistan, a number that is expected to grow as US troop numbers swell. <br> By Jeremy Scahill:Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Noam Scheiber is a senior editor at The New Republic, where he writes about economic policy.<br>The president appeared at the Brookings Institution yesterday morning to announce several job-creating measures as a kind of tangible follow-up to last week's summit. But between Obama's speech and a background briefing by senior administration officials beforehand, I detected four other goals on the economic front: <br> 1.) Reclaim the stimulus as a success story. It's no secret that the administration has taken its lumps over the stimulus, even as the data suggest it's been reasonably effective. That's a problem for a White House embarking on another round of spending to spur job creation--the need for more money could be read as an admission that the first stimulus failed. To preempt that argument, the White House was determined to cast the stimulus as a success. One theme running through the speech and the briefing was that a lot of the new proposals are stimulus programs that worked beyond expectation, then hit a wall once the money was spent. <br> For example, Obama talked about another "boost in investment in the nation's infrastructure beyond what was included in the Recovery Act" because "there are many more worthy projects than there were dollars to fund them." The briefers were even more explicit, talking about a business-loan guarantee program from the stimulus that was "so successful it basically ran out of money." Later on there was talk of Recovery Act investments whose "success generated over-subscription" and a renewable energy program that was "substantially over-subscribed." <br> 2.)Stress that the administration doesn't go in for big, clumsy government programs. A related problem dogging the stimulus and the rest of the administration's economic interventions is the vauge perception that they summed to a wasteful jumble of spending. Today Obama took pains to show he's intervening with as light a touch as possible. Wherever feasible, Obama wants to elicit desired behavior from the private sector rather than mandate it from Washington. For example, he proposed eliminating capital gains taxes and extending write-offs to encourage small-business expansion, and creating a tax incentive to encourage hiring. He highlighted the need to "leverage private capital," a concept the briefers hit on multiple times. All of it seemed designed to paint Obama as a nudge-o-crat rather than a big-government Democrat, even as he presides over unprecedented government spending. <br> In a similar vein, the briefers took pains to show that the point isn't to have government create jobs so much as nudge businesses to speed up hiring they were going to do anyway. So you had repeated discussion of how to "pull forward investments in the short term" and "catalyze hiring." The challenge, said one of the officials, is to "get job growth more connected to GDP growth," not create jobs out of thin air. <br> 3.) Remove the rusty nail that is TARP from the administration's heel. Politically, the most welcome line in Obama's speech may be his declaration that "we're going to wind down the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP--the fund created to stabilize the financial system so banks would lend again." As Obama aptly described it, "[t]here has rarely been a less loved or more necessary emergency program than TARP, which--as galling as the assistance to banks may have been--indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire financial system." The perception that the administration was bailing out Wall Street has, of course, been one of the most politically damaging developments of the past year, creating a general cynicism toward government intervention among voters. <br> Amid the recent news that TARP will cost a mere 20 percent of its original $700 billion price tag when all is said and done, and that the government may even make a profit on the bank-bailout portion, the administration is styling itself the investment-savvy steward of the people's money, versus its slightly ham-handed predecessors, who were simply shoveling money out the door without any real game plan. "Launched hastily under the last administration, the TARP program was flawed, and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly," Obama said. Talk about lemons to lemonade. <br> 4.) Set the fiscal record straight. In fact, Obama didn't stop at TARP. The end of the speech was basically an indictment of GOP financial management, dating back to the Bush tax cuts and the 2004 prescription drug benefit, neither of which was paid for with offsetting spending cuts or tax increases. Obama contrasted this with his own insistence that health care reform not increase the deficit "one dime" and noted that, as a result of Bush's big-spending ways, his administration inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit. (That's not quite right--the recession also took a real toll on the federal budget--but those Bush policies do account for more than half of the projected 10-year deficit.) Then came the brush-back pitch: "[T]hese budget busting tax cuts and spending programs were approved by many of the same people who are now waxing political about fiscal responsibility while opposing our efforts to reduce deficits by getting health care costs under control," Obama said. "It's a sight to see." <br> Notwithstanding the president's determination to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term, we're not going to see much deficit-reduction next year (the 2010 fiscal year actually started in October). But it does sound like the reports that fiscal responsibility will be a major rhetorical theme going forward were basically on target. <br> By Martha Coakley and Elizabeth Warren: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 President Obama has always been too scattered and unfocused when it comes to addressing the primary social, economic and political challenge of his presidency: high unemployment. <br> But he is starting to "get it," as is evidenced by a series of job creation proposals the White House released Tuesday. It is especially significant that he has picked up on the calls by labor unions and grassroots groups for using at least some of the $200 billion in left over Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) money to encourage small businesses to expand and to promote hiring. <br> Obama is not going as far as the unions have asked. He reportedly plans to use $20 billion and $40 billion in unused bailout funds to free up lending to small businesses and perhaps another $30 billion for tax credits designed to encourage the hiring of new workers. <br> That's an encouraging, if still tepid, intervention. <br> What's encouraging is that the president is beginning to link his happy talk about the economy to practical initiatives. <br> Until recently, Obama took most of his advice regarding unemployment concerns from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and National Economic Council director Larry Summers, who are about as in touch with the real economy as Marie Antoinette was with the hungry citizens of 18th century Paris. As such, the president kept talking about how things were getting better even as the unemployment rate hit the highest levels in a quarter century - and the real unemployment rate (factoring in those who have given up looking for work and those who the underemployed) compares with Depression-era numbers. <br> A series of wake-up calls culminating in the confirmation that the country was experiencing double-digit unemployment for the first time since Ronald Reagan's first term got Obama listening to key members of Congress and the more serious members of his Cabinet, such as Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, and, frankly, political aides who are terrified by the prospect of trying to convince voters in the 2010 congressional contests that they should feel good about an economy where one in every ten Americans is jobless. <br> So Obama is saying - and doing - some of the right things: <br> But he must step it up if he wants to tackle daunting jobless figures in some parts of New England and the Great Lakes states. <br> Moving roughly a quarter of the leftover TARP money from Wall Street to Main Street is not going to jumpstart the economy in the most battered regions of the country - regions where, it should be noted, Democrats will be facing some of their toughest fights to defend House and Senate seats in 2010. <br> Where to begin? <br> The president has borrowed a good idea (using the remaining TARP funds for job creation) from the AFL-CIO. <br> He should borrow a few more. <br> The labor federation continues to press the Obama administration and Congress to move quicky to: <br> 1. Extend the lifeline for jobless workers. Unless Congress acts now, supplemental unemployment benefits, additional food assistance and expansion of COBRA health care benefits will expire at the end of the year. They must be extended for another 12 months to protect working families from bankruptcy, home foreclosure and loss of health care. Extending benefits also will boost personal spending and create jobs throughout the economy. <br> 2. Rebuild America's schools, roads and energy systems. America still has at least $3 trillion in unmet infrastructure needs. We should put people to work to fix our nation's broken-down school buildings and invest in transportation, green technology, energy efficiency and more. <br> 3. Increase aid to state and local governments to maintain vital services. State and local governments and school districts have a $178 billion budget shortfall this year alone--while the recession creates greater need for their services. States and communities must get help to maintain critical frontline services, prevent massive job cuts and avoid deep damage to education just when our children need it most. <br> 4. Fund jobs in our communities. While workers go without jobs, important work is left undone in our communities. We should put people to work restoring our environment, providing child care and tutoring, cleaning up abandoned houses and more. These are not replacements for existing public jobs. They must pay competitive wages and should target distressed communities. <br> Obama should, as well, move to change policies that are causing unemployment. <br> To do so, he should act on the restructuring of the auto-industry bailout to prevent plant closures that are taking place as part of the auto-industry bailout and he should adopt a new approach to international trade that addresses outsourcing of jobs and the country's gaping trade deficit. As it happens, a smart initiative on trade, the Trade Reform, Accountability, Development, and Employment Act, was introduced this week in the Senate by Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown and has attracted more than 125 supporters in the House. <br> "We want trade and we want more of it. But, we need a new direction," explains Brown. "Done wrong, trade sends our jobs overseas. Done right, trade can foster new business and job growth at home, and can lift up workers in developing nations. The TRADE ACT will help Congress and the White House craft a trade policy that benefits workers, business owners, and our nation." <br> Obama can be a jobs-jobs-jobs president. But to do so he must make a deeper commitment to job creation while at the same time recognizing that bad bailout and trade policies are critical causes of rising unemployment. <br> By John Nichols:Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Jonathan Cohn is a senior editor of The New Republic. This column is a collaboration between TNR and Kaiser Health News. KHN is an editorially independent news service and is a program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care policy research organization, which is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.<br>On Monday morning, a week ago, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that, for most people, insurance would cost the same or less if the Senate's health care reform bill passes. By the afternoon, critics of health care reform rushed to the microphones, claiming vindication. CBO, these critics insisted, had determined reform would mean higher costs! <br> What happened? The simple answer is that the critics were being deliberately deceptive. And they almost certainly were. But there's also a more complicated answer. The critics were taking advantage of widespread confusion over the definition of cost--a confusion that has been hanging over this debate for the last few months and is continuing to distort it. <br> Until now, the CBO, which is Washington's official scorekeeper, has been assessing reform proposals largely on the basis of how they would affect the federal budget. And whenever CBO has issued one of its assessments, critics have focused largely on CBO's estimates of government outlays--that is, the amount of money a bill would require Washington to spend on expanding government health insurance programs or providing people with financial assistance to buy insurance. <br> These numbers inevitably sound big. Most of the bills CBO has analyzed have called for outlays in the neighborhood of $1 trillion over 10 years. And while that figure represents just a fraction of the total federal budget--government outlays for the same period will be more than $40 trillion--it still represents an increase in what Washington will be spending. That's bound to upset anybody whose primary concern is the size of government. <br> But sometimes government needs to grow, in order to take on responsibilities the private sector can't handle on its own. And when that's the case--as it seems to be with health care--the only relevant question is whether an initiative adds to the federal deficit. Here, the news has been largely good. The bill before the Senate now would raise some tax revenue while finding savings in other government programs. The net result, according to CBO, would be lower deficits overall. (It reached a similar conclusion about the House bill.) <br> Of course, that's not the end of the story. The most important issue for most Americans isn't what the government spends on health care. It's what they, as individuals and families, spend on health care. That's the question the CBO finally addressed this week--although the findings were, in fairness, a bit hard to follow. <br> The vast majority of Americans with private insurance get coverage through employers. For these people, CBO predicted, premiums would stay about the same or come down a bit if the Senate bill became law. That wouldn't be the $2,500 in annual savings that President Obama famously promised during the campaign. But it also wouldn't be the huge hike in premiums critics had been predicting. <br> Where the price of health insurance would start to change radically is in the non-group market--that is, for people who buy on their own, as individuals, rather than through an employer. Premiums for these people, who number a little more than 30 million, would tend to go up. That's one of the points reform critics seized upon in their press conferences. But the more interesting and relevant story was why CBO expected premiums to go up. For the most part, CBO found, it was because people would be getting health insurance that provided more benefits and covered medical bills more completely--coverage that often wasn't available to people in the non-group market before. In many cases, CBO determined from its economic models, people would actually opt to buy more expensive insurance than necessary simply because they valued the added protection. <br> In addition, CBO noted, while premiums in the non-group market would rise, the majority of people buying insurance on their own would simultaneously become eligible for federal subsidies. For the majority of these people, the subsidies would more than offset the increase in premiums, so that they'd end up paying less--even as they were getting better coverage. <br> To be sure, not everybody would be so lucky. People making more than four times the poverty line, or $88,000 a year for a family of four, wouldn't be eligible for subsidies. They'd end up paying more. So would some, although not all, people who now have cheap insurance because they are young, healthy, and have minimal benefits. They'd be a small minority of the total U.S. population, but still a few million people. They, too, figured prominently in last week's anti-reform propaganda. <br> But it's virtually impossible to design a reform scheme that doesn't, in the early stages, involve at least some transfer of money away from the healthy and wealthy. The point of insurance is to pool risk, bringing in contributions from relatively healthy people, so that medical bills don't fall too heavily on the sick. And if government is going to offer subsidies to the poor and middle-class, it's bound to finance those subsidies through taxes on the wealthy. <br> Keep in mind that CBO is very skeptical about reform's ability to make medical care itself less expensive. If it turns out that better use of information technology, more scrutiny of treatments, and other innovations reduce the incidence of wasteful medical treatments--as many experts believe will happen--then it's possible everybody, even the very healthy and very wealthy, would end up spending less on health care, at least in the long term. <br> And if not? Then even those few people who do end up paying more for their insurance would still gain something: The peace of mind that they'll still have coverage even if they suddenly stop making a lot of money, as well as the knowledge that insurance will meet their needs if they get sick. That's something worth celebrating, even if the reform critics don't agree. <br> By Jonathan Cohn: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 Jonathan Chait is a senior editor of The New Republic.<hr width="50%">On the inside cover of the last issue of The New Republic, the conservative American Future Fund (AFF) took out an advertisement helpfully warning moderate Democrats to abandon health care reform. The ad features head shots of numerous Democratic members of Congress who lost their seats in 1994. The headline reads, "THE LOSERS OF 1994 THANKS TO HEALTH CARE!" <br> I hesitate to impugn the intellectual integrity of any of the good folks who purchase space in this magazine in order to share their concerns about public policy. Yet I cannot help but wonder if AFF has truly proffered this advice in good faith. The ad calls health care reform a "Majority Killer." Yet Democrats did not lose their seats in 1994 because they enacted health care reform. They failed to enact, or even vote on, health care reform. So it's hard to see why this historical example recommends letting health care reform die an ignominious death as an attractive strategy for the majority party. <br> The political landscape looks worse for the Democrats than it did a year ago. Why has that happened? Republicans are expending a great deal of energy trying to convince Democrats that it's because the Obama administration has overreached. Senator Lamar Alexander helpfully warns that Obama's "policies, and those pushed by the congressional Democrats, are scaring the daylights out of people." <br> The most direct and immediate goal of this campaign is to spook moderate Democrats into abandoning health care reform. It is true that some of Obama's spending programs--the stimulus and the bailouts of the auto and financial sectors--have little public support. But health care reform actually remains quite popular. Many people think the right has won the health care debate, since polls show that narrow but stable majorities of Americans disapprove of Obama's health care plan. The problem with this gauge is that it lumps together Obama's critics from the right with those from the left. <br> For instance, one recent poll asks whether the Democratic plans create too much government involvement, the right amount, or not enough. Too much gets 42 percent, the right amount 34 percent, and not enough 21 percent. Another question shows that only 28 percent of Americans think the bill goes too far in expanding coverage to the uninsured, 33 percent say it expands coverage the right amount, and 35 percent say it does not go far enough. In both cases, majorities of the public either support Obama's approach or wish it went further. <br> Moreover, a clear majority of Americans say that they want the Democrats to pass a health care bill with a public option, even if this means it would get no GOP votes--a striking result, given the misty-eyed sentiment Americans generally display toward bipartisanship in all its forms. <br> All of these results suggest that the Democrats' biggest obstacle on health care reform is not a fundamental lack of public agreement but public weariness with the endless legislative grind. Vulnerable congressional Democrats may have individual interests in establishing their moderate bona fides by challenging their party leadership. But they have a far stronger collective interest in passing a bill. <br> The second, broader Republican goal is to essentially delegitimize Obama's presidency. This argument, building ever since Obama took office, reached a crescendo in the wake of the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections. Americans never supported Obama's agenda, say conservatives; and now, thanks to his attempt to impose it, we are seeing the inevitable backlash. <br> "If the president--opposed by a majority of Americans, with almost no support from the other party--imposes an ideologically divisive health reform, it will smack of radicalism, reinforce polarization and may cede the ideological center to Republicans for years to come," cries former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson. Democrats "know this legislation is possible only because of temporary liberal majorities," complains a Wall Street Journal editorial. <br> How, you might ask, does this differ from George W. Bush ramming through unpopular regressive tax cuts? Well, those were temporary conservative majorities. The other difference, of course, is that Obama out-polled his opponent by eight-and-a-half million votes, a margin that exceeded Bush's 2000 popular-vote edge by, oh, roughly nine million votes. <br> Shouldn't Obama's actual election count for more than two low-turnout gubernatorial races? Oh no. The off-year elections prove Obama's presidency is a fluke. Here is Fox News all-star panelist and Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer: <br> 2008 was a historical anomaly. A uniquely charismatic candidate was running at a time of deep war weariness, with an intensely unpopular Republican president, against a politically incompetent opponent, amid the greatest financial collapse since the Great Depression. <br> Did factors other than Obama's platform (his charisma, eight years of declining median income, Sarah Palin) help him win? No doubt. This happens every election. Krauthammer gloats of the 2009 elections, "The return to the norm is happening now." Got that? The normal state of affairs is an odd-year, low-turnout election occurring in just two states, which have voted against the incumbent party for the past 20 years, with no national candidates on the ballot, and with double-digit unemployment. That's a perfectly calibrated measure of public preference on national issues. But Obama's election was an accident. <br> Sure, Obama has lost popularity since his inauguration. In a worldwide recession, voters have thrown out incumbent parties of all stripes. And Democrats will probably take a beating next year. <br> But, if Americans were recoiling at Obama's liberalism, rather than lashing out at the poor economy, you'd expect to see the Democratic Party losing favor and the GOP regaining it. In fact, the opposite remains true. (A recent poll had the Dems' favorable rating at 53-41, and the Republicans' at 36-54.) Given the circumstances, the striking fact about the political landscape is how little has changed since November 2008. <br> Democrats' failure to realize that the public never really supported their agenda, argues Krauthammer, "is the fundamental cause of the Democratic debacle of 2009." But 2009 isn't a debacle, and it won't be unless Democrats get bluffed into making it one. <br> By Jonathan Chait: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 Matthew Continetti is the associate editor of The Weekly Standard. His The Persecution of Sarah Palin: How the Elite Media Tried To Bring Down a Rising Star is published this week by Sentinel Books.<br>If Sarah Palin visits Nashville on her book tour, she really ought to stop by the Hermitage. Andrew Jackson's plantation is a lot more than a beautifully restored example of Greek Revival architecture and design. It's also a monument to the seventh president's democratic legacy--of rule by the people, of competitive commercial markets, of entrepreneurial individuals lighting out to the territories. It's a legacy to which Palin is heiress. And one she ought to embrace. <br> To be sure, by today's standards, Jackson's record is mixed. He was a slave owner whose Indian policy was nothing less than cruel. His war on the Second Bank of the United States had some dreadful economic consequences. But, when we look at Jackson today, the positive traits stand out. More than any other politician of his era, he aligned himself with the common man against self-dealing elites. Lacking formal education, he nonetheless understood that incumbents, whether in the market or in politics, raise barriers to entry in order to protect their positions. And because he sought to unsettle those entrenched interests, Jackson was at the vanguard of a spirited popular upheaval. <br> The Jacksonian era was the first populist moment in American politics. But it wasn't the last. There is something about the structure of American democracy that encourages periodic upsurges in popular opinion directed at nogood-niks on the East Coast. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Democratic congressman and thrice presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan rallied his followers against agglomerations of power in New York and Washington. In Jackson's time, the bad guys had been Nicholas Biddle, his bank, and supporters of the tariff. In Bryan's time, the bad guys were the corporate monopolists who squelched individual risk-taking and their bag-men in the legislature whose monetary and trade policies favored big business over the small farmer. <br> Bryan's reputation, like Jackson's, has pockmarks. He was sympathetic to the Ku Klux Klan. He prosecuted Darwin's theory of natural selection in the heavily publicized Scopes "monkey" trial of 1925. The elites of Bryan's time certainly hated the prairie populist. To them, he was an ill-mannered dunce from the boonies and his supporters nothing more than a rabble. Such anxiety was understandable. Bryan was a rebel. He liked to quote Jackson's adage of "equal rights to all and special privileges to none." He didn't want to overturn the government, but he did want to ensure that government lived up to its duty to "protect all from injustice and to do so without showing partiality for any one or any class." In Bryan's view, the nation's elites had grown complacent. Irresponsible. In their lust for power, they endangered the American ethos of equality of opportunity. <br> Over the last century, the popular energies that fueled Jackson and Bryan shifted to the right side of the political spectrum. Increasingly, the public directed its animosity at the bureaucratic and governmental elites who robbed ordinary folk of liberties in the pursuit of "social justice." At the judges who designed busing schemes that disrupted neighborhood schools. At government-induced inflation and high marginal tax rates that destroyed savings and prevented the taxpayer from spending his earned income as he saw fit. At regulatory agencies that micromanaged the trucking, airline, power, and telecommunications sectors to the detriment of competition, innovation, and affordability. <br> For the last quarter century, right-wing populism, often infused with social conservatism, has been the most demonized force in American politics--and also the most interesting and dynamic. When the historian Michael Kazin wrote his 1995 book The Populist Persuasion, he counted Ronald Reagan among Bryan's heirs. These days, references to Bryan show up in unexpected places. Kazin notes that Bryan's second-favorite book (the first was the Bible) was The Jefferson Cyclopedia, a collection of the third president's thoughts organized by topic. When you google "Jefferson Cyclopedia" today, the first link doesn't take you to the Democratic party. It takes you to the Campaign for Liberty, a Ron Paul group. <br> In this country, whenever the public concludes that elite behavior is opaque and self-interested, a popular reaction ensues. In part, Barack Obama was elected president because of widespread discontent with the way Washington had managed its basic roles of fighting wars and maintaining the financial system. But Obama, who had the common touch during the campaign, has governed as an elitist. He's dismissed the populist revolts against his policies. And so Americans continue to look at New York and Washington with suspicion. Trust in government remains low. The president's job approval rating is around 50 percent. Congressional approval is at a dismal 21 percent. <br> When the average American looks at the headlines, he sees the government bailing out large, failed, politically connected enterprises even as the unemployment rate rises to 10 percent. He sees the Obama administration exaggerating the role its fiscal stimulus has played in reviving the economy, even though unemployment is higher than the administration's models predicted. (The average American also understands that there is no way to measure the number of jobs the White House has "saved.") He sees the president and Congress eager to pass a costly health care bill against the public's wishes; businesses funding Democratic campaigns so as not to be punished; the rich increasingly voting Democratic. In short, he sees a river of power and wealth flowing inexorably to Washington, D.C. <br> The public's negative reaction to Beltway profligacy has been visceral. The government is shoveling money to powerful interest groups, and the man on the street feels left out. In September, the Democratic pollster Peter Hart asked registered voters who they thought had benefited most from the Obama administration's economic policies. Sixty-two percent said the main beneficiary had been the "large banks." In contrast, 65 percent said the "average working person" and "small businesses" hadn't been helped. Seventy-three percent said "my family/myself" hadn't been helped. <br> Public opinion registers a widespread skepticism of government and elite decision-making. The percentage of voters who say that government is doing too much has risen to 49 percent. The percentage of voters who say that government should "worry more" about keeping the deficit low has risen to 62 percent. When pollsters ask voters what their priorities are, the economy is always the number one answer, but the deficit and national debt are not far behind. In the September NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, for instance, the deficit was voter priority number three. These worries are more than punctilious accounting. They relate to larger concerns over the government's unchecked fiscal power and its right role in American society. <br> What's most interesting about the popular ferment is that it transcends party. The number of self-identified independents has risen as the number of Democrats and Republicans has declined (in the GOP's case, to a generational low). About twice as many people call themselves "conservative" as "Republican," which means that a large chunk of potential Republican voters are alienated from the national party. We saw this divergence at play in the fight over the populist candidacy of conservative Doug Hoffman in New York's 23rd Congressional District. We see it in the ongoing debate over whether populist talk radio is good for the GOP's electoral prospects. <br> Above all, the public is dissatisfied with the solutions that both parties have to offer. But, because today's populists lack institutional support, and because they don't have a programmatic agenda, they vent their frustrations in disorganized ways. The left-wing populists rail against CEO compensation, bank bailouts, and lobbyist influence in government. The right-wing populists attack the auto bailouts, government spending, and Obamacare. There is no central authority directing the tea party protestors. There was no single leader who ordered the 9/12 taxpayer march on Washington. Instead, you have multiple voices, with overlapping (and sometimes contradictory) antagonisms, agendas, and priorities. <br> The upshot is a creative and unregulated political marketplace. The most compelling figures and ideas prosper. No one has a dominant position. But it's also clear that what Michael Barone has called the "balance of enthusiasm" in politics is now squarely on the right. And yet, like all markets, the political trading post is prone to bubbles, excesses, rumors, and even the occasional conspiracy theory. <br> All of which creates a gigantic opening for a politician to display imagination and leadership. An opportunity for a figure who will separate the good populism (championing free-enterprising individuals) from the bad (concocting loony theories and vilifying "enemies of the people"). Someone who will give voice to the millions who don't want government aggrandizing the powerful; who don't want government risking dangerous fiscal imbalances; who do want public policies that create the conditions for a general prosperity. Someone, in other words, who can play the same role in contemporary politics that Jackson, Bryan, and Reagan did in the past. <br> She lives in Alaska. <br> The similarities between Jackson, Bryan, Reagan, and Sarah Palin are striking. This is not to say that they are alike in every respect. Nor is it to say that Palin's achievements to date rank with the others'. And, of course, American populism is a deep and complex tradition. But it's nonetheless true that a couple of traits span the centuries and unify these four political figures. The first is the reaction they provoke among the elites of their age--what one might call the "Coonskin Cap Critique." The second is their advocacy of dispersed power, open markets, and American individualism. <br> Elites regard challenges to their authority with condescension and contempt. They routinely underestimate the capacities of populist leaders. They mock their enemies as uneducated provincials who lack expert knowledge and therefore have no place interfering in politics. They contemptuously refer to the supporters of populist politicians as an ill-kempt and dangerous mob. <br> When Andrew Jackson's supporters flooded the capital to celebrate their hero's ascent to the presidency, elite opinion was aghast. In his Andrew Jackson, H.W. Brands quotes a D.C. resident writing, <br> To us, who had witnessed the quiet and orderly period of the Adams administration, it seemed as if half the nation had rushed at once into the capital. It was like the inundation of the northern barbarians into Rome, save that the tumultuous tide came in from a different point of the compass. The West and the South seemed to have precipitated themselves upon the North and overwhelmed it. <br> Supreme Court justice Joseph Story was equally shocked: "The reign of King 'Mob,' seemed triumphant," he lamented. <br> The press of William Jennings Bryan's time saw the same thing. They called his supporters revolutionaries. Anarchists. Socialists. Dangers to the republic. In one editorial cartoon, Bryan is portrayed as a snake. In another, he's portrayed as an unruly little boy showing off the ugly contraption he's built--the populist Democratic party--to a worried Uncle Sam. <br> When the Reagan era rolled around, the Gipper's conservative supporters were "right-wing extremists" engaged in a racist "backlash." Later, "angry white men" brought Newt Gingrich to power in the 1994 Republican Revolution. When Sarah Palin-loving activists held anti-big government tea parties and engaged in rowdy behavior at congressional town halls in the summer of 2009, Democrats took out the carving knives once more. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer wrote of an "ugly campaign" that was "simply un-American." <br> The advocates of the Coonskin Cap Critique love to tar their opponents as dangerous zealots. The Philadelphia Monthly likened Andrew Jackson and his followers to "Peter the Hermit" and "his rabble of Christian vagabonds." Nicholas Biddle, head of the Bank of the United States, described Jackson's veto message killing the bank as "a manifesto of anarchy, such as Marat and Robespierre might have issued to the mob." To H.L. Mencken, William Jennings Bryan was the "Fundamentalist Pope" who represented everything the Sage of Baltimore disliked about America. During the 1980 presidential campaign, liberals sought to portray Ronald Reagan as an ideologue and lunatic who risked plunging the world into armageddon. In one editorial, the Nation declared, "We believe that a Ronald Reagan victory increases the chances for nuclear war." <br> Last year in Newsweek, Jon Meacham wrote that "-Palin's populist view of high office" is "dangerous." Then, when Palin brought up Barack Obama's association with William Ayers on the campaign trail, the pundit tribe went nuts. Bill Maher likened a Palin rally to a "hate-fest." E.J. Dionne speculated that John McCain may have "become the midwife of a new movement built around fear, xenophobia, racism, and anger." The Chicago Sun-Times columnist Andrew Greeley wrote that Palin was "a racist with her eye on the White House." The elite's great fear is that their supposed intellectual inferiors might rule them. John Quincy Adams described Jackson as "a barbarian and savage who could scarcely spell his own name." The journalist Charles Willis Thompson wrote of Bryan, "He did not merely resemble that average man, he was that average man." (Even historians can't help taking shots at Bryan's intellectual ability. His "capacity to convince himself," Richard Hofstadter wrote, was "probably the only exceptional thing about his mind.") Michael Kinsley pronounced Reagan "not terribly bright." Nicholas von Hoffman found it "humiliating" that "this unlettered, self-assured bumpkin" had been elected president. To William Greider, Reagan was a "hopeless clown." <br> It's Pavlovian: Whenever the arbiters of educated opinion witness the emergence of a populist leader, they spew insults. Sarah Palin has been called--among many, many other things--a "bantamweight cheerleader" (Maureen Dowd), an "airhead" (Charles Wohlforth), an "idiot" (Victoria Coren), a "character too dumb even for daytime TV" (Matt Taibbi), a "puffed-up dimwit with primitive religious beliefs" (Taibbi again), and a "white trash trophy wife wearing glasses so she looks intellectual" (Catherine Deveny). Palin's opponents will go to any lengths to prove that she is stupid. They've forged her SAT scores. They've prank-called her posing as foreign leaders. They tout every rumor or myth that fits into their world view and dismiss all contrary evidence. <br> At root, the Coonskin Cap Critique is about the battle between the country and the city. Jackson's strongest supporters were small landowners on the Appalachian frontier finally able to exercise the franchise. Bryan's were the indebted prairie farmers who took a hit during an era of falling agricultural prices. By the age of Reagan, America was transitioning rapidly to a service economy, and most Americans lived in cities and suburbs. The geographical frontier had closed. But the imaginative frontier--the beckoning American horizon of innovation and enterprise--remained. <br> Intellectuals belittled Reagan because he believed in this frontier of the imagination. Cosmopolitans detested him because he represented the provincial folkways of small town America. In a 1980 Nation essay, E.L. Doctorow wrote that Reagan was the product of <br> such towns as Galesburg, Monmouth, and Dixon--just the sorts of places responsible for one of the raging themes of American literature, the soul-murdering complacency of our provinces, without which the careers of Edwin Arlington Robinson, Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, and Willa Cather, to name just a few, would never have found glory. The best and brightest fled all our Galesburgs and Dixons, if they could, but [Reagan] was not among them. <br> Twenty-eight years later, in describing Sarah Palin's Wasilla, the journalist Heather Mallick wrote that "small towns are places that smart people escape from, for privacy, for variety, for intellect, for survival. Palin should have stayed home." <br> The antiprovincial, antipopulist critique is not only perennial. It's indestructible. <br> Because Andrew Jackson was the founder of the modern Democratic party, we have a tendency to look at him through big-government eyes. We draw a line that starts with Jackson, runs through Bryan, Woodrow Wilson, and FDR, and ends up at Barack Obama. But the facts are more complicated than that. Jackson and Bryan were representatives of an American system where self-made men reaped the fruits of their labor without government meddling. <br> There's a connection between a faith in the democratic wisdom of the crowd and support for free markets. Jackson and Bryan didn't feel that government should play favorites or manipulate society according to intellectual fashions. They felt it should level the playing field so that men of all stations, possessed with initiative and enthusiasm, could thrive in commercial society. As Richard Hofstadter wrote in the American Political Tradition (1948), like the Jacksonians, "Bryan felt that he represented a cause that was capable of standing on its own feet without special assistance from the government. The majority of the people, he declaimed, who produced the nation's wealth in peace and rallied to its flag in war, asked for nothing from the government but 'even-handed justice.'" <br> Ronald Reagan possessed a similar optimism about the individual capacities of the American people. His basic faith in American decency--his democratic faith--was more than a personal tic or a political tactic. It was one of the pillars of his philosophy. It gave him the courage to dismiss moral equivalence in foreign policy and challenge Democratic shibboleths. If you believe--as Jackson, Bryan, and Reagan did--that left to their own devices Americans will create a free, just, and prosperous society, the task of politics is simple. Identify the obstacles impeding the American spirit and eliminate them. <br> Is tight money dampening economic growth? Kill the national bank. Are tariffs depressing farm wages? Reduce them. Is inflation robbing the middle class and high taxes limiting investment? Squeeze out inflation and lower the tax rates. The people will take care of the rest. <br> In the past, populist leaders have understood that when large organizations--corporate or governmental--exercise power, the main beneficiaries tend to be large organizations. The populist therefore aligns himself with the folks who aren't displayed in portraiture. He's on the side of the small businessman and the ordinary individual. "When the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages, artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer, and the potent more powerful," Jackson wrote in his bank veto message, "the humble members of society--the farmers, mechanics, and laborers--who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government." <br> Likewise, the 1908 Democratic party platform, with Bryan as the nominee, stated: "'Shall the people rule?' is the overshadowing issue which manifests itself in all the questions now under discussion." Among other things, the platform attacked "the heedless waste of the people's money." It called for free trade and the "reduction of import duties." It favored the "election of United States Senators by direct vote of the people." Later in the 20th century, President Ford would nod to the populists when he said, "Here, the people rule." <br> In a 1978 radio commentary that he wrote while overlooking traffic from a hotel room window, Reagan distilled the populist belief in individual ability. "They are not 'the masses,' or as the elitists would have it, 'the common man,'" Reagan said of the people driving cars on the highway below. "They are very uncommon. Individuals, each with his or her own hopes and dreams, plans and problems, and the kind of quiet courage that makes this whole country run better than just about any other place on earth." Reagan's mission was to remove the obstacles that prevented these men and women with "quiet courage" from realizing their potential. <br> Populist leaders have held very modest views of government. "Distinctions in society will always exist under every just government," Jackson wrote in his bank message. "Equality of talents, of education, or of wealth cannot be produced by human institutions." In Bryan's view, government was so easily corrupted that it needed to be subject to constant democratic renewal. "The conscience of the nation," the 1908 Democratic platform stated, "is now aroused to free the Government from the grip of those who have made it a business asset of the favor-seeking corporations." Reagan famously likened government to a baby--"an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other." <br> And Palin? Time and again, she has run against elites who, in her view, are ignoring the public interest. She overthrew a three-term incumbent mayor of Wasilla because he wasn't as conservative as the people he represented. She used sales tax revenues and bond issues to help the town grow into a thriving suburb. She knocked off a Republican energy commissioner, a Republican attorney general, and an incumbent Republican governor because she felt that they were helping themselves and their friends and not the Alaskan people. As governor, she passed a sweeping ethics reform, changed the tax code so Alaskans got their fair share of oil revenues, and introduced competition and transparency into the construction of a natural gas pipeline. <br> Palin has an intuitive faith in builders and traders, in hockey moms and plumbers. She is clearly on the side of competitive, entrepreneurial capitalism. But she hasn't spent much time on the national stage. Nor has she tied her pointed criticisms of the Obama agenda and the liberal media to a larger argument about how ordinary people with common sense can rescue the American economy and revitalize American democracy. Palin has Jacksonian instincts, but she still hasn't forged her own political persuasion. Time to add flesh to the bone. <br> For example, take energy policy. Last week, when Joe Biden traveled to upstate New York to campaign for Democratic congressional candidate Bill Owens, the vice president took aim at Sarah Palin. "The fact of the matter is that Sarah Palin thinks the answer to energy was 'drill, baby, drill,'" Biden said. "No, it's a lot more complicated, Sarah, than 'drill, baby, drill.'" <br> A good sign of condescension is when someone tells you that "things are more complicated" than you think. In truth, as Palin pointed out on her Facebook page later that day, she has "always advocated an all-of-the-above approach to American energy independence." It was, moreover, Biden and not Palin who was treading dangerous policy ground. Palin's positions align squarely with the American people's. In an August ABC News/Washington Post poll, for instance, almost two-thirds of respondents supported more oil and gas drilling. A 52-percent majority favored building more nuclear power plants. A similar majority supported additional coal mining. Fifty-one percent wanted "more power plants that burn oil, coal, and natural gas." And another two-thirds favored constructing nuclear power plants within 50 miles of their homes. <br> The popular and sensible approach to energy policy is obvious. Remove the restrictions on offshore oil exploration--if Obama thinks it's fine for Brazil to drill offshore, why can't the United States? Lower tariffs and reduce subsidies for domestically produced ethanol. Get rid of the regulations limiting the construction of oil refineries. Dismiss airy prophecies about "peak oil," "green jobs," and "limits to growth." Pledge, instead, that Americans will have access to as much of the cheapest, cleanest energy they need to stimulate the economy. Palin is right. No limits. "All of the above" is best. <br> Or take health policy. In the tradition of Jackson, Bryan, and Reagan, Palin could point out that the price of health care is rising because the market in health care is broken. When you buy insurance in the individual market, you don't receive the same tax break as large corporations who buy group plans for their employees. Instead of one, more-or-less free market for health insurance, there are 50 heavily regulated state markets. The mandates for insurance that state governments impose--guaranteed coverage for hair plugs or in vitro fertilization, for instance--increase prices. And since an individual cannot shop for insurance across state lines, a young, healthy person in mandate-manic New York cannot buy a low premium, high-deductible plan on offer in lightly regulated Utah. <br> Meanwhile, state and federal government, which accounts for a large (46 percent in 2006) and growing portion of national health spending, uses its monopoly power to bid down the price of the medical services it purchases, and thereby raises costs for everyone else. Medicare fraud is rampant. Defensive medicine increases expenditures. And doctors and hospitals are under no obligation to share prices with consumers until after services are rendered--which means that patients cannot shop around for the most affordable treatments. <br> What's a populist to do? Trust in the commercial ideal, and dismantle the regulatory barriers to true competition and innovation in the health care marketplace. <br> Next, consider the financial sector. The government is doing its best to prop up failed giants at the expense of competition and innovation. Held to the standards of the marketplace, companies like GM, Chrysler, AIG, GMAC, and Citi probably would disappear. They'd be bought and sold, carved up into little pieces, and the overpaid CEOs who made bad bets would lose their jobs. <br> Instead, these firms are on government life-support. Hundreds of billions in taxpayer money is propping them up. The dollars keeping GM alive and UAW workers employed are dollars that could be spent more productively elsewhere. The dollars enriching Vikram Pandit and his cronies are being financed by Americans who aren't even born. Worse, rather than bury the idea of "too big to fail," the Obama regulatory scheme would enshrine it. The administration seems bent on repeating the same mistakes that Japan made in the 1990s, when political favoritism triumphed over regulated capitalism. The result was the zombie banks that haunt the Japanese economy to this day. <br> Jackson, Bryan, and Reagan would be furious at the way the financial crisis has been handled. They would want to break down the ossified constellations of power. They'd want to let new businesses replace the old. <br> Step one is to set a timeline for withdrawal from the bailout state. Policymakers need to be clear that they have no intention of maintaining these huge transfers of wealth for much longer. Rather than micromanage government-owned banks and auto companies, they need to focus on weaning them off the federal teat. For the banks, a complicated and technocratic regulatory scheme isn't necessary. A few simple rules that separate the solvent banks from the insolvent would suffice. <br> Feeling outrage and impotence over the actions of Wall Street bankers and government regulators is natural and understandable, Palin could say. But the answer isn't further government control and politicization. It's using government to break apart concentrations of power--and then stepping back to watch as the market imposes its iron discipline. <br> Last year the public elected an inspirational leader who promised change. Barack Obama promised to open government, end insiderism, and confer no special privileges. He promised to reach across the aisle and adopt his opponents' best ideas. <br> This was all an illusion. As the Obama presidency has developed, people have realized that this is not the change they sought. The Treasury secretary is a tax cheat overseeing a Wall Street bailout program. The congressman in charge of the tax code is under investigation for various frauds. From auto bailouts to the stimulus to health care, the president has implemented or advocated policies of which the people disapprove. <br> Obama's governing style is based on personal interaction with major policy stakeholders. So, when the president formulates a policy, he brings into the White House all the titans of industry and top lobbyists who might be affected. The rule applies whether the issue is the financial system, climate change, or health care: Obama listens to and makes deals with market incumbents. The theory is that such negotiations will produce legislation that satisfies everyone involved. But whatever the benefits, the costs are all too clear: Incumbent stakeholders use government access to drive out competition, increase their leverage, and limit transparency. <br> In other words, Obama has rejected the tradition of Jackson, Bryan, and Reagan. He has rejected putting trust in the common wisdom and collective judgments of the American people. He's sought comfort in the "expert" knowledge of technocratic elites. Liberal Democrats in Congress set the agenda. The unions drive trade, health, and labor policy. The bankers drive economic policy. Joe Six Pack is left out in the cold. <br> But the elites continue to mess things up. Confidence in American institutions continues to erode. Faith in the American future continues to decline. <br> Is there an exit? Yes. All it would take is for a populist leader like the one in Wasilla to pick up the Jacksonian, Bryanite, Reaganite torch and deliver this simple message to Obama and the political class: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this big-government crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon the cross of Goldman Sachs. <br> By Matthew Continetti: Reprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard 
 Andrew Koneschusky is a Vice President at Levick Strategic Communications in Washington, DC and writes for Bulletproof Blog. He previously served as National Press Secretary to Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and as Communications Director for Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY).<br>The historic healthcare reform bill passed by the House of Representatives last weekend still faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, but few thought the Democrats would get this far. A week that included gubernatorial defeats in Virginia and New Jersey, along with unemployment numbers clocking in at 10.2%, did not bode well for the White House and Congressional Democrats. <br> Whatever happens, the current success enjoyed by the Democrats merits a closer look. The political dynamics have certainly changed enough to suggest that a party once on the defense in national debates has learned a few lessons over the years. In this debate, the Democrats are controlling the language and images that drive public perception. <br> A few months ago, the outlook for health care seemed bleak. Heated town hall protests over the summer dominated the news as populist anger - perhaps real, perhaps manufactured - thundered over the broadcast channels, fueled the blogs, and hit key Congressional representatives in their home districts. <br> One can only surmise why the Republicans - after topping the charts with hit tunes like "war on terror" and "death tax" - did not draw enough momentum from what seemed to be a total debacle. Perhaps it was the sharp division in their party. Perhaps it was a bit of ill-advised complacency as victory seemed assured. The Republicans may have thought further vivisection of a nearly dead patient was unnecessary. <br> But credit the Democrats for some canny alterations in the very fabric of the debate. <br> First, they changed the language to expand their constituency. The initial policy definer was "health care reform" but, as the summer protests raged, the White House realized that that terminology focused the debate too much on those without health insurance and too little on those who are covered. So the shift was made to "health insurance reform," refocusing the purported benefits of the proposed legislation on both the haves and have-nots. <br> Such flexibility was subtle but decisive. In the past, Democrats like Al Gore and John Edwards have been hampered in their quests for power by too much emphasis on service to the disadvantaged. In the bigger tent needed for victory, politicians must speak to the interests of those who are doing okay while feeling they have a right to do much better. <br> Second, they co-opted their fiercest opposition. Here, "public option" has been lexically decisive. Rather than tout "government-run insurance," Democrats are using language that reflects the values of our society. The term "option" assuages the anxieties of free market opponents as it embraces the defining concept of choice, a synonym for "option." Cries of "socialized medicine" are still uttered but do not resound. Even the talk radio echo chamber has been ineffective. <br> Third, they let the Republicans cartoon themselves. Those summer protests may have offered the potential for momentum, but they got out of hand. Here the visuals reinforced the language shifts as independent and undecided voters were treated to virtual mob scenes. <br> Democrats continue to outflank the Right, augmenting their dominance in the language war with compelling images. Enter Bill Clinton. The former president this week injected himself into the healthcare debate, visiting Capitol Hill ostensibly to persuade Democratic Senators to pass a bill. But the trip has implications far beyond the halls of Congress. <br> Clinton didn't go to the Capitol to have lunch with Democratic Senators. He went to the Capitol to be seen having lunch with Democratic Senators. The optics matter far more than the lobbying mission. <br> We've seen this movie before. Bill Clinton didn't free two journalists held in North Korea as a result of hardnosed negotiations. He secured their release simply because he made the trip - and was seen making the trip. Clinton's powerful brand bestowed on the North Koreans a respect and seriousness that few others could have offered. <br> In the homestretch of the health care debate, Clinton's entrance is an attempt at a similar outcome. Democrats are presenting a contrasting "picture" of political gravitas to calm tensions and bring health care home. <br> Control the language and visuals of a debate and you win the debate. If two sides are evenly matched on those scores, you get to see quite a political match, a veritable "Thrilla in Manila." More often, once someone starts to win, the other guy suddenly can't stop tripping. That said, there is time to recover from a bad start, to regain momentum, as has been the case on healthcare. The adaptability of the Democrats on this issue is a model case study in recovery. <br> Of course, we should not altogether neglect another reason why health care reform is still politically viable. An awful lot of Americans are just sick and tired of the American health care system as it currently stands. But that's a topic for another discussion. <br> By Andrew Koneschusky: 
 <img src="https://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/images/2007/09/06/image3240153x.jpg" border="0">(Office of Sen. Lamar Alexander)</div>Lamar Alexander is the senior United States Senator from Tennessee. He offered these comments on the Senate floor. <br>In 1969 and during the first half of 1970, I was a wet-behind-the-ears, 29-year-old staff aide in the West Wing of the Nixon White House. I was working for the wisest man in that White House, Bryce Harlow, who was a friend of President Johnson, as well as the favorite staff member of President Eisenhower, and President Nixon's first appointee. <br> Based upon that experience and my forty years since then in and out of public life, I want to make what I hope will be taken as a friendly suggestion to President Obama and his White House: don't create an enemies list. <br> As I was leaving the White House in 1970, Mr. Harlow was heading out on the campaign plane with Vice President Spiro Agnew whose job was to vilify Democrats and to help elect Republicans. The Vice President had the help of talented young speechwriters, the late Bill Safire and Pat Buchanan. In Memphis, he called Albert Gore, Sr., the "southern regional chairman of the eastern liberal establishment." He labeled the increasingly critical news media, "nattering nabobs of negativism." <br> Those phrases have become part of our political lore. They began playfully enough, in the back and forth of political election combat. After I had come home to Tennessee, they escalated into something more. They eventually emerged into the Nixon enemies list. <br> In 1971 Chuck Colson, who was then a member of President Nixon's staff and today is admired for his decades of selfless work in prison reform, presented a list of what he called "persons known to be active in their opposition to our Administration." He said he thought the administration should "maximize our incumbency . . . [or] to put it more bluntly, . . . use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies." On that list of 20 people were CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr, Washington Star columnist Mary McGrory, Leonard Woodcock, the head of the United Auto Workers, John Conyers, the Democratic Congressman from Michigan, Edwin Guthman, managing editor of the Los Angeles Times, and several prominent businessmen such as Howard Stein, of the Dreyfus Corporation and Arnold Picker, vice president of United Artists. The New York Times and the Washington Post were made out to be enemies of the Republic. <br> Now make no mistake, politics was not such a gentlemanly affair in those days either. After Barry Goldwater had won the Presidential nomination in 1964, Daniel Schorr had told CBS viewers that Goldwater had "travel[led] to Germany to join-up with the right wing there" and - "visit[ed] Hitler's old stomping ground." Schorr later corrected that on the air. <br> What was different about Colson's effort, though, was the open declaration of war upon anyone who seemed to disagree with administration policies. Colson later expanded his list to include hundreds of people, including Joe Namath, John Lennon, Carol Channing, Gregory Peck, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the Congressional Black Caucus, Alabama Governor George Wallace. All this came out during the Watergate hearings. You could see an administration spiraling downwards. And, of course, we all know where that led. <br> Now the only reason I mention this is because I have an uneasy feeling, only ten months into this new administration, that we're beginning to see symptoms of this same kind of animus developing in the Obama administration. <br> According to Politico, the White House plans to "neuter the United States Chamber of Commerce," an organization with members in almost every major community in America. The Chamber had supported the President's stimulus package and some of his early appointments, but has problems with his health care and climate change proposals. <br> The Department of Health and Human Services imposed a gag order on a large health care company, Humana, who had warned its Medicare Advantage customers that their benefits might be reduced in Democratic health care reform proposals-a piece of information that is perfectly true. This gag order was lifted only after the Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said he would block any future nominees to the Department until the matter was righted. <br> The White House Communications director recently announced that the administration would treat a major television network, Fox News, as "part of the Opposition." On Sunday White House officials were all over talk shows urging other news organizations to "boycott" Fox and not pick up any of its stories. Those stories, for example, would include the video that two amateur filmmakers made of ACORN representatives explaining how to open a brothel. That's a story other media managed to ignore until almost a week later when Congress decided to cut ACORN's funding. <br> The President has not stopped blaming banks and investment houses for the financial meltdown even as it has become clear that Congress played a huge role, too, by encouraging Americans to borrow money for houses they couldn't afford. He was "taking names" of bondholders who resisted the GM and Chrysler bailouts. <br> Insurance companies, once the allies of the Obama health care proposal, have suddenly become the source of all our health care problems-because they pointed out, again correctly, that if Congress taxes insurance premiums and restricts coverage to those who are sicker and older, the cost of premiums for millions of Americans is likely to go up instead of down. Because of that insubordination, the President and his allies have threatened to take away the insurance companies antitrust exemption. <br> Even those of us in Congress have found ourselves in the crosshairs: The assistant Republican leader, Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, said to ABC's George Stephanopoulos that the stimulus plan wasn't working. The White House wrote the governor of Arizona and said, "If you don't want the money, we won't send it." Sen. McCain said that this could be perceived as a threat to the people of Arizona. <br> Sen. Bennett of Utah and Sen. Collins and I as well as Democratic Senators Byrd and Feingold all have questioned the number and power of the 18 new White House czars who are not confirmed by the Senate and have suggested that is a threat to constitutional checks and balances. The White House refused to send anyone to testify at congressional hearings. Sen. Bennett and I found ourselves "called out" on the White House blog by the President's communications director. <br> Even the president, in his address to Congress on health care, threatened to "call out" members of congress who disagreed with him. This behavior is typical of street brawls and political campaign consultants. It is a mistake for the President of the United States and the White House staff. <br> If the President and his top aides treat people with different views as enemies instead of listening to what they have to say, they're likely to end up with a narrow view and a feeling that the whole world is out to get them. And as those of us who served in the Nixon administration know, that can get you into a lot of trouble. <br> This administration is only ten months old. It's not too late to take a different approach - both at the White House and here in the Congress. Here is one opportunity. At the beginning of this year, shortly after the President's inauguration, the Republican leader, Sen. McConnell, addressed the National Press Club. He proposed that he and the President work together to make social security solvent. He said that he would make sure the President got more support in that effort from Republicans than President George W. Bush got from Democrats when he tried to solve the same problem. President Obama held a summit on the dangers of the runaway costs of entitlements which I attended. Every expert there said making social security solvent was essential to our country's fiscal stability. There is still time to get that done. <br> On clean energy, Republicans have put forward four ideas: build 100 nuclear plants in 20 years, electrify half our cars and trucks in 20 years, explore offshore for low-carbon natural gas and for oil, and double energy research and development for alternative fuels. The administration agrees with this on electric cars and research and development. We may not be far apart on offshore exploration. And, at his town meeting in New Orleans last week, the President said the United States would be "stupid" not to use nuclear power. He is right, since nuclear reactors produce 70% of our carbon free electricity. So why don't we work together on this lower-cost way to address clean energy and climate change instead of enacting a national energy tax? <br> On health care, the White House idea of bipartisanship has been akin to that of a marksman at the state fair shooting gallery: hit one target and you win the prize. With such big Democratic congressional majorities, the White House figures all it needs to do is unify the Democrats and pick off one or two Republicans. That strategy may win the prize but lose the country. Usually, on complex issues, the President needs bipartisan support in Congress to reassure and achieve broad and lasting support in the country. In 1968 I can remember when President Johnson, with bigger majorities in Congress than President Obama has today, arranged for the Civil Rights Bill to be written in open sessions over several weeks in the office of the Republican leader, Everett Dirksen. Dirksen got some of the credit; Johnson got the legislation he wanted; the country went along with it. Instead of comprehensive health care that raises premiums and increases the debt, why should the White House not work with Republicans step by step to reduce health care costs, and then, as we can afford it, reduce the number of Americans who don't have access to health care? <br> The President and his Education Secretary Arne Duncan have been courageous-there is no better word for it-in advocating paying teachers more for teaching well and expanding the number of charter schools. These ideas are the Holy Grail for school reform. They are also ideas that are anathema to the labor unions who support the President. President Obama's advocacy of master teachers and charter schools could be the domestic of equivalent of President Nixon going to China. I, among others, admire his advocacy and have been doing all I can help him. <br> Having once been there, I can understand how those in the White House feel oppressed by those with whom they disagree, how they feel besieged by some of the media. I hope the current White House occupants will understand that this is nothing new in American politics-all the way back to the days when John Adams and Thomas Jefferson exchanged insults. The only thing new is that there are today multiple media outlets reporting and encouraging the insults 24 hours a day. <br> As any veteran of the Nixon White House can attest, we've been down this road before and it won't end well. An "enemies list" only denigrates the Presidency and the Republic itself. <br> Forty years ago, Bryce Harlow would say to me, "Now Lamar, remember that our job here is to push all the merely important issues out of the white house so the president can deal with the handful of issues that are truly presidential." Then he would slip off for a private meeting in the Capitol with Democratic leaders who controlled the congress and usually find a way to enact the president proposals. <br> Most successful leaders have eventually seen the wisdom of Lord Palmerston, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who said, "We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. The British writer Edward Dicey was once introduced to President Lincoln as "one of his enemies." "I did not know I had any enemies," was Lincoln's answer; And Dicey later wrote, "I can still feel, as I write, the grip of that great boney hand held out to me in token of friendship." <br> So here's my point. These are unusually difficult times, with plenty of forces encouraging us to disagree. Let's not start calling people out and compiling an enemies list. Let's push the street-brawling out of the White House and work together on the truly presidential issues: creating jobs, reducing health care costs, reducing the debt, creating clean energy. <br> By Lamar Alexander 
 Jeremy Scahill, a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute, is the author of the bestselling Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army, published by Nation Books. He is an award-winning investigative journalist and correspondent for the national radio and TV program Democracy Now!<hr width="50%">The nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight and Reform recently revealed that the top 100 government contractors made nearly $300 billion from federal contracts in 2007 alone. Since 1995 these same contractors have been involved with 676 cases of "misconduct" and paid $26 billion in fines to settle cases stemming from fraud, waste or abuse. Fines and other penalties, it seems, are simply the stunningly small price of doing government business. <br> Take the case of the top three war contractors, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. These companies have engaged in 108 instances of misconduct since 1995 and have paid fines or settlements totaling nearly $3 billion. In 2007 they won some $77 billion in federal contracts. Or consider pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which in September paid $2.3 billion to settle a slew of criminal and civil cases, including Medicaid fraud. According to the Justice Department, this was "the largest healthcare fraud settlement" in its history. Yet Pfizer made more than $40 billion in profits last year and won $73 million in federal contracts in 2007; it continues to do robust business with the government. Not bad for a "corporate felon." <br> Unfortunately, neither Pfizer nor the largest US military contractors are targets of significant Congressional action. Instead it's ACORN, a community organization that trains and advocates for poor and working-class Americans. Over the past fifteen years, ACORN has received just $53 million in federal funds, much of it for low-income housing. Despite--or perhaps because of--its efforts to empower some 500,000 member families, ACORN was the subject of a sting video produced by a right-wing activist that featured a fake pimp and prostitute seeking tax advice. The group swiftly fired the handful of employees who were entrapped, but that didn't put an end to the storm. <br> Fox News aired the video repeatedly, and right-wing astroturf operative Rick Berman set up a Rotten ACORN website. The campaign was wildly successful. In mid-September all but seventy-five House Democrats and seven senators voted with their Republican colleagues to bar the group from receiving federal funds. <br> ACORN, like all organizations receiving federal dollars, should be subject to Congressional scrutiny. But ACORN was clearly singled out for political reasons. Those Democrats who voted for the "defund ACORN" bill should be required to explain their reasoning to their constituents, particularly when so few of them have taken substantive actions to apply the ACORN standard to corporate criminals with real rap sheets. <br> A small but growing number of lawmakers are fighting to confront out-of-control corporations. Here are three legislative initiatives that stand out: <br> &#8200;HR 3679. Representative Betty McCollum of Minnesota introduced her own ACORN Act--the Against Corporations Organizing to Rip off the Nation Act--which seeks to deny federal funds to "corporations or companies guilty of certain felony convictions." Pfizer is singled out, but the act could be applied to other corporations too. "Why are companies that break the law as a business strategy allowed to receive taxpayer funds?" asks McCollum. "A government contract is a privilege, not a right. If a company commits a felony against the people of the United States, then that privilege must end." Significantly, Wisconsin Representative David Obey, chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, has signed on as a co-sponsor. Obey also voted to defund ACORN. <br> In the Senate, Bernie Sanders put forward an amendment to the current defense authorization bill (HR3326 S. AMDT. 2617) that calls on the defense secretary to conduct a wide-ranging study of the money the government pays to contractors that have been indicted, settled charges or been fined by any federal agency, as well as those that have been convicted of fraud. It also calls for recommendations on how to penalize contractors that are "repeatedly" involved with fraud. "Virtually every major defense contractor in this country has, for a period of many years, been engaged in systemic, illegal and fraudulent behavior while receiving hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money," says Sanders. While Sanders is just calling for a "study," the spirit of his amendment could be the basis for legislation that targets corporate criminals receiving federal dollars. <br> Several Congressional offices say they are weighing the possibility of introducing legislation that would apply the ACORN standard to companies like Blackwater, whose operatives will stand trial next year on manslaughter charges stemming from killing Iraqi civilians; or KBR, which is being investigated in connection with the electrocution deaths of US soldiers and contractors in Iraq. Representative Jan Schakowsky says she is considering reintroducing a version of her 2007 Stop Outsourcing Security Act, which sought to ban the use of Blackwater and other mercenary companies from performing armed activities on the federal payroll. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a co-sponsor in the Senate, now oversees the work of Blackwater and other armed State Department contractors, increasingly employed in Afghanistan. <br> Florida Representative Alan Grayson is spearheading calls for fraudulent military contractors to be defunded under the anti-ACORN legislation. He points to Halliburton's misconduct and its "extreme and gross negligence...putting in showers in Iraq that end up electrocuting soldiers, and feeding them poisoned water." The federal funding ACORN has received over the past twenty years, Grayson says, "is roughly equal to what the taxpayer paid to Halliburton each day during the war in Iraq." <br> By Jeremy Scahill: Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Lydia Depillis is a reporter-researcher for The New Republic.<hr width="50%">On Saturday, September 12, America threw a gigantic temper tantrum in Washington D.C. Organizers called it the "largest gathering of fiscal conservatives in history," and they're probably right. But for an angry, anti-government fit, the march was remarkably civil. They had come in large bands--14 buses from Morristown, New Jersey; 12 from Harford County, Maryland--prepared with picnic baskets and lawn chairs. They festooned their hats with teabags and dressed in Revolutionary-era finery. Marchers smiled and waved and met new friends, laughing at each other's signs and exulting in their power. You might call it solidarity (the logo for the march was a raised fist against the Capitol Dome) but that would sound sort of communist. <br> "It's the biggest thing I've seen in my entire life," said a lady on the phone, excitedly. "Everybody has the same idea." <br> "I'm optimistic for the first time in a long time," said another, thinking aloud. "We're gonna get out of this mess." <br> Their complaint? Hard to say, really. Some, like the contingent of coal miners in hard hats with anti-cap-and-trade signs, had a concrete beef with the administration. But for most, there was both an incredible specificity to their protestations--all those czars, and ACORN, and Obama's missing birth certificate--and a fuzzy vagueness. <br> "We're losing America," said Kris, from Maryland. "Government is trying to take over everything." <br> What makes you so sure? I asked Shawn Nicholls, of Delaplane, Virginia, who had come with her young son. <br> "Just the people who surround the president. You have to question some of the associations," she answered. "It's like a big puzzle, and you get a few pieces of it here and there. You're trying to figure out what's going on, and you can't ignore these pieces anymore," she finished. <br> After congregating at Freedom Plaza, the entire mass strolled its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, with the occasional cheer of "YOU LIE," or just an undefined roar, sweeping the column. We pressed up against the Capitol steps, hearing an endless rotation of speakers exhort the crowd. Images of Obama were everywhere: wearing a Che hat, as the Joker, in culturally ambiguous tribal regalia, as a wolf in sheep's clothing. And then, as The New York Times reported later, the president himself passed over the crowd in a helicopter on his way to sell health care in Minnesota. The crowd waved, not realizing whom the copter contained. <br> This march, however, was only the culmination of a three-day bonanza of anti-government events, collectively known as the 9/12 Project. The most dedicated corps had come on Thursday morning, to the Armory--a vast hall in fairly desolate area in Ward 6, where the AIDS rate is 2.8 percent--and alighted on a rank of bleachers. They sat attentively, but responsively, while politicians like John Boehner and Jim DeMint, as well as FreedomWorks activists, outlined the reasons for Saturday's march. <br> "This isn't a Democratic administration. This is a progressive administration," explained Representative John Shadegg, of Arizona. "And they want to destroy everything that you and I think is great about this country." Shadegg is a good speaker--the way he explained health care, the Democrats had messed it up by fixing the tax code such that only employers could buy insurance, and now Obama wants to raid Medicare to fund a system of government control. This is about a radical revolution! a woman shouted behind me. <br> "The same government that can't run the post office?" Shadegg continued. "The same government that can't run cash for clunkers? You let them run a health care plan? I don't think so." Noooooooooo, the crowd agreed. <br> The longer one listened, the more it seemed like the nation was really under attack. "I'm worried about George Soros," said one woman, in a question and answer session. "I'm worried that the Democratic Party and our country have been hijacked by radical socialists!" Senator Jim Inhofe agreed. "You do have to wonder, who's really in charge?" he said from the dais. "Clearly it's the elitists and the money that's coming out of Hollywood." Boot 'em out! a cry went up. <br> But as much as it appeared the forces of darkness were gathering, this was also a profoundly hopeful event. The Republicans have alternatives--they brandished a reassuring stack of paper that contained all the proposals they've been introducing, only to be ignored by the mainstream media and crushed by Democratic leadership. And with the help of ordinary citizens, there was still time to stop the madness. <br> "I am actually tremendously excited to be here. This is an incredible moment," Shadegg told the crowd. "And you know what makes it incredible? You. You make it incredible." <br> Later that day, they convened again, this time at Upper Senate Park near the Capitol, for a "Physicians Rally Against Socialized Medicine." There's something so trustworthy about people in lab coats, and the ultra-conservative group American Association of Physicians and Surgeons had gathered their members to dramatize the point. This is when Obama really started to look bad. <br> "Doctors have been accused of actually mutilating their patients for financial gain," an earnest-looking doctor named Scott Barber told the crowd, before describing his long, tortuous years spent training for his profession. "To be honest with you, I'm kind of livid." Right! the guy next to me shouted. Lies! cried another. "Because we do not do amputations instead of treat diabetes! We do not take out tonsils instead of treating a sore throat!" <br> And then, it became not only anti-doctor, but also anti-American, to suggest that the U.S. health care system even needed reform. "We have the best health care system here and everyone knows it," said another speaker. The cheer went up: USA! USA! USA! <br> I have never felt more welcome as a reporter than I did at a "Meet and Tweet," advertised as a gathering of tea partying women on the eve of the march, at the Doubletree Hotel. <br> "Are you a tweeter?" cried Dianne Shaw, sitting primly cross-legged, in a gray skirt set. About ten middle-aged women sat around a table crowded with empty wine glasses and a few bottles of Heineken, delicately munching mini cheeseburgers. I explained that I wasn't, but no matter--they sat me down to join the conversation. <br> One of the 9/12 Project organizers' primary claims is that their participants are political neophytes, not seasoned activists. That, at least, appears to be true: Almost everyone I talked to was doing this for the first time, and most were tremendously excited. Donna Cohen, a Pennsylvanian with short red hair, was one exception; she had marched against the Vietnam War in the 1960s, but later apologized to the troops. "I said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you were right,'" she told me. "But this is as much fun as I've had since the '60s!" <br> The discussion drifted from outrage to outrage, lingering on health care. No one actually doesn't have insurance, the women agreed. Obama's numbers of the uninsured keep wavering; maybe he just stopped factoring in the illegals. Besides, everyone can just go to the emergency room, or one of those clinics that Wal-Mart runs. <br> "This administration does not understand the free market," someone pronounced. <br> "The only people with private insurance will be unions!" said another. <br> Above the chatter, Shaw, a retired voice teacher from Alabama, leaned over to get my attention. "I tell you, my Facebook is hot," she said, putting on her glasses and pulling out her iPhone. She started reading wall postings from all the people back home in Birmingham. "'I'm so jealous. I want a full report,'" one read. And another: "'Give 'em a wedgie!' Or--I'm not going to say this--'call them a doo-doo head for me.'" <br> "I could go on and on," she gushed. "All these people, rooting for me!" <br> In a weekend well-attended by women but largely led by men--nearly all the speakers at all the rallies were male politicians and talking heads--this was a rare moment of female camaraderie. It felt like they were on the edge of something big. "We should have a women's party!" someone proposed. <br> I was about to leave, but Judith Weiss from New York City--who had been proudly pointed out as a Jew, which was as close as the group came to diversity--flagged me down. "Can I tell you what I like about Obama?" she asked. "I think the fact that there's a normal black family in the White House. If he could make being nerdy fashionable among black kids, he will have done a good thing." The women nodded in agreement. No racists here! <br> If there was a uniformity to the message at Saturday's march, it's because everyone gets their news from one place: FOX. As the stream of humanity flowed past FOX cameras, people took their pictures against the truck's logo, and chants went up: "FOX! FOX! FOX!" <br> The patron saint of the entire movement, of course, is Glenn Beck. "Beck 2012" signs dotted the audience, and at one point ten women got lined up in a row, each with a letter from his name: "G-L-E-N-N [heart] B-E-C-K." People speak of him not just with appreciation, but reverence. "Thank God for Glenn Beck," said Barbara Conley, a spry old woman from Harford County, Maryland. "He has instilled in me the felling of, if you speak the truth, don't be afraid, because you speak the truth." <br> Beck himself watched the event from his studios in Manhattan, receiving dispatches from FOX correspondent Griff Jenkins, who bounded around looking completely overwhelmed. "LOOK AT THIS CROWD," he screamed, thrusting his mic out to the mass. "You guys got something to say to Glenn Beck?" <br> Beck harps constantly on the theme that this isn't a partisan movement--these ordinary Americans are fed up with Democrats and Republicans. In an interview with Beck, Republicans Senator DeMint and Representative Mike Pence attempted to salvage some high ground for their party, in an almost painful process of self-flagellation and abasement. Rule #1: Glenn is always right. <br> "What will it take for people like you to be able to say, 'You know what, I gotta clean out the hornets nest in my own party?'" he asked them. "I'm a recovering alcoholic. I can tell you the moment when I said, 'Enough, I've gotta change my life or I'm gonna die.' I have not seen that from the Republican Party." <br> "Glenn, I think you're right," DeMint answered, after bravely arguing that the GOP was actually starting to figure things out. "I don't think we have come to the point as a party that we're willing to admit that we've got a problem. And as you know, that's when the recovery begins. ... So I still can't tell you who to trust, but I can tell you who you can't trust. I know the Democrat Party right now is solid moving us in the wrong direction. We've gotta get this Republican side together so Americans know who to come to." <br> The crowd disbursed gradually, like a fever subsiding. Lines for some 70-odd port-o-potties stretched dozens of people deep. For blocks, garbage cans were filled with crumpled signs. As people flooded out, D.C. residents percolated back in, some wearing Obama t-shirts, looking bemused: What in the world had just happened? <br> By Lydia Depillis: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 Yuval Levin issenior editor of The New Atlantis and a contributing editor to National Review.<hr width="50%">Last night was a very strange evening of political theater. President Obama pretended that the last eight weeks never happened and gave essentially the speech he has been giving to no avail around the country all summer, in favor of the same general outline the Democrats have been pushing, without more detail, and without any real changes. <br> As Bill Kristol points out, Obama actually began by suggesting that there was not a health care crisis in America. "We did not come here just to clean up crises," he said after speaking about the economic crisis. "We came to build a future. So tonight, I return to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future - and that is the issue of health care." And he suggested that by engineering and designing things just right, the Democrats would indeed give American health care its correct ultimate shape, and render it permanently unproblematic. "I am not the first president to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last." The last? <br> Permanent perfection, in this kind of technocratic vision, would surely require getting every fine detail just right. Yet Obama did not seem to be advancing a very detailed plan, but rather championing some vague generalities. And when you line these generalities up, they form a very peculiar and implausible picture. It will cost $900 billion, involve no tax increases for the middle class and no Medicare benefit cuts for the elderly, but not add a dime to the deficit. The basic prerequisites for risk-based insurance will be rendered illegal, but the public is assured that insurance arrangements need not change-or rather that they will only improve. <br> To try to sneak these glaring contradictions past his listeners, the president engaged in some familiar misdirection. He said the government would not force people to lose their existing insurance. But the question of displacement is not about force: employers currently provide insurance not because they are forced to do so (they are not) but because a combination of policy and labor market pressures lead them to choose to do so. Change those pressures and coverage arrangements will change for millions. <br> He insisted that "no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions," but those dollars would be used to fund insurance that would pay for abortion, and new rules would require more insurers to pay for it. He insisted the public plan would not be subsidized by the public (though he then compared it to public universities, which are subsidized by the public). But the problem with that plan is that it would have regulatory advantages and negotiating power that would allow it to price private insurers out of the market, not that it would be directly subsidized in ways its competitors were not. <br> To pass off this misdirection (not to say dishonesty), he accused his opponents of dishonesty. There won't actually literally be panels of people deciding that elderly patients should die, he said. That's a relief. To argue that cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare will in any way reduce benefits is just plain lying, he insisted. <br> And in the face of these liars, the president offered himself up as a moderate. Again and again he presented two extremes and described his position as a golden mean between them. Some people want a single-payer system (yes, some people do), and others want to abruptly end the employer-based insurance system, while he is the centrist taking good ideas from both sides. But his support for medical liability reform amounted to an argument against including it in the bill (since he said he would pursue very modest executive branch action alone). His support for lower-cost options for people with pre-existing conditions, which he attributed to John McCain, was just unclear: what exactly is he arguing for there? <br> The president made a spirited case for a public insurance plan, yet somehow the news is supposed to be that he didn't demand it as adamantly as he might have or threaten a veto if it is not in the final bill. That's true, but he argued for it, and it's a very bad idea. Are we supposed to walk away impressed that he's not really for it? <br> And finally, Obama concluded with a painfully inappropriate abuse of the memory of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy-calling by name on several Republican friends of Kennedy's, as if to shame them into voting for a bill they do not support because failing to do so would be a failure of friendship. Is this how a president behaves? Using the memory of the recently deceased as a club with which to pound upon the man's friends? <br> Steppping back, it is striking how partisan this speech was - both in its offense and its defense. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, of course. But it's telling. It suggests the White House and the Democratic leaders have decided that the Democrats must go it alone, and therefore needed a pep talk to give them the courage to push against public unease and Republican opposition. This speech may well serve them on that front. But it is hard to imagine that it will persuade independent voters who are worried about the plan, and that kind of persuasion is what moderate Democrats needed. <br> On the whole, it is hard to see how this speech moved the ball much. But it certainly revealed more clearly some of Obama's priorities and premises - a peculiar combination of technocratic ambition and wariness of particulars. <br> By Yuval Levin Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 James C. Capretta is a Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. <br>During August, in scores of meetings which were held in all parts of the country and attended by thousands, concerned citizens sent unmistakable signals to their elected political leaders that if Congress is going to produce anything on health-care this year - and many openly stated they hope nothing at all will pass - they want it to be a more targeted, less expensive, and less controversial product, and one based on bipartisan consensus and not ideological ambition. Polls show most Americans are strongly opposed to a full governmental takeover of U.S. health-care, and they rightly sense that is exactly what would happen if the bills currently under consideration were to pass. <br> And so how are Democrats responding to this spontaneous display of widespread public disapproval of their planned agenda? Not with a sensible course correction, it seems. No, by all appearances, it's still full steam ahead. <br> On Tuesday, Pres. Obama delivered a campaign-style speech to his union supporters which made news mainly because the president went off of his prepared remarks to deliver a false attack on his political opponents. The president said those who are against his government-heavy plan have offered no alternatives, which is flatly not true. Months ago, Senators Coburn and Burr, and Congressmen Ryan and Nunes offered the Patients' Choice Act which would build a true consumer-driven marketplace for insurance and medical services. <br> Also on Tuesday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus distributed a summary of his long-awaited plan to selected members of his committee, and it looks to be the same plan that was under discussion in June and July, with only the most modest of tweaks. It is built on the same flawed foundation as the House bills, starting with a so-called "individual mandate" that would penalize any American who didn't sign up with government-approved insurance. Employers would also pay a tax if any of their lower wage workers ended up on government-subsidized plans, which would create a strong disincentive for hiring such workers in the first place. The federal government would vastly expand health-care entitlement spending by enrolling millions of people in Medicaid and standing up a new entitlement for persons with incomes between 133 and 300 percent of the poverty line. The new spending in the Baucus plan is said to be near $900 billion over a decade, but no official estimates are available. <br> To "pay for "the additional federal costs, Sen. Baucus wants to impose a vast array of new taxes, on health insurers, drug companies, device manufacturers, and clinical labs, all of which will be passed on to patients, of course. In addition, Sen. Baucus wants to impose payment rate reductions in Medicare and Medicaid which will save between $400 and $500 billion over ten years. Among the cuts would be a deep reduction in Medicare Advantage payment rates, which would force millions of seniors out of their current coverage and back into the traditional Medicare program and expensive Medigap plans. <br> The Baucus plan is flawed from the get-go because it starts from the same misguided premise as its counterparts in the House. It seeks to achieve "universal coverage" but without building a functioning marketplace to slow the pace of rising costs. And so, if it were to pass, costs would escalate just as rapidly in the future as they have in the past, and it would only be a matter of time before the current administration or its successor proposed new and draconian "cost control" measures to hold down governmental health-care spending. <br> At that point, federal central planners would resort to the same kinds of price setting devices that have been tried for years in others settings, including Medicare. And the predictable result would be a large reduction in the willing suppliers of medical services, which would mean queues and lower quality care all around. <br> By James C.

 Jonathan Cohn is a senior editor at The New Republic.<hr width="50%">The August recess began with critics attacking health care reform because of its high price tag. It ended with critics attacking health care reform because of how reformers proposed to reduce that high price tag. The intervening weeks were nightmarish: Instead of using August to showcase what reform could do for the average American, the White House spent most of its time knocking down rumors of death panels for the sick and elderly. And as the right became energized, the left grew disillusioned, as much by the administration's backroom deals as by its ineffectual messaging. Eventually, the shift showed up in the polls. First people grew more wary of reform. Then they grew more wary of the president. It was if everything that could go wrong did go wrong. <br> Somehow, though, health reform is not dead. Despite all of the setbacks and all of the missed opportunities--despite this train wreck of a month--the situation remains remarkably similar to what it was before the recess. Significant health care legislation is likely to pass, particularly if Obama manages to give a good speech on Wednesday night. And while the possibilities for what that legislation might accomplish have certainly diminished, mostly for worse, it's not clear how much they have diminished--and to what extent progressives may yet have the power to change that fact. <br> Here is where the debate stands, based on interviews with about a dozen key players spanning the administration, Congress, and broader reform community: <br> Things certainly weren't looking this promising as recently as ten days ago, when the status of legislation remained precisely what it was before the recess. Four congressional committees had passed health reform bills, but the fifth and perhaps most crucial one--the Senate Finance Committee--remained stuck. Chairman Max Baucus hadn't been able to forge a consensus within the "Gang of Six," the bipartisan group he'd convened to hammer out a bill that could claim at least some Republican support. This was said to be crucial because Democrats needed a few Republicans in order to get the 60 votes necessary for breaking the inevitable filibuster. Trying to use the reconciliation process, in which filibusters can't block a simple majority from passing bills, was said to be impractical and too divisive. <br> But then the reality about the Gang of Six started to set in, particularly at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Mike Enzi and Charles Grassley, two of the three Republicans, made clear through statements and actions they wanted no part of reform--that their goal was to stop Obama's proposal from becoming law. That prompted terse dismissals from the White House, which focused all of its energies on the third Republican, Maine's Olympia Snowe. As my colleague Suzy Khimm has reported, Snowe has been negotiating about health care in good faith. By all accounts, she wants a bill and she wants a good bill. And if her notions of a good bill don't always gibe with those of liberals, they're closer than those of some Democrats, including some of her colleagues on Finance. <br> The White House made clear that it saw Snowe as a partner--and that it was willing to write a bill with her, even if it had to do so itself. At the same time, White House allies started talking about the reconciliation process--not to dismiss it, as they had before but to suggest it might work after all. Key players inside the administration and on Capitol Hill began suggesting in background conversations that reconciliation, although not ideal, could produce meaningful legislation. (One knowledgeable source challenged the prevailing wisdom that the parliamentarian would knock out provisions to create insurance exchanges, a crucial piece of reform.) Nobody was talking about it as a first choice option. But the change in tone was unmistakable and, I assume, not at all accidental. <br> Most of these developments took place last week, culminating in perhaps the most intriguing news of all: Baucus was finally offering legislative framework to the Gang of Six. He distributed that framework over the weekend with a request for feedback before Obama's speech on Wednesday--a clear indication that he realizes his window for action is closing. <br> The proposal is not good as it could be, at least relative to what the other committees have produced. But it's certainly not as bad as it could be, given expectations and the demands Republicans have been making. Rather than gut the proposal in order to keep the price tag down, Baucus has kept most of the basic structure and offered financial assistance that's close to--if not equal to--what the other committees have offered. As a result, the bill will require between $800 and $900 billion in outlays over ten years rather than, say, between $600 and $700 billion--as some recently circulated language suggested. But with that extra money, the proposal delivers at least some financial relief to people with incomes up to four times the poverty rate, rather than cutting off assistance at a much lower number. (It also reduces the deficit in the budget planning window, something no other bill does. More analysis of the proposal to come soon.) <br> So what happens now? For the moment, it's all about Snowe. If she signs on to a bill--whether it's the proposal Baucus has put forward, a framework Obama himself delivers, or some other iteration--it will most likely get out of the Finance Committee. Among other things, several sources note, Baucus' proposal has features designed to appeal to the committee's increasingly anxious liberals; a proposed tax on insurers, for example, is something Jay Rockefeller has endorsed. That might be enough to get Rockefeller's assent, even though Baucus ditched the public plan in order to include a co-op--the idea Kent Conrad, a member of the Gang of Six, has pushed. <br> At that point, the process would move forward, just as it was supposed to move forward before the Finance Committee got stuck. The Senate would have a floor debate, in which the Finance and HELP bills would somehow have to be merged; the House would have its floor debate, based on some amalgam of its three bills (which actually differ very little). If both houses passed a bill--and if the Senate does, the House almost surely will--then a measure would go to conference committee. There, the two chambers would work out a mutually acceptable compromise--and send it back to each chamber for a final vote. <br> That's a lot of deliberation. Liberals would try to improve the bill at every step, whether by adding more financial assistance or a real public plan. And, speaking as a liberal, it'd be great if they could succeed. <br> But if Snowe signs on, according to nearly every person I consulted, it's quite possible the legislation she supports would become the Senate's bill with very little change--and that, in conference, the Senate bill would prevail. She'd hold the leverage, as long as the administration and Democratic leadership prefer to pass pass legislation with 60 votes. And that certainly seems to be the inclination of Obama and his advisors. (It's harder to tell about Congress, particularly the House, but they're unlikely to challenge the White House openly on this.) <br> Unless, of course, it never gets that far. Snowe may not sign on; even if she does, one source close to the process notes, she "may not bring a sufficient number of conservative Democrats" to reach 60. If that happens--if consensus proves elusive, for whatever reason--then Obama and his allies would focus on trying to pass a bill through reconciliation. And they would move quickly. <br> It is, as one senior administration official put it recently to me, a "high-risk-high-reward" strategy. Since reconciliation means passing a bill with just fifty senators supporting it, the group of interests to satisfy becomes narrower--potentially allowing for a bolder, more progressive bill. That's the reward. At the same time, it's risky because of the procedural hurdles. Among other things, Conrad would apparently become the measure's "floor manager," since he's chairman of the Budget Committee. (It's not clear to me what that entails, but, I gather, it's not entirely helpful, given his well-known skepticism about health reform.) <br> But the greatest risk with reconciliation is that the process produces a weak bill, an incomplete one, or, in the very worst case, a counter-productive one--not that it fails to produce any bill at all. The Democratic Party isn't necessarily the bravest. (If it was, it'd have passed reform already.) But it's also not the dumbest. Failing to pass a bill when they have the numbers would be politically suicidal, just like it was in the 1990s. Having committed themselves to passing legislation, they now must follow through. They knew that before August. Knock on wood, they still know it today. <br> By Jonathan Cohn: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 Jonathan Cohn is a senior editor for The New Republic.<hr width="50%">Even before Ted Kennedy lost his battle with brain cancer late last month, Republicans were suggesting that health care reform had suffered in his absence--not because Kennedy was so devoted to the cause, but because he would have cut a deal with the Republicans. "In every case, he fought as hard as he could . . . but, when he recognized that he couldn't get everything he wanted, he could get a good bill by working with the other side," Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said on ABC's "This Week." "If he was here, I don't think we'd be in the mess we're in right now." <br> It's true that Kennedy was the consummate dealmaker. His determination to reach across the aisle reflected, in no small part, his regret over one time he didn't--during the 1970s, when President Richard Nixon put forward a health care reform proposal that Kennedy and his liberal allies rejected as too timid. But the wistfulness for Kennedy's deal-making and, more broadly, his bipartisanship, overlooks a key detail. The deal on health care that almost came together in 1973--like the deals Kennedy later made on No Child Left Behind, immigration reform, and the Medicare drug benefit--involved Republicans who were willing to be part of the reform enterprise. Such Republicans are almost impossible to find today. <br> During the past year, Republicans have frequently said they want to work with Democrats. But the real story of the last few months is how unserious those pledges turned out to be. Although you wouldn't know it from their rhetoric or the media coverage, there are not one but two ostensibly bipartisan proposals out there right now. Either of them could be the template for successful reform if even a few Republicans started pushing them seriously. But, even the ostensibly reasonable Republican senators whom Democrats have tried to engage--Mike Enzi, Charles Grassley, and Hatch--just aren't interested. And it appears they haven't been for a while. <br> Nixon's old proposal--which would have covered nearly all Americans, mostly through private insurance--is a reminder that Republicans haven't always opposed health care reform, sight unseen. And, as recently as a few months ago, at least a handful of Republicans were signaling that they bought into the basic goals of health care reform: expanding insurance coverage substantially, improving the quality of medical care, and curbing the growth in health care expenses. "We're going to make it," Grassley said on CBS's "Face the Nation" in July. "We'll get this done because we're doing it in a bipartisan way." <br> The challenge, or so it seemed, was finding a way to accomplish these goals that meshed with conservative sensibilities. In practical terms, that meant relying heavily on private insurance to bring coverage to the uninsured, much as Nixon had proposed, rather than relying heavily on expanded--or even newly created--public insurance programs. It also meant minimizing taxes on the rich and fostering a sense of individual responsibility.Earlier this year, a group of former Senate majority leaders--Republicans Howard Baker and Bob Dole, along with Democrats Tom Daschle and George Mitchell--showed how that might be accomplished. After negotiating with each other for more than a year, as if they were still in office and representing their two parties, the group (minus Mitchell, who had since joined the administration) unveiled a fully fledged health care reform proposal in June. They released it through the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank they'd establish precisely to advance proposals like these. And, at least on paper, it looked like the kind of scheme members of both parties could support in good conscience. <br> The Center's proposal had the same basic architecture as the plan Obama put forward in his presidential campaign and that congressional committees have been debating this year. Everybody would have to get insurance; in exchange, government would make sure everybody could get insurance, by subsidizing the cost for those who needed financial assistance--and by creating a marketplace in which people without access to employer policies could get coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions. <br> Still, it was hardly everything Obama or the Democrats would have wanted. Instead of a single public-insurance plan into which people could enroll, the Center's proposal would have given states the option of creating independent insurance plans to compete with private insurers; it allowed the federal government to step in with its own plan only if, after five years, there was evidence the system needed more competition. This was an effort to satisfy conservatives, who believe a public plan might drive private insurers out of business and, ultimately, starve doctors and hospitals of necessary resources by underpaying them. <br> The Center's plan included other compromises as well. It expanded Medicaid eligibility to the poverty line but not beyond, while the House bill, in line with liberal expectations, raised eligibility to include people making one-third more than the poverty line. This change helped achieve another major goal: holding down the overall price of reform. All told, the Center's plan called for $1.2 trillion in new government spending--a significant sum, to be sure, but less than initial Democratic proposals, which, according to most outside experts, were likely to cost $1.5 trillion or more. And, again consistent with conservative thinking, the Center did not simply impose new taxes on the wealthy, as both Obama and, later, the House Democrats would. <br> Instead, the Center's proposal would have paid for reform by capping the exclusion on group health benefits, then extracting savings from Medicare and Medicaid. It was, in short, a proposal in which both sides gave ground. "I had a lot of trouble with mandates, just as Tom had trouble with the public plan," Dole said. "But, if we can't compromise, how are you ever going to get a bill passed?" <br> But Baker and Dole's endorsement didn't move the Republican caucus in Congress, which barely acknowledged the Center's proposal. Instead, the Republican leadership continued to oppose Democratic proposals outright, while those few members willing to talk about it kept pressing for plans that would be even less generous--a lot less generous--than what the Center had put forward. Enzi, in particular, wanted to minimize the financial assistance going to people buying insurance through the exchanges. Democrats had hoped to make subsidies available to people making up to four times the poverty line. Enzi proposed making subsidies available only to people making two-and-a-half times the poverty line--or around $55,000 per year for a family of four. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has concluded, "substantial numbers of people with incomes modestly above 300 percent of the poverty line could face difficulty paying the full price of coverage. . . . This could leave the family short of funds for other expenses such as housing and child care." And the $1.2 trillion price tag, the one lower than many Democrats wanted? Republicans have been saying reform can't cost more than $1 trillion--and should probably cost a lot less. <br> Of course, the Center's proposal wasn't a real bill. But the Healthy Americans Act--the bill that Ron Wyden, the Democratic Senator from Oregon, unveiled and began pushing back in late 2006--is real. The Healthy Americans Act is a completely different kind of reform: It would get rid of employer-sponsored insurance as it now exists and move to a system in which virtually everybody would buy coverage on their own--again, through some sort of structured marketplace in which the federal government set standards for benefits, made sure they were available to everybody, and provided subsidies for people who needed them. Although Wyden is a liberal Democrat, he crafted the proposal with Republicans in mind--seeking to reach what he called "a philosophical truce" between left and right. It is still the only proposal on the table that pays for itself within a few years, then starts to show actual savings after that. It would provide coverage entirely through private insurance, eventually folding in parts of Medicaid. And it would do all of this without raising taxes on the wealthy, at least not directly. Money for the program would come primarily from eliminating the existing tax exclusion on group health insurance, so that there would be no new taxes targeting the wealthy explicitly. <br> It was, in many ways, a conservative proposal, as the opposition of prominent liberal groups attested. And Wyden scored an early victory when he secured, as a co-sponsor, Bob Bennett of Utah--a Republican senator with solid conservative bona fides. "It's the right time," Bennett said. "[W]e have a situation in Congress that would lead both parties to want to have a solution." Over the next two years, a handful of additional Republicans agreed to co-sponsor Wyden-Bennett or its mirror version in the House. If Congress was to pass a bipartisan bill, surely, this was the chance.But, presented with that opportunity, Republicans refused it. With one or two exceptions, even the legislators co-sponsoring the measure did not in fact seem to support it. When asked about it, they would inevitably refuse to endorse the particulars and call the proposal--as a spokesperson for GOP <br> Representative Mike Castle did in an interview--"a great conversation starter." And, while Bennett still seems committed to the bill, it's hard to know if that will last. The Club for Growth--a conservative group--began running advertisements in Utah, attacking Bennett for his advocacy of the bill. Bennett, in turn, has recently vowed to "kill" Obamacare, which suggests that combining the bills to produce a true compromise--a possibility others have certainly entertained--is not an option in his mind. <br> The White House and its allies seem to grasp that Republicans (except for Maine Senator Olympia Snowe) just aren't interested in promoting health care reform anymore. After Enzi gave a radio address in which he attacked Democratic health care plans, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters, "I think Senator Enzi's clearly turned over his cards on bipartisanship and decided that it's time to walk away from the table." Gibbs didn't say anything about Grassley. But, after a string of comments attacking Democrats and the revelation that Grassley is now sending fund-raising letters asking for support so he can help defeat the Democratic health care plan, the administration has apparently given up on him, as well. <br> And yet, negotiations will go on, between liberals and those who remain at the table--conservative Democrats, who have their own qualms about the direction reform is headed. One issue is how much to spend on reform--a question that depends on Democrats' willingness to find new revenue, in the form of taxes or savings elsewhere, and on which the plan's ultimate generosity will depend. Another issue, naturally, is the public plan, which more conservative Democrats continue to talk down. Still, these are more differences of degree than of kind. At the end of the day, centrist Democrats may want less-ambitious legislation, but they still want legislation. Given their preferences, it wouldn't be at all surprising if they ended up endorsing--and, finally, enacting--something like the measure Baker and Dole embraced. <br> Which wouldn't be such a bad thing. The Baker-Dole-Daschle proposal still isn't everything liberal Democrats want. But it's far more ambitious than anything than the Enzis of the world would tolerate--and a measure that would accomplish much, if not all, of what liberal Democrats can realistically hope to achieve in the prevailing political environment. In effect, conservative Democrats now occupy the political space that moderate Republicans once did, years ago--a place on the ideological spectrum that tends to look upon government more skeptically, perhaps, but still recognizes its place as a protector of economic security. These are the people with whom Ted Kennedy used to make deals--and with whom liberals can still find common ground, even as they wish today's Republicans good riddance. <br> By Jonathan Cohn: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 Given Mike Enzi's departure from the bipartisan talks and the imminent collapse of the Gang of Six, it looks like there's just one Republican Senator still willing to negotiate seriously with the Democrats-Olympia Snowe. Even if the leadership decides to take a more partisan route for the bill, Snowe is sometimes more liberal than the right flank of the Democratic Party, and her vote could still be critical to reform's survival. But what does she really want out of the current bill? And is she in a place where she can still see eye-to-eye with the Democratic leadership? <br> Over the past few days, I've spoken with close observers of the debate, both on and off the Hill, to get a better sense of Snowe's positions on the key issues that will shape the final Finance Committee bill. Here's the quick rundown on where Snowe appears to stand, based on my reporting so far: <br> -Supports the public plan-but only as a fall-back option. Snowe has essentially maintained the same position that she came to months ago: a government-run insurance plan that would be a fall-back option, only if the reforms to the private insurance industry did not provide adequate savings. This is the "trigger" option has largely fallen to the wayside in the midst of the hysteria over the public plan and the popularity of Kent Conrad's co-op plan. Snowe is continuing to lobby her colleagues to support what she calls a "safety net plan" to avoid the politically combustible association with the liberals' "public plan." <br> -May agree to scale back insurance subsidies, but allows room for negotiation. The Finance Committee has already indicated that they plan to scale back the subsidies to help low-income individuals to buy insurance, providing help to those earning up to 300% above the poverty line, as opposed to the 400% that's in the HELP/House bills. Snowe argues that most of the uninsured fall below the 300% mark, though-according to multiple sources-she believes there are some "unique problems" that those in the 300-400% range face. She is going to continue deliberating ways to help these individuals in negotiations. But it's not clear what those mechanisms might be if Finance isn't willing to budge from the lower figure--and if Snowe's not willing to fight to push it higher: <br> -Wants financing for the bill to come from within the health care system. Snowe apparently wants to finance the bill from "within the health care system," according to one source, and expects much of the savings to come from industry groups and cost-savings measures within the system. But for meaningful reform to happen, more money will probably have to be put on the table--and the means for doing so might not be to Snowe's liking. Back in May, she spoke out against putting a cap on the tax exclusion of employer-sponsored benefits, opposing a significant potential revenue stream for the bill. Altogether, it's still unclear whether she will support taxing individuals-either within or outside the system-to pay for the bill. <br> -Supports a reduction of the minimum benefits that all insurance policies would have to provide.The "actuarial standard" basically means the percentage of medical bills that insurance would have to cover. The HELP bill set this at 75%, while Snowe seems inclined to support something closer to 65%. According to my sources, it's partly because Snowe thinks this is less of a priority for the public-they don't understand this provision very well and are more concerned about, say, the high cost of insurance premiums. And plans that provide fewer benefits are bound to cost less. <br> -Willing to consider having larger businesses participate in the Health Insurance Exchange. Right now, only small businesses would be eligible to participate in the exchange, which could limit its cost-saving potential. Snowe is interested in exploring whether businesses with more than 50 employees could participate--a move that could ultimately strengthen the exchanges by attracting a larger, and more medically diverse, group of people. <br> -Wants to protect older people from undue price discrimination by insurance companies. Right now, insurance companies in certain states charge exorbitantly higher premiums for older patients-the HELP/House bill stipulate that they can only vary by a factor of 2, but Enzi wanted to push it to 5. On this issue, Snowe appears to be on the more liberal end of the spectrum, though she doesn't expect the rating to remain as low as 2. <br> -Opposes reconciliation because of the detrimental impact it would have on reform.It's no surprise that Snowe opposes reconciliation, but her apparent rationale is telling: it's not just because of its political significance, but also because it could only be applied to part of the current bill. Snowe shares the fears of some members of the liberal, pro-reform camp that doing this could significantly curtail the impact of reform. <br> Altogether, these positions put Snowe to the right of many if not most Democrats. But not that far to the right. In other words, she appears to be negotiating in good faith-in other words, her interest in passing reform seems genuine. That sets her apart from the rest of the Republican Caucus-and makes her somebody with whom Democrats can, and should, keep talking. <br> Suzy Khimm is a reporter-researcher at The New Republic. <br> By Suzy Khimm: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic. 
 Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor for National Review. <br>Republicans are looking for a leader. Go to any right-leaning gathering, and at some point the conversation will turn to the party's potential presidential nominee in 2012. Republicans were less consumed by that question in 1993, the first year of the last Democratic presidency. Even when Republicans aren't talking about the 2012 race, they are debating who speaks for the party - sometimes explicitly, as when Rush Limbaugh and Michael Steele feuded this spring. Or they are wondering who will form the next generation of Republican leaders: Eric Cantor? Paul Ryan? <br> The present-day question can be answered simply: The Republican party has no leader. Nobody should be surprised by this fact. A party without the White House and without either chamber of Congress is unlikely to generate an unquestioned leader. To the extent Newt Gingrich overcame those odds in 1993-94, it was because of highly unusual circumstances. He had led the fight against the previous Republican president's tax increase in 1990, that president had lost his reelection campaign, and the party had concluded both that the tax increase was the most important mistake that had led to the defeat and that it was connected to all the other mistakes. <br> Ronald Reagan was to some extent the leader of the party after Gerald Ford's 1976 defeat, although we tend to forget how tough a primary campaign Reagan had to fight in 1980. But he would not have earned that status if he had not challenged Ford in a two-man primary and Ford had not then lost the general election. <br> The present circumstance offers no parallel to either previous set of wilderness years for the Republicans. Nobody ran against Bush in the 2004 primaries, he was reelected, and no single piece of legislation became the organizing principle for an intra-party opposition that ultimately saw its interpretation of events adopted by the party as a whole. Nor did any Republican go mano-a-mano against McCain in 2008. <br> The search for a leader of the party is therefore destined to be fruitless. The party will not have a leader until it has a presidential nominee or has taken control of a chamber of Congress. The good news is that the party doesn't really need leadership. The bad news is that it also doesn't have what it does need: entrepreneurship. <br> The situation was quite different in the late 1970s. In today's highly structured, hierarchical GOP it is hard to believe that a congressman who wasn't in the party's leadership, and wasn't even on the House Ways and Means Committee, could become its chief spokesman on economic policy. Yet Jack Kemp came to fill that role even while rejecting many of the party's existing economic tenets - and even though most of the supply-siders around him lacked formal credentials as economists. <br> Even as late as 1993, the party did not put too much stock in its titular leadership. Bob Michel was, officially, the House minority leader and Bob Dole his Senate counterpart. But it was of course Gingrich who truly led the House Republicans, and such senators as Phil Gramm and Paul Coverdell did more to defeat the Clinton administration's health-care plan than Dole. <br> The current congressional leaders - Mitch McConnell in the Senate, John Boehner in the House - are more aggressive, and probably more capable, than Dole and Michel. Partly as a result, though, backbench Republicans take fewer actions independent of their leaders. Not much seems to happen among House Republicans, for example, that hasn't been coordinated with Boehner's staff. <br> So Republicans have a high degree of unity these days, which has been very helpful in opposing liberal initiatives such as the stimulus and the Democrats' health-care legislation. The downside of that unity is that it is less helpful in generating new ideas, some of which the party will probably need to retake power and will certainly need to exercise it productively. Understandably given their role, the leaders will not embrace an idea unless it has the support of the vast bulk of their followers, or at least does not offend them or compete with their own ideas. But no new idea can pass that test until it gets a thorough airing. Backbenchers can promote those ideas - but only if they are not waiting for someone else to give them direction or, worse, a script. <br> So opportunities for entrepreneurship abound, unseized. There is no shortage of potentially popular conservative causes. But where is the backbench congressman who will devote himself to publicizing our elite universities' shameful treatment of ROTC programs? Who has the moxie to try to revolutionize the party's economic platform by offering a pro-family tax reform? What congressman was willing not only to oppose the bailout of Detroit but to advocate that our carmakers instead be released from fuel-economy regulations? Republicans have pounced on the many signs that the Obama administration is distancing itself from Israel. But one could make the case that it has systematically been devaluing our alliances, including our old ones with Britain and Japan and our new one with India. Will anyone make that case? <br> Among the possible explanations for the decline in entrepreneurship, four stand out. The first has to do with the general tendency of a party to fall in line behind a president who belongs to it. For eight years, the congressional party's agenda was whatever President Bush said it was. That wasn't the case in 1993, since a lot of congressmen had stopped identifying with the first President Bush even before he left office; and it wasn't the case in the late 1970s, since the long-out-of-power congressional GOP had no agenda and wasn't expected to have one. This time there is a habit that has to be unlearnt. <br> The second is that changes in the way campaigns are financed have changed the psychology of politicians. It has often been observed that Reagan's campaign for governor of California in 1966, and Eugene McCarthy's for president in 1968, would have been impossible under the current campaign-finance laws. A small number of rich people who believed passionately in something had the power to shake up politics; perhaps that ability has been sacrificed to a spurious equality. <br> The increasing sophistication of gerrymandering may also be partly to blame. (That's my third culprit, if you're counting.) In conversation, Bill Kristol recently described Republican congressmen as exhibiting "a curious mix of dogmatism and timidity." The districts most of them represent encourage both traits. They are packed with conservatives, thus simultaneously reducing conservatives' influence in other districts and relieving the congressmen of any need to learn how to appeal to non-conservatives in order to win and keep their seats. This latter effect could be expected to yield a certain lockstep conformity rather than creativity. <br> Conservatives have generally resisted the idea of letting nonpartisan commissions draw district lines according to some formula, thinking it a close cousin to campaign-finance regulation and, even more, fearing that it would reduce the number of hard-core conservative congressmen. There are limits to what such a reform could achieve, given that liberals and conservatives over the last generation have tended to move to different neighborhoods and states. But perhaps conservatives should rethink their position on the policy question. <br> On the other hand, the Republican governors, who provided the party with many of its most successful policy initiatives in the 1990s, do not seem to be brimming with ideas either, with a few exceptions. Gerrymandering cannot explain their passivity. <br> A final possibility is that the supply of entrepreneurship has fallen because the demand has. Most conservatives have concluded that Republicans fell from power because they fell from grace. Rightworld these days places a considerably higher priority on the maintenance of principles than on finding new ways to apply them. The example of the reigning Democrats, who regained power without coming up with any new ideas, strengthens this inclination. <br> So we have come to this sorry pass: The party that gives political expression to America's entrepreneurial class has within its number few political entrepreneurs. What Republicans celebrate they do not, alas, exemplify. <br> By Ramesh PonnuroReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 Dr. Ted R. Bromund is the Margaret Thatcher Senior Research Fellow in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom in the Heritage Foundation. This article is published under his own name. <br>Daniel Hannan is in trouble. The young Tory European MP, who became a YouTube sensation earlier this year for his denunciation of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as the "devalued prime minister of a devalued government," has made what can in politics be a serious error: he has challenged orthodoxy in a way that is both substantive and interesting. Boring substantive challenges can be seen off, and soaring rhetoric that says nothing is the stuff of politics, but having a point and knowing how to make it will always raise bellows from the defenders of the gored sacred cow. <br> The curious thing in this instance is who is doing the bellowing. Hannan has achieved the impossible: he's brought Gordon Brown's backers and the Conservative Party into harmony. Health Secretary Andy Burnham described Hannan as "unpatriotic": it's curious how dissent is only the highest form of patriotism when it comes from the left. Lord Peter Mandelson, the First Secretary of State, claimed that the British people would find Hannan's remarks "shocking." If so, they must have very short memories or very low standards: Mandelson, known as the "Prince of Darkness," has been forced out of the government twice in the past eleven years on ethics charges. For his part, David Cameron, the Leader of the Conservative Party, described Hannan as an eccentric, and the Leader of the Conservative group in the European Parliament, Timothy Kirkhope told the BBC that Hannan should be disciplined for his comments. <br> Hannan's error was to step boldly and simultaneously into two ongoing battles, with the result that he was hit by the cross-fire. The battle in the U.S., to which Hannan thought he was contributing, is the one over health care. Hannan is a vehement opponent of Britain's National Health Service - which he describes as a "60-year failure" that he "wouldn't wish on anybody" - and a supporter of U.S.-style health savings accounts. As the NHS is the single-payer system to end all single-payer systems, and as it is one of the two foreign health care systems that Americans have heard of - the other being Canada's - its deficiencies are potent fodder for opponents of what President Obama is pleased to call health care 'reform' in the U.S. <br> The other battle is the one in Britain between the Tories and Labor. There, both parties are competing for the title of who can praise the NHS the loudest. Brown's claim is strong: he has increased spending on health care since 1999/00 by over 50% in real terms. The results, charitably, have been modest: much of the increased spending has been swallowed up by cost pressures and the advancing bureaucratic legions inside the system. Britain's Office of National Statistics has found that productivity across government as a whole slumped as more money was spent: as the NHS got an outsized budget boost, it turned in a particularly dismal performance. Labor's error was to believe its own propaganda that the NHS was suffering from heartless Tory budget cuts, and that the solution was more money combined with more top-down control. The latter absorbed the former, and by the end of his tenure in Downing Street, Tony Blair was returning to Tory-style reforms in an effort to contain the exploding costs. <br> It's those costs, and the lingering potency of the claim that the Tories want to destroy the NHS, that gave the Conservatives both their political opportunity and their political strategy. After the Conservatives lost the 2005 election under the leadership of Michael Howard, Cameron concluded that the Tories had to return to the legacy of One Nation Conservatism that exemplified the career of Harold Macmillan and, in his post-war tenure, Winston Churchill. The essence of One Nation Conservatism, at least after 1945, was its unwillingness to fundamentally challenge to the post-war domestic status quo established by Labor. <br> In the end, that was what destroyed it. The post-war world was not forever, and many policies that seemed correct - or at least sustainable - in the two decades after 1945 had become dangerous irrelevancies by 1979. Appropriately, Macmillan ended his career as a bitter critic of Margaret Thatcher's denationalizations, as if the tattered and ineptly run industries the British government clung to were really the valuable family heirlooms of his imagination. <br> The new One Nation vision substitutes New Labor for the Labor Party of the post-1945 era. The problem is that, so far, it has not addressed the actual deficiencies in New Labor's agenda, just as post-war conservatism proved unable to take Labor's program and make it work. The problem with the nationalized industries, for example, was simply that they were expected to provide more public services - in particular, jobs for union members - than their steadily shrinking productivity could justify. The NHS faced the same dilemma from the very beginning: the British public then, like a substantial part of the American public today, wanted to consume more health than it was willing to pay for. The NHS was launched in 1948 by proposals which estimated it would cost 145 million pounds per year. By the end of the first eight months, the NHS's annual cost was 295 million pounds. By mid-1950, experts were anticipating that the bill for 1950-1 would be 426 million pounds. <br> From the start, the NHS was thus pulled terribly and constantly in two directions at once: it had destroyed the variegated system of charities and insurance schemes that the continent's post-war systems, by contrast, sought to supplement, so it had to pay for everything. But somehow it had to constrain costs too. In 1951, the creator of the NHS, Aneurin Bevan, resigned from his position as Minister of Labor when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Gaitskell, introduced prescription charges for glasses and dental care. According to Bevan, this violated the essence of the system, which was that it was free: "A free health service is pure Socialism and as such it is opposed to the hedonism of capitalist society." Or, as he put it in his speech to the Labor Party in 1943, the welfare state was "a social experiment" that would allow Britain to "assert a moral leadership which will have consequences in every sphere of her activities." <br> Of course, the service was not genuinely free: nothing of value is. Free, in this context, was just a synonym for a grant from the Exchequer paid out of general taxation. But for Bevan, using the power of the state to tax money away from the men and women who had earned it had a morality that actually earning money in the first place could never possess. The crucial consideration to him was that, once the NHS was in place, the old shame inherent in accepting public handouts would be abolished, because everyone - bared from the hedonistic pleasure inherent in writing a check to the doctor - would now be a client of the state. <br> But Bevan's belief that free service at the point of delivery was a matter not so much of bodily health but of moral purity exercised a continuing and malevolent influence. By turning the NHS into something resembling a religion for milk and water Marxists - which is not an unfair description of Bevan's political sensibilities - and by crushing the old system beneath the iron but faltering wheels of progress, Bevan at once committed Britain to a single payer system and made criticizing it a form of political heresy. All Gordon Brown did was to take advantage of what appeared to be one of the most prosperous periods in modern British history to remedy the deficiency that had vexed Bevan: the system could never get enough money. <br> As it turned out, it still can't: even as Brown blew the doors of the Treasury to pump money into the NHS, private spending on health care in Britain - there is some, in spite of the existence of the NHS - has remained steady at 1.4% of GDP. No amount of public spending appears to be sufficient to meet all needs, or to satiate the public's demand for better health, a lesson that the U.S. might take usefully to heart. The idea that instituting a British-style system in the U.S. will save money relies on the premise that Americans could be restrained from spending their own money on their own health, and would be willing to accept British levels of government-provided care. Any politician who really believes this is welcome to test the validity of their belief at the ballot box. <br> Indeed, Britain spends less on health than the U.S. precisely because, like any basically single payer system, the NHS ultimately has to ration what it provides to take account of the public's unwillingness to pay higher taxes, a reality that accounts for many of the NHS's failures and horror stories. The NHS's defenders have the difficult job of protecting it from the reality that Britain is no longer dominated by the old cloth-cap class system that made it so appealing in 1948: the NHS is a top-down system trying to get by in a bottom-up age. But that has not prevented British politicians on all sides from promising to try even harder and attacking the littleness of their opponents' vision. That is why Brown delights in Hannan's remarks, which give him the opportunity to demand that even meeting with foreign critics of the NHS be ruled out of bounds by all parties, and to play the old 'Tory spending cuts' card. This blissfully ignores the reality that his own Treasury has forecast massive spending cuts after he wins the next election - however unlikely that eventuality now appears - which implies that even a future Labor Prime Minister would have to continue the ceaseless struggle to reduce the cost pressures in the NHS. <br> The Conservatives, for their part, worry that Hannan's words will hurt them politically because, as part of their effort to compete with Brown, they have promised to ring-fence the NHS's budget when they win. This creates a tricky dilemma, because in 2007/8 spending on health (at 92.2 billion pounds) was almost 30% of the budget. It will not be easy to come close to balancing the budget - never mind achieving the surplus that Brown used to aspire to in good times - after declaring a third of spending off limits. The Conservatives are following the strategy that Blair pioneered in the mid-1990s: seize the opportunity of the recession to talk about the budget cuts that the government plans to inflict, emphasize the danger to public services, look askance at tax increases, and remain vague about how that circle can be squared. The difference is that Blair benefited from sound Tory stewardship of the economy before 1997: Cameron is not going to be so lucky. He has achieved a virtual political miracle in bringing the Tory Party back from the brink: now he will need to follow that up with a fiscal hole in one. <br> What does all this have to do with the health of ordinary Britons and Americans? Not much. Life expectancies in Britain keep on rising, just as they did before Brown's spending spree. The majority of uninsured Americans, whose numbers are usually exaggerated, have either decided that health insurance is a waste of their money, or rely on free emergency room care. The former strikes me, personally, as insane, and the latter is undeniably inefficient, but the supposed money-saving alternative of preventive care usually leads, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office testified last week, to higher, not lower, spending. By moving the U.S. towards a single-payer system under the guise of the public option, Obama is heading in the direction of the British system, at precisely the moment when that system, after an unprecedented injection of taxpayer money, has failed to deliver the promised results. <br> But then the left's demand for the single-payer system in the U.S. is not about health. It is, as it was for Bevan in 1948, about a vision of social morality, which accounts for the eagerness with which its supporters stigmatize their opponents as unpatriotic and evil. That's a curious basis, even an unhealthy one, on which to build a health care system, which one might suppose should be judged on its results. But it's an even unhealthier basis for a political system. There is no surer guarantee of fossilization, and eventual irrelevancy, than mistaking particular policies, which need to change, for immutable principles, which need not. If the British people cannot grasp the difference, Dan Hannan will be the least of their troubles. <br> By Ted R. BromundReprinted with permission from The New Ledger 
 Reihan Salam is a fellow at the New America Foundation. He is the co-author, with Ross Douthat, of Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.<hr width="50%">Why are Republicans rushing to oppose co-ops? In the New York Times, Robert Pear and Gardiner Harris describe the vagueness of the various co-op proposal floating around the moment before ending on a discouraging note. <br> "Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said he saw the differences as more semantic than substantive. "You can call it a co-op, which is another way of saying a government plan," Mr. Hatch said." <br> But is this a fair characterization? Mark Schmitt, editor of The American Prospect, has written a useful primer on the evolution of the public option, which has its intellectual origins in Jacob Hacker's Medicare Plus proposal. Schmitt, writing from a left-of-center perspective, notes the following:"One key player was Roger Hickey of the Campaign for America's Future. Hickey took UC Berkley health care expert Jacob Hacker's idea for "a new public insurance pool modeled after Medicare" and went around to the community of single-payer advocates, making the case that this limited "public option" was the best they could hope for. Ideally, it would someday magically turn into single-payer. And then Hickey went to all the presidential candidates, acknowledging that politically, they couldn't support single-payer, but that the "public option" would attract a real progressive constituency." <br> This explains why many on the left are so disappointed by the apparent death of the public option. (Let me stress that I'm convinced that the White House fully intends to resurrect the public option.) Schmitt continues: <br> "But the downside is that the political process turns out to be as resistant to stealth single-payer as it is to plain-old single-payer. If there is a public plan, it certainly won't be the kind of deal that could "become the dominant player." So now this energetic, well-funded group of progressives is fired up to defend something fairly complex and not necessarily essential to health reform. (Or, put another way, there are plenty of bad versions of a public plan.) The symbolic intensity is hard for others to understand. But the intensity is understandable if you recognize that this is what they gave up single-payer for, so they want to win at least that much." <br> Indeed, Schmitt goes on to describe the public option as "stealth single-payer." He suggests - rightly, I think - that the Democratic left might have been smarter to have simply pushed a "Medicare for All" proposal. As Ramesh has argued, a key problem with the Obamacare effort has been the increasingly pervasive sense that the White House isn't leveling with the public. By simply calling for single-payer and, say, backing a tax hike on the rich, the Democrats could have set a new, and possibly quite popular, leftward benchmark. Unfortunately for the Democrats, President Obama failed to recognize that the promise of painless reform <br> Co-ops, in contrast, point in a very different direction. When Arnold Schwarzenegger - not a popular governor around these parts, I realize - called for a statewide healthcare reform, he tried to address "medical loss ratios," the share of premiums spent on medical care rather than administration or profits. He wanted to mandate that all insurers maintain MLRs of 85 percent or higher. MLRs for for-profit insurers tend to be in the neighborhood of 80 percent. This isn't a smart idea for a lot of reasons: the MLR is an artifact of accounting, and setting a rigid requirement will prompt little more than creative accounting. Yet it reflects a basic anxiety: do private insurers have the right incentives? <br> In Paul Krugman's latest column, he talks up Switzerland's 1994 healthcare reform. <br> "Switzerland offers the clearest example: everyone is required to buy insurance, insurers can't discriminate based on medical history or pre-existing conditions, and lower-income citizens get government help in paying for their policies." <br> Like the United States, Switzerland used to have a lot of for-profit health insurance firms. After the reform, insurers were obligated to offer health insurance plans on a non-profit basis. They can offer other insurance policies on a for-profit basis, and offering supplemental coverage has been a big source of growth for them. The vast majority of universal health systems built around private insurers have a similar non-profit requirement. The United States is definitely the outlier here. <br> The Democrats presented the public option as a matter of choice. Why not let consumers choose a leaner, more efficient system? But as Gregory Mankiw has observed, a public provider is fundamentally different from a private provider: it can't really go out of business. <br> "Even if one accepts the president's broader goals of wider access to health care and cost containment, his economic logic regarding the public option is hard to follow. Consumer choice and honest competition are indeed the foundation of a successful market system, but they are usually achieved without a public provider. We don't need government-run grocery stores or government-run gas stations to ensure that Americans can buy food and fuel at reasonable prices." <br> "An important question about any public provider of health insurance is whether it would have access to taxpayer funds. If not, the public plan would have to stand on its own financially, as private plans do, covering all expenses with premiums from those who signed up for it." <br> "But if such a plan were desirable and feasible, nothing would stop someone from setting it up right now. In essence, a public plan without taxpayer support would be yet another nonprofit company offering health insurance." <br> The case for co-ops is simple: we don't have enough non-profit insurers. Let's encourage the creation of more of them. This might be wrong. But the potential upside is considerable and the potential downside is negligible. Bitter opposition to the idea suggests that the right is needlessly hostile to reform. <br> By Reihan SalamReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 John B. Judis is a senior editor at The New Republic and a visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. <br>The Obama administration is increasingly being compared to the Carter and Clinton administrations--and the comparisons are not meant to be favorable. Both of those earlier administrations stumbled seriously during their first two years, with dire consequences for their legislative agenda and for their party. <br> I expect, and hope, that Barack Obama will avoid this fate. Obama has surrounded himself with people far more savvy in the ways of Washington than Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton initially did. (You get bonus points for remembering the name of Clinton's first chief of staff.) Obama has certainly learned from their failures, and so have the Democrats in Congress, who under Nancy Pelosi have a tougher and more capable leader than the Democrats had in 1993. Still, there is a similarity between the two past administrations and the Obama administration that could signal trouble ahead. <br> Each of these administrations came into office, along with Democratic majorities in Congress, pledging to pass legislation that would affect the distribution of wealth and (even more important) power between the corporate/financial sector and the rest of America. The Democratic administrations championed what you could call "class legislation," and by doing so, they set off a class struggle that they lost. <br> Here is a rundown of some of the class legislation that the prior administrations sponsored. Carter and the Democrats favored redistributive tax reform, public campaign financing, a consumer protection agency (that Ralph Nader had long championed), and labor law reform. Clinton and the Democrats had a shorter list of this kind of legislation. It included increased funding for regulatory agencies and limits on executive compensation--but right at the top was national health insurance reform. Clinton's health bill would have benefited some corporations, but it would have curtailed the prerogatives and very possibly the profits of private insurance companies, and it would have forced large companies that didn't offer health insurance to do so. <br> A powerful new coalition of Republican conservatives and business groups, including the newly formed Business Roundtable, opposed Carter's measures. As I described in my book, The Paradox of American Democracy, they brought pressure not only on politicians, but also on the media, including The Washington Post, which reversed its support for the consumer protection agency. Carter got none of this legislation through Congress. And in 1978, the weakened Democrats performed poorly at the polls, setting the stage for the rout of 1980. <br> Clinton didn't fare much better. He got some of his regulatory funding increases through Congress, but they were rescinded by the Republicans who took over Congress in November 1994. Most importantly, the Republican-business coalition that had destroyed Carter's agenda made sure that Clinton's health care bill never even made it to the floor for a vote. Clinton was re-elected in 1996, but it was a different Bill Clinton. Chastened by defeat, he moved to the "center," which in this case meant that he did not offer any legislation that threatened people and companies at the pinnacles of power. <br> The Obama administration has already had its share of legislative successes. But these successes, such as the passage of the stimulus program, have not included legislation that threatens class power and wealth. Those bills that do threaten class relations--the administration's proposals for health care reform, executive compensation limits, and financial regulation--are now bottled up in Congress. Another bill, the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have benefited labor unions, seems to have been shelved. <br> The Republican-business coalition, led by the American Bankers' Association and the Financial Services Roundtable (which includes 92 corporations with $16 trillion in assets), has taken aim at efforts to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, while the Business Roundtable is leading the fight against regulations that would limit executive compensation. The way they see it, these are provisions designed to curb their power and profits. A similar coalition, including insurance companies, hospitals, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has taken aim at those parts of the health care bill, particularly the public option, that would potentially limit business's powers. <br> Of course, there is nothing intrinsically meritorious about this kind of power-shifting legislation. It wouldn't make sense, for instance, for the government to nationalize the major computer software firms in the country rather than ensuring that private competition prevails among them. But health care and finance are two industries that have seen private competition and self-regulation fail miserably in achieving results that benefit the public interest. It's necessary for the government, acting on the public's behalf, to step in. <br> Obama and the Democratic leadership in Congress seem to understand this. They have already succeeded in doing one thing Carter and Clinton failed to do: divide the ranks of their potential opponents. Obama's health bill generally enjoys some support from the American Medical Association and the drug company lobby, while his financial consumer protection agency is backed by an investors' coalition. And a few Republican senators seem ready to back some kind of health care legislation. <br> The real danger may be that Obama and the Democrats, particularly in the Senate, will get weak-kneed in the face of the Republican-business coalition and settle--either for health care legislation that increases subsidies, but doesn't rein in the insurance companies (which is what Clinton and the Democrats did after 1994), or for financial regulation that ostensibly imposes new rules, but doesn't strengthen the public's ability to enforce them. A case in point: the administration's proposal that asks the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the rating agencies more closely, but does not alter the fact that the SEC is funded by the very banks whose securities they are supposed to evaluate. <br> Obama has a difficult task ahead of him. The last time Congress passed and a president signed legislation that significantly limited the power of businesses and banks occurred during Richard Nixon's first term, when a host of regulatory agencies were formed. Nixon, of course, was no liberal. But the country was in an uproar, and a coalition of labor, consumers, and the New Left was able to defeat the business opposition. Soon afterwards, business and Republicans joined hands to block any future efforts along these lines. And this coalition has carried the day for over three decades. Can Obama succeed where Carter and Clinton failed? Or will he listen to the sirens of the op-ed pages who urge him to move to the center and avoid the class struggle? <br> By John B.

 Brad Jackson writes for The New Ledger.<hr width="50%">There are a whopping 1189 days until the 2012 election, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the moves of GOP presidential hopefuls. Tim Pawlenty, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Palin and other Republicans looking to oust Barack Obama are already lining up staff, raising money, building networks of supporters, and helping fellow politicians as they lay the groundwork for the next battle for the White House. In fact, you have to look no further than the hottest policy issue of the moment - healthcare reform - for signs of the early struggle for Republican constituencies. <br> This week, Pawlenty and Romney fought over the best method for reforming our nation's healthcare system, each presenting competing ideas, each taking a slight swipe at the other along the way. Pawlenty, the outgoing Governor of Minnesota, trumpeted his state's plan where state employees, "can choose any clinic available to them in the health-care network they've selected," of course those options that are more costly incur higher out of pocket expenses. He also took a stab at Romney's home state of Massachusetts where the former Governor enacted a state-wide insurance system aimed at covering nearly every citizen. A side effect of this plan has been rapidly rising costs of care in the Bay State, costs that Pawlenty pointed out, mean increased fees and taxes. The Minnesota Governor asked in a Washington Post Op-Ed piece, "Imagine the scope of tax increases, or additional deficit spending, if that approach is utilized for the entire country." <br> Not to be outdone, Romney responded in his own Op-Ed in USA Today where he insisted that President Obama must "dump the public option." The former Governor also countered Pawlenty's accusations of high cost overruns in the Massachusetts plan saying that the state's costs were "pretty much on target." <br> Both men are seeking to inject themselves into the nation's heated healthcare debate to garner attention, and establish themselves as credible sources on this issue well before they have to argue and debate it in 2012 primary debates. <br> Romney has something on his side that Pawlenty does not - name recognition. In spite of his defeat in the 2008 Republican primary to John McCain, Mitt Romney has remained quite popular in Republican circles, speaking to a raucous crowd at CPAC in February and even winning the organizations straw poll for 2012. American Conservative Union chairman David Keene referred to Romney as "one of us" at his CPAC introduction, something that may have been impossible to fathom during a presidential campaign where GOP competitors rolled out YouTube moment after YouTube moment of Romney flip-flopping on issues espoused in earlier campaigns for public office. The former Governor's message that February day was one conservatives to latch on to in the days just after Obama's inauguration: fiscal restraint, America first, and local control. Railing against the early plans for healthcare reform, and imploring Washington to provide a big tax cut for middle income Americans, Romney took the plurality of the votes, winning the straw poll for 2012 ahead of other possible contenders like Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, Mike Huckabee and even Pawlenty. <br> Recent polling shows that Republicans have, unsurprisingly, not yet settled on a favorite. A Gallup poll just a few weeks ago, home of the nation's first caucuses, just about 30 months away, showed Romney leading Palin by five-points, 26 - 21 percent, with former Arkansas Governor and current Fox News host Mike Huckabee in third with 19 percent of the vote. A broader poll done by the Washington Post and ABC News found Huckabee ahead 26 - 21 over Romney with Palin and Gingrich nipping at their heals. <br> One key factor in the 2012 race that may go unnoticed though is the help that these potential candidates offer to other politicians on the ballot in next year's 2010 elections. Palin, a rock star on the road in 2008 who drew thousands at rallies, has been a much-sought after fundraiser for races across the country. For Congressman, Governors, even those running for State House or State Senate, many conservative Republicans are hoping to get a boost from the Palin effect by having the popular former Governor, who has battled with the liberal media lately, into their state or their district for big and small dollar fundraisers. Palin's ability to garner good will from these candidates and their voters will be invaluable should she come calling a year or so later as her potential campaign for the White House was kicking into high gear. <br> Palin, Romney, Huckabee and others will use many of the pivotal races next year as a chance to up their name recognition among party leaders in states like Texas where there is both a hotly contested GOP primary for Governor and, soon enough, an open Senate seat. Texas is fertile ground for any Republican looking to run nationally, having provided more than $30 million to GOP presidential candidates alone in 2008. Palin has already announced her endorsement of Texas Governor Rick Perry in his primary battle with sitting U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, and is "committed to campaigning" for his re-election bid. These campaign stops will allow the former Alaska Governor to make in-roads with Texas grassroots leaders, state Republican organizations, and most importantly - big dollar donors in the Lone Star State. <br> Look for other aspiring GOPers to follow suit in other state with big 2010 races like Florida, California and Ohio- - all sources of tens of millions in potential campaign donations and growing networks of supporters and grassroots volunteers. Each of the major Republican presidential players don't just work the country raising money for others though, they also seek to fill the tills of their own campaign coffers. Palin has reportedly raised more than $900,000 for her SarahPAC so far in 2009, which is still far behind the more than $1.6 million that Romney has brought in during the same time period. Huckabee trails with just over $300,000 in the bank at this point - and frankly, the organization he's building shows signs of major weakness at this point. One interesting item to watch on Palin's fundraising though is that a surprising 60% of her contributions came in amounts less than $200. That's a good sign as it means she has a broader base of low-dollar donors who she can return to time and time again, a strategy exploited to excellent effect by President Obama his 2008 campaign. <br> Of course, all these early predictions for a race this far out should be tempered. At this point before the 2008 election Obama wasn't even showing up in polls for the Democratic nomination, and Rudy Giuliani was leading the Republican polls. Both campaigns clearly had a long way to go at that point, one a long way down, and the other all the up to the White House. <br> As you begin to see the 2010 campaigns kick into high gear after Labor Day with growing amounts of mail, email, phone calls and yes, even TV commercials, keep a close eye on which 2012 hopefuls are backing your candidate for Governor or Senator, or which ones appear on Meet the Press or Fox News Sunday. Even though we are 1189 days away from that 2012 election, right now the groundwork is being laid for an arduous race to come. <br> Editor's Note: An earlier version incorrectly referred to this Gallup poll as being of Iowans.

 Michael Novak's latest book is No One Sees God.<hr width="50%">After six months in the Oval Office, Pres. Barack Obama has a lower job-approval rating than did ten of the last twelve presidents at the same point in their presidencies. Rasmussen reports that the daily tracking poll of the president's popular standing shows eleven points negative: Twenty-eight percent "strongly approve" and 39 percent "strongly disapprove." <br> The support for his signature issue, health-care "reform," is falling by the day. The more that Americans learn about it, the more revulsion they feel against it. His big stimulus bill has not delivered what he said it would. A giveaway stimulus is the Democrats' usual alternative to tax cuts, on the theory of "increase demand" as opposed to "increase supply." Unemployment in a few important states has now soared to 17 percent, and nationally it has risen close to 10 percent. <br> Further, while Obama still ranks high in personal popularity, his numbers have fallen from percentages in the high 60s down to the low 50s, and are still dropping. His policies are much disliked: unimaginably high deficits, ever-greater state controls over industry after industry, a certain preference for raw leftist ideology over the needs and feelings of ordinary people. <br> For instance, Obama showed a cool insouciance recently in telling a televised citizens' forum that some older patients must hereafter consider whether the health care they are now receiving is really helping them, and perhaps begin to reconcile themselves to giving it up. This means condemning themselves to an earlier and perhaps more painful death. Is complete government control, even of the time of death, supposed to be "reform"? <br> In a recent dust-up between an African-American Harvard professor and a local Irish-American policeman (of high reputation), Obama made the foolish mistake in a press conference of defending his "friend," the black professor, and calling the local police (in the person of this one cop) "stupid." <br> The great class division in American life is no longer between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat (since there is no longer any proletariat, only one huge middle class). It is now between the highly educated elite and the ordinary people of family and neighborhood and common work. So, in calling the cop stupid, Obama pulled the veil back on his own Harvard arrogance. A huge public outcry forced him to step back and telephone both men in order to make peace. To make himself seem like an ordinary guy (the cop, not the professor), he even invited both men to the White House to have "a beer." Too late! This sudden flash of self-revelation about his own class consciousness was exactly what everyone had suspected for some time. <br> It was the sergeant who suggested having a beer together (not wine and cheese), and he was the coolest of the three in ordering a Blue Moon. (Blue is the color of cops, and Moon is real, real cool.) I gave the first two rounds to him. Then, in the third round, watching his dignity and unblinking integrity (with the strength of tens of thousands of policemen standing behind him), I gave him round three running away. <br> This iron-jawed Sergeant Crowley is the man they called racist and hotheaded and stupid. They got the wrong man. They made the wrong charge. The president and the professor came out of this with lower universal esteem, the sergeant with higher, far higher. <br> Thus, once again, below the president's honeyed, highfalutin ways of speaking, there is revealed a pretension that is becoming insufferable, a sense of moral and class superiority in office, which he has not yet earned. Moreover, when he is on his own, without speechwriters, Obama is surprisingly unimpressive. He is rambling, fairly boring, error-prone, evasive, and not well-informed. <br> In addition, President Obama seems to be unable to admit error, to apologize, or to voice what all can see to be true. "Calibrated" is a word he often hides behind, as when he brushed off his insulting remark about the Cambridge policeman - as if he, President Obama, did not use an inexcusable insult. No, the president's words were wrong, not just imprecisely "calibrated." Try to figure out the correct calibration of "stupid." <br> President Obama no longer persuades. <br> By Michael NovakReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 Leslie Savan is the author of Slam Dunks And No-Brainers: Pop Language in Your Life, the Media, and, Like...Whatever and The Sponsored Life: Ads, TV, and American Culture. <br>It'd be nice to think that the recent surge in overtly racist rhetoric on the right has been a case of random opportunism, provoked by the coincidence of a wealthy black Harvard professor yelling at a white cop who arrested him in his own home. Like, who could've predicted that the professor would be a friend of the Harvard law school graduate who is president, or that president would then say on camera that the cops acted "stupidly"? Or that the incident would happen just as Congress was going into a clinch over health care reform? <br> The Henry Louis Gates imbroglio did come out of nowhere, and it did give President Obama's opponents a chance to howl about the onerous burdens "reverse racism" puts on the fading white majority in this country. You may not see how that justifies the big-time bigotry that took over the discourse last week, but hey, it's a white thang: There were Birthers insisting that Obama's presidency is illegitimate because he was "born in Kenya"; CNN's Lou Dobbs trying to legitimize the Birthers, and of course, an angry Rush Limbaugh fuming that Obama "is an angry black man." None of them, however, could hold a fuse next to Glenn Beck, who asserted that the biracial POTUS is a "racist" who has "a deep-seated hatred of white people," something so unhinged that even the Brown-Haired-Guy-Who's-Not-Steve-Doocy (the Fox Friends cohost who had to apologize a couple weeks ago for blurting that Swedes and "other ethnics" are different "species") called him on it. <object width="425" height="344"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Xyj1DSEQuy0color1=0xb1b1b1color2=0xcfcfcfhl=enfeature=player_embeddedfs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="425" height="344"></object>It's not only angry white male pundits who are waving the white victimhood flag. It's also the chair of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who last Thursday called the kettle dusky by excoriating Democrats who've defended Sonia Sotomayor for "giving cover to groups and individuals to nurture racial grievances for political advantage." <br> With every passing day it gets harder to think of this sudden dialing-up of whiny hate speech as sheer coincidence. Instead, it's beginning to look inevitable--so much so that maybe the real question is, What is it about health care that brings out the latent racism in the GOP? <br> The answer is simple: For two or three generations, Republicans have defeated progressive reform of the health care system by hinting that it would mean redistributing wealth from whites to blacks. As Beck himself said, practically redefining "welfare queen" as "healthcare queen": "Everything that is getting pushed through Congress, including this health care bill, are transforming America, and they're all driven by President Obama's thinking on one idea: reparations." <br> Nevertheless, when we see that Obama's poll numbers have dropped back to the margin of victory he had in the election and have even gone underwater on his handling of health care, it really shouldn't make us give up on the prospect of reform. <br> Sure, Professor Gates's run-in with Cambridge's Finest wasn't planned, any more than the rump rebellion at GOP Rep. Mike Castle's townhall meeting about health care by a Delaware chapter of the Birthers (video of which catapulted the loonies to national prominence) was. There was no "conspiracy" linking those two events, but the mainstream media quite predictably chose to make them headliners, all but obliterating detailed discussion of health care reform for more than two weeks (and this just when the subject was beginning to resurface after the blanket coverage of Michael Jackson's and Sarah Palin's exits). <br> The news media could have instead been running, say, commentary about Michael Moore's Sicko, like the interview Bill Moyers did with CIGNA's former PR chief just two weeks ago; or they could have aired footage of the uninsured being wheeled out onto the sidewalk outside hospitals to "walk it off." That they didn't isn't a conspiracy, either--I mean, those endless ads for "purple pills" and aphrodisiacs on the evening news are just the way capitalism works, and don't necessarily mean that Big Pharma has already paid for that microphone. Right? <br> The Obama people are always talking about how they don't want the perfect to become the enemy of the good, and that often seems to suggest that they have no notion of the bad and the ugly. In fact, they were exquisitely attuned to the American racial divide, at least during the campaign. Obama's nomination was a way of calling the bluff behind the GOP's Southern Strategy--it forced this sort of overt racism out into the open, where before it was always cloaked behind anti-tax or anti-welfare rhetoric, and that exposure helped split the Republican coalition. The Daily Kos/Research 2000 poll showing that 58 percent of Republicans either don't believe Obama was born in the U.S. or aren't sure (compared to 7 percent for Dems and 17 for independents), confirms Bill Maher's formulation: Not all Republicans are racist, but if you are a racist these days, you're probably a Republican. <br> Who knows where it will end up, but the not-terrible news right now is that there seems to have been just enough of a demographic shift toward racial equality in America to pass Obama's own middling approach to health care reform, as furthered watered down as it will likely be. After all, the Medicare bill passed by Lyndon Johnson in 1965 is not the program we have today; there have been 44 years of amendments, fill-ins, and gap coverages that have created the best-loved insurance program in America. The kinds of arguments Obama has to sell are hard to make: his health care plan is by definition a Trojan horse, a gradual glide toward guaranteed care that will take several more years (at least) of handing out emergency room addresses to the poor, unemployed, and unlucky before it really kicks in. Arguing that we have to settle for something less than a single-payer system like those in every other advanced industrial country can seem rhetorically dishonest, or at least lame--and people are starting to distrust Obama's ability to discipline the Dems and get it done. <br> But watching the Republican Party morph into the National Association for the Advancement of White People should give us all hope, not despair: Anything that brings 'em out of the closet and gets 'em running naked through the streets shouting, "I'm the victim here, dammit!" will only ensure their minority status over the long run. <br> By Leslie Savan: Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Christopher Hayes is The Nation's Washington, DC Editor. <br>As I write, the Senate Finance Committee has yet to release its version of healthcare reform legislation, and Harry Reid has announced that the Senate won't vote on any healthcare bill until after the August recess. This is worrisome. The future of progressive politics and the nature of the American social contract, not to mention the lives and health of millions of our fellow citizens, is up for grabs. <br> Strangely, though, you wouldn't really know it from listening to the pronouncements emanating from the White House. Instead, they're focused with laserlike precision on "bending the curve." Testifying before Congress in June, Council of Economic Advisors chair Christina Romer said she wants "to focus on slowing the growth rate of costs...the so-called curve-bending that can last for decades." Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag emphasized in a recent interview that "the legislation that emerges from this process has to contain key provisions that will bend the curve over the long term." And even before he took office, President Obama said that "the key is going to be medium-term and long-term, how do we bend the curve so that we start getting these deficits down to a manageable level?" <br> In this case the "curve" is the projected increase of healthcare expenses over the next several decades. Healthcare currently accounts for 17 percent of GDP (more than in any other industrialized nation), and its share is growing. This predicted inflation in healthcare costs will drive up the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, which if allowed to grow at the current rate will eventually bankrupt the government. Therefore, reforming healthcare is crucial to keeping America solvent. This is true and right and compelling enough, so far as it goes. <br> But in politics there are two kinds of issues: those that make your cheeks flush and inspire passion, and everything else. The integrity of our bodies, the care loved ones will or will not receive when they fall ill, the fear and misery that beset millions of people who are cruelly left to a prison of nagging illness because they don't have routine care--those are in the first category. Long-term fiscal deficit projections are decidedly in the latter. <br> In its healthcare messaging, the White House has taken an issue more intimate and immediate than perhaps any other in a voter's life and transformed it into an abstract, technical argument about long-term actuarial projections. It's a peculiar kind of reverse political alchemy: transforming gold into lead. <br> Of course, there's a certain logic to the White House approach: despite widespread public support for reforming the healthcare system, a desire for more choices and pervasive insecurity about the stability of coverage, a majority of people think that their health insurance is just fine. The trick then is to promise two contradictory things: that healthcare reform will change the system while leaving your healthcare intact. In what at first appeared a deft bit of jujitsu, the White House settled on the long-run-cost argument as the way to pull this off. <br> But now we're seeing the problems with this approach. For one, converting a moral and political argument into a technical and accounting one ends up ceding veto power to the accountants at the Congressional Budget Office. In a Beltway version of Revenge of the Nerds, every time a Democratic bill comes out of committee it's sent to the CBO to be "scored"--that is, to evaluate how much it will cost and how much it will "bend the curve" on future costs. So far, the results have been mixed. CBO head Doug Elmendorf has been skeptical about the gains to be had from measures like health IT and wellness programs, and both the House and Senate bills have been scored as revenue neutral over the next ten years. In another context that would be great news, but since healthcare is being sold as a way to reduce the deficit, revenue neutral doesn't quite cut it. <br> The other problem is broader than just these pieces of legislation. Obama has inherited a shared political vocabulary in Washington (with phrases like "fiscal discipline," which he himself employs) that shapes the contours of the possible and semantically militates against progressive politics at every invocation. If "fiscal discipline" meant that politicians support tax increases on the wealthy or cuts to the military budget to pay for programs, it would be a useful concept. But what "fiscal discipline" means in Washington is cutting government. It means no taxing and no spending. It means "pain" and "sacrifice" and gutting the welfare state. When politicians say they're "fiscally conservative," what it actually means is they're conservative. Full stop. <br> Even with his mandate and the broad social forces moving America toward a progressive majority, Obama doesn't have the time (and may not have the inclination) to undo three decades of accumulated right-wing, antigovernment rhetoric. So in order to strike while the iron is hot, he's attempting to use the language of fiscal conservatism to pull off a marginally progressive shift in the social contract. <br> But the rhetoric of "fiscal conservatism" also empowers the enemies of reform. When "moderate" Democratic senators on the Finance Committee, Max Baucus and Kent Conrad, finally unveil their secretly crafted version of healthcare reform, which reports indicate will include neither an employer mandate nor a public option, they can claim it fulfills the president's goal of "bending the curve." By cutting subsidies and reducing the number of Americans covered, their plan could still manage to come in under the magical $1 trillion mark. Since the CBO's Elmendorf has been intimately involved in crafting the bill, that seems assured. What Congress could end up with, then, is a bill that costs less than others but doesn't, you know, provide universal healthcare. <br> The policy argument the president is making is sound: more government intervention, a public option and broader coverage will reduce costs in the long run. But this causes so much cognitive dissonance that mainstream media figures are incredulous. And that skepticism, along with industry propaganda claiming that a public option will limit choices, is, not surprisingly, showing up in public opinion. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found support for Obama's healthcare agenda at 49 percent, down from 57 percent in April. <br> So what to do? If there's a silver lining to the fact that Congress will enter its August recess without a bill, it's that the White House and advocates of real reform will have a chance to modify their pitch. If there was ever a time for Obama's vaunted and much-anticipated grassroots army Organizing for America (OFA) to do its thing, it's now. Since it's closer to the actual lived experience of voters, OFA may have superior instincts about what kinds of messages resonate. Recently it undertook an effort to compile stories from people about their experiences with a broken healthcare system, like this one: <br> I am 36 years old and have Blue Shield HMO health insurance coverage through my employer. In January 2009, I was diagnosed with metastatic (stage 4) breast cancer.... My doctors prescribed a medication that targets and removes the cancer throughout the body like a "smart bomb"; however Blue Shield of California denied coverage of my doctors' recommended treatment. Blue Shield also denied a radiation procedure that would target and remove the two lesions in my brain. In both cases, Blue Shield denied the original requests and subsequent appeals I filed on the grounds that the treatments are not a medical necessity. I have learned that insurance companies will use "medical necessity" as an excuse to not cover treatment when it appears that the patient is "too sick" (read: not worth it). <br> Stories like this strike me as a whole lot more potent than talk about "bending the curve." <br> By Christopher Hayes: Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 Irwin M. Stelzer is a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard, director of economic policy studies at the Hudson Institute, and a columnist for the Sunday Times <br>"It started out like a song we knew we had a good thing going. And if I wanted too much, was that such a mistake?" President Obama's answer to composer Stephen Sondheim's question would be "yes," were he not a president who rarely admits error. <br> We are six months into the Obama reign, and he surely did have a good thing going until very recently. He pushed through what voters thought was a stimulus bill. He held numerous press conferences at which an adoring media allowed him to display his rhetorical skills. No mumbling George W. Bush, he. He toured the world, to the applause of adoring masses from London to Paris to Cairo. He fulfilled a campaign promise to tackle perceived global warming and lead the world to a cooler, greener future by urging Congress to pass a cap-and-trade bill aimed at cutting CO2 emissions. He bailed out General Motors and Chrysler, rewarding the United Auto Workers for delivering key states to him in last year's election. <br> Then he made the mistake about which Sondheim wrote and Sinatra sang -- he wanted too much. He attempted to push through Congress a so-called reform of the nation's health care industry -- a $1 trillion restructuring that would turn effective control of one-sixth of the economy over to government regulators and bureaucrats. Not a good idea: some 90 percent of Americans are satisfied with their health care, a majority think that the burgeoning deficit is more of a problem than health care, and 42 percent think his plan is a bad idea, while only 36 percent say it is a good idea (22 percent have no opinion). <br> It is too early to say that the presidential agenda is dead in the water. But it is not too early to say that he made some serious errors. <br> The stimulus not only failed to keep the unemployment rate to 8 percent, as Obama promised (it is now 9.5 percent). It also unleashed a flood of red ink that shifted voters' attention to the implications of the deficit for their children's and grandchildren's standard of living. So when the president insisted that Congress pass a cap-and-trade program that will drive up energy costs, and a health care plan that will add more than a trillion dollars to the deficit or the tax burden over the next decade, Congress heard from unhappy constituents (39 percent strongly oppose his health plan while only 25 percent strongly support it), and momentum shifted from the president to more centrist congressional Democrats, who are doing what Republicans don't have the votes to do: preventing the liberal Democratic leadership from taking a giant step to a government-controlled health care system. <br> The President has a 78-seat majority in the House of Representatives, and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. He does not need a single Republican vote to pass any bill he sends to Congress. Still, he could not have his way with the Congress, and it now looks likely that he will have to trim his health-care program to get anything in the fall that he can declare a victory, which he will have to do if he is to avoid acute political embarrassment. Equally important, the president's difficulty with Democratic centrists will inevitably slow the pace of his efforts to "transform" the entire American economy. <br> But slowing is not the same thing as derailing. The president remains popular, more popular than his policies. He is articulate, assured and, more important, not George W. Bush. No Republican has his communications skills, although he is subject to some ridicule for his ever-present teleprompters. And if the economy continues to recover, all will be forgiven. <br> Share prices are about 20 percent higher than when Obama took the oath of office. The index of leading economic indicators is up. Some banks -- most notably Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase -- are profitable enough to repay the bailout moneys meted out to them when it looked as if the financial system would collapse. Inventory liquidation is slowing and manufacturing activity seems to be recovering. Business investment is up, and Federal Reserve Board Chairman reports that the Fed's support for the commercial paper market has fallen to one-third of crisis levels. <br> Perhaps most important, the housing sector might, only might, be "finding a bottom," to use Wall Street lingo. Sales of existing homes are at their highest level since October 2008, and sales of new homes rose 11 percent in June. The much-watched Standard Poor's Case-Schiller index of house prices rose in May from the previous month for the first time in three years. Vacancy rates are down, as is the supply of unsold homes, now at its lowest level since October 2007. Housing starts rose 3.6 percent in June, and I am told that some builders in the hard-hit southwest have begun buying up land in anticipation of again constructing new homes. There is even talk of the "exit strategy" the Fed will adopt to reduce the money supply when the recovery proves durable. <br> Against that voters will have to weigh the fact that the unemployment rate has risen from 7.6 percent to 9.5 percent since Obama took office -- some three million more people are out of work than early in the year. Perhaps even more crucially, there is the troubling, soaring deficit and the prospect of large tax increases or future inflation. <br> And the president cannot be certain that the economy has finally turned around. The banks still have an estimated $30 billion in commercial property loans to write off this year. Government efforts to modify mortgages so as to reduce foreclosures are floundering. Consumer sentiment fell in June, as consumers decided that the jobs market will not soon improve and "see little reason to believe that the economic stimulus package will improve their finances any time soon," says Richard Curtin, director of the Reuters / University of Michigan survey. <br> So Obama has much to think about as he tallies his successes and failures. Other than the stimulus package, passed during the euphoria following his inauguration, his legislative program is stalled, and by members of his own party. The economy is doing better, but the indicator that most matters to voters -- the unemployment rate -- is headed up, rather than down. And the market sent a powerful signal this week: The auction of government bonds did not go well, forcing the Treasury to pay higher interest rates than in the recent past. That is a bad sign for a president who needs low rates to encourage business investment and sustain the fragile green shoots that must flower if the Democrats are to hold their gains in next November's election. <br> It just might be that Obama had "a good thing going, going, gone." <br> By Irwin M.

 Suzy Khimm is a reporter-researcher for The New Republic.<hr width="50%">When Sarah Palin abruptly announced that she was planning to leave office, it was clear whom she blamed for her early exit. "I wish you'd hear MORE from the media of your state's progress and how we tackle Outside interests--daily--SPECIAL interests that would stymie our state," she said in her July 3 resignation speech, which she later posted on her website. Blasting her adversaries for paralyzing the Alaska governor's office with charges of "frivolous ethics violations," Palin and her representatives accused these unnamed "Outside interests" of harming her ability to govern after returning from the presidential campaign. "There were some complaints that were filed under pseudonyms that we believe came from down in the lower 48," Palin's lawyer, Thomas Van Flein, told Fox News. "There is a connection to the Democratic Party in the lower 48." <br> There's no doubt that Alaska's state government has been paralyzed since Palin's return, with anger and frustration emanating from both the governor's office and the state legislature. All of Palin's major bills failed to pass this year's first 90-day session. But conversations with both Republican and Democratic legislators reveal that Palin's inability to get anything done has little to do with the media attacks the Alaska governor claims drove her from office. The lawmakers say it has more to do with how national exposure changed her, moving her much further to the right than she had been and making her nearly impossible to work with. And state Republicans seem just as incensed about it as the Democrats. <br> Before Palin left the state to become John McCain's running partner, she cultivated a good, if not exactly chummy, working relationship with Alaskan Democrats by pushing for an oil-tax increase and ethics reform. And state Republicans embraced Palin as the new face of a party that had been tarnished by scandal-ridden politicians like Ted Stevens. But upon returning to Juneau last fall, "she managed to alienate most of the 60 members of [the Alaska] House and Senate," says Larry Persily, an aide to state Republican Representative Mike Hawker. "It wasn't a matter of burning bridges--she blew them up." <br> Palin made it clear that she wasn't going to back away from the hard-line conservative ideology that had propelled her to national prominence--and her first high-profile target was the federal stimulus bill. Rehashing Republican talking points, she called it "an unsustainable, debt-ridden package" and threatened to veto a third of the $930 million in funds, including money for energy efficiency and social services. The move drew criticism from Palin's Democratic opponents and her closest Republican allies in the state, but seemed to fit into her quest for national prominence. "The little bit of time she spent on policy, she devoted ... to issues of national merit," says Republican Representative Jay Ramras. "It wasn't when but how she was going to throw Alaska under the bus." <br> But even as Palin grandstanded on her opposition to the funds and her willingness to withstand what she called "the slings and arrows" from both parties, she failed to communicate the specifics of her positions and dismissed lawmakers. When it came to legislative matters of any substance, "we got very little information from the state," says Republican House Speaker Mike Chenault. "All I wanted was to know what her response was.... There were many times we couldn't get a clear answer." "We couldn't get any decisions out of the governor," says Persily, who spent two years working in the Alaska governor's Washington office. "It had nothing to do with critics harping at her--it was a lack of attention to governing." <br> Rather than hash things out with lawmakers, Palin repeatedly rebuffed their engagement efforts, most notably canceling a key April meeting with legislators. When she changed her mind at the last minute, the frustrated legislators declined to meet with her. Palin issued a press release blaming them for the meeting's failure, prompting both the Senate president and the Republican House speaker to denounce her claims as completely false. "You don't see that often--the Senate president calling the governor a liar," says Persily. <br> Then, instead of trying to repair fraying relations with the lawmakers, Palin left town to give a speech at an anti-abortion rally in Indiana. When Tom Wright, an aide to the Republican House speaker, informed her that leaving the state within the last days of the legislative session flouted standard practice, she marched into his office and berated him. "There was no malice on his part to take a dig at the governor," says Chenault. "I take it very seriously for anyone to chew on one of my staff for any reason." "It violated all common decency, all protocol," says Ramras. "It just showed such disrespect." <br> It wasn't the only instance in which Palin ran roughshod over the legislature. In March, Democratic State Senator Kim Elton announced that he would be leaving to work for the Obama administration, and Democratic lawmakers nominated state Senator Beth Kerttula for the seat. Palin dithered for a month before striking down the appointment, claiming that the Democrats should have followed protocol by picking three candidates for the post. Then, she pushed forward two candidates who had only registered as Democrats weeks earlier--including one neophyte married to another legislator. <br> When Senate Democrats struck down her second nominee, Palin declared that Democratic lawmakers were violating the state constitution by voting behind closed doors. "The arguments by Palin that [the vote] was somehow a secret cabal didn't hold much water," says Gregg Erickson, a longtime Alaska political analyst. "A lot of people speculate that she was punishing Juneau for the fact that Juneau didn't vote for her." The House Republicans could do little to help resolve the political deadlock. "It was an issue I had no control over--I didn't wanted to be dragged into the melee," says Chenault. By the time the governor and the Democrats compromised on a nominee, the Juneau district had been without representation for half the legislative session. <br> In another controversial move, and in the midst of the deadlock over the stimulus and the state Senate seat, Palin nominated Wayne Anthony Ross for attorney general. A board member of the National Rifle Association infamous for calling gays "degenerates" and accused of making derogatory remarks toward women, Ross was seen as someone who would--in Erickson's words--"alienate a significant segment of the population" in the state, but "would clearly open pocketbooks of NRA folks around the country." Palin, for her part, seemed to be more interested in the kind of credibility Ross could give her among national Republicans than in actually getting him confirmed. In picking such a controversial nominee, Palin should have stepped up to defend him, says Ramras, who had supported Ross's candidacy. <br> But by mid-April, Palin had little will to do so, and the legislature rejected the appointment--the first time in Alaska's history that a head of state failed confirmation. "He was voted down, and she blamed all of us," says Ramras. "She's perfected victim psychology." <br> Of course, the barrage of ethics complaints filed against the governor exacerbated in-house tensions and probably served as a distraction. But Juneau's state of utter dysfunction wasn't due to nefarious Democratic operatives who had crept up from the lower 48 to sabotage Palin; it was Palin's national ambitions that were primarily responsible for her undoing. <br> Traveling to Fairbanks to sign a gun-rights bill a week after she announced her resignation, Palin didn't bother contacting local officials, "but she did contact a conservative talk-radio host," says Ramras. Surrounded by photographers, Palin defended her resignation on the radio show, "Firearms Friday." "I'm not cut out to play that game that a lot of politicians are," the governor told listeners. She couldn't have been more on target. <br> By Suzy Khimm:Reprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 Frank Llewellyn is the national director of Democratic Socialists of America. <br> "Socialism" is now an active part of the Republican lexicon, among the litany of routine charges to be trotted out whenever they cannot come up with a substantive critique of policy initiatives they oppose. Beginning with a steady drumbeat from the far-right blogosphere during last year's Democratic primary campaign, Republicans have attacked health care reform and modest progressive tax reform proposals as somehow "un-American," "European," and, God-forbid, "socialist!" <br> When the Republicans lost the election and the Obama administration filled its Treasury positions with former Goldman Sachs executives, we socialists thought that was the end of these baseless charges. But when the Republicans found themselves with nothing to say about how to shore-up an economy in free-fall, they deemed the stimulus bill socialist - even though the architect of such policies, John Maynard Keynes, advocated a capitalist economic system. <br> Republicans and their media allies never really define what they mean by socialism. To some, it is an expansion in government spending (although many capitalist nations funnel more of their GDP through the public sector than the U.S. does). This past February, Fox TV host Glen Beck informed me on the air that Canada must be a socialist country because it had a universal health care system. That would be news to Canada's socialist New Democratic Party, which has occasionally held power at the provincial level but has never won a federal election. <br> Whatever their definition of socialism is, the term is gaining currency among some Republicans as a form of blanket condemnation of the President and Democratic reform proposals. Just yesterday, RNC Chair Michael Steele declared definitively that Obama's health plan represented socialism, even though the Obama proposals most closely resemble the universal health insurance scheme of Germany - last we knew, an avowedly capitalist nation. <br> All this Republican chatter is letting me make a living telling people that Obama and his administration are not socialist - and as National Director of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the United States' largest socialist organization, I ought to know. Just, like the New Deal-era Roosevelt haters, these Republicans erroneously term a president who is trying to save capitalism from itself a socialist. <br> Contemporary democratic socialists want to mitigate the many adverse impacts that unregulated capitalist markets have on the lives of ordinary people by supporting intelligent democratic regulation of the economy (particularly the financial sector) and by using progressive taxation to finance high-quality public goods that can satisfy all citizens' basic needs for health care, education, unemployment insurance, and job training. We do not wish to destroy markets for consumer goods or to confiscate personal property. Rather, we want to establish efficient government regulation of financial markets so that ordinary citizens can secure stable financing for the purchase of such important personal property as an affordable home. <br> In other developed democracies, national health care systems are so popular that once they have been established it is politically impossible to eliminate them. In a recent Gallup poll, while only fifty-seven percent of United States residents said they were satisfied with their health care, over seventy-five percent of Canadians and Western Europeans said they would not trade their health care system for the current U. S. model. That is the real reason that Republicans are trying to sow doubt and prevent passage of a national health care bill: they want to protect the for-profit health care and pharmaceutical industries. <br> American socialists (and many more non-socialists, including 86 members of Congress) support HR 676, John Conyers' Medicare for All single-payer national health plan, which would replace the private insurance industry with a government agency but would preserve personal choice of physician and hospital care. <br> We socialists are deeply suspicious of the Democratic Party leadership proposals for health care. We worry that these proposals lack a sufficiently robust public insurance option to provide an effective check on the private insurers. Any comparative analysis of health care systems indicates that the greater the role of private, for-profit health insurance companies in the delivery of health care, the higher the cost. This is why the United States has the most expensive healthcare system in the world but trails well behind on crucial indicators of public health, such as infant mortality, longevity, and death of women in childbirth. <br> The insurance companies don't like the Democratic leadership plan because in theory they might have to face effective competition from a public insurance option. Democratic socialists don't trust the insurance companies enough to keep them in the health insurance market. But President Obama does, which makes it much more likely that the pay-or-play predominantly private insurance plan we distrust is likely to pass. So exactly how does that put the President in a "cabal," to use Michael Steele's word, to advance socialist goals? <br> This socialist-baiting is more than just name-calling. We are in the middle of a prolonged economic crisis brought on by unrestrained and unregulated capitalism. Since it arose from a crisis in the banking and housing sectors, this economic crisis in particular cannot be solved by normal market mechanisms. There is not sufficient private purchasing power to rejuvenate demand, and capital markets remain very tight. Financial institutions are unwilling to renegotiate under-water mortgages and are even reducing credit lines to borrowers with strong credit ratings. <br> Absent government efforts to strengthen the rights of working people and organized labor, we face the likelihood of another jobless recovery and declining wages. The devastating decline in value of pensions, retirement accounts and housing means that many near retirement age and even many not so near to retirement will not be able to retire on schedule - and certainly not with dignity and security. <br> If the United States fails to democratically restructure its economy, we face a future of increased inequality and poverty. But the constant drumbeat of right-wing "socialist-baiting" makes it less likely that this administration will consider the public initiatives - such as investments in alternative energy, education, and health care - that could engender productive jobs at good wages. <br> Reactionary forces have always utilized anti-socialism to oppose democratic reforms that constrain corporate power. Corporate America tried to red-bait Social Security, the GI Bill, and Medicare. But ordinary Americans rejected the politics of fear, and reforms passed that significantly improved the lives of average Americans. It will take Americans once again rejecting mindless anti-socialism to create sufficient support for the extensive reforms needed to address this deep and systemic economic crisis. <br> By Frank Llewellyn 
 </link-http:>Pejman Yousefzadeh writes a blog for The New Ledger.<br> <br> I cannot remember where I read it, alas, but some news story, some months ago, pointed out that in anticipation of health care reform, the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office--and the current Director of the Office of Management and Budget--Peter Orszag, increased the hiring of staff economists well versed in the fiscal and economic consequences of any changes in the health care system. With these new hires, Orszag hoped that CBO would be well-prepared to turn out quick and accurate estimates of any health reform legislation. <br> One imagines that while the current CBO Director, Doug Elmendorf, is happy about these hires, OMB Director Orszag regrets them. Why? Because CBO issued a fairly blistering report concerning the ability of the current health care reform plans to save money and control health care costs for the long term. <br> CBO's hammer blow to the prospects of the reform packages currently on the table was buried in this Politico report, but its issuance ought to have alarm bells going off in Washington: <br> "In the legislation that has been reported we do not see the sort of fundamental changes that would be necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount," Elmendorf said. <br> "And on the contrary, the legislation significantly expands the federal responsibility for health care costs." <br> Far from burying the lede, this report highlights CBO's undercutting of the Obama Administration's claims. Hilariously, Senator Harry Reid's response to Elmendorf's unwelcome-but-devastating analysis was to suggest that Elmendorf, "who in recent months has set back health care efforts with his office's cost analyses of the plans being floated," should run for Congress, "suggesting [Reid] found the CBO estimate to be partisan in its results." Of course, it goes without saying that Reid is unburdened by any experience in having attended charm school, and one can understand his remarks in light of this fact. But charming or not, Reid's reply does nothing to alleviate the concerns of any halfway respectable policy wonk that the claims of the Obama Administration and Congressional Democrats notwithstanding, health care costs will not be contained or reduced under the health care reform plans at issue. <br> Cost control and reduction are the goals that any health care reform worthy of the name should be shooting for. Too many people have gotten hung up on the concept of universal coverage, neglecting to note that universal coverage helps drive health care providers out of business, that it leads to incredibly onerous increases in taxes, and that current Congressional plans promising universal coverage will only serve to push down wages, increase the complexity of the health care system, and stick us with yet another unaffordable entitlement. <br> The emerging picture that comes out of the current health care reform bills under consideration validates the general statement of principles that make up Michael Cannon's Anti-Universal Coverage Manifesto. <br> Last week, David Brooks--the New York Times columnists who, despite his putative conservative leanings, is more than delighted to throw rhetorical bouquets towards the general direction of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue--pointed out that the current bevy of health care reform legislation would do nothing to control costs. Among the other points he makes, Brooks highlights the fact that the lower administrative costs that will supposedly eventuate through the implementation of a public plan will do nothing whatsoever to drive down costs, since they do "not affect the fundamental incentives driving inflation." This is because "the public plan would pay providers of health care at rates comparable to privately negotiated rates," according to--you guessed it--a CBO analysis of the plan provisions in the health care reform bill issued by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Quoting Brooks: <br> Wait, it gets worse. <br> The bills not only fail to reduce health care inflation, they make it harder to fix the larger fiscal mess later. They do that by taking the chits we could use to balance the overall budget and using them to cover the $1.3 trillion in new federal health spending. <br> One may take issue with some of the solutions offered by Brooks to fix the fiscal mess we face because of rising health costs. But there is no denying the problem. And there is no denying that the health care reform bills we are seeing batted around the halls of Congress do nothing to fix that problem. <br> The CBO report has clearly worried advocates of health care reform. Ezra Klein tries to promulgate "rules" concerning comments on CBO's findings, including the requirement that those who trumpet CBO's critiques on the issue of cost control also accept CBO's call for the elimination of tax breaks that support employer-provided health insurance, a public insurance option that can bargain at Medicare rates, allowing MedPAC to reform Medicare, support cost-sharing that will effectively ration care, and support cost-effectiveness of treatments, which will serve to set reimbursement rates. To which, the proper response is something along the lines of "No, Ezra, we don't have to accept these conclusions." These CBO proposals are given with the assumption that universal health care is a desirable goal. But it may not be. Rather, the desirable goal, as Cannon writes, may better be described as "making health care of ever-increasing quality available to an ever-increasing number of people.," with the understanding that the policy consequences of universal coverage may not be desirable, that people ought to have the right to refuse health insurance, and that there are plenty of other--and better--ways to subsidize people who do not have health care. <br> Perhaps the worry of people like Klein is not limited to a mere CBO report, devastating though that report is. Perhaps the concern of universal coverage advocates also centers around the fact that for all of the hoopla surrounding health care reform, polls show that the American public is divided over the issue of reform. The political advantages enjoyed by the Obama Administration and Congressional Democrats are not nearly as pronounced or overwhelming as universal coverage advocates (the vast majority of them sympathizing with the Democratic party) thought they would be, and a significant number of Americans believe that neither their care, nor their pocketbooks will see much improvement in the aftermath of health care reform. <br> Sometimes, public skepticism is not justified by the facts. But in this case, the skepticism of the American people is borne out by the most serious of policy critiques, thus reinforcing public wariness. Health care reform advocates may try bluff and bluster to overcome public concerns. But with any luck, they will be forced instead to go back to the drawing board, and return with a better plan. <br> By Pejman Yousefzadeh:Reprinted with permission from The New Ledger 
 Jonathan Cohn is a senior editor at The New Republic <br>You could make a credible argument that health care reform took enormous strides forward last week, given that legislation passed three of the five congressional committees considering it. But when President Obama stood at a White House podium on Friday, in order to discuss health reform, he seemed frustrated and a little drained. <br> It's possible he was just reacting to recent bad news on the economy. And it's possible he was just, well, feeling tired. But I suspect he was also reacting to some other developments on health care reform--developments that were not nearly as encouraging as the news from those three committees.Obama had started the week by pushing Congress to get legislation done before its August recess. But several members of his party responded by saying, in some cases publicly, that Congress would need more time. Obama also spent the week saying, as he has all along, that health care reform must succeed in reducing the cost of medical care over the long run. But on Thursday, the head of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) testified that the legislation he'd seen so far wasn't fulfilling that goal, prompting some more conservative Democrats to make public their own concerns along those lines. <br> The legislative process is like this--lots of ups and downs, often in rapid succession. Obama is right that we all get too caught up in the 24-hour news cycle. And in a quick canvassing of sources on Capitol Hill over the weekend, the responses weren't as glum as I'd expected."We will get there," one senior staffer e-mailed me."Always darkest just before a breakthrough." <br> Still, reform's momentum seems to have slowed, if not stalled. And it's not going to speed up again unless the Democrats do something they haven't done in a long time: Show some mettle and embrace some unpleasant positions. Some of them seem ready to do it. But others, particularly some of the party's more conservative members, don't. <br> There are really two key issues the Democrats need to confront. The first is how to finance reform in the ten years that counts for official budgeting. Making sure that everybody has access to health insurance, by providing them with Medicaid or helping them to buy private coverage, will cost at least $1 trillion over ten years. (And, if you want to do it right, it costs a fair amount more.) <br> The government can raise some of that money by finding savings elsewhere in the health care system. It can, for example, reduce the subsidies to private insurers serving Medicare patients or introduce a government-run insurance option that would waste less money than its private competitors. <br> But those moves will only yield about half the money necessary. To get the other half, the government has to raise new revenue. In other words, it has to raise taxes. A number of options have been discussed--capping the tax exclusion for group health benefits, imposing an income tax surcharge on the wealthiest Americans, limiting itemized deductions for more affluent taxpayers. Any of those would work, alone or in combination. <br> The second key issue is how to make health care less expensive over the long run. This is what the administration famously calls"bending the curve." Experts have come up with a wide variety of ideas for accomplishing this--everything from better information technology to rewarding hospitals that are the safest and most efficient. But the evidence that these efforts will yield savings isn't exactly ironclad. At least not yet. <br> In the absence of such evidence, the CBO--whose judgment on this matter most of Washington seems to be following, at least for the moment--has indicated government must choose from a more limited set of alternatives: imposing some sort of automatic budget limit on health care, reducing congressional oversight over Medicare payment policies, or capping the income tax exclusion for group health benefits (so that there's less incentive to buy generous insurance). Again, these can work in isolation or together. <br> None of these decisions would be particularly easy. One way or another, they involve taking money out of somebody's pockets. And while the direct impact on the finances of most middle class families would be modest, or in some cases non-existant, they'd all give political ammunition to critics--who will say that Democrats are either"raising taxes,""rationing health care," or some combination of the two. <br> But if none of these moves seem particularly pleasant, they are nevertheless necessary. <br> They are necessary, first, for the sake of policy. A reform that invests substantially less than $1 trillion will provide far less assistance to people--or guarantee them far less coverage. Either way, it will leave not millions but tens of millions of Americans without access to health care. Similarly, without some the serious cost control measures, health care will just keep getting more expensive--imposing increasingly unsustainable burdens on individuals, and our society. <br> But the rationale for making these moves goes beyond policy. There's a political rationale too. If Democrats don't make the difficult decisions on raising revenue and controlling costs, then the reform they pass won't do much to help middle class Americans. If the subsidies in a reform bill go down, it's middle class people--that is, people making between three and four times the poverty line--who would suddenly lose all assistance. And, without financial assistance, they'd be even more vulnerable to rising costs. <br> Of course, that's assuming reform passes at all. If the Democrats flinch at taking the votes necessary to finance a full package or to bring long-term costs under control, the whole enterprise could unravel. That could lead to the sort of backlash we saw in 1994, when the failure to produce health reform was a major reason voters took out their wrath on Democrats in the midterm elections. It would be one thing if Obama and the Democrats hadn't promised reform explicitly. But, having done that, they've both staked their political survival on its success. As Mark Kleiman writes, "This bill is make or break for the Democratic Party." <br> Do the Democrats get this? Some of them do. President Obama, for example, has put on the table nearly a trillion dollars in funding--and, just this week, he sent to the Hill a proposal to create an independent board that would set payment policies for Medicare. The two House committees that approved legislation each backed an income tax surtax. <br> But there are plenty of Democrats who don't want to make such moves. And ironically--if not surprisingly--many if not most of them are the same ones who complain that reform either is too fiscally irresponsible or doesn't do enough to help the middle class. Unfortunately, these Democrats also may have the votes to block action, either in the two committees still considering legislation or on the floors of their chambers. <br> The good news for Democrats is that passing reform--a good reform--will yield enormous political dividends. And, no less important, it will create a blanket of financial security while fortifying the economy. But doing that will take a little bravery, more than we've seen so far. <br> By Jonathan Cohn:Reprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 This story was written by Paul Wachter.<hr width="50%">Add the name Mark Sanford to the ever-expanding list of politicians done in by extramarital dalliances. On June 24 the South Carolina governor and potential 2012 Republican presidential candidate resurfaced after a weeklong disappearance--during which his staff and family denied knowledge of his whereabouts--and announced that he had flown to Argentina to rendezvous with a woman with whom he had been having an affair. At the press conference, a shaken Sanford apologized for his indiscretion, though he acknowledged that his wife, Jenny, had known about the affair and that they had sought counseling. "I've spent the last five days of my life crying in Argentina," he said. "I am committed to trying to get my heart right." <br> Sanford immediately resigned as chair of the Republican Governors Association, and a day later he pledged to reimburse the state for a government-funded trip he'd taken to Argentina in 2008. It remains unclear whether he will survive the mounting calls for his resignation, though it's almost certain the exposed infidelity has torpedoed any chance he might have had of attaining the Republican presidential nomination. <br> But if now is the time to write Sanford's political obituary, it would be a disservice to place so much emphasis on his affair. What brought Sanford to national prominence and prompted Republican National chair Michael Steele to anoint him as a rising star was the months-long, headline-grabbing campaign Sanford led to turn down portions of the Obama administration's stimulus funds. His stance played well among the fiscal conservatives who rallied behind the "tea party" protests this past spring, but many South Carolinians questioned the judgment of a governor who was willing to turn away money (jobs, really) designated for a state that desperately needs it and that boasts the nation's third-highest rate of unemployment. In order to establish his economic bona fides among conservatives, it seemed, Sanford was prepared to run his state's economy into the ground. <br> The showdown ended June 4, when the South Carolina Supreme Court ordered Sanford to apply for the disputed$700 million earmarked for his state. As questions mounted about the governor's absence, his staff initially said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail to recharge after the defeat. But if there is an irony to be found in Sanford's rambling public apology, it's not the standard tale of comeuppance. Rather, it's that he was finally asking South Carolinians for forgiveness--but for the wrong reasons. <br> Young, handsome and rich, Sanford swept into the House as part of the 1994 Republican revolution. A firm believer in the Contract With America--the party leadership's paean to limited government--he pledged to serve no more than three terms. Yet even by his own reckoning, his time in Congress was undistinguished. The Trust Committed to Me, an autobiographical account of his six years in Congress, is a strange political memoir--a masochist's chronicle of one legislative failure after another. In the fights over term limits (for), sugar subsidies (against), Congressional pay raises (against), Social Security reform (for) and the pork-laden highway bill (against), Sanford was always on the losing side--opposed not only by Democrats but often by his own party, which enjoyed a majority in both houses. <br> Among his former colleagues, Sanford's Congressional days are remembered for his public displays of frugality: he trimmed office staff, helped stop the daily delivery of ice to Congressional offices, slept on a futon in his office and showered at the House gym. "It was one gimmick to the next, and I never thought there was much substance to him," said House majority whip James Clyburn of South Carolina. <br> Until the recent stimulus kerfuffle, Sanford's years as governor had been most notable for public theatrics, as well. In May 2004, a day after the Republican-led House overrode 105 of Sanford's 106 budget vetoes, the governor carried two piglets into the Statehouse chambers to protest "pork-barrel spending." (That the pigs proceeded to defecate on the governor struck some miffed lawmakers as poetic justice.) The following year, he brought a horse and buggy to the Statehouse, saying it symbolized the state's "outdated" Constitution and ways of governance. At first, it looked like the governor's recent "disappearance" was yet another in his long resume of zany but harmless capers. <br> "Sanford's ideal for a perfect South Carolina would find the state with very limited government, no income taxes, limited roles for public education and little governmental involvement with job creation," wrote S.C. Statehouse Report publisher Andy Brack in 2005. In less dire economic times the governor's fiscal austerity resonated with many South Carolinians. But as the economy tanked, his style of governance, which can best be described as obstructionist, has proved costly. <br> One sunny morning in late April, I attended a job fair at Columbia's National Guard Armory, not far from the Statehouse. Hundreds of down-on-their-luck South Carolinians went from booth to booth discovering that for every company hiring--Verizon was looking for sales staff--there were others pitching training programs with no guarantee of a paycheck. <br> As he was leaving, I spoke with Gary Grimes, 55, who had been laid off seven months earlier from his job at Flextronics, a multinational manufacturing company with a plant in West Columbia. He and his wife, who had also recently lost her job, were scraping by on food stamps and unemployment insurance--insurance that Sanford had threatened in December to cut off unless the state agency that disbursed unemployment checks agreed to a new audit. (On January 1, just hours before the fund was to run out, Sanford capitulated and applied for a $146 million federal loan.) A lifelong Republican, Grimes was puzzled by Sanford's stance on the stimulus. "I know we'll have to pay the money back later, but at the same time, the state's hurting and we need the money," he said. "It looks like the governor's just playing politics." <br> I spent that afternoon in the observation balcony of the State Senate chambers alongside children from Greenville's Welcome Elementary School. The third graders were on a field trip, and they caused a brief commotion as they leaned over the railing to take photos. The august men below--there's not a single woman in the State Senate--were debating the 2009-10 appropriations bill. Tax revenue had plummeted; even though the $5.7 billion spending plan the Legislature passed included the $700 million in federal funds, it fell about $1 billion short of the previous year's plan. <br> Congress has mandated that the disputed $700 million--one-tenth of the total allocated for South Carolina under the $787 billion federal stimulus package, but the only part the governor believed was within his power to reject--be disbursed over two years for education and law enforcement. Sanford wanted to redirect the money to pay down state debt, and he stood prepared to see it go to other states even though South Carolinians would still have been on the hook to pay it back. "Going further into debt will not solve a problem that was created by too much debt," he said in a televised address defending his position. <br> But the governor's position was not a popular one in South Carolina. His approval rating had fallen to 40 percent by April, and other GOP lawmakers were questioning his priorities. South Carolina's AAA credit rating places it among states with the lowest general-obligation debt, and it is not unduly burdensome, said State Treasurer Converse Chellis. "If my house was burning down, I don't get in my car and drive to the bank to pay off the mortgage," added GOP State Senator Hugh Leatherman, chair of the budget-writing committee. "I try to put out the fire." <br> Leatherman's metaphor was apt, because South Carolina was going up in flames--literally. At the very moment the legislators were deliberating, the state's worst wildfire in more than thirty years was raging around Myrtle Beach. Months earlier, state forester Gene Kodama had warned that budget cuts at the Forestry Commission put the state "in a very vulnerable position," and now, at a moment of need, he was making do with fewer firefighters and creaky equipment. (More than $500,000 of the disputed stimulus money was allocated to the Forestry Commission, Sanford's critics were quick to point out.)

KHN is an editorially independent news service and is a program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care policy research organization, which is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.<br>Bill and Hillary Clinton are off saving the world, he through his global foundation and she via the State Department. But their presence looms over the health care debate as surely as if they were running the White House. Their epic failure to pass reform in 1994 has become the defining object lesson in how to botch health care legislation--a lesson President Obama has obviously taken to heart. Push for reform right away; let Congress hash out the details; and, above all, don't threaten people's current insurance arrangements. You can sum up Obama's strategy for health reform as "WWCD": What Wouldn't the Clintons Do. <br> And it's working well so far. Notwithstanding the predictable fits-and-starts of the legislative process, it seems likely that Obama will have a bill to sign by year's end, thereby accomplishing what the Clintons famously could not. But then what? Having crafted a bill that can pass Congress, will Obama be signing a bill that people actually like? It's a question best answered by examining another episode of the past--one that, although a mere footnote in political history, is fraught with warnings for today's reformers. <br> The episode is the fight over the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, which President Reagan signed in 1988. Its purpose was to plug some of the emerging gaps in the Medicare program: If you stayed in the hospital too long, Medicare just stopped paying the bills. The Act extended hospital coverage indefinitely, capped out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries, and offered partial coverage of prescription drugs, among other things. <br> Or at least that's what the law was supposed to do. After the bill passed with overwhelming, bipartisan support, a backlash developed, memorably culminating in a "riot" of angry seniors who chased a beleaguered Dan Rostenkowski--then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee--into his car after a Chicago meeting. Less than two years after passage, before the bill's implementation, Congress voted to repeal the act, again with sweeping margins. <br> What had soured the public? As political scientist Jonathan Oberlander recounts in The Political Life of Medicare, a major factor was the sense among seniors--the program's intended beneficiaries--that the program's limited upside wasn't worth the cost they were paying. Medicare's lack of catastrophic care was a real problem, for sure, but not necessarily its biggest and certainly not its most visible, since only a tiny percentage of seniors ever ended up with those extended hospital stays. (Nursing home costs were a much bigger problem.) The other benefits, like the partial prescription drug coverage, would have helped more people. But few seniors understood that and the affluent among them already had supplemental coverage for many of those needs anyway. <br> At the same time, all seniors felt the program's burden: Determined to make the new benefit self-financing, lawmakers imposed a mandatory premium on seniors and tacked on an income tax surcharge for the wealthy among them. The financial hit to most retirees would have been quite modest, but it hit right away, before the full benefits kicked in. That made seniors a receptive audience for demagogic advertisements attacking the program. <br> Fast forward two decades, take a closer look at what's happening on Capitol Hill, and you may notice some familiar storylines. In order to make sure reform can pay for itself, lawmakers are talking about slowing down implementation, so that the program is not fully on line until 2014. They're also talking about offering fewer subsidies to help people obtain insurance. In a nod to centrists who don't like the idea of too much government, there's a strong push to gut or even eliminate proposals for the public insurance plan, which was supposed to provide security for individuals and competition for private insurers. <br> These are not small concessions. Consider the proposed reduction in subsidies. In the original schemes, families of four making up to $88,000 a year would get at least some assistance; under the alternatives under discussion, only families making up to $66,000 could get subsidies. Yet families making between $66,000 and $88,000 are precisely the sort of families who could use help--not a lot of help, but a little--paying for insurance. And that's assuming subsidies really end up at $66,000. Lawmakers could easily bid the number down more before reaching a final compromise. <br> Put aside, for a moment, the policy merits of these moves. The politics are lousy. Obama would be in danger of producing legislation that seems to offer little up-front benefit, particularly for the electorally vital middle class. And if some of these people end up paying even modestly higher taxes to help finance reform they're not likely to be happy about it. It's hard to imagine such legislation provoking a backlash that could produce total repeal. It's not so hard to imagine such legislation creating bad political feelings, the kind that linger around until the next Election Day and pave the way for legislative retrenchment later on. <br> Of course, holding out for more generous subsidies, a robust public plan, or other reform elements that deliver clear, short-term benefits would obviously carry its own set of political risks. To get something through Congress, Obama probably needs some centrist support--or, at the very least, he needs to make a good show of courting it. But Obama must be wary of conceding too much. Even in strictly political terms, a good bill that passes with a narrow margin may preferable to a weak bill that carries huge majorities. <br> The lesson of the Clinton health care fight is that Congress won't embrace reform if there aren't some compromises. The lesson of the Medicare Catastrophic Care Act is that the public won't embrace reform if it has too many compromises. We know that Obama has mastered the first one. For his own sake, as well as ours, he'd better master the second. <br> By Jonathan Cohn: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 Weekly Standard contributing editor Irwin M. Stelzer is a director of economic policy studies at the Hudson Institute. Death by a thousand cuts. Or in the case of the efficiency of the U.S. economy, by at least four: energy policy, health care policy, trade union resurgence, and fiscal madness. <br> Start with energy. The world is awash in it. The wind blows and the sun shines, at least some times and somewhere. Oil and gas wells gush, and substantial oil- and gas-rich areas have never even been explored. Coal abounds. Nuclear power can be had at a cost. So why has Barack Obama made energy policy one of his three top priorities -- education and health care are the other two -- in a country in which inexpensive energy has produced the world's most productive agriculture, a population capable of navigating America's huge spaces in air-conditioned comfort, and permitted the substitution of energy-plus-brain-power for back-breaking labor? <br> One problem is that oil is largely in the hands of very bad actors. Still another is that almost all sources of energy have significant impacts on the environment: solar panels consume acres of space; wind machines are considered eye sores by those who can spot them; oil, natural gas and coal emit CO2, responsible for claims that the globe is warming; nuclear power generates long-lived and dangerous waste. <br> Some of these problems are soluble, although not without cost. Domestic producers of natural gas tout their product as a substitute for petrol in trucks, busses and other vehicles. Progress is apparently being made in developing cars and trucks that run on at least partly on batteries. The efficiency of vehicles is being increased, albeit in response to inefficient government edicts rather than to more efficient price signals. Never mind that the infrastructure for these various gasoline substitutes has not been developed, and that the cost of these technologies exceeds that of the gasoline-fuelled internal combustion engine by a good margin. They must be listed in the possible column. That's the good news. <br> The bad news is that even if these technologies do develop, we will still need lots of oil and gasoline to fuel the existing capital stock, and that oil is in the hands of the bad guys. The Saudis and their OPEC allies control the bulk of the world's oil reserves, and use the proceeds of their cartel-based oil sales to fund the spread of radical Islam and jihadism. Hugo Chvez uses the (dwindling) receipts from his increasingly clapped-out oil industry to fund his takeover of Venezuela's private sector and his anti-American activities. Iran's mullahs survive their disastrous economic policies only because they have oil revenues with which to bribe the masses, pay for their nuclear-arms program, and fund international terrorism. <br> The problem of the unfortunate location of oil reserves can't be solved by research into alternatives to oil, or by conservation; as far ahead as we can see, we will need the bad guys' oil, and Europe will need natural gas from an increasingly bellicose Russia. Both problems can be ameliorated by diversifying sources of supply. Investment in the oil industries of Canada and Mexico certainly seems worthwhile for the United States, as does investment in natural gas pipelines that by-pass Russia for the EU. And maintenance of a military strong enough to guard supply routes and protect the Saudi fields from falling into even worse hands seems essential. <br> It is the environmental issues that seem intractable. At one time a united environmental movement was of one mind on important issues. No longer. President Obama and greens favor the development of solar and wind power, but other environmentalists oppose dedicating substantial swathes of desert land to solar panels, and Senator Ted Kennedy is leading the charge against building windmills in sight of his family compound on Cape Cod. Some environmentalists see pollution-free nuclear power as an important part of future energy supply, others oppose new plants because there is no political agreement on the disposal of nuclear waste. If environmentalists in America agree on anything it is that coal presents the greatest threat to the environment, and that the courts can be used to drag out the permitting process until most projects are abandoned. <br> All of this means that the electrical energy needed to power battery-driven vehicles won't come cheap, if indeed it is available. Industry sources fear that with coal and nuclear more or less off the table, at least for now, we will end up rationing electricity. <br> Energy is not the only sector that is likely to be less efficient than in the past. It is no coincidence that America's superior productivity performance has coincided with the decline of trade unions. We have seen how union compensation scales and work rules contributed to the bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler -- a fate the non-union car manufacturers have avoided. Yet Congress and the president are preparing to spur union growth by eliminating the secret ballot in union-recognition elections and, rumor has it, by writing advantages for union members into the tax laws, perhaps by exempting them from taxes on their employer-sponsored health-care benefits while imposing such taxes on non-union employees. <br> There is worse. The president is about to engineer the takeover of the health care sector. Unless Congress refuses to go along with the establishment of a government insurer -- voter enthusiasm for this "reform" is minimal -- competition from an entity that has no need to make a profit and can count on taxpayer funding if premiums prove inadequate will surely doom private insurers. Estimated cost over ten years: $1.3-$1.6 trillion, adding to the upward pressure on taxes, especially on wealth-creating entrepreneurs, created by the administration's runaway deficits. <br> The administration simply has no credible plan to reduce those deficits, and instead talks vaguely of cutting entitlements or the savings from universal health care coverage -- never mind that more coverage means higher costs, and the proclaimed goal of prolonging live, however admirable, will drive costs up, not down. Obama's huge deficits already have purchasers of Treasury IOUs worried that they will be repaid in devalued dollars, which will eventually force wary investors to price the risk of inflation into the price they are prepared to pay for government IOUs. Interest rates rise, economic growth slows. <br> Two thoughts pierce the gloom. The first is that the American economy might be large enough, and resilient enough, to remain competitive even bearing the weight of the new inefficiencies. The second is that voters will demand a change of course before Obamanomics is permanently embedded in our system. Voters worry that they are leaving their children a mountain of debt. Already Obama's approval rating among independent voters, whom Wall Street Journal analyst Gerald Seib calls "the canaries in the coal mine of American politics", has fallen from 60 percent to 45 percent. Even if the president doesn't get the message, Congress, faced with an election next year, just might.By Irwin M. StelzerReprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard 
 Arnold Kling is the author of Crisis of Abundance: Rethinking How We Pay for Health Care,. He writes for econlog.econlib.org.<hr width="50%">As the discussion of health-care policy unfolds, what we are seeing is a non-debate over non-reform. The Democratic proposals promise to entrench the status quo, which does not fit with the principles of personal responsibility and fails to allocate resources sensibly. <br> To show what I mean, hold up ten fingers. Each finger represents 10 percent of health-care spending in the United States. Five fingers - half - represent what is paid for by government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Four of the remaining fingers represent what is paid for by private health insurance. One finger represents what individuals pay out of their own pockets. <br> To move in the direction of personal responsibility, we have to make more of our health-care system look like the one finger - as was the case as recently as 1960, when the share of medical expenses paid for by individuals out of pocket was 50 percent. This is a radical idea for reform, and neither political party is talking about it. Instead, the Democrats are trying to incrementally make the system look more like the five fingers now represented by government. And in opposing the Democrats' reforms, the Republicans risk being put in the position of trying to protect the four fingers of private health insurance. <br> Our health-care system is wasteful. We spend far too much money with relatively little to show for it. That would be of little concern if individuals were wasting their own money. However, because close to 90 percent of personal health-care spending is paid for by third parties, we are wasting each other's money. This approach has its attractions; as individuals, we all want unlimited access to medical services without having to pay for them. <br> However, this is not sustainable. Employer-provided health insurance is unraveling, as workers are getting less take-home pay while employers are shelling out more to compensate workers in the form of health care. Medicare is even less viable. It faces tens of trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities, meaning the gap between what future beneficiaries have been promised and the taxes that we expect to collect to fund those promises. Rather than make hard choices to restrain costs, the political mechanism works to satisfy existing constituencies now and pass the liability on to future generations. <br> Some form of restraint in our choice of medical procedures is going to be necessary. The debate we should be having is over whether restraint in our use of medical services should be initiated by government officials or left to consumers. The Democrats want to avoid that debate. Instead, they make it sound as if they can make excess health-care spending disappear by magic. But even if we were to stipulate for the sake of argument that all of the supposed savings from preventive care, electronic medical records, and eliminating the waste and greed supposedly inflicted by insurance companies and doctors will actually materialize, the excessive use of medical procedures would still be the main problem with our health-care system. <br> Both government rationing and consumer cost-sharing seem unpleasant. The debate between the two approaches would not be one-sided. But until Democrats are willing to stand up toe-to-toe and have that debate, we will not see any move toward cost-effective health-care reform. <br> Assuming such a debate took place, how might one advocate consumer-driven health care within it? I believe we need to do three things. <br> First, government assistance should take the form of vouchers, given to people based on need. Government must end the practice of reimbursing health-care providers for services. Instead, consumers with low incomes or expensive pre-existing conditions should be given vouchers that compensate for their disadvantages. Consumers can then decide which health-care services best meet their needs, based on what they can afford given their own resources and the vouchers. <br> Second, Medicare should be phased out - by gradually raising the age of eligibility - in favor of a system that encourages people to save for the health coverage they will need in their old age. This is the only way to fund health care for the elderly on a sustainable basis. People should be given savings targets and tax credits that help them meet those targets. <br> And third, private health insurance should be deregulated. Affordable health insurance requires radical changes to the way health-insurance policies are designed today. In order to get there, we need less regulation of health insurance, not more. My hope is that the industry would come up with plans that pay claims to only those who fall within the top 2 or 3 percent in terms of health-care needs; those who need basic care would pay out of pocket. Health insurance would look like fire insurance. Few of us would make claims, and premiums would be affordable. <br> I am under no illusion that my ideas for health-care policy are going to play a role in the debate this year. However, by the same token, the public ought to be under no illusion that what the politicians are calling health-care reform offers any hope for a real solution to the compounding cost of American health care. <br> By Arnold KlingReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 Sasha Abramsky,a freelance journalist and senior fellow at Demos, is the author, most recently, of Breadline USA: The Hidden Scandal of American Hunger and How to Fix It.<hr width="50%">If that old adage still holds true, then the nation may soon see a gradual backpedaling from the criminal justice policies that have led to wholesale incarceration in recent decades. <br> For the most populous state in the union is on the verge of insolvency--partly because it didn't set aside a rainy-day fund during the boom years; partly because its voters recently rejected a series of initiatives that would have allowed a combination of tax increases, spending cuts and borrowing to help stabilize the state's finances during the downturn; partly because it has spent the past quarter-century funneling tens of billions of dollars into an out-of-control correctional system. Now, as California's politicians contemplate emergency cuts to deal with a $24 billion hole in the state budget, old certainties are crumbling. <br> The state with the toughest three-strikes law in the land and a prison population of more than 150,000 is facing the real possibility of having to release tens of thousands of inmates early in order to pare its $10 billion annual correctional budget. At the same time, an increasing number of the state's political figures are challenging the basic tenets of the "war on drugs," the culprit most responsible for the spike in prison populations over the past thirty years; they argue that the country's harsh drug policies are not financially viable and no longer command majority support among the voting public. <br> Similar stories are unfolding around the country; in Washington, federal officials are talking about drug-policy reform and, more generally, sentencing reform in a way that has not been heard in the halls of power for more than a generation. <br> For old-time politicians, who have spent the past three-plus decades navigating the country's roiling tough-on-crime waters, the changes are almost unfathomable. Onetime California governor and current gubernatorial hopeful Jerry Brown, for example, has spent decades trying to erase the public's memory of his liberal tenure in the 1970s, when California's prison population shrank to well below 30,000. As a part of that remodeling, he has assiduously courted the California Correctional Peace Officers' Association, the trade union representing the state's prison guards. Now, with his war chest flush with CCPOA funds, Brown won't do anything to challenge tough-on-crime orthodoxies. <br> Yet many newer political faces view the current moment as something of an opportunity. For Betty Yee, chair of California's Board of Equalization--the office responsible for collecting sales tax in the Golden State--the changes, especially around drug-law enforcement, can't come soon enough. Sitting at her conference table high up in one of downtown Sacramento's few sky-rises, Yee has marijuana on her mind. Specifically, she has become an outspoken advocate for legalizing pot for residents older than 21. Her friend Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, a former San Francisco city councilman, is pushing just such a bill in the State Legislature. Yee wants to levy fees on business owners applying for marijuana licenses, impose an excise tax on sellers and charge buyers a sales tax. Do it properly, and the state could reap about $1.3 billion a year, she has estimated. "Marijuana is so easily available. Why not regulate it like alcohol and tobacco?" she says, and gain additional tax revenue into the bargain? <br> Not so many years back, any public figure who dared to advocate such reforms would have been shunned by much of the establishment. It's a measure of how much things have changed that Yee and Ammiano's proposal is being taken seriously across the board. In fact, shortly after I met with Yee, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger--whose office declined my request for an interview for this article--announced that the state should at least consider the merits of pot legalization. He wasn't advocating it, he was careful to stress, but he did think the time was ripe to debate the issue. <br> "The budget is so bad now, the populism of the issue is beginning to work here in the Legislature," Ammiano says as he paces back and forth in his office, toward the bookshelves with the four martini glasses and Golden Gate Bridge bookends and then away again. On the wall near the receptionist's desk hangs a huge poster from the movie Milk. <br> "Everyone thinks it's Cheech and Chong," he says with a laugh, describing the marijuana legalization bill. "But there's a lot of policy wonks" supporting it. <br> "There's very conservative support from the oddest sources and locations." The GOP chair in the state, as well as Tom Campbell, a Republican gubernatorial hopeful, have indicated their support for his bill, Ammiano declares. "When it starts to cost more money than it's worth even in the eyes of the pooh-bahs, then you can accomplish something." <br> Over the past three decades, California has tripled the number of prisons it operates, has more than quintupled its prison population and has gone from spending $5 on higher education for every dollar it spent on corrections to a virtual dead-heat in spending. That puts it in the same boat as Michigan, Vermont, Oregon, Connecticut and Delaware--all of which, according to estimates by the Pew Charitable Trust, spend as much or more on prisons than on colleges. California is also under federal court order to implement costly improvements in the delivery of medical and mental healthcare services in prisons and to release close to a third of the prison population--about 55,000 inmates--to improve conditions for those remaining behind bars. <br> Schwarzenegger adamantly opposed that ruling by a three-judge panel. Now, though, in the face of fiscal calamity, he is proposing cutting the prison population by tens of thousands. Of course, he is doing that not out of concern for inmates' well-being, or out of a sense that many sentences are disproportionate to the crime, but simply because the state can no longer pay its bills. Schwarzenegger believes he can save several hundred million dollars by releasing some categories of inmates, in particular nonviolent offenders who are in the country illegally and stand to be deported upon early release. <br> To save money, he's also talking about firing hard-working guards (a far better, but costlier, option would be to scale back the prison system and to retrain surplus guards to work in other venues), and he's asking for close to $1 billion in cuts to vital prison drug-treatment, education and job-training services. At the same time, since this is all about shaving dollars off budgets rather than intelligent criminal justice system reform, there's no talk of investing in crucial re-entry infrastructure. <br> In short, it looks like California will go about a necessary scaling back of the correctional system exactly the wrong way. But however grudgingly state officials are approaching the issue, at least they recognize that the magnitude of prison spending is a problem. Down the road, when Californians start thinking beyond the crisis moment, that new understanding will shape policy responses for years to come. It will both feed off and help create a new national sentiment that being "tough on crime" isn't necessarily being smart on crime. <br> Tough-on-crime rhetoric, and the policies and institutions that grow from it, emerged from Nixon's Silent Majority tactics, from his recasting of politics as a series of debates around "values" rather than bread-and-butter issues. And in the same way the 2008 presidential election ended that peculiar chapter in American history, so too did it end the monotone cry that we could incarcerate our way out of deep-rooted social and economic problems. Despite a few halfhearted GOP attempts to accuse Democrats of being weak on drugs and public safety--Obama had, after all, written about his drug use during his teenage and early adult years, which, according to the old calculus, should have made him an easy target for scaremongers--neither presidential candidate played the tough-on-crime card. It was a nonissue for most voters and thus for the candidates. <br> In fact, recent Zogby polling commissioned by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency suggests that close to eight in ten Americans favor alternatives to incarceration for low-level nonviolent offenders. Another Zogby poll, from last fall, found that just more than three-quarters of Americans felt the "war on drugs" was a failure. The sea change in public opinion holds in California too. In late March the Los Angeles Times ran a column asking readers their opinion on marijuana legalization. So far 4,927 people have replied, and 94 percent of them favor legalization. A Field Poll in April found that 56 percent of Californians favor legalizing and taxing pot. <br> The new atmosphere is most apparent vis--vis the Obama administration's move away from "war on drugs" rhetoric and toward a harm-reduction strategy. Gil Kerlikowske, the new head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, has made it clear that he prefers treatment over punishment for drug users, a preference he brings from his time as a reform-oriented police chief in Seattle. Putting money where its mouth is, the new team has increased funding for the Bush-era Second Chance Act, intended to connect released inmates with community services such as housing, family counseling and addiction treatment. Support is also growing for the creation of more drug and mental health courts across the country. Finally, there are the promises being made by drug policy leaders in Washington that state medical marijuana laws will be respected rather than trampled, as they have been for more than a decade. <br> A related issue involves the infamous discrepancy in sentences for crack- versus powder-cocaine crimes. Vice President Biden was one of the architects of these laws--which is why his repudiation of them in recent years has been so significant. The day after Obama's inauguration, the president's website mentioned the importance of eliminating these discrepancies--as well as of promoting needle-exchange programs and expanding the nation's embryonic network of drug courts. The House recently held hearings on the sentencing discrepancy issue. <br> For Margaret Dooley-Sammuli, deputy state director of the Drug Policy Alliance in Southern California, sacrosanct legislative underpinnings of the "war on drugs" are starting to look like the Berlin Wall, "up one day and down the next"--seemingly impregnable; in reality, utterly fragile. Over the past few years, an increasing number of localities have dabbled in ways to simply walk away from the "war on drugs." Initiatives in several states and cities, including Denver; Missoula, Montana; Albany County, Oregon; and Seattle have mandated that law enforcement agencies deprioritize marijuana arrests. Several cities have begun needle-exchange programs. And states like California have passed citizens' initiatives mandating that first-time drug offenders be channeled into treatment programs in lieu of prisons. <br> Then there's Virginia Senator Jim Webb's legislation creating a blue-ribbon commission on criminal justice reform, with a mandate to put all questions on the table during its eighteen-month tenure--from drug law reform to the restoration of judicial discretion in sentencing, from parole reforms to different approaches to gangs, border patrol, prison architecture and the like. Webb has been pushing for systemic criminal justice reform for years; in 2009, he believes, it will acquire legs. During a telephone interview for this article, Webb said that President Obama "has personally called me on this, and he's very supportive of the idea of moving forward." Across the aisle many Republican senators, including senior figures like Lindsey Graham, have also expressed support for the idea. <br> The bipartisan backing for Webb's commission is partly a response to the escalating drug-and-gang crisis south of the border. There's a growing recognition in US policy and law enforcement circles that government dysfunction, phenomenal levels of street violence and the rising power of drug cartels are threatening to move from being a Latin American problem to one that destroys the integrity of the Mexican state and risks spilling over more heavily into the American Southwest. Nobody, no matter their political stripe, wants the Tijuana-ization or Jurez-ization of Phoenix or Los Angeles, of San Diego or El Paso. <br> "It really is a serious problem in this country," Webb argues. "The transnational gangs or syndicates are bringing a tremendous amount of drugs into this country." <br> To get a handle on that problem involves thinking of ways to neutralize these gangs, which inevitably leads to a discussion of partial drug decriminalization or legalization. Why? Because once the drug market is no longer confined to the shadows--once it is regulated and taxed, as alcohol was after Prohibition ended in 1933--the violence that accompanies struggles for control of that illicit market will disappear. After years of denying this truth and assuming that the country could incarcerate its way out of the drug-abuse epidemic, a number of American politicians, Webb included, are touting that seemingly paradoxical fact. Want to get really tough on crime? Well, do the smart thing: start working out ways to neutralize the drug cartels, start talking about at least limited forms of decriminalization or legalization. <br> It is, Webb argues, "a fair issue for this commission. Every piece of it should be fair game." <br> For an administration like Obama's that prides itself on thinking outside the box, systemic drug policy reform is an intriguing prospect. An increasing number of law enforcement people and judges have also decided that this is an idea worth running with. <br> "I've never seen so much interest," says retired Orange County superior court judge James Gray, who has been advocating marijuana legalization since the early 1990s. "My phone is ringing much more than it ever has before." <br> "We need to ask, Is there a more sensible approach?" argues Norm Stamper, who, like Kerlikowske, is a former chief of police of Seattle who believes the criminal justice system is broken. "And the answer is prevention and education and treatment." <br> After decades of being on the defensive, progressive criminal justice reformers suddenly have a receptive audience. New York, which has closed some of its prisons in the past decade, has spent the last few years unraveling the tangled web created by the 1970s-era Rockefeller drug laws. Michigan, Louisiana and several other states have also scaled back their harshest mandatory drug sentences. The State of Washington is looking at how to redefine low-end drug and property crimes as misdemeanors rather than felonies. And in Michigan, which allows a $100 theft to trigger a four-year prison sentence, legislators are pushing to make the threshold $1,000 instead, so as to reduce the number of low-end offenders pushed into long-term incarceration and hobbled for life by felony convictions. <br> Meanwhile, correctional system administrators in Georgia, Illinois and Arkansas have started the long, hard task of reforming their systems from within even without a new consensus emerging on the issue. <br> Howard Wooldridge, a retired police detective from Bath, Michigan, who advocates in DC for criminal justice system reform, says the moment is ripe for change. "I've been doing this for twelve years, and this is by far the most perfect storm." <br> America isn't about to abandon all of its "tough on crime" tenets. Nor should it in all instances. The three-strikes law will likely remain in place for violent offenders, as will the growing body of laws limiting where sex offenders may live. Violent crimes will probably continue to trigger longer sentences than they did before the get-tough movement. And while some inmates will qualify for early release, many sentenced to long terms at the height of the tough-on-crime years will stay in prison. But out of economic necessity and because of shifting mores, the country will likely get more selective, and smarter, about how it uses incarceration and whom it targets for long spells behind bars. <br> This will be especially true for drug policy--the multi-tentacled beast that's sucking most people into jails and prisons. There, profound changes are likely to develop over the next few years. And when it comes to the mentally ill, momentum continues to build around mental health courts designed to get people medical and counseling help rather than simply to shunt them off to prison. States like Pennsylvania are starting to develop parallel institutions to deal with mentally ill people who run afoul of the law. Many other states will likely follow suit in the near future. Forty years after deinstitutionalization, a new consensus is emerging that prisons became an accidental, de facto alternative to mental hospitals, and that very little good has come from that development. <br> "I believe that we have a compelling national interest," explains Senator Webb, referring to systemic criminal justice reform. "That's a term that is carefully chosen. This is a national commission, but it should not be limited to looking at the federal prison system. You have to look at the whole picture and then boil it down into resolvable issues." <br> By Sasha Abramsky: Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 A clear majority of Americans -- 72 percent -- support a government-sponsored health care plan to compete with private insurers, a new CBS News/New York Times poll finds. Most also think the government would do a better job than private industry at keeping down costs and believe that the government should guarantee health care for all Americans. <br> The new poll shows the idea of a government-sponsored plan, or "public option," to be fair non-controversial, though Democrats in the Senate have considered nixing the proposal in order to win Republican support for the bill. House leaders on Friday unveiled a health care reform plan that includes a public option. <br> The poll reveals, however, the obstacles that remain in the way of the public option and broader reform efforts. Many Americans are concerned that their own health care may be compromised if the government is involved, and while they are generally willing to pay more in taxes for universal coverage, that support drops when dollar amounts are mentioned. <br> Few support -- and many are unsure about -- some other specific policy options that have been proposed, including creating a government insurance pool for purchasing health coverage. By two to one, Americans disapprove of taxing employer health benefits, and many are uncertain about it. <br> Views on health care reform are highly partisan, just as they were in 1993, the last time serious reform was debated in Washington. Republicans are largely opposed to most government involvement. <br> Despite President Barack Obama's overall popularity (63 percent approve of the president), 22 percent don't have an opinion yet about his handling of health care. Still, more approve than disapprove. <br> Government Involvement In Health Care <br> While many have criticized Mr. Obama's proposal for a public option, Americans generally see government involvement in health care in a positive light, and most support it. Fifty percent think the government would be better than insurance companies at providing medical coverage (up from 30 percent in 2007), and 59 percent think the government would be at better holding down costs (up from 47 percent in 2007). <br> More generally, 64 percent of Americans say the government should guarantee health insurance for all Americans. Just 30 percent think this is not its responsibility. Those percentages have been stable for many years. <br> When presented with the option of a government-administered health insurance plan similar to Medicare to compete with private health insurance companies, 72 percent are in favor and just 20 percent oppose. Even 50 percent of Republicans favor that option. <br> Still, the debate over government involvement in health care is highly partisan, with 61 percent of Republicans saying it is not the government's job to provide health care. Meanwhile, 85 percent of Democrats think the government does have this responsibility. Similarly, 63 percent of Republicans think government will do a worse job providing medical coverage, and 53 percent think it will do worse holding down costs. Among Democrats, about seven in 10 thinks government will do a better job on both. <br> Reactions are mixed as to whether the government should go as far as requiring all Americans to have health insurance, as long as it provides financial help to those who can't afford it on their own. Forty-eight percent think the government should require this, while 38 percent think it should not. <br> The public, however, has acknowledged the need for sweeping changes to U.S. health care, with 51 percent saying it needs fundamental changes and another 34 percent saying there is so much wrong with it that it needs to be completely rebuilt. Just 13 percent think only minor changes are necessary. <br> In addition, many Americans link problems with the health care system to broader economic problems. While 61 percent think that the rising cost of health care presents a very serious threat to the national economy, 25 percent see that threat as a somewhat serious threat. However, there is no consensus on what effect a government guarantee of health care for all would have on the economy, and more think it would hurt the economy (37 percent) than think it would help (28 percent). <br> President Obama, who receives a 63 percent approval rating overall in this poll, gets a lower approval rating on his handling of health care -- but many don't yet have an opinion. While 44 percent approve, 34 percent disapprove and 22 percent are unsure. Among Democrats, 68 percent approve, but just 13 percent of Republicans do. <br> Americans are divided when it comes to who they trust more to make the right decisions about health care policy. Just 39 percent trust President Obama, while 35 percent trust Congress. When asked which party is more likely to improve the health care system, by three to one Americans choose the Democratic Party. Even one in four Republicans thinks the Democratic Party is better-suited to reforming health care. <br> Little Support For Some Specific Care Proposals <br> One proposal to cover the cost of reform would tax the health insurance benefits workers receive from their employers, with the revenues going toward providing insurance for those without it. There is significant opposition toward this proposal: 20 percent approve, but more than twice as many -- 46 percent -- disapprove. A sizable percentage, 31 percent, is unsure. <br> Americans have more defined views on whether insurers should cover anyone who applies for coverage, regardless of whether they have a pre-existing medical condition or a prior illness, with 75 percent approving of this proposal and just 17 percent disapproving. Even if the cost of their health insurance rose, 56 percent would still approve of this measure. <br> The Costs Of Health Care Reform <br> In addition to supporting a government role in providing universal health coverage, many are willing to pay higher taxes so that everyone can be covered. But when a specific dollar amount or other cost is mentioned, support drops. <br> Overall, 57 percent of Americans would be willing to pay higher taxes so that all Americans would have health insurance they can't lose. Majorities of Democrats and independents are willing to pay higher taxes, but two thirds of Republicans are not. <br> However, when a specific dollar amount is included in the question, support drops. Just 43 percent of Americans would be willing to pay $500 a year more in taxes to pay for universal health care. <br> And although 64 percent of Americans think the government should guarantee health insurance for everyone, they are less supportive when a direct cost is mentioned. If the cost of their own insurance were to rise, support for a government guarantee of insurance for all drops to 47 percent. <br> Similarly, 68 percent are very or somewhat concerned government involvement would limit access to care, while 53 percent are concerned they may have to change doctors as a result of government involvement. <br> Most Americans who have health insurance are fairly happy with the cost and quality of their own care, but perceptions of the country's health care in general are much more negative. In terms of quality, 77 percent say they are satisfied with their own care, but only 48 percent are satisfied with the quality of care for the country as a whole. Fifty percent are satisfied with the cost of their own care while just 19 percent are satisfied with costs nationwide. <br> More than four out of five Americans are concerned about the health care costs they and their family might face in the coming years, including 49 percent who are very concerned. Those with lower incomes are more concerned than those with higher incomes, and nearly six in 10 Americans aged 30 to 64 are very concerned. Among those without health insurance, about six in 10 are very concerned. <br> One in five report they or someone in their household have had to go without a test, treatment or procedure that their doctor recommended because their health insurance plan wouldn't cover it. Among those with health insurance, 15 percent say they have gone without medical treatment. 
 Steven F. Hayward is F. K. Weyerhaeuser Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and the author of The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counter-Revolution, 1980-1989, forthcoming in August from CrownForum.<br>In the New York Times this weekend, John Harwood revisited the debate between conservatives and Republicans over whether it is time to "rethink the Reagan mystique." Does anyone really think the major media outlets covering this intramural argument really have conservative success in mind? <br> Now, that's not to say that the argument isn't a worthy one or should be suppressed - NRO has hosted some fruitful discussion on the issue. But Americans should approach such stories with a grain of salt, since many of them fail to get a few basic things straight. <br> Yes, I have several big dogs in this fight. My copious (and revisionist) narrative history of the Reagan presidency is coming out in August, featuring a special emphasis on the difficult domestic-policy story, rather than the dramatic Cold War story that is easier to tell - and I hope all NRO readers will rush out and buy it. The book is not all cheerleading for a happier time for our movement: It contains a number of criticisms of Reagan. But the criticisms I'm hearing now seem wide of the mark, though - when they're not simply wrong. <br> There was no Reagan "mystique." Study him closely and you see that he worked very hard at becoming a good politician, and part of that hard work was invested in concealing just how hard he worked at it. Too many conservatives think it suffices simply to call themselves "Reagan Republicans" and mouth a few optimistic generalities (fill in your least favorite radio talk-show host here.) <br> Now, I hate to disagree with David Frum, who offered some of the earliest cogent criticisms of the failures of the Reagan years in Dead Right, but he capitulates to the conventional wisdom when he says that "the most dangerous legacy Reagan bequeathed his party was his legacy of cheerful indifference to detail." I sentence Brother Frum to a close reading of Reagan's diaries, and perhaps a few days in the Reagan Library reading the declassified transcripts of White House meetings, all of which decisively refute this tired clich. It's clear that Reagan was hardly disinterested in the daily details of the 1986 tax-reform process, and he was an active participant in every annual-budget fight. Reagan was also intimately involved in the arms-for-hostages debacle - not to his credit, of course. (In my forthcoming book, I sum up one installment of the affair thus: "Through all the murkiness of the decisions made throughout the entire affair, however, one fact is clear - the Iran arms-for-hostages initiative carried on because Ronald Reagan wanted it to.") Reagan may have ignored the EPA, HUD - make your own list of rightly ignored favorites - but that redounds to his credit; I think it was Wellington who said that sensible men concentrate on the essential things. <br> Unfamiliarity with the historical facts on Reagan is one thing. Reshaping them is quite another. I was startled by Harwood's quote from Indiana governor Mitch Daniels: "I don't use [Reagan] publicly as a reference point." Well, fine; but back in 1989, Daniels said, "The Reagan years will be for conservatives what the Kennedy years remain for liberals: the reference point, the breakthrough experience - a conservative Camelot." Well, which is it? Has Daniels changed his mind - or has Harwood done a little reshaping of his own here by quoting Daniels selectively? <br> Back in 1989, Daniels added this: "At the same time, no lesson is plainer than that the damage of decades cannot be repaired in any one administration." This is why I have argued here on NRO that it is precisely the failures and shortcomings of the Reagan years that should be the focus of our debate; here I'm probably close to the same page as Brother Frum, but we differ on the specifics. Frum, in his most recent Bloggingheads exchange with Brink Lindsey, went so far as to say that Republicans might have been better off had neither Barry Goldwater nor Reagan been nominated in 1964 and 1980, respectively. (I think he's just trying to test the efficaciousness of my new blood-pressure medicine - and give Rush an embolism.) <br> Such debates can get rancorous in a hurry - which is what I think the Left and the media would like to see. Let me shift ground slightly and challenge the Reagan critics this way: Why do we study and praise Lincoln or Churchill? Because we think we're going to see "another" Lincoln or Churchill? Of course not: We study them for their example of practical political judgment. Britain didn't get another Churchill - they got Thatcher, for whom Churchill's examples (even his mistakes, such as his imprudent Hayek-inspired "Gestapo" speech of July 1945) made a strong impression. We are not going to see "another" Reagan. But we can and should learn from a close study of the man, and apply usable lessons to different circumstances. <br> Such a prospect seems remote at present, with Democrats ascendant and led by a charismatic young president. Political success for the GOP, we are sometimes told, will require adopting policies closer to those of Barack Obama than to Ronald Reagan. Here again, history is instructive. <br> Jack Germond and Jules Witcover wrote in their book about the 1984 American presidential election, "Democrats preferred not to face the evidence that their guiding light of half a century - the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt and its successor mutations from Truman through Carter and Mondale - had been all but snuffed out by the voters as the preferred framework for governmental policy at the national level." Today, FDR and the New Deal are back with a vengeance, of course: Judging from his books, Obama clearly considers FDR a model and inspiration. In other words, conservatism finds itself in a place roughly analogous to liberalism's 25 years ago. Reaganism -in a modified or even high-octane form - might make a comeback, too. <br> We must also rightly judge the role of chance and contingency in human affairs and political fortunes. Brother Frum writes: "It was not Goldwater who made Reagan possible. It was Carter. Had Carter governed more successfully, the Goldwater disaster would have been just a disaster, with no silver lining. And there was nothing about the Goldwater disaster that made the Carter failure more necessary, more inevitable." There is something to this, as Reagan himself acknowledged. He told the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Grenada invasion in 1983, "If Jimmy Carter had sent in two more helicopters to Iran, he'd be giving you this briefing right now." <br> We can apply this same lesson to Lincoln, Churchill, FDR, and others who come to mind. Only thoroughgoing Machiavellians think humans can control chance or fate; the rest of us should follow Churchill's counsel to "assume that the favorable and adverse chances equate, and then eliminate them both from the calculation." To which I would add that, like Reagan (and Churchill), I do not believe that Chance is indifferent to human excellence. <br> By Steven F.

 Jacob S. Hacker is co-director of the Center for Health, Economic, and Family Security at U.C. Berkeley; a fellow at the New America Foundation; and the editor of "Health at Risk: America's Ailing Health System--and How to Heal It." He's also a regular guest contributor to The New Republic. <br>In the fast-moving debate over health care, no idea invites more admiration or ire than the "public health insurance option"--or what I've been trying to get people to describe as "public plan choice. The idea is overwhelmingly popular with Americans, garnering 85 percent support in a new independent poll from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. It's also compelling and simple: If you don't have coverage from your employer, you can choose from a menu of health insurance products that includes not just a range of private health plans but also a public insurance plan provided on the same terms nationwide. <br> The argument for this new public plan is that it would have lower administrative costs; greater leverage to hold down prices; and the transparency, broad patient data, and incentives for long-term investment in health to improve the quality and efficiency of care. Along with new regulations, it would also be the primary check on a private insurance industry that has, for too long, neglected both quality and efficiency, focusing its creative energies instead on new ways to shift costs onto and screen out the sick. <br> The idea of public plan choice was part of all the leading Democratic candidates' health plans, Senator Max Baucus' November 2008 White Paper, and the vision of reform articulated earlier this year by key congressional Democrats. All with little attention outside health policy circles--until conservatives, health insurers, and some provider groups decided the public plan was public enemy number one. And so, the misinformation campaign began: A public plan available alongside private plans only for Americans without workplace insurance was suddenly described as a "government takeover" of medicine, the "road to rationing," and (that old standby) "socialized medicine." Republicans drew their lines in the sand, and Democrats started their favorite parlor game: compromising among themselves even before the real debate begins. <br> In most of the discussion of public plan choice, including my own writings, the plan has been as described as "Medicare-like"--a national plan roughly modeled after Medicare that would, however, be separate from Medicare and compete on a level playing field with private plans. That is still the leading model, and thoughtful Democrats have usefully fleshed it out (more on that shortly). But the last couple months has featured a proliferation of putative compromise alternatives to the public plan, from creating a bunch of state plans modeled after self-insured health plans for state workers, to chartering some kind of nonprofit (national or state) plan that would be not quite governmental and not quite private, to "triggering" the public plan only if the situation in American health care got too bad. (Aren't we there yet?) Some of these ideas had some of the elements of the original vision of a Medicare-like public plan, but none had substantial recommendations other that they were ostensibly more politically salable. <br> Which brings us to Senator Kent Conrad, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who has announced with much fanfare that he has solved the public plan problem--er, "problem." His solution? Allow consumers, states, and anybody else so inclined to create cooperatives that would purchase health care for their members. Conrad has not offered much in the way of specifics on what the cooperatives would look like or how they would be chartered. Most important, he has offered no reason to think that the cooperatives he envisions could do any of the crucial things that a competing public plan must do. <br> An easy way to think of the public plan's functions is the three "B"s: We need a national public plan that is available on similar terms in all parts of the nation as a backup. This plan has to have the ability to improve the quality and efficiency of care to act as a benchmark for private insurance. And it has to be able to challenge provider consolidation that has driven up prices to serve as a cost-control backstop. <br> Cooperatives might be able to provide some backup in some parts of the nation, but they are not going to have the ability to be a cost-control backstop, much less a benchmark for private plans, because they are not going to have the reach or authority to implement innovative delivery and payment reforms. And so Conrad's idea appears to be yet another compromised compromise that cuts the heart out the idea of public plan choice on the alter of political expediency. <br> That's not to say that encouraging cooperatives would be bad policy. In fact, Conrad has resurrected an old health care idea that taps into Americans' strong belief in direct community control (what the political scientist James Morone has called "the democratic wish.") Cooperatives of various sorts have been discussed and sometimes created to provide health care in the past. After the Great Depression, the Farm Security Administration encouraged the development of health cooperatives--which at one point had about 600,000 members, mostly in rural areas. But the cooperatives crumbled in the face of physician resistance (including boycotts), the lack of financial wherewithal of the cooperatives themselves, and the eventual withdrawal of government support. <br> Even today's remnants of the cooperative movement don't provide the most inspiring of lessons. The only survivor of the 1940s experiment, Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, does continue to operate as a tightly managed health maintenance organization, paying doctors on a salaried basis. It is well regarded, and indeed, was found to be remarkably efficient by the RAND Corporation as part of a famous 1970s analysis of the effect of insurance cost-sharing. Unfortunately, it's now little different from other nonprofit HMOs, with around a half million members in Idaho and Washington State. By contrast, WellPoint--the nation's largest insurer and a major force behind the defeat of health care reform in another West Coast state, California--has more than 30 million members. <br> And that's the story of purchasing cooperatives writ large. They have been hard to establish or extend, and when they have been established, they've been under constant siege from doctors and insurers and eventually largely operated as private insurance plans or weak purchasing arrangements. It is hard to see how any sort of decentralized cooperative model could do what a public plan can do. <br> </quote>But what if the cooperatives were national? In an interview with Ezra Klein of the Washington Post, Conrad has suggested that a national cooperative could be created on behalf of consumers. This would be a distinct improvement over the decentralized approach, especially if Congress established the cooperative and provided federal startup funds. Health law expert Timothy Jost has argued that the only viable cooperative strategy would involve "a federal charter to license and regulate a national non-profit coop, with coop governance prescribed by Congress." <br> But a national cooperative would still fall so dramatically short of a public plan that it would only be attractive in addition to a national public plan, not as a substitute for it. Indeed, this point holds more generally. Given the need for countervailing power in the health care market, the federal government should encourage a range of consumer-oriented health plans and state-based public plan options, so long as there is also a national public plan capable of being a backup, benchmark, and backstop. <br> Conrad's proposal does have one virtue: It presses advocates to be clearer about what public plan choice should do. Moreover, it is reasonable to be concerned about whether a public plan will be overly politicized or compete on a playing field that is not truly level. But that is an argument for creating an independent governing body for the public plan and for making sure that the public plan competes on equal terms with the private plans--for example, by requiring it to abide by the same basic rules as private plans and ensuring that, outside of setup costs, it is self-sustaining (that is, funded by premiums and subsidies available to low- and middle-income enrollees in all plans, rather than general government revenues). <br> The saddest part of this is that Conrad's announcement has overshadowed a truly constructive contribution to the debate by his colleague on the Senate Finance Committee: Jay Rockefeller. Rockefeller knows a thing or two about health care, having played a leadership role on the issue for decades. And this week he put out a compelling vision of public plan choice with the evocative title of the "Consumers Health care Act." Rockefeller's public plan would be called the "Consumer Choice Health Plan," and it would be a self-sustaining national public plan that would have to be abide by the same rules as private insurance plans and be run by the federal government separately from the new insurance pool that would oversee the competition among public and private plans. As the press release that accompanied the plan puts it: "By bringing a competitive public plan option to the table, private insurance companies will be driven to provide Americans with better value for their health care at a better price, in contrast to the current private insurance framework, which is focused on avoiding risk and increasing their profits." <br> Rockefeller also calls for creating an a nonprofit, consumer-driven organization to evaluate and give ratings to all health insurance products offered through the new insurance pool. Now that is a cooperative-sounding idea that might really work. <br> The attractions of Rockefeller's consumerist proposal make all the more transparent that there's no substantive case for Conrad's cooperative idea as an alternative to a public plan. We can design a good national public plan focused on patients, not profits, that could be up and running quickly. But is there a political case for Conrad co-op cop-out? <br> Conrad says that abandoning public plan choice is necessary because there are few wavering Democrats in the Senate who won't support it. If you have been following this debate, you are probably wondering why that is so consequential, since leading Democrats have suggested they could pass health care reform through the budget reconciliation process, which means they would need to get only a majority of Senate votes rather than the sixty needed to stop a filibuster. (Currently, the Democrats have fifty-nine votes, but most expect they will have sixty when the Minnesota election imbroglio is resolved.) But Conrad has consistently indicated that he does not think the reconciliation process is viable, notwithstanding his pledge to the White House to support its use if necessary. So he is saying that an anemic, almost certainly unrealistic proposal is what has to fill the check box on the Democrats' wish list next to "public plan." <br> But is Conrad right about the politics? A reform proposal that doesn't have a public plan is bound to cost more (or do less), since a public plan can save money--and save money in ways that the Congressional Budget Office will score. Get rid of the plan, and reform's overall price tag goes up, making it harder to pass. And if reform without a public plan were to pass, it would simply not work as well, or perhaps at all. It would be more likely to run into problems because budget expenditures turn out to be higher, or implementation problems when private insurance doesn't live up to its promises. That could sink reform before it even gets underway. In other words, maybe there's a political risk to including a public plan. But there's also a big political--and policy--risk to excluding it. <br> Strategically, Conrad's approach is more like capitulation than compromise. Reconciliation or no reconciliation, the right political path for achieving reform doesn't run through a minefield of endless preemptive concessions. When President Bush successfully enacted tax cuts in 2001 (through the reconciliation process, it should be noted), the question was simple: tax cuts, yea or nay? Many Democrats eventually signed on, not because they liked what Bush was peddling, but because they didn't want to be against tax cuts. And tax cuts mostly for the rich weren't all that popular. By contrast, there's little question about the popularity of bold action on health care. <br> Before the year is out, Republicans (and some Democrats) need to be asked: health care reform, yea or nay? And the reform package they're asked to vote up or down had better be good--which means, among other things, contain a true public plan--because there will not be another bite at this political apple for a very long time. <br> By Jacob HackerReprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 Gary Andres is vice chairman of research at Dutko Worldwide in Washington, D.C., and a regular contributor to The Weekly Standard Online.<hr width="50%">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke sounded like a fiscal Paul Revere last week, warning Congress about the dangers of an advancing army of debt. <br> Bernanke said policymakers need a bold plan to correct the deficit or else face dire consequences. Our "near-term challenges must not be allowed to hinder timely consideration of the steps needed to address fiscal imbalances. Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term, we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth." <br> He's not alone. The Congressional Budget Office and private forecasters share these worries. Concern about the president's handling of the deficit and debt are also spreading to the general public. While 67 percent approve of Obama's job performance overall, only 45 percent of Americans approve of Obama's handling of federal spending, and 46 percent of his handling of the federal budget deficit, according to a new Gallup poll. <br> The White House is a lot better at dealing with public criticism than balancing the budget. Earlier this week Obama called for restoration of "pay as you go" (PAYGO) rules to curb the mounting debt, which means any new spending would be offset by other cuts or tax increases. But as Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-ND) has said, it may be too little to late. He told ABC News, the plan "does not address the deficits and debt projected under existing policy." <br> For now, the White House's posture of periodically genuflecting to the altar of deficits while conducting a revival of new spending at least makes political sense. The new president campaigned on a platform of change and activism. His instincts and ideology lead him to larger government. Large majorities in Congress further empower his goals. His liberal backers waited at least eight years for this moment. Truly promoting fiscal austerity at this moment in time is like ordering rice cakes at a steakhouse. <br> But Obama may have a broader ambition. He wants to be Ronald Reagan in reverse. Running up the debt, creating a host of new budgetary commitments and enlarging the government's role in the economy will take generations to unwind. And the engines of bigger government also require fuel in the form of taxes. <br> Reagan did the opposite. He cut taxes to make government expansion harder. Obama is transposing Reagan. He is growing government to make future tax cuts more difficult. <br> True, Obama promised tax cuts to 95 percent of Americans. That leaves a small percentage of individuals and businesses to bear the burden. Based on budget forecasts and other White House policy proposals, his math seems fuzzy. Maybe most Americans won't pay higher federal income taxes for the time being, but Obama's plans to enlarge the federal government could mean higher out-of-pocket costs for individuals and businesses due to legislation ranging from climate change to health care reform. <br> Further, Democrats in Congress are determined to outbid even Obama in federalizing more programs. For example, buried in the energy bill the House will consider in upcoming weeks is a provision giving the federal government new powers over local building codes, according to a recent Washington Post editorial. And based on the Democratic majority's plans in a host of other areas, there is a lot more to come. <br> But one thing is clear: tax cuts don't fit into the White House's long-term fiscal picture. And for a president who wants to be Reagan in reverse, that's just fine. Just as Reagan used tax cuts to trim the size and scope of Washington's ambitions, Obama is enlarging the government to take them off the table. <br> Liberal budget experts already join the chorus. Given the grim fiscal realities, cutting taxes would be "irresponsible." How can we reduce revenues given all our obligations and a sea of red ink? <br> </quote>Many still think Obama will pivot at some point in time and get serious about the deficit. But new federal programs and regulations develop stakeholders and interest group support. Like dandelions, they tend to multiply rather than go away on their own. And the President's PAYGO gambit won't make much of a difference either. Iowa senator Charles Grassley said on Tuesday the plan is a "fig leaf to appease those who say they support fiscal discipline but continue to vote for more spending." Many believe PAYGO also makes future tax cuts more difficult--another reverse Reagan outcome. <br> Finding fuel for new economic growth is Obama's larger challenge. Reducing the tax burden is more than just ideological symbolism; it's an important tool to propel economic growth. With an enlarged public sector, and tax cuts off the table, we run the risk of entering a fiscal death spiral: a sluggish economy means shrinking tax revenues, producing even larger deficits and debt. Financing these growing obligations also means higher interest rates, which hampers economic growth even more. It's hard to see how the current path doesn't lead to higher taxes to close budgetary gaps, which again, is a reverse Reagan outcome. <br> Reagan believed tax cuts served not only as a stimulus for economic growth, but as a tool to keep the size of the federal government in check. Obama is trying the antithesis. By growing the size and reach of Washington he makes tax cuts seem like an impossible dream--truly a nightmare for those who agree with Ronald Reagan's belief that a bloated federal leviathan is inconsistent with both fiscal stability and economic growth. <br> By Gary AndresReprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard 
 This column was written by Irwin Stelzer.<hr width="50%">In the days when it was still necessary to explain to one's parents just what an economist does, my first job was to crank out a forecast of economic activity in the coming quarter. Get it wrong often enough, and you were gone. More senior employees assigned themselves the longer-term outlooks: their forecasts would be long forgotten by the time actual data became available. <br> That was then and this is now. So I will exercise the prerogative of seniority and shorten my comments on the current economic outlook to make room for a longer-range look at the post-Obama world in which we Americans will be living. <br> Green shoots continue to sprout. The supply of homes for sale dropped; banks have survived the stress tests in better shape than many feared and are going about the process of raising any needed capital; even traditionally cautious European Central Banker Jean-Claude Trichet thinks the global economy is starting to recover; the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says several of the world's leading economies are turning up; Paul Otellini, CEO of recently fined Intel, says demand for computer chips has bottomed out; spending on technology has stabilized; Honda is ramping up its auto production a bit. <br> But, as usual, there are counter-signals: continued falls in house prices, weakness in the labor market, an impending wave of defaults on commercial property loans, and heaven-only-knows what Congress might concoct. <br> Longer-term, there is little doubt that we will be paying more for energy. On Wednesday Democrats in the House agreed on a cap-and-trade system that will put a price on CO2 emissions, a cost that will be passed on to consumers in the prices of electricity and other energy sources. Agreement was reached when the bill's enthusiasts bribed recalcitrant congressmen with free pollution permits for important constituents in the utility, oil and other industries. Which is too bad: cap-and-trade is a woefully inefficient way of imposing emissions costs on polluters. Experience in Europe shows that the price of permits fluctuates so wildly that potential producers of renewable energy aren't given a target against which to compete. A solar or wind installation that might make economic sense when users of coal have to pay $40 per ton for a permit, is uncompetitive when the price drops to $10, as it has done. <br> Energy costs will also be driven up indirectly, in a way concealed from consumers. We will pay higher taxes to cover the costs of the subsidies being lavished on solar, wind, ethanol and other parts of the energy economy by environmentalists. Or, in the case of ethanol, by politicians who equate ethanol with corn, corn with Iowa, and Iowa with the first presidential primary in 2012. Throw in the costs of a "smart grid" and all of us, especially those who have been stockpiling incandescent electric bulbs so as not to be dependent on the dangerous, malfunctioning and costly energy-saving fluorescents when the US outlaws incandescent bulbs in 2014, will pay more. <br> We will also end up paying more to borrow than we would have paid before the government decided that contracts are made to be broken. The Obama administration demonstrated in the Chrysler bankruptcy that it has no regard for the contracts that have in the past protected lenders who made their money available on the assumption that they would have a preferential claim on the borrowers' assets. Nor does it believe that contractual compensation arrangements should withstand a raised eyebrow in the White House or a raised voiced in congress. This weakening of the sanctity of contracts increases lenders' risk, and higher risk means a demand for an offsetting higher interest rate. George Will, writing in the Washington Post, notes, "The Obama administration is careless regarding constitutional values and is acquiring a tincture of lawlessness . [It] thinks contracts are written on water." <br> There will also be a major change in the structure of the financial services sector. New regulations will have a greater effect on institutions that create systemic risk than on smaller, below-the-radar enterprises. So the best and brightest will leave the job of second-vice-presidential-assistant-to-the deputy-risk-manager to the more bureaucratically inclined, and set up shop on their own. Or seek other outlets for their entrepreneurial urgings. One of the few pleasant unintended consequences of new regulations. <br> We are also certain to see the portion of our pay that we actually get to take home decline significantly. The debt that Obama is running up will have to be repaid. Already, there are grumblings in the market about the future of the dollar, with the Chinese not the only one of our creditors worrying that we will inflate our way out of our obligations. Run the presses, make dollars cheaper, and use the debased currency to repay debts. Former Comptroller General David Walker believes that we are in danger of losing our triple-A bond rating: <br> How can one justify bestowing a triple A rating on an entity with an accumulated negative net worth of more than $11,000bn [$11 trillion] and additional off-balance sheet obligations of $45,000bn? An entity that is set to run a $1,800bn-plus deficit for the current year and trillion dollar-plus deficits for years to come? <br> But inflation is not the only possibility. Instead, politicians, remembering the fate of Jimmy Carter when he allowed inflation to climb towards 20 percent, will try to restore fiscal sanity by raising taxes. Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, who supported the president's stimulus package, puts the needed tax increase at $1.1 trillion over the next decade; the International Monetary Fund puts the figure at $1.9 trillion, a sum the magnitude of which is better understood when written as $1,900,000,000,000. <br> After all, Congress won't be able to cut spending. Obama's drive towards a trillion dollar health-care tax-funded system seems to be irresistible. Drug companies will go along so they will be relieved of the cost of subsidizing lower-income folks' prescription drug needs. Insurers will go along because the law will require everyone to take some sort of coverage. Employers will go along so they can shift the cost of employee-benefit plans to taxpayers. <br> So higher taxes are in our future, as is the inevitable queuing with which patients in Canada and Britain are familiar, examples being cited by Obama's critics in television ads aimed at rousing voter opposition to his program. Polls show that most Americans are satisfied with the quality of their health care; they will be shocked at what happens to that quality. But like so much of what Obama is pushing through Congress, this "reform" will prove irreversible. <br> Finally, there are the cars we will be driving. It is difficult to predict whether the government will be able to prevent auto makers from producing the big, comfortable, safe cars consumers prefer, and shoe-horn them into smaller, European-style vehicles. But the greens and the peak-oil crowd will give it a good try. <br> Where is the outrage? Certainly among hedge fund operators vilified by Obama, the wound all the deeper because these same folks poured tens of millions into the Obama presidential campaigns. (One can forgive Hillary Clinton and John McCain their I-told-you-so smiles.) Perhaps among hard-working risk-takers who are upset by the president's distinction between "workers" and "families earning more than $250,000 per year". Perhaps, and if polls are to be believed, only perhaps, among the mass of voters worried about the rising debt burden faced by their children. We won't know until next year's congressional elections. <br> <b>Irwin M. Stelzer is a contributing editor to THE WEEKLY STANDARD and the editor of First Things. <br> By Irwin M.

 This column was written by Henry Aaron.</i><br>Behind closed doors all over Washington, serious people are working hard to design a major overhaul of the U.S. health care system. We should wish them well, but their chances of success are slim. Since yet another complete failure would be catastrophic, some attention should be given now to policies that are politically palatable, and would begin the evolution to a new and better health system. <br> Three measures will start this process. Two--improved health information technology, and investment in research that would study the comparative effectiveness of various forms of health care--have already been put in motion. The third--a national health insurance exchange--has a bipartisan heritage and can appeal to both liberals and conservatives. <br> The reasons why systemic reform of the U.S. health care system is needed are widely recognized. Rising health care spending threatens private and public budgets alike. Avoidable medical error kills or injures hundreds of thousands annually. The number of uninsured continues to grow. <br> As clear as the need for reform are the reasons why wholesale change is unlikely. Covering the uninsured will cost money now, even if other reforms promise savings later. Taxes for some will go up. Since changing the way hospitals and doctors deliver health care means changing the way millions of people do their jobs, incomes of some providers will go down. And as health care is a $2.5 trillion behemoth, those who oppose change will be well funded and fight hard. <br> Any doubts on this point should have been extinguished by the reception accorded President Obama's budget proposal to fund half of his $634 billion health reform reserve fund with increased taxes on high-bracket filers. Those whose taxes are now reduced by 33 cents or 35 cents for each dollar of itemized deductions would be limited to tax savings of only 28 cents. Not a bad idea, one might think--tax upper income households who have prospered mightily for two decades to pay for a reform that will benefit all. Think again! The Democratic chairs of the House and Senate tax writing committees ultimately condemned the proposal. Bad for charities, they declared. Other members of Congress from both parties agreed. <br> So, why do I believe that health IT, comparative effectiveness studies, and insurance exchanges will get larger-scale health reform underway? <br> Let's start with the $19 billion included in the economic recovery bill to help physicians and hospitals introduce health information technology. If well-designed, health information technology can improve care coordination, reduce administrative spending, and, perhaps most importantly, generate information that will tell researchers, inexpensively, which treatments work, which don't, and at what cost. The economic recovery bill also includes $1.1 billion to pay for such research. Though initial savings will be modest, both are essential to any rational program of pruning waste and inefficiency, and will likely become only more essential over time. <br> Still to be enacted is the seemingly drab, but strategically important, proposal to create a national health insurance exchange (or several regional ones). In the late 1980s, Alain Enthoven pointed out that no mortal human being can rationally choose among the myriad available health insurance plans. For markets to work, the number and diversity of plan features must be limited, and since insurers use a bewildering range of plan gimmicks to attract low-risk patients, the sale of insurance has to be tightly regulated. The Clinton administration was persuaded by the argument and proposed a variant of this idea in its proposal. <br> Obviously, that didn't work, but a bipartisan track record has since emerged on the issue. In 2006, when Massachusetts's Republican governor and Democratic legislature agreed to require nearly every state resident to have medical coverage, a key part of that plan was a health insurance exchange endorsed by advisers from the conservative Heritage Foundation. And in 2008, <br> Barack Obama included a similar call for a health insurance exchange in his campaign platform. This ideologically mixed history indicates that a health insurance exchange can be negotiated because it can--and should!--appeal to both conservatives and liberals. <br> Conservatives believe a well-functioning health insurance exchange will encourage genuine consumer choice in the individual health insurance market and competition among insurers, and that that, in turn, will slow spending growth. What's more, replacing Medicare, and perhaps Medicaid, with vouchers to help the elderly, poor, and disabled select among competing private plans would also become plausible--bringing us closer to the conservative Nirvana: a market-driven health insurance system. <br> To liberals, a health insurance exchange offers an efficient way to funnel subsidies to low- and moderate-income households and to expand coverage at companies that now do not offer health insurance plans. It could discourage socially wasteful marketing practices by insurers, such as competing to cherry-pick low-cost enrollees ("have we got a sports medicine program for you!!"). If linked to a mandate that everyone or nearly everyone must be insured, an exchange could end the practice of charging exorbitant premiums to the old or the sick. Also, the exchange could wield the regulatory clout that may be necessary to force modernization of health care delivery. <br> And for both, a well-functioning exchange could end "job-lock," one of the chief drawbacks of employment-based health insurance. Employers could simply pay the exchange premiums on behalf of current employees, who could keep coverage when they change jobs. <br> I don't know whether the vision of liberals or that of conservatives would be realized if a health exchange proposal were implemented --probably some of each. It would not be a first. The 1965 law that created Medicare and Medicaid was a legislative marriage of distinct initiatives--some embraced by Democrats, some by Republicans--enacted by a heavily Democratic Congress, and signed by a Democratic president. Sound familiar? A plan with bipartisan appeal would not please ideological true-believers in either party. But it can pass. And, if it does, it would set in motion a process of change that cannot be stopped. <br> Henry J.

 This story was written by Bradford Plumer.</i><br>According to today's Politico, some House Dems are fretting that Obama's climate proposals will suffer the same grim fate that health care reform did during Bill Clinton's first term. DCCC chair Chris Van Hollen, for one, has started warning that the House should "move cautiously" on the big Waxman-Markey energy bill if it's just going to die in the Senate anyway. He doesn't want vulnerable freshmen Dems to get screwed the way they did in 1994, when the House held a nerve-wracking vote to approve a (small) energy tax increase that got nixed by the Senate and turned out to be a Dem-killer in the midterms. <br> Indeed, the 1994 analogy has been sprouting up a lot lately. One environmental lobbyist recently told me he never goes anywhere without his dog-eared copy of The System, David Broder and Haynes Johnson's minute-by-minute chronicle of Clinton's failed health care push. As then, you have a Dem president with an ambitious and controversial proposal (cap-and-trade) that's being greeted with near-unanimous Republican opposition and fierce industry lobbying. And public opinion on global warming is quite malleable. That said, I'm not convinced the 1994 analogy is apt-at least not for the time being. <br> It's true, Henry Waxman hasn't lassoed up enough votes to move his big carbon-reduction bill through subcommittee. Coal-state Dems and Blue Dogs are still dissatisfied with some of the bill's details (see Kate Sheppard's round-up of the main objections). Industry groups, meanwhile, are spending a lot of money trying to derail the whole debate. The American Energy Alliance-a creation of the American Petroleum Institute and the National Association of Manufacturers-have started airing radio ads in the districts of swing voters on the energy committee. (Among other things, the ads repeat the line that the carbon-cap provisions would cost families $3,100 per year-a figure debunked by the guy who wrote the study being cited.) <br> But none of that squabbling has hit the critical stage yet. What will ultimately make or break the climate bill, it seems, is the White House's leadership. So far, Obama hasn't really waded into the debate over Waxman-Markey. Everyone knows he'd like a climate bill, but he hasn't thrown his shoulder behind specific legislation, or undertaken a sustained public push for the bill, or even started twisting any arms in Congress. As Phil Radford, the director of Greenpeace, recently told reporters, "I think right now Waxman is negotiating from a position that he doesn't have leadership from Obama." That's spot on, though that dynamic may soon change: The White House is meeting tomorrow with select House swing votes to chat about health care and cap-and-trade. <br> The big question ahead is how well Obama will be able to sell a climate bill, both to his own party and to the voters. Clinton stumbled on this point, to put it delicately. Obama, for his part, never really had to focus on salesmanship during last year's election, in part because McCain also supported a cap-and-trade proposal and didn't attack Obama over the details that will certainly face scrutiny in the months ahead. "You had two people aspiring to the presidency who had both been vocal supporters of paths to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions," Jason Grumet, a top energy advisor for Obama during the campaign, told me. "The contest was principally about identifying contrasts. So you didn't see the kind of scrutiny or aggressive messaging about caps as you might have otherwise." <br> There's one other major difference between the current climate debate and the health care fight under Clinton. Back then, once Republicans scuttled health care reform, that was that. The issue was dead. This time around, however, the EPA still has the legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases on its own-and will do so if Congress fails to move legislation. (Some legal experts even think the EPA could implement its own cap-and-trade regime on greenhouse-gas emissions, bypassing Congress entirely.) Apart from stray comments from a few members of Congress, that reality hasn't sunk in yet, but it does make outright opposition less tenable, and a repeat of '94 a lot less likely. <br> Bradford Plumer is an assistant editor at The New Republic.

 As his 100th day approaches, more than two in three Americans approve of the job Barack Obama is doing as president, a new CBS News/New York Times survey finds. <br> But while the president earns high marks from Democrats and independents, he has not won the support of Republicans, less than one third of whom approve of the president's job performance so far. <br> Mr. Obama's 68 percent approval rating at the 100 day mark is better than the ratings of his two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush (whose approval at this point was 56 percent) and Bill Clinton (whose approval was 49 percent). Going back to 1953, only two presidents - John F. Kennedy (83 percent) and Dwight Eisenhower (72 percent) - had a higher approval rating at this point in their terms. <br> The president has the overwhelming support of Democrats, nine in ten of whom approve of the president. Just 31 percent of Republicans agree, however. The party divisions are similar to those seen under President's George W. Bush and Clinton - Mr. Bush had the support of just 35 percent of Democrats at the 100 days mark, while Mr. Clinton was backed by just 26 percent of Republicans at this point. <br> Mr. Obama enjoys the approval of Americans overall on every major issue: Iraq (63 percent approval), the economy (61 percent), foreign policy (59 percent), Afghanistan (56 percent) and terrorism (55 percent). He is widely seen as a different kind of politician, one who Americans say cares about them and can unite different groups. Most say he has already made progress on critical issues and that he is tough enough to make the hard decisions required of a president. <br> There are doubts, however, that the president he will be able to end the recession and the war in Iraq by the end of his first term in office. Just 37 percent say Mr. Obama will get the country out of the recession in his first term, while 44 percent say he will end the U.S. involvement in Iraq in four years in office. Still, a majority of Americans say the president has made progress on both fronts during his first 100 days. <br> Majorities say it is either "very" or "somewhat" likely that Mr. Obama will bring about significant reform in health care (67 percent say so), immigration (59 percent) and energy policy (75 percent) during his first term - though the percentage that say such reform is "very" likely is relatively low. <br> Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed, meanwhile, say Mr. Obama's presidency has improved the U.S. image around the world. Just 11 percent say his presidency has worsened it. <br> Views Of The President: <br> Americans are split on whether Mr. Obama has made progress on changing the "way things are done in Washington." Forty-eight percent say he has done so, while 45 percent say he has not. <br> The president's personal favorable rating stands at 54 percent, a slight drop from January. At this point in his presidency, George W. Bush's personal favorable rating stood at 41 percent. Eighty percent say Mr. Obama cares at least somewhat about their needs and problems, including 54 percent who say he cares "a lot." <br> Roughly three in four Americans say the president is tough enough to make hard choices. Sixty-two percent have confidence in him to deal with an international crisis. Sixty-three percent say he will unite the country. <br> Americans believe the news media have been relatively easy on the president. Forty percent say the media have been easier on Mr. Obama than on his predecessors, while just 18 percent say they have been harder on him. <br> The Vice President And First Lady: <br> Vice President Joe Biden receives relatively positive reviews from Americans, though 37 percent don't yet have an opinion. Fifty-percent approve of the vice president's job performance, while just 13 percent disapprove. <br> The reviews for first lady Michelle Obama are overwhelmingly positive. Eighty-four percent approve of her job performance, while just six percent disapprove. Her personal favorable rating stands at 67 percent, up from 50 percent earlier this month. <br> The Economy And Foreign Affairs: <br> But the percentage who says the economy is improving, while still low, is now the highest it has been in over four years. Twenty-six percent now say it is getting better, while 25 percent say it is getting worse. In February, just five percent said the economy was getting better. <br> The percentage of the public that says the country is headed in the right direction now stands at 41 percent. While that percentage is similar to what it was earlier this month, it is significantly higher than before Mr. Obama assumed office. Fifty percent think the country is on the wrong track, the lowest number since July 2003. <br> Though Mr. Obama receives the highest approval rating on handling foreign policy of any modern president at this early point in their presidencies, slightly more than half of Americans think the war in Afghanistan is going badly. 
 This column was written by John B. Judis.</i><br>My colleagues Frank Foer and Noam Scheiber have written a compelling account of the Obama administration's approach to economic policy. And although I don't pretend to know the president's mind, I might agree with their summary statement that "Obama has no intention of changing the nature of capitalism." <br> Still, I want to make what may seem to be a paradoxical argument: that regardless of the president's intentions, he will change American capitalism in fundamental ways--in particular, he will alter the relationship between the government and the economy. My argument rests on what he has actually proposed to do and how his proposals, if enacted, would situate his administration in the history of American economic reform. <br> Americans have been notoriously loath to undertake reforms that increase the role of government. That goes back partly to our Lockean liberal heritage of minimal government that marks us off from Europe with its absolutist past. The only times that Americans have permitted major changes in government's role have been during economic crises, social upheavals, and war--that is to say, during the Civil War, the Progressive Era and World War I, the New Deal and World War II, and the Sixties (circa 1961-1974). If you look at these periods, and at the intervals between them, you find certain patterns that may help explain what is going on today. <br> Reform and reaction: Periods of major reform have invariably been followed by periods of reaction: the Civil War by the era of Robber Barons and Social Darwinism; the Progressive Era and World War I by the Twenties of Calvin Coolidge and Andrew Mellon; the New Deal and World War II by the Robert Taft Congresses and the Eisenhower presidency; and the Sixties by Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich, and George W. Bush. <br> The limits of reaction: In these periods of reaction, attempts were made to undo and reverse prior reforms, but the efforts always fell short, and the reforms were preserved, if in weakened form. The Robert Taft Congresses failed to eliminate collective bargaining; Eisenhower, to the distress of conservative GOPers, kept social security in place; Reagan, Gingrich, and G. W. Bush tried, but failed, to eliminate the regulatory reforms of the Sixties. In addition, during these periods of reaction, the government's share in the gross domestic product never fell below the plateau established, except during the world wars, by the prior reform era. <br> Reform builds on reform: Each of the reform eras picked up on the unfinished agenda of the prior era, and in some respects, went beyond it and into uncharted waters. The New Deal nationalized the state reforms of the Progressive Era (such as unemployment compensation), but also radically expanded the sheer quantitative role of government in the economy. The Sixties expanded social security and added Medicare and Medicaid, but it also radically widened the definition of what government could do to include things like worker safety and environmental protection (which is different from Progressive Era conservation). <br> Now how does this apply to the Obama administration? Its relationship to the Sixties is similar to the Sixties' relationship to the New Deal. It is reviving and expanding the regulatory state of the Sixties, particularly in the areas of the environment, consumer protection, worker safety, and financial regulation. It is attempting to make good on the promise of universal health insurance that failed in Congress in 1971. It is also committed to tax reforms and social programs that will redress post-Sixties inequality. The Obama budget, for instance, contains $100 billion in tax increases on the wealthy and tax cuts for everyone else. It would also make college more accessible to lower- and middle-income students. <br> But the Obama proposals also go well beyond the Sixties in certain respects. First, they pick up on an approach to industrial policy that began circulating among Democrats in the early Eighties, but has never been successfully implemented. That is, its proposals seek to change not merely the pace of production, investment, and consumption, but what is produced and consumed. Most notably, it is using the budget to shift the locus of industrial production toward "green" jobs and products. It is making dramatic changes in transportation with its intervention in the auto industry and in its funding of high-speed rail. <br> Of course, the Eisenhower administration invested in transportation through its massive highway program, but there is a subtle difference here. The Eisenhower administration's intervention was largely in response to pressure from the auto, construction, and real estate and developer (suburban housing, malls) lobbies. Obama's proposals aim to alter and reverse existing trends. They are an effort at national planning. And it doesn't matter, incidentally, whether the administration tries to get its way through manipulating the market or through outright control of investment; what matters is that it is using its governmental power to change the American economy in basic ways. <br> Finally, there is the sheer size of Obama's intervention. Obama's stimulus program and its budget are going to lift overall government spending from the 30s to well over 40 percent of GDP. Its 2009 budget, along with other public spending, could reach 45 percent of GDP. That's in response to a crisis, but as has happened before, the extent of government intervention is likely to remain permanent . <br> At the least, the Obama budgets will shift even more dramatically the balance of economic power away from the private and toward the public sector. The American relationship of state to economy will begin to look more like that of France and Sweden, whose non-crisis budgets total over 45 percent of GDP. And our politics may change accordingly--shifting public opinion on regulation, spending, and taxes well to the left. On the relationship of the state to the economy, European "conservatives" (say, Nicolas Sarkozy) are well to the left of our "moderates" and even occasionally our "liberals." It's hard to imagine, but the Republicans of the next decade could begin to sound like moderate Democrats today when discussing certain domestic policies. <br> Of course, what I have described are largely proposals rather than accomplishments. Obama has the perverse benefit of a crisis to spur reform, but not to the extent that, say, Franklin Roosevelt did. Roosevelt took office after four years of a Depression, with unemployment nearing 25 percent and with bankers, businessmen, and their Republican backers thoroughly discredited. Obama is being forced to battle bankers and corporate execs; and the Democratic leadership in Congress faces filibusters from irresponsible or deeply ignorant--take your pick--Republicans and even from some so-called centrist Democrats. <br> It won't be easy for Obama to get national health insurance or to finally put the financial sector in its place. And if his opponents are victorious or if he is too timid, the United States could head in an entirely different and more unpleasant direction than it would head if he were successful. There will probably be a return to deregulation and capital gains tax cuts--but when they don't work (and they won't), we might be forced to venture even deeper into the dark recesses of the American right. <br> John B.

 This column was written by Suzy Khimm of the New Republic.<br><br>If Senator Orrin Hatch is a liberal-friendly health care reformer, he's working under some pretty deep cover. Just two months ago, Hatch voted against the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), protesting the inclusion of legal immigrants and higher-income children as a "partisan exercise." When President Obama released his budget proposal, Hatch warned that health care reform under his administration's watch could be a nightmare. "[T]his reckless budget will swamp Americans in a morass of debt and mortgage the future of our children and grandchildren," the Utah senator thundered in a press statement. Hatch's remarks echoed his scathing criticism of the stimulus bill, whose health provisions he denounced on the Senate floor as the "Socialized Health Care for All Act of 2009." <br> But Hatch's Senate colleagues have noticed some disparities between his public fulminations and his private actions. Four days before railing against Obama's budget, Hatch was standing with his fellow legislators on the Senate floor, shortly before the call to walk over as a group for the president's joint address to Congress. He took the time to speak to Democratic Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, and said that he wanted to help him push for a bipartisan consensus on comprehensive reform. "What Hatch telegraphed was, 'I'm in the fundamental reform camp, I want to do something big,'" says one senior Democratic staffer. "You've made a commitment to work together." <br> When I talked to Hatch last week, he brushed off the Baucus incident as a routine conversation with a Democratic colleague. "I work very hard to accommodate people," he said. But, in fact, further conversations with Hatch and health care advocates on the Hill and beyond have suggested a very personal, profound reason why Hatch may be throwing his powerful weight behind "Socialized Health Care": his decades-long friendship with Ted Kennedy, the ailing patriarch of the universal health care movement. "I would like to do [health care reform] as a legacy issue for [Kennedy], if I can--this would mean a lot to him," Hatch told me. <br> Hatch and Kennedy first came together as adversaries on the Senate Labor Committee in 1977, where Hatch--an accomplished off-duty songwriter--jokes that he damaged his singing voice from wrangling over labor-law reform with his liberal colleague. Within a term, though, the two learned to compromise, and their ensuing friendship became part of Washington lore. "Sometimes I've been the chairman, sometimes he's been my chairman," Kennedy says. "But we've always been able to work together." Hatch recounts the early antics of Washington's "legislative odd couple" with a teasing, domestic familiarity. Before smoking was banned, Kennedy would regularly puff away at cigars in the committee room, much to the dismay of his Mormon colleague. "You could normally tell whether we were fighting by the amount of smoke he would send my way," Hatch writes in his autobiography. "If our differences were great ... Ted would lean back in his chair, puffing away, knowing he was giving me a headache that was more than just political." Hatch had his own way of needling Kennedy when he wanted to press him on an issue: He'd threaten to call Kennedy's sister, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was also a close friend of his. "If he'd get reluctant, I'd say, 'OK, Teddy, I'm going to go see Eunice,'" Hatch told me. "And then she'd tell [Kennedy], 'Don't you dare mistreat that nice young senator!'" <br> Conservative detractors soon claimed that it was Kennedy who had gotten the better half of the relationship, watching as Hatch repeatedly bucked the expectations of his own party to enable Kennedy to achieve legislative breakthroughs on workplace privacy, federal support for child care, and civil rights for the disabled. And, largely because of Kennedy's particular passion for health care, Hatch has time and again broken with his party in this arena. From his early years in the Senate, he has prided himself for being able to forge bipartisan deals on health care, including the Hatch-Waxman overhaul of the Food and Drug Administration in 1984 and, with Tom Harkin, the first broad-reaching regulation of dietary supplements a decade later. But working with Kennedy has brought Hatch to new heights on liberal health care legislation. In 1995, Hatch took on Jesse Helms in a Kennedy-led effort to provide emergency aids funding, breaking a political impasse and ushering in enough Republicans to pass the bill. Two years later, Kennedy wooed Hatch to support a children's health insurance bill that covered the working poor through a cigarette tax--at times literally serenading him in the Senate halls with music. Hatch was won over, explaining at the time that he supported the legislation to prove that the Republican Party "does not hate children." <br> Nevertheless, Hatch's underlying conservatism on health care has not, by and large, been affected by his friendship with Kennedy, and he has regularly blasted more ambitious expansions of government-run health programs. In 1994, for example, when Kennedy introduced a health care bill modeled on the president's proposal for universal coverage, Hatch attacked it as "nothing more than a pasteurized version of Clinton's blueprint for socialized medicine." Given this, and given Hatch's powerful spot as one of the few Republicans on both the Finance and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committees--the bodies with key jurisdiction over health care--Democrats in the current Senate feared that Hatch would be less than enthusiastic about passing comprehensive reform, watching him blast Obama's stimulus as a "Trojan Horse" for socialized health care and vote against the reauthorization of his own children's health act. "We were worried," admits a senior health care policy adviser to Baucus, describing the concerns over the SCHIP vote. <br> But Kennedy's terminal brain cancer seems to have changed everything. If Hatch's deep-abiding affection for Kennedy has plunged him into the most ambitious legislative deals of his career, the prospect that universal health care will be Kennedy's last defining act in Congress has pushed Hatch into the fray with a far more urgent zeal. Hatch has now become actively involved in the initial deliberations--despite his recent friction with Democratic legislators. "I resented the way [the Democrats] modified CHIP ... but, as important as CHIP is, this is even more important," Hatch told me. "I'm prepared to work on a final bill right now." To the relief of Democratic policymakers, Hatch has not only put aside his anger about SCHIP, but also suggested that he wants to take a central role in crafting a grand compromise, setting his sights on achieving "seventy-five or eighty votes" in the Senate. And he's doing it all for Teddy: These days, when Hatch confers with his colleagues, Kennedy's name has become something of a mantra. "The one thing that comes to mind is how many times [Hatch] talks with great affection about Senator Kennedy," says Senator Ron Wyden. "He very much wants to make this journey to health care reform with Senator Kennedy." <br> Determined to help put a deal together, Hatch has made an all-out push to consult not only Republican-friendly stakeholders, but also Democrats and liberal policy advisers. "Frequently, it's us trying to reach out to them, and [Hatch's staff] took the first step," said the Baucus aide. "We reached out to many people, and I suddenly heard that Hatch's office wanted to talk," says Len Nichols, a former Clinton health reform staffer and key Democratic proponent of the bipartisan reform effort. "They weren't going to give me an hour unless they were really serious." <br> But Hatch's key role in the push for health care reform could actually involve members of his own party. Hatch isn't the only congressional Republican interested in making some compromises on health care. Senator Chuck Grassley, well known for being a reform-minded crusader, is considering writing a comprehensive bill with Baucus. And Hatch's colleague from Utah, Senator Bob Bennett, has helped convince a handful of Republican senators to co-sponsor the Wyden-Bennett bill, a bold proposal to eliminate the current employer-based insurance system. Nonetheless, within the GOP's pro-reform camp, Hatch is one of the loudest public voices against "Socialized Health Care," which does wonders for his credibility--and the credibility of those Republicans working with him. With Hatch's reputation as a conservative intact, "Grassley has cover--he's not out there by himself doing health reform," says the Democratic Hill staffer. While it won't be enough to sway his most reactionary colleagues, Hatch could bring along a critical margin of Republican support in a legislative fight that might come down to a handful of Senate votes. <br> It's a particularly senatorial way to pay tribute to a dying friend. And this could be Hatch's last chance to do so, since he may himself be leaving the Senate after his current term ends, depending on his own health. Just enough time for one last serenade.By Suzy KhimmReprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 This column was written by John Nichols.<br><br>More than four months after the federal government claimed it was moving to address a mortgage crisis that threatened to take away the homes of millions of American families, steps are being taken to do just that. <br> All that was required was the exit of a president (George Bush) and a treasury secretary (Hank Paulson) who, in the best interpretation, were too economically inept to do what was needed, and, in the worst interpretation, used the crisis to steer hundreds of billions of dollars into the accounts of their buddies on Wall Street. <br> Whatever the cause of the delay, President Obama on Wednesday offered the response that was needed -- or, at the very least, a piece of the response that was needed. <br> The president proposes to take administrative actions to spend $75 billion of the Financial Stabilization Fund on facilitating modifications in existing loans and he wants to require lenders that are accepting tax dollars to adopt foreclosure prevention protocols to prevent unnecessary foreclosures. <br> These are meaningful steps. <br> Indeed, ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), the national organization that has been in the forefront of the struggle to keep working families in their homes -- and has taken a lot of hard hits in the media and Washington for doing so -- refers to Obama's move of Wednesday as "the first federal effort to fight foreclosures since the crisis that brought down the economy began two years ago." <br> The president's ambitious plan could help as many as nine million American families that are currently struggling to make mortgage payments or whose homes are now worth dramatically less than the amount they paid for them. The housing plan uses incentives to homeowners and lenders to ease and encourage the process by which home loans can be restructured or refinanced to avoid foreclosure. <br> "The plan I'm announcing focuses on rescuing families who have played by the rules and acted responsibly," says Obama, who added that the plan would do this "by refinancing loans for millions of families in traditional mortgages who are underwater or close to it; by modifying loans for families stuck in sub-prime mortgages they can't afford as a result of skyrocketing interest rates or personal misfortune; and by taking broader steps to keep mortgage rates low so that families can secure loans with affordable monthly payments." <br> That's the right sentiment, even if the precise strategy adopted by Obama tends to reward banks and bankers that acted irresponsibly. (More on savvier approaches in a moment.) <br> This is not a particularly new notion, however. <br> Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chair Sheila Bair was promoting a plan to modify mortgages last fall. <br> Had the Bush White House and the Department of the Treasury listened to Barr -- and to members of Congress such as California Democrat Maxine Waters -- back then, hundreds of billions of dollars might have been saved. And the dollars that were spent might have actually gone to address the real crisis, as opposed to the demand from Wall Street for money to pay bonuses, bail out speculators and keep stockholders happy. <br> "In the end, all of us are paying a price for this home mortgage crisis. And all of us will pay an even steeper price if we allow this crisis to continue to deepen," Obama explained in Phoenix, where he announced his initiative. "But if we act boldly and swiftly to arrest this downward spiral, every American will benefit." <br> We should have acted "boldly and swiftly" -- and in a fiscally-responsible manner -- last fall. Hundreds of wasted billions later, we finally are. For that, Barack Obama and his administration deserve a good deal of credit -- just as George Bush and his administration deserve a great deal of blame. <br> The lesson is an important one. <br> Focus on the people who are hurting -- not the bankers who are threatening them -- first. <br> To do that, Ohio Congressman Marcy Kaptur and economist Dean Baker have some smart ideas. They argue that the proper role for the federal government is not to fund mortgage negotiations but to insist that banks -- many of which have already collected billions in taxpayer dollars -- carry them out. <br> Short of that step, ACORN head Bertha Lewis proposes a short-term ban on mortgage foreclosures during the period when the Obama administration is implementing its plan and seeking legislative approval for key components of it. <br> "With 8 to 9 million Americans on the verge of losing their homes in the next four years, the nation's housing crisis demands leadership commensurate with its enormous scale, and we got that today from the Obama Administration," says Lewis. "These effective sticks and carrots will do the job that the previous all-voluntary efforts have failed to do, and help prevent millions of unnecessary foreclosures once fully operational and enacted in law. Until that time, however, there should not be a single foreclosure on any family that could benefit from this comprehensive housing plan, so we need a thorough, binding moratorium." <br> By John NicholsReprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by Liza Featherstone.<br> <br> "I said, 'I see windmills,' and everyone kind of gave me a strange look." Vicky Sloan, a humanities professor at Clinton Community College, which serves a rural region in upstate New York, is describing a "visualization" session with a touchy-feely outside consultant, forced on the faculty several years ago by the administration. The consultant had asked the professors to close their eyes and picture their institution's future. "It was so Dilbert," interjects Sloan's close friend June Foley, a professor who teaches psychology at the college. "It was!" agrees Sloan, who lives off the grid, in a log cabin, with her own power generator. "But when I closed my eyes, that's what I saw." <br> Less than an hour north of campus, along the Canadian border, real wind turbines perform a slow ballet dance over the snow-covered farmland. The windmills look at once gleamingly futuristic and as if they've always belonged there. The landscape is rapidly darkening on this overcast mid-afternoon in December--another snowstorm is expected--but even the most distant turbines can be seen easily, like guiding beacons. Wind farms have become a symbol of clean energy--feel-good iconography used by every liberal entity from The Rachel Maddow Show to Barack Obama's presidential campaign. But here in the Plattsburgh region, they also represent jobs. <br> Clinton County--part of what is called the North Country--has endured much upheaval in recent years. Plattsburgh Air Force Base--the oldest military post in the nation--closed in 1995 and has been turned into an industrial park, occupied by a mix of biotech, pharmaceutical, engineering and other companies. The area's many small farmers struggle, like small farmers everywhere. Manufacturing jobs have been gradually ebbing. But the North Country is one of the windiest spots in the nation and thus has become a thriving Gold Coast for the wind industry, with five wind farms producing a total of 690 megawatts of clean energy. <br> Like many two-year college teachers--who don't enjoy the salary or prestige that many of their counterparts at four-year colleges do--the faculty at Clinton Community College have long taken seriously their civic duty to prepare students for the best jobs the local economy can offer. While faculty members like Sloan envisioned a role for the college in the region's wind industry, it was Janice Padula, an environmental science professor and hard-working Democratic Party activist, who made it happen. Working with regional economic development officials, the wind industry and relevant technical experts at the college, she established a wind technician training program to prepare students for the wind industry's most permanent jobs: troubleshooting and maintaining the turbines. The program's first students began in January, as Barack Obama took office. The timing couldn't be better: several of the students have arrived fresh from recession trauma, having just been laid off from FedEx or Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. <br> Windmills are only modest engines of job creation. A 200-megawatt wind farm--a large one--creates about 300 jobs over the course of its construction. Some of these are union jobs, but all are temporary. A wind farm of the same size requires about twenty technicians to operate and to fix the turbines if anything goes wrong. Such jobs, says Charlie Turlinski, a project manager for Horizon Wind Energy, require a good amount of skill. "The technician job can work well for the farmer's son who knows how to take a tractor apart and put it back together," he explains, but it also requires extensive computer and GPS training. Plus, as Sloan points out, "They have to like climbing really tall towers!" (True, and this wouldn't be fun for everyone: the windmills are 265 feet to the "navel," or axis.) Technicians--nonunion, though there is no reason they have to be--will earn an average salary of $50,000 a year over the lifetime of the wind farm, on average being paid $35 per hour: hardly as good as making cars for GM, but much better than working at Wal-Mart. <br> Wind energy from the North Country reaches New York City on the state's overstressed grid. One of the buildings that buys it is 1400 Fifth Avenue, the city's first green condominium building--still the only one to include affordable housing units (before the recession, green was as trendy in Manhattan luxury buildings as it was on the runway). Built in 2004, 1400 Fifth boasts the largest geothermal residential heating and cooling system in the United States; despite its location in densely populated East Harlem, it is powered by well water. <br> In this part of New York City, there are almost certainly more Baptist churches than "green jobs," but 1400 Fifth's resident manager, Hector Norat, has one of the few. Norat is obviously proud of the complex skills and exploratory spirit required to maintain the building: "No one understands the geothermal system, not even the engineers who made it up," he observes, "because it is so new!" Norat's union, SEIU Local 32BJ, offers an energy-efficiency training program for building supers, and Norat has taken many of the classes. He's proud not only of the building's small carbon footprint but that it is so much healthier for the residents. He leads me into the hallway and insists that I observe the building's distinct air quality: "I want you to breathe this clean, light air." Like organic family farmers who are relieved that their kids can play outside without eating pesticides, Norat, who lives in the building, relishes raising his two young children in this environment--especially in a neighborhood where the number of child asthma hospitalizations is ten times the national rate. <br> Though the "win-win" perkiness of the phrase has inspired some media cynicism, "green jobs" is not just a campaign buzzword or a liberal fantasy. Environmentally sound job creation and training is happening right now, all over the country, fueled by the belief that it is possible to solve the climate crisis and put more people to work in better jobs all at the same time. In Sacramento, a costly nuclear plant has been shut down and turned over to solar energy, widely believed to be, among renewable energy industries, the most promising sector for job creation (both in number of jobs and in job quality). As the port in Duluth, Minnesota, has become busier unloading wind turbine parts, more than 100 additional workers have been hired for union jobs paying more than $30 an hour. For the past eight years, such changes have been led by state and local governments, advocated for mainly by groups like the Apollo Alliance, a coalition pushing for a greener economy, and by labor and environmental organizations. <br> Activists supporting green jobs have been doing so with little help from the government, because the Bush administration had no interest in solving the global warming problem or in economic policy. That meant that the thinking was small: a few hundred jobs, or even ten, and here and there one town shrinks its carbon footprint. Because there was no possibility of a national green jobs policy, no one was thinking systematically about how to remake the economy along greener lines. All that has changed. We now have a president who believes that saving the planet can create jobs. "The election changed everything," says Keith Schneider, a spokesman for the Apollo Alliance, who sees Obama's November victory as the death knell of the fossil fuel dependent, "drive through" economy. "Now that we--the progressive environmental left--have made our case and won," he says audaciously, "we're in a great race. Does the rise of the new economy beat the decline of the old?" <br> It's a fine question, as the debate over the economic stimulus package takes place against the backdrop of the burning wreckage of the American auto industry and a national recession. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity," says Bracken Hendricks of the Center for American Progress, one of the authors of its influential report Green Recovery. "We're going to spend over a trillion dollars." There's no doubt that Obama will do something to support green jobs, says Kate Gordon, co-director of the Apollo Alliance, but "people need to keep making the case that it needs to be really big." <br> That case keeps getting easier to make. Even before this recession, the economy was desperately in need of jobs that could support a family but didn't require an advanced degree. Rising unemployment--estimated at 13 percent in real terms--makes the case that aggressive government investment in any sort of job creation is urgently needed. And because of the recession, many of the private-sector businesses previously on the cutting edge of the green economy are floundering. Apollo Alliance activists, in conversation and on the group's website, love to highlight a green jobs success story: a factory in Memphis that used to manufacture TVs, back when TVs were made in the United States. That factory now makes solar panels, providing hundreds of unionized jobs--just the sort of story, I thought, that would intrigue and inspire Nation readers. Yet when I tried to arrange to visit the plant for this story in late 2008, the company, Sharp Electronics, preferred I stay home; because of the housing bust, business was so slow that there would be no production to see. <br> Wind companies struggle with the costs of capital in this tough financial environment. They're also affected by anemic state budgets; at the end of 2008 it was uncertain whether New York State would continue to fund its Renewable Portfolio Standard, which guarantees a market for renewable energy by mandating that utilities buy clean energy. (Although Governor Paterson just announced a goal of meeting 45 percent of the state's energy needs through energy efficiency and renewable energy by 2015, no one has figured out the wonky details of how to do this.) Without that policy, its enforcement mechanisms and the guaranteed demand for renewable energy credits it assures, some new ventures become too risky. <br> "Everyone has had to re-evaluate their projects," says Charlie Turlinski. In this climate Horizon Wind Energy, which operates the nearby Maple Ridge Wind Farm, has postponed construction on its latest North Country project. Turlinski and I drive by the site. Snow falls on the abruptly stilled forklifts. The scene is eerie, like a sudden evacuation. The project has been suspended indefinitely, and that could mean fewer jobs for graduates of Clinton County's wind technician program. <br> "But for the financial crisis, we might not have this opportunity," says Phil Angelides, chair of Apollo's board and former California state treasurer, referring to the historic possibility of federal investment in green jobs. "But the crisis makes it an uphill slog." Angelides points out, too, that some of the most vital projects being proposed for the stimulus do not depend on the vagaries of the business cycle: mass transit, for example, and revamping the grid for more efficient transmission. Both could help the green economy in the long run while creating jobs in the short run. The current struggles of private business, says Angelides, make federal intervention all the more urgent: it is clearer than ever that the free market alone will neither revive our economy nor reform it along greener lines. <br> The recession makes some engines of green development more appealing than usual: those that save money as well as the planet. Energy efficiency is enjoying a tremendous boost, hence billions in the proposed stimulus/recovery for weatherization assistance, which could create thousands of jobs while saving energy costs for businesses and consumers. In addition to the union programs like 32BJ's, innovative city schools like Bronx Community College have also been training workers in this area, which is considered the most promising source of urban green jobs at the moment. Not many spiffy new buildings like 1400 Fifth will be built during this housing bust, but anyone paying for heat should be eager to hire this emerging army of efficiency experts. <br> The green jobs advocates are just finding their way around a changing Washington. Many are pleased with the proposed appointment of Hilda Solis as the new labor secretary, who as a California Congresswoman was a vocal advocate for green jobs and environmental justice. In mid-January, the Apollo Alliance was meeting with legislators on the Hill, where Green For All founder Van Jones was testifying to urge Congress to make green jobs central in the stimulus/recovery package. The Blue Green Alliance, which is setting up its DC office, will have an intense "advocacy day" in early February. <br> The question is, When they don't get what they want, who will take to the streets and fight? It's in everyone's interest to create decent jobs while fighting global warming, yet the constituency for a green jobs agenda is not always clear. Until recently, the most organized constituencies on energy issues were the few industries--like petroleum and auto companies--that stand to lose from a cleaner economy. Public enthusiasm for green jobs has evolved: Americans are more aware than ever about global warming, as well as what politicians like to call "energy independence" or "energy security." And growing numbers of Americans could use a job. Still, it is not clear how broadly or easily mobilized these desires are, and who has the capacity to organize people to make a serious green jobs policy happen, if and when Obama decides against doing anything "really big." <br> The Blue Green Alliance, founded by the Steelworkers and the Sierra Club, has organized town-hall meetings in blue-collar strongholds like Canton, Ohio, and Granite City, Illinois, where steelworkers have been bringing the green jobs case to others in the community. Dave Foster, formerly of the Steelworkers and now executive director of the Blue Green Alliance, describes these campaigns as "neighbor-to-neighbor, person-to-person--making the case that the person who lost their job in a plant in Akron could go back to work tomorrow if we passed a [federal] Renewable Energy Standard." Now that SEIU, the Laborers and the Communications Workers of America have joined the Blue Green Alliance, the coalition represents more than 6 million people. That's a lot of Americans, of course, but with SEIU, the largest of those organizations, in extreme disarray, and the rest of the labor movement occupied with trying to pass the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), the potential could go untapped. <br> Green jobs represent a great opportunity for the labor movement; if the new jobs are union jobs, labor could gain numbers and clout. This would be a boost to the economy, too, putting money in the pockets of working-class people. Hector Norat's work is demanding, highly skilled and cutting edge, but that's not why he makes such good money (he won't say how much, but his local says superintendents at his level make between $50,000 and $100,000). The reason is old school: his union card. Yet questions of union membership, and even organizing rights, haven't been central to the policy debate over green jobs. <br> Largely offstage in these discussions about labor advocacy on green jobs is one obvious actor: the United Auto Workers. It's hard to imagine an industry more in need of a green makeover; yet the UAW, following the lead of the automakers, is doing little to push for the kind of federal action that might reinvent the industry along greener lines--and save more of its members' jobs. Having been through steel's bankruptcy wave in 1998, Foster says, he understands what the UAW is going through. "You almost can't think strategically while something like that is going on," he says. "But the world does have a crying need for green transportation." <br> "It's hard to develop constituency for something that doesn't exist yet," says the Center for American Progress's Hendricks. This lack of constituency is particularly dire for some of the best green jobs ideas: serious investment in high-speed interstate rail, for example, could provide good jobs, revive small cities whose economies have been devastated by the decline in air travel, and lower carbon emissions by providing an alternative to air and car travel. But no member of Congress is going to lose her job or even see protesters outside her office because she didn't make sure high-speed rail was in the stimulus package. <br> Yet this, too, becomes another argument for huge investment in green jobs, whether through regulation, investment, tax breaks or training programs: this "new economy" gathers more supporters the more real it becomes. That's because as the green economy grows, more people benefit. In Puerto Rico, where he grew up, and where much of his family still lives, Norat owns ninety acres of windy land, which he is hoping to lease to a wind farm, to provide power for the island and, of course, profits for himself. (In the North Country and other rural areas, such revenues are a major boost to small landowners, mostly farmers, who enjoy substantial rents for hosting wind turbines on their property.) Paradoxically, environmental groups have, so far, kept windmills out of Puerto Rico. "They were worried about the birds flying into the turbines," Norat sighs, rolling his eyes. "Aren't the birds smarter than that? This is something that is so good for everybody!" <br> "I don't consider myself a fanatic of green energy," Norat says, his enthusiasm evident in his cautious smile, "because I don't believe in being a fanatic of anything." But he's going to Maine for a family wedding this summer, and he may drive along the Canadian border to see the Clinton County wind farms. "I am crazy about this," he admits, "and I want to get a little more crazy." <br> The North Country has wind to spare, but New York's rickety grid is at capacity. No new wind farms can be built in Clinton County until Obama delivers on this piece of the "Green New Deal." While the prospects for improving the grid are decent--judging from the most recent stimulus plans--it's one of many examples of how the slowly emerging green economy is in a state of suspension. <br> As stimulus proposals emerge from the president and the House, it's clear that in many ways they already fall far short of what many green jobs advocates have championed. Job-creating, money-saving initiatives--like weatherization assistance for low-income Americans and grid upgrades--will be funded, but these will be, at best, tentative baby steps. Too much money is squandered on tax cuts, and of the dispiriting 14 percent allocated for infrastructure, conventional, old-economy projects like highways have fared much better than mass transit and other green priorities. When Van Jones testified before Congress in January on green jobs, he sympathized with members' efforts: "[You're] sweating over the details of how we can actually beat the recession and global warming at the same time.... And you're going to get a grade from our great-grandchildren. Yes or no. Pass or fail." There's a danger that in the rush to do just about anything to get the economy moving, we'll fumble a rare chance to revolutionize that economy. <br> As inspiring as it is to have a president who talks the talk on green-collar jobs, it will take an organized movement to ensure that we get, in a phrase popular among renewable-energy advocates, "megawatts, not just megawords." That movement must have the imagination to fight for our great-grandchildren, and for much that doesn't exist yet, with the "selflessness" and creativity that Obama, in his inaugural speech, urged upon the nation. "The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act--not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth," President Obama said. "We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."

This lack of constituency is particularly dire for some of the best green jobs ideas: serious investment in high-speed interstate rail, for example, could provide good jobs, revive small cities whose economies have been devastated by the decline in air travel, and lower carbon emissions by providing an alternative to air and car travel. But no member of Congress is going to lose her job or even see protesters outside her office because she didn't make sure high-speed rail was in the stimulus package. <br> Yet this, too, becomes another argument for huge investment in green jobs, whether through regulation, investment, tax breaks or training programs: this "new economy" gathers more supporters the more real it becomes. That's because as the green economy grows, more people benefit. In Puerto Rico, where he grew up, and where much of his family still lives, Norat owns ninety acres of windy land, which he is hoping to lease to a wind farm, to provide power for the island and, of course, profits for himself. (In the North Country and other rural areas, such revenues are a major boost to small landowners, mostly farmers, who enjoy substantial rents for hosting wind turbines on their property.) Paradoxically, environmental groups have, so far, kept windmills out of Puerto Rico. "They were worried about the birds flying into the turbines," Norat sighs, rolling his eyes. "Aren't the birds smarter than that? This is something that is so good for everybody!" <br> "I don't consider myself a fanatic of green energy," Norat says, his enthusiasm evident in his cautious smile, "because I don't believe in being a fanatic of anything." But he's going to Maine for a family wedding this summer, and he may drive along the Canadian border to see the Clinton County wind farms. "I am crazy about this," he admits, "and I want to get a little more crazy." <br> The North Country has wind to spare, but New York's rickety grid is at capacity. No new wind farms can be built in Clinton County until Obama delivers on this piece of the "Green New Deal." While the prospects for improving the grid are decent--judging from the most recent stimulus plans--it's one of many examples of how the slowly emerging green economy is in a state of suspension. <br> As stimulus proposals emerge from the president and the House, it's clear that in many ways they already fall far short of what many green jobs advocates have championed. Job-creating, money-saving initiatives--like weatherization assistance for low-income Americans and grid upgrades--will be funded, but these will be, at best, tentative baby steps. Too much money is squandered on tax cuts, and of the dispiriting 14 percent allocated for infrastructure, conventional, old-economy projects like highways have fared much better than mass transit and other green priorities. When Van Jones testified before Congress in January on green jobs, he sympathized with members' efforts: "[You're] sweating over the details of how we can actually beat the recession and global warming at the same time.... And you're going to get a grade from our great-grandchildren. Yes or no. Pass or fail." There's a danger that in the rush to do just about anything to get the economy moving, we'll fumble a rare chance to revolutionize that economy. <br> As inspiring as it is to have a president who talks the talk on green-collar jobs, it will take an organized movement to ensure that we get, in a phrase popular among renewable-energy advocates, "megawatts, not just megawords." That movement must have the imagination to fight for our great-grandchildren, and for much that doesn't exist yet, with the "selflessness" and creativity that Obama, in his inaugural speech, urged upon the nation. "The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act--not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth," President Obama said. "We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."

 This story was written by John B. Judis.<br><br>Does Barack Obama understand the seriousness of the economic crisis? Yesterday, he laid out his economic agenda, and it was filled with all sorts of important exhortations and proscriptions. He appropriately condemned the "anything goes" policies of the last administration. He declared that government is now the solution to our woes, not the problem. Still, I worry that the president elect is underestimating the problem he and the country faces. <br> We may not simply be facing a steep recession like that of the early 1980s, from which we can extricate ourselves in a year or two, but something resembling the Great Depression of the 1930s. For starters, the current crisis is global, which means that one part of the world can't lift the other out of its misery; everyone will go down together, which is what happened in the 1930s. Secondly, the downturn has combined an unusual decline in the real economy--employment in durable-goods manufacturing fell by 21.9 percent from 2000 to 2008--with a financial crash precipitated by the bursting of the housing bubble. The bubble resulted from an attempt to sustain growth and employment in the face of an underlying decline, which, too, is what happened in the late 1920s. <br> Over the past six decades, policymakers have used some tactics from the Great Depression to quell recessions--such as spending on roads and bridges to create jobs, transferring payments to raise consumer demand, and infusing money into the credit system. But these stopgap measures, which are at the heart of Obama's recovery program, may prove inadequate. <br> There's much to like in Obama's plan. But there are two important ways he may have to go further. Most economists agree that what finally pulled the U.S. out of the Great Depression was military spending for World War II. Some liberals argue that if the Roosevelt administration had not abandoned a Keynesian stimulus strategy in 1937-38, the U.S. might have gotten out of the depression without a war. But in 1936, unemployment was still at 16.9 percent; by 1942, after two years of war spending, it was 4.7 percent, strongly indicating that it was war spending that did it. I am not suggesting that the United States start a world war in order to solve the world's economic problem. But I am suggesting a strategy that could be called the fiscal equivalent of war. <br> It would consist not merely of updating or repairing the nation's infrastructure, but in undertaking massive new investments that would expand the scope of American industry, and address other urgent problems in the process: global warming, over-reliance on petroleum, and the need to revive America's domestic manufacturing capabilities--not just to provide jobs, but also to provide tradeable goods that can reduce the country's current account deficit. <br> One area that is ripe for such investment--and that is not, from what I have seen, a declared priority of the Obama administration--is high-speed rail. Amtrak's Acela trains--the closest thing we have to one--average less than 100 mph between Washington D.C. and Boston, whereas trains in Western Europe and Japan go more than twice as fast. Many of them also run on electricity. They would be the most energy-efficient and quickest means of getting between places like Boston and New York, or Los Angeles and San Francisco. But they would require a massive investment. For instance, installing high-speed rail in the Northeast corridor could cost about $32 billion, while California's high-speed rail system would require up to $40 billion. A system that would address the other areas of the country could easily raise the cost to the hundreds of billions. The House transportation and infrastructure committee has currently proposed $5 billion in stimulus funds for intercity rail--not even a down payment on what it would cost to convert the U.S. to high-speed rail. <br> Investing in high-speed rails would be very expensive, but unlike tax cuts--the benefits of which can be siphoned off in the purchase of imported goods--the money spent would go directly to reviving American industry and improving the country's trade balance. That doesn't just mean jobs creating dedicated tracks or new rail stations: Though the U.S. abandoned train manufacturing decades ago to the French, Germans, Canadians, and Japanese, this kind of production could be undertaken by our ailing auto companies or aircraft companies--if the federal and state governments were to place orders. And building trains that would run on electricity would be a paradigmatic example of the "green jobs" that Obama often touts. <br> Though a massive investment in high-speed rail brings its own set of complications, it's worth keeping these kind of examples in mind when one hears from the Obama people that they can't find sufficient infrastructure projects to fund. The question I would pose is this: Are we not at some point going to have to go beyond repairing roads and bridges in our conception of public spending and public works, and contemplate the kind of ambitious industrial expenditures that the country made on war production in 1941? <br> The second arena that needs radical action from Obama is international. One reason that the depression of the 1930s endured and deepened was because the international monetary system, which had been based on gold, broke down; and one reason that the world economy enjoyed reasonable prosperity between 1945 and 1971 was because the International Monetary Fund--created as part of the Bretton Woods system in 1944--ensured a measure of international monetary stability. Countries controlled their capital inflow and outflow, and the IMF oversaw--if imperfectly--surpluses and deficits, and devaluations and revaluations. Currency exchange was regulated by nations, not by private companies or speculators. And the only country that ran a large surplus after World War II--the United States--took it upon itself to spend much of it helping the other countries to revive their industries. <br> Since 1971, the breakdown of Bretton Woods has given way to a perverse anti-system that combines floating rates, fuelled by speculation, and behind-the-scenes currency manipulation by counties like China and Japan that don't want their exports priced out of foreign markets. The result, as Martin Wolf and others have argued, has been decades of financial crises, which began on the fringes of the system but have now engulfed the center. This system, which features huge surpluses in China and Japan, and huge deficits in the United States, has not proven viable, and is breaking down right now. If China is "losing [its] taste for debt from the U.S.," as a recent New York Times story reported, the U.S. will have trouble financing its deficit expenditures. Interest rates will go up, investment will go down, income will sink, and more Americans will be out of jobs; on the other side of the Pacific, China will be able to sell less goods to the U.S., its investment will fall, its workers will be jobless, and so on. It's not a pretty picture. <br> What's needed, it appears, is a new international system that will prevent the kind of global imbalances that are plaguing the current system. Like Bretton Woods worked initially in practice, it will place the onus of regulating these imbalances on countries running surpluses, not deficits. It would also permit countries to develop economic strategies without fearing that speculators would create a run on their currency. Larry Summers and Tim Geithner are well-suited to work out the details of such broad reform, but Obama has yet to make this a priority within his economic policy. The U.S. also needs to begin working on its own strategy to reduce its current account deficits. That may require not only very large government subsidies to manufacturing industries, but also some currency manipulation of our own to get the price of our goods competitive with those produced in Asia. <br> Obama is certainly right to abandon the "anything goes" mentality of the Bush administration and to promote an $800 billion stimulus program. But to reverse to current economic collapse, the new administration may have to go even farther than this in the direction of a fiscal equivalent of war and a new Bretton Woods. <br> John B.

 This column was written by Jacob S. Hacker.<br><br>As we move deeper into the recession, most economists are urging President-elect Obama to spend big money right away in order to stimulate and prop up the economy. The sticking point for a lot of people, however, is the long-term budget picture, especially given that Obama is planning to keep most of his predecessor's tax cuts. How are we going to drop huge sums of money on job creation and fiscal stimulus right now without continuing to suffer through yawning budget deficits years down the road? <br> In fact, we have a magic bullet for short-term spending and long-term saving--health care reform. During the campaign, skeptics complained that a health care overhaul would involve a lot of upfront costs and that the saving would only come later. But that's exactly what we need right now. Health care involves major spending in the near future, but, more than other initiatives, it will put a brake on federal outlays in the far future. <br> All this argues for temporarily throwing fiscal caution to the wind when it comes to health care reform. The idea of spiking the deficit now may seem frightening, but it's a lot better than the alternative--and it could actually make it easier to bring universal health care to America. <br> When talk turns to economic stimulus, health care usually gets short shrift. Perhaps that's because we are so used to thinking of health care as something we should spend less on; or perhaps it's because we assume that health care spending goes straight into doctors' pockets and hospitals' budgets. Yet, when done right, the biggest effect of broadening and upgrading coverage is to immediately help struggling families. The typical items on the stimulus menu--infrastructure spending, general aid to the states, benefits for the jobless, investments in new forms of energy--have a lot going for them. But they shouldn't blind us to the fact that government health spending is also an extraordinarily effective way to boost the economy. <br> After all, health care isn't a luxury good, like a flat-screen television--something you can put off when money is tight. People do economize on health care when times are tough, but only so much and with serious risks, both physical and financial. The better way to think about health care is like an upfront deduction from family income. If you make that deduction smaller, families have more to spend on other things, improving their own situation and the economy in general. <br> Today, however, the health care deduction is big and getting bigger. Despite widespread complaints about "overinsurance," the amount people pay for health care out of their own pocket has risen substantially as a share of personal income over the last generation, and especially in the last decade. The Commonwealth Fund recently completed two massive surveys showing that the proportion of adults younger than 65 with health insurance who spent more than 10 percent of their income on health care out of pocket (5 percent for low-income adults) skyrocketed from 13.8 million in 2003 to 21.8 million in 2007, as health plans hiked deductibles and co-payments, denied claims more aggressively, jacked up costs for out-of-network care, and so on. What's more, almost all of the increase occurred among families with higher incomes--meaning that high health care costs have become a standard deduction for the middle class. <br> The problem is, of course, far worse for those who lack health insurance. Indeed, if you add the ranks of the uninsured to those without adequate coverage, you have more than 40 percent of the working-age population in an immediate economic bind because of medical costs. About half these people--slightly more of the uninsured than the underinsured, but not much more--report severe problems paying their medical bills. These are the families accounting for the 40 percent to 50 percent of people in bankruptcy or foreclosure who say health care is the number one reason for their plight. <br> So fixing health care isn't just a recipe for better access to medical care. It's an immediate economic lifeline for working families, giving them back part of their income to use on other things. It's also a rescue package for state and local governments burdened by Medicaid and S-CHIP, for doctors and hospitals who treat the uninsured and inadequately insured, for community institutions that help people in distress--in short, for all the rapidly fraying threads of our health care safety net. Put simply, most of the money we spend upgrading coverage and spreading it to the uninsured is going to go directly into the pockets of people who need help now. <br> Spending money in the short term is also the best way to make health care reform salable. To grasp this surprising point, it helps to understand how different today's situation is from the one that Bill Clinton faced in 1993. Then, the economy was already coming out of recession, meaning that deficit reduction was the order of the day. So the Clinton reformers made big promises about how they would save big money immediately--and backed them up with a massively regulatory plan designed to get people quickly into tightly managed HMOs. <br> The result was political disaster. As Theda Skocpol of Harvard has argued, the Clinton plan was almost tailor-made to scare Americans into thinking health care would be rationed, while providing ammunition for anti-government conservatives. Moreover, in order to rein in federal spending, the plan didn't include enough handouts to appease interest groups and was far too complex and overambitious, aiming to pull almost everyone out of employer-based insurance overnight. <br> Reformers shouldn't make the same mistake this time around. Freed from the strictures of short-term budget balance, they can instead do what all other countries did when creating their national health programs: buy off the opposition. Britain's health minister was once asked how he had gotten doctors on board for the National Health Service. His reply: "I stuffed their mouths with gold." Money may not change everything, but it does make it easier to win friends, or at least divide and placate them. <br> It also makes it easier to attract public support. Americans tend to fear that reform will impair the quality and raise the costs of the care they already have. Moreover, most don't believe our nation spends too much on health care; they believe they spend too much. The way to get reform is to give Americans what they want--better coverage at lower cost, made possible in the short term by a major infusion of new federal dollars. <br> For this to work, reform has to be simple and unthreatening. People should be able to keep employment-based coverage if their employers provide it (with new government help to lower the cost). If they don't have workplace coverage, they should be automatically enrolled in a national framework that gives them a choice between a good public insurance plan and competing private plans. The faster everyone is in the system, the faster money flows into people's pockets, and the sooner reformers start reaping the political rewards. <br> And the faster all that happens, the better situated we are to start the difficult but essential task of controlling long-term health spending. Without runaway health spending, as Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution has shown, the future fiscal picture of the federal government looks surprisingly rosy, even if taxes stay right where they are as a share of the economy. With runaway health spending, it looks catastrophic. Plus, as bad as the federal picture looks, it's prettier than what businesses and workers are facing. According to Sarah Axeen and Elizabeth Carpenter of the New America Foundation, if employer-sponsored insurance premiums and family income rise at the same rate they have for the past decade, an average family health plan will cost more than 45 percent of a typical family's income by 2016. <br> Lowering costs might not happen fast, but it is possible in the long term. There are some relatively easy and quick ways to bring down costs, like streamlining administration and reducing the rate of payment increase for specialty services and prescription drugs. But a good deal of the savings have to come from using resources more efficiently--and here, again, spending now will help us spend less later. The federal government invests a pittance in health-information technology and comparative-effectiveness research, and we know the private sector won't make these investments on an appropriate scale. These are public goods that require public investment. A Manhattan Project to collect health-outcomes data, develop new practice guidelines and quality measurements, and really test the effectiveness of new medical technology won't come cheap. But it will make health care cheaper--and, more important, better at improving health--in the long run. <br> The beauty of all this spending is that it will mean higher wages and employment, a more flexible labor market in which people feel free to change jobs or strike out on their own without risking their health and finances, and, yes, less pressure on public and private budgets down the road. We'll be running up hefty federal bills for a while. But we'll be doing so confident we're going to improve the economic standing of millions of Americans and our long-term budget situation in the bargain. <br> Jacob S.

 This column was written by <b>The Editors.<hr width="50%">For the last few months, critics have warned that the economic crisis would force Barack Obama to set aside his more ambitious ideas--starting with universal health care. For some, the issue has been one of priorities. With the economy in such desperate shape, the argument goes, Obama must devote all available manpower--and political capital--to measures that would rescue Wall Street and revive growth. "How much do you want to tweak health care while dealing with bank mortgages?" asks Deloitte and Touche's Paul Keckley. For others, the problem has been the price tag: Given the realities of the budget, the federal government simply doesn't have enough money to start giving everybody decent medical insurance. Speaking for this increasingly popular point of view, the Urban Institute's Robert Reischauer noted recently, "Fiscal resources that might have been devoted to the unavoidable short run costs of health reform will be needed to stimulate the economy and shore up the financial system." To try health care reform now, he suggested, would be "difficult if not impossible." <br> It's a superficially logical argument--one that people like Reischauer, a well-respected budget expert, surely come by sincerely. Fully implemented, universal health insurance will require an infusion of somewhere between $50 billion and $130 billion per year. With the annual budget deficit likely to hit $1 trillion this year, where would the money come from? And, while it's important to maximize the number of people with health insurance, surely it's more important to maximize the number of people with jobs and steady incomes. But neither argument holds up that well under scrutiny. On the contrary, the economic downturn actually makes the case for universal health insurance even stronger than it was before. <br> Start with the present economic crisis. By now, even the most hard-core fiscal conservatives are discovering their inner Keynesians, calling for new government spending to stimulate the economy. But spending on what exactly? Infrastructure is the most obvious target, because infrastructure spending creates jobs. But recent reports suggest that the number of projects that are ready to go--that is, those that could start up as soon as money is available--would account for only tens of billions in new spending, which is just a fraction of the stimulus many economists say we need in the very near future. There's also the possibility of tax rebates. But recent experience suggests that all but the poorest tend to save the money rather than spend it--which basically defeats the purpose. <br> On the other hand, most proposals for universal coverage start with a federally financed expansion of Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. That means more poor people would get health insurance right away. And, as economist Jonathan Gruber argued recently in The New York Times, expanding those programs provides a superb economic stimulus. When poor people get health insurance, they purchase medical goods and services. More important, they start spending money on other things, since they no longer have to put aside money to pay for medical emergencies. That funnels cash back into the economy, promoting growth. "Health care reform," Gruber concluded, "is good for our economy." <br> Some fiscal conservatives, upset that universal health care would require all sorts of new spending upfront, aren't so sure. They argue--rightly--that the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid is the primary reason why the federal government's long-term budget picture is so scary. If we can only avoid overwhelming deficits and, by extension, a lackluster economy in the future by spending less money on these health care programs over time, surely spending more money on them now makes no sense. <br> But, actually, it does. The reason Medicare and Medicaid are getting so expensive is that health care, overall, is getting so expensive. (Relative to private health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid control costs a little better.) But the only rational, not to mention humane, way to control health care costs is through system-wide reforms--the kind that are a lot harder, if not impossible, to implement in the disorganized and volatile insurance environment we have today. Making sure everybody has insurance is the first step--or, depending on how you do it, the first few steps--toward creating one common system. <br> Universal health care can also bolster the economy's long-term health in other ways. Sometimes people stay in jobs they'd prefer to leave just because they fear losing their insurance; this phenomenon, known as "job lock," distorts the labor market and makes the economy less efficient than it would be otherwise. Making health insurance universally available would change that. And, just like investments in infrastructure, investments in health care--properly targeted--can improve productivity, whether by encouraging investments in information technology (something most reform plans would do, in order to streamline record-keeping) or simply by creating a healthier workforce. Don't forget, too, that universal health care should ultimately make life easier for businesses struggling with the cost of employee coverage. If that need doesn't sound pressing to you, check out the auto companies' latest stock prices. <br> As it happens, a few key people in Washington already seem to believe these arguments--not least among them, the guy who was just elected president. Asked repeatedly during the campaign which of his big priorities he planned to shelve because of the economic crisis, he said over and over again that he remained committed to health care reform--along with climate-change policy--because the rationale for each remained as imperative as before. In each case, he noted, spending money now would improve growth in the short run while making the country more productive, and prosperous, in the long run. Obama had it right then. The key is sticking to that view now.By The EditorsReprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 This column was written by Ben Adler.<hr width="50%">In the weeks leading up to Election Day, the hand-wringing over voting irregularities reached a fever pitch. Rolling Stone published a feature by Greg Palast and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., warning that Republicans may have already stolen the election. The McCain campaign highlighted accusations that the civil rights group ACORN was trying to commit voter fraud by fabricating voter registrations. Voting rights groups sent nearly daily e-mail blasts to reporters obsessing over every state and local incident of voter intimidation or suppression. Even "The Simpsons" had a segment on possible electronic machine malfunctions. <br> And yet after Election Day, the stories seemed to have vanished. What happened? Did America's patchwork of voting systems that caused so much consternation in Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004 suddenly get fixed? <br> In fact, the 2008 election was rife with the same problems that have bedeviled others in recent years. It was only because Barack Obama's margin of victory was so healthy that the country was not waiting with bated breath to see how many provisional ballots were counted. So while the White House will soon be filled with someone who has been a leader on addressing voting rights in the Senate, the public pressure needed to move legislation through the meat grinder on Capitol Hill is noticeably absent. "It's a lot easier to illustrate the impact of these problems when there are 537 votes separating the presidential candidates," notes Jonah Goldman, Director of the National Campaign for Fair Elections in the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law's Voting Rights Project. But as seen by the haphazard, frantic rush to fix voting problems leading up to this year's election, it is imperative that lawmakers not wait until 2012 to address these challenges. There are numerous measures that the Obama administration, together with a Democratic Congress, could enact in the coming months. <br> Under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), 2008 was the first presidential election for which each state was required to match its voter rolls to other state records, such as those from the Department of Motor Vehicles. People whose residency was not confirmed were purged from the rolls--but many legitimate voters were removed in the process. "There are all sorts of reasons an eligible voter may not come up," says Daniel Tokaji, an election law expert at Ohio State University. One can be a citizen and not have a driver's license or even, in some cases, a Social Security number. Many people were purged due to data entry errors, such as misspelling their names. This problem famously bedeviled even the 2008 campaign's overnight sensation Joe the Plumber, whose name was misspelled on his voter registration. <br> All those voters who unknowingly got knocked from the rolls had to cast provisional ballots if they tried to vote on Election Day. But the rules for when and how provisional votes get counted vary widely, and some are so strict that many legitimate voters may fail to meet them. In California, for example, a voter who does not have an I.D. and votes provisionally gets his or her vote counted as long as he or she is a registered voter. In Ohio, however, a voter who does not present proper identification on Election Day may cast a provisional ballot--but for it to be counted, he or she must appear in person at the Board of Elections with an I.D. within ten days. <br> One way to solve the problems of voter purges and provisional ballots--as well as concerns about fraudulent registrations--would be a universal registration system, in which a national program automatically registers every American citizen when they turn 18, just as Selective Service currently enrolls every American male when they reach that age. Skeptics, such as Allison Hayward, a professor at George Mason Law School, suggest that the political will to spend federal dollars on a national voter database instead of, say, education, simply does not exist. <br> An alternative that has gained popularity in recent years is Election Day registration. Nine states currently allow eligible voters to register at the polling place, boosting turnout in each one of them--most notably this year in North Carolina, which experienced the biggest increase in turnout of any state. Some conservatives fear that Election Day registration increases the risk of fraud because someone with, say, residences in two states could vote in both. But there has not been any credible evidence of increased fraud in the states that have adopted it, according to most experts. Election Day registration has already been proposed in Congress, pushed particularly strongly by Senator Hillary Clinton (who, it seems, has other plans than to stay and guide it through). But Goldman, the voting rights expert, expressed confidence that other legislators will take up its banner in Clinton's absence. <br> It's not surprising that some of the most restrictive voter registration laws have come from state legislatures controlled by Republicans, such as laws in Indiana and Georgia that require voters to present a state-issued photo identification card at the polling place. (Republican legislatures in Wisconsin and Kansas passed similar laws that were vetoed by their Democratic governors.) People without identification are disproportionately poor, urban, young and non-white. For instance, in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, nearly three-quarters of African Americans and fully two-thirds of Hispanics aged 18 to 24 did not have a valid driver's license, according to a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study. All of those constituencies lean Democratic, so Republicans have a political incentive to support I.D. requirements. <br> Congressional Democrats could head off the possibility of more stringent state-level requirements by enacting a lower national standard, such as a requirement that voters show any one of a wide array of documents to prove their residency, including a utility bill, and simply sign an affidavit if they do not have any of them. Although the federal government has the authority to do so, it might be unpopular among states that want either greater or lesser requirements, making it unlikely to pass Congress. <br> Even if all the logistical impediments to voter registration are solved, many voters face other roadblocks to casting their ballots--particularly in the form of misinformation, which was rampant this past November, according to election experts. Some of these efforts are intended to discourage certain people from voting by warning of false penalties for doing so, such as when Virginia Tech students were told, incorrectly, by their local government that voting at school required them to give up tax benefits they may receive from residing with their parents. Other misinformation campaigns tell people to vote at the wrong time or place, such as the numerous complaints Goldman says his group received from Philadelphia about flyers being distributed in predominantly African-American neighborhoods saying that people with unpaid parking tickets might face arrest if they vote. Both of these kinds of tactics are perpetrated by local election officials who may want to disempower a local constituency, such as college students who some may want to exclude from local politics, or by partisan groups that hope to affect the results by disenfranchising people who are likely to vote for one party. <br> A pair of legislators from Illinois, Barack Obama in the Senate and Rahm Emanuel in the House, introduced bills to address deceptive practices. Neither bill became law, but now that Obama will be president and Emanuel his chief of staff, will they push similar bills from their new perch in the White House? Voting rights activists hope so. "It's really critical at this point," says Goldman. Currently, only "intimidating" practices are illegal under the Voting Rights Act. A deceptive-practices bill would outlaw misleading information, with criminal penalties that could serve as a deterrent, and it would involve the Justice department in informing voters of the correct information where deceptive practices are found. <br> But getting past the registrars at the doors doesn't ensure a problem-free vote. Some areas that saw a big spike in turnout, such as college campuses, found they had too few machines, or too few that worked. Students at Temple University experienced up to four-hour waits, while those at the University of Southern Florida stood in line for three hours throughout the day, according to Sujatha Jahagirdar, program director of Student PIRG's New Voters Project. "We were told that they didn't have enough voting booths," Jahagirdar says. "They tried to fix it but couldn't because of some technological issue." <br> In late April, House Republicans stymied a bill that would have provided funds to create a paper trail for electronic machines, or to switch away from them entirely, and to use the paper ballots to check the accuracy of the machines with a post-election audit. The Republicans complained that the bill, which would cost approximately $685 million, would be excessively expensive. The Democrats, 91 of whom were sponsors or co-sponsors in the House, may introduce new legislation with the same purpose. Congressman Rush Holt, the original sponsor of that bill and of an earlier unsuccessful effort to require a paper trail for all electronic machines, intends to reintroduce the stronger measure to create a national standard for verification, according to his office. <br> Seeing as most of these types of disenfranchisement disproportionately hurt Democrats, voting rights advocates are hoping that full Democratic control of Washington for the first time in 14 years will allow some of the recent bills to finally pass. But whatever options the new Congress and White House pursue, they'd be smart to do it soon. Even people who dedicate their lives to studying electoral reform admit that it is not an issue that captures the popular imagination for long. "When it comes to election administration," says Hayward, "The public cares about it for three weeks out of every four years."By Ben Adler Reprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 This column was written by <b>Fred Barnes.<hr width="50%">Barack Obama wants to give the economy a jolt. So far, though, the biggest jolt we've seen is the one the economy has given to Obama. That jolt, in the form of a plummeting stock market, upset Obama's desire for a leisurely transition. It made him virtually America's acting president. <br> Obama is fond of saying-he said it again last week-that the country has only one president at a time, and until January 20 it's George W. Bush. True enough, but financial markets don't look at Washington that way. They focus on the future, and that means Obama. Financial markets demanded at least some comforting hints about Obama's plans for reversing the economic downturn. <br> Reluctantly, Obama has begun to provide them. But it took a 900-point dip in the stock market, plus persistent pleas, for Obama to act. After two days of market collapse, his aides spread the word that Obama's choice for secretary of the Treasury would be Timothy Geithner, the head of the Federal Reserve in New York. <br> Last week, Obama made his choice of Geithner official. And he named former Treasury secretary Larry Summers his top economic counselor at the White House and chose a monetarist, Christina Romer of the University of California at Berkeley, as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers. The stock market rallied. This was change financial markets could believe in. <br> There's a larger point here. It's not that Obama, despite his unswervingly liberal record in the Senate, turns out to be a pragmatist. The point is he's pragmatic (so far) in one direction-rightward. Who knew? <br> His national security choices also underscore this point. Hillary Clinton benefits from not being John Kerry, who desperately wants to be secretary of state. And Obama owes Kerry for having lifted him from obscurity and made him keynote speaker at the 2004 Democratic convention. But knowing Kerry, Obama looked elsewhere and fastened on Clinton as his secretary of state. <br> Clinton, for all her shortcomings, doesn't hail from the surrender-at-all-costs wing of the Democratic party. Nor does retired Marine general Jim Jones, who's slated to be Obama's national security adviser. Jones, an Iraq war skeptic, is a strong supporter of offshore drilling and other steps to increase domestic production of oil and gas. <br> Then there's Bob Gates, Bush's defense secretary. Obama wants to keep him at the Pentagon for another year. Liberals and the media like Gates because he replaced the man they loved to hate, Donald Rumsfeld. But Gates is no dove and no ally of the antiwar left. <br> So the scoreboard looks like this: Three of the four cabinet posts that matter most are going to those with views acceptable to the center-right of the Democratic party. That's Geithner, Clinton, and Gates. The fourth, attorney general, will provoke a confirmation fight if Obama chooses his buddy Eric Holder, famous as President Clinton's deputy attorney general for facilitating the pardon of Marc Rich. <br> Three out of four isn't bad. Conservatives aren't jumping for joy. But imagine how the left wing of the Democratic party-the dominant wing, after all-feels. Let down would be an understatement. <br> Organized labor must be crazed over the selection of Summers. As a believer in the indispensability of global trade, Summers is bound to advise Obama to reject labor's call for limitations on trade, especially during a world financial breakdown. In fact, I suspect he's already urged Obama to go along with "card check," labor's latest scheme for unionizing workers, but not the protectionist agenda. Tinkering with trade would unsettle financial markets. <br> And how about the environmental lobby, which totally embraced Obama? Jones will be hard for environmentalists to stomach. And the foreign policy left? The left views Jones, Clinton, and Gates as enemies. <br> The losers in the Obama administration, as of now, are Joe Biden and Susan Rice, favorites of the left. Biden's role in foreign policy is likely to be minimal with Clinton at the State Department. She'll squash him if he sticks his head up. Rice, an assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration and an Obama campaign adviser, may wind up as United Nations ambassador, a highly visible but inconsequential post. She'll have little influence. <br> The Washington clich about appointments is that personnel is policy. It's an exaggeration but essentially true. If Obama wants to pursue economic and national security policies that would thrill MoveOn.org, William Ayers, and the Democratic left, he has a funny way of showing it. The only reasonable conclusion is he's spurning the left. <br> Obama has dozens of lesser posts to fill, and no doubt he'll use some of those jobs to assuage the left. Labor can probably have whomever it wants as secretary of labor. For all Obama's talk about education reform, chances are he'll bow to the teachers' lobby in choosing an education secretary. If former Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle becomes health and human services secretary, that will please the single-payer crowd and the champions of more government-managed health care. <br> But financial markets are Obama's overriding concern as president-elect. In their eyes, he's acting president. In his postelection press conference on November 7, Obama said his aides would be monitoring markets and the economy. The transition, in other words, would be relaxed and unhurried. <br> Last week, Obama's tone had changed. He was alarmed. He held press conferences three days in a row. He said he'd be getting full daily briefings on what's happening on Wall Street and Main Street. "We don't intend to stumble into the next administration," he said. <br> In trying to give financial markets a sense of comfort and continuity about his priorities, Obama might have provided one further note of assurance: that he won't raise taxes in 2009 or 2010. He stopped short of that. <br> But he offered a signal. Interviewed on 60 Minutes, Obama said, "We shouldn't worry about the deficit next year or even the year after." Later he told reporters his advisers would recommend whether to repeal the Bush tax cuts for the well-to-do and on capital gains and dividends, or merely allow the cuts to be "not renewed" and thus expire at the end of 2010. With the door opened to leaving the cuts in place, shutting it would be hazardous. Keeping the cuts would enrage the left, but financial markets would appreciate the jolt.By Fred BarnesReprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard 
 This column was written by David W. Rohde.<hr width="50%">After the 2004 presidential election Democrats were crushed. Four more years of George W. Bush seemed unthinkable, disastrous. But now that the Obama era is beginning, Democrats should view John Kerry's defeat as something else entirely: the luckiest break the party has caught since at least the 1964 election, which yielded the presidency of Lyndon Johnson and two-thirds Democratic congressional majorities. (Those 1964 victories made possible the passage of a long list of legislation backed by northern Democrats, including federal aid to education, Medicare, and the Voting Rights Act.) Indeed, had Bush lost in 2004, the Democrats simply wouldn't be anywhere near as powerful as they are now. <br> Of course, many will assert that a second Bush term is a very steep price to pay for today's success. But consider the pattern of events that likely would have followed Kerry's election. He would have faced a Republican Congress substantially weighted against him and hell-bent on disrupting his legislative agenda. That means no universal health care coverage and no elimination of Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy. Past experience also indicates that the electorate probably would not have blamed the Republicans for the congressional gridlock. For example, in the months leading up to the 1994 midterms, the Senate GOP used the filibuster to frustrate almost all of the proposals the Democrats sought to pass, but it was President Clinton and his party who took the blame. In fact, only three times since 1900 has the party of a sitting president failed to lose House seats in a midterm election, and given the political conditions, there's little reason to think President Kerry would have bucked the trend. <br> The Congress starting in 2007 probably would have been even harder for Democrats to navigate. Some version of the current financial crisis probably would have occurred. (Given that further regulation of the financial system was never part of candidate Kerry's '04 campaign, he probably would not have measurably changed government oversight of the financial sector.) But again, it would have been the Democratic president who got the blame, saddling him with a significant burden come reelection time. We might either have seen Kerry narrowly reelected along with a hostile GOP Congress, or a restoration of unified government under the Republicans. <br> Instead, the Bush administration survived, and the public grew increasingly disenchanted with its performance and the Republican brand. We see this not just in the net gain in House seats (51 since 2006) and in the Senate (12 more Democrats, and up to three extra depending on the outcomes of the unresolved races in Alaska, Minnesota, and Georgia), nor merely in Obama's crushing White House victory (the first Democrat to win more than 50 percent of the vote since Carter, and the largest popular vote percentage for a northern Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt), but also in the party's new, mammoth fundraising advantage. The Democratic Party apparatus spent more than a million dollars in 38 House races; the same was true for the Republicans in only four contests. Similarly, the Democratic Senate committee spent more than $8 million in five races; the most the GOP spent in any Senate contest was $6.5 million. According to exit polls, in 2004, 37 percent of the electorate identified themselves as Democrats, and the same proportion said they were Republicans. In 2008, the Democrats had 39 percent, while the GOP had only 32. <br> The Democrats under President Obama now have a working governing coalition for the first time since 1965-66. (President Jimmy Carter had large Democratic majorities in Congress, but they had little value for governing because of internal divisions and Carter's visible contempt for politicians. Clinton had narrower majorities than Carter, and he squandered his possibilities through poor strategic decisions and an unwillingness to work with congressional Democrats on major bills.) They hold at least as many Senate seats as they did when Clinton was elected, and almost as many House seats. Democratic-leaning legislation that has a good chance of passing now--from major health care reform to new energy policies to a shift in the tax burden--almost certainly would have looked hopeless had Kerry won in 2004. <br> To be sure, the "alternate history" of a Kerry victory discussed here involves probabilities, not certainties. It is difficult to predict precisely how events would have unfolded. For example, opinions of Bush suffered greatly from his handling of Hurricane Katrina; perhaps Kerry's approach would have been a big boost. Also, the situation in Iraq might have been very different, and that could have affected election results and governance. But even accounting for these uncertainties, it still seems extremely likely that Democrats are now far, far better off than they would have been under President Kerry. <br> It will take time to discover whether the developments in 2006 and 2008 constitute an enduring pro-Democratic shift in the electorate, rather than just a transitory negative reaction to Bush and the GOP. But the benefits the Democrats have realized from 2006 and 2008--the ample mandate and the majorities the Democrats now possess--have put the party on the path toward substantial progress in its policy goals. And if John Kerry and John Edwards had found their way into office four years ago, they would have found a much more difficult, possibly impossible, road ahead of them.By David W.

 This column was written by The Editors Of The New Republic.<hr width="50%">Now that Barack Obama has won the presidency, a swath of the Washington establishment is pressing him to answer what it considers an urgent question: How will he scale back his plans--for tax cuts, for health care reform, for education--in response to the economic emergency? Actually, they were incessantly asking that before the election--in each of the three presidential debates, in fact. And even members of his own party have joined the David Gergens and Bob Schieffers in demanding that Obama retrench. This is, to say the least, a bizarre fixation, one that simultaneously misreads economics, politics, and history. <br> The complaint about Obama's agenda begins with the fact of rising deficits. The argument holds that they necessitate the scaling back of expenditures. This would be a sound argument in decent economic times, but in the early stages of a recession it is madness. Even conservative economists like Martin Feldstein have called on the federal government to spend billions on fiscal stimulus, deficit be damned. That's the surest way to hasten recovery. <br> Of course, there are good reasons to fret over long-term deficits. They can siphon money from investments that improve the living standards of future generations. But, aside from his stimulus package, Obama's agenda is designed precisely to provide investments that would improve future living standards. <br> Take his health care reform plan. Sure, it costs money. But spiraling health care costs are also driving up future deficits--a fact that has swung the moderate wing of the party associated with Robert Rubin behind reform. The Rubinites have come to understand that reform isn't an impediment to long-term solvency but a necessary step toward it. We doubt that future generations would thank us if we bequeathed them a sputtering jalopy of a health care system that required ever greater expenditures lest it break down completely. <br> Obama's first task, then, is to upend the mindless conventional wisdom which holds that he must never implement the agenda he campaigned on. And this will involve straightening out some of his fellow Democrats who believe that he should replicate the fiscal strategy of the early Clinton era, when the administration scaled back its more ambitious spending plans and focused instead on deficit reduction, a choice that laid the groundwork for the boom of the late 1990s. But the analogy isn't terribly apt. By the time Clinton changed tack, the economy was already well on the path to recovering from the recession- -a very different situation from the one we now face. <br> There's another lesson from the Clinton presidency that is being widely misapplied these days. Democrats worry that, if Obama tries to do too much too soon, his first two years in office will end with a Republican rout in the midterm elections--just as Clinton's did. "We moved fast in the 103rd [Congress], and what did it get us?" mused House Majority Whip James Clyburn, who instead advocates, as a Wall Street Journal article characterized it, "a pragmatic approach to governance that would begin with items that have proven bipartisan support before tackling ambitious elements such as universal health care." <br> This utterly misunderstands the nature of the Clinton debacle. Clinton was punished not because he tried to reform the health care system but because he failed. Voters had spent a year listening to Clinton tell them how the health care system was broken; then they spent another year and a half hearing about how he presided over a legislative stalemate. And, as his plan stalled, Republicans managed to portray it in fearful and inaccurate terms. <br> The politics of health care reform shouldn't be anywhere near that complicated. Instead of dithering over a deal, Democrats need to remind their Republican colleagues of the price the GOP paid for opposing the creation of Social Security and Medicare. Sure, they can oppose this new program as a socialistic nightmare. But they will be forced to spend the rest of their careers defending their vote to deprive voters of health care. <br> None of this is to say that Obama should abandon moderation or bipartisanship. There are areas for cooperation. Education is one: His support for teacher accountability and flexible hiring practices would attract Republican backing. And he ought to make a point of forming bipartisan coalitions to root out waste in the budget and tax code. <br> But, in the end, there's probably nothing the Democrats can do to avoid losing seats in 2010. Almost all presidents suffer defeats during their first midterm elections. The greatest risk for Democrats is not that Obama will try to do too much, but that their terror of failure will lead them to waste an historic opportunity. This is not a Clintonian moment. It is more like the moment Lyndon Johnson inherited in 1965, or the one Franklin Roosevelt faced in 1933--a chance to reshape American government. The Democrats have it in their grasp to master the great problems of public life if they can summon their collective nerve. The only thing they have to fear is fear itself.The Editors Of The New RepublicReprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 This column was written by Andrew Ferguson.<hr width="50%">"To those Americans whose support I have yet to earn--I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your president too." <br> --Barack Obama, November 4, 2008 <br> "Today I want to speak to every person who voted for my opponent: To make this nation stronger and better I will need your support, and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can do to deserve your trust. A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation. We have one country, one Constitution and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America." <br> --George W. Bush, November 3, 2004 <br> He was a college professor with strong political opinions--two marks against him right there--but even so he seemed to be a very smart man. Like all but 17 of America's college professors, he was an Obama supporter. He had noted my skepticism. <br> "But don't you see Obama has the potential to be a unifying force," he said. "He could bring the country together, the way Reagan did to win the Cold War." <br> I didn't know what to say. How do these things get started? Reagan as a unifying force? <br> I spent a lot of time during the Reagan years in faculty lounges, on college campuses, with men and women just like this professor, and I don't remember Reagan as a unifying force. Just about everybody I knew hated him--really couldn't stand him, with a teeth-grinding, skin-crawling disdain. Even beyond the leafy lotus land of higher-ed, he was acknowledged by admirer and critic alike as a "polarizing presence." Weekend after weekend, protesters swelled our great cities and hoisted placards calling him either a psychopath or a buffoon (they could never decide which). His foremost political adversary, Tip O'Neill, said he "had ice water for blood." His landslide reelection victory in 1984 was impressive, but even then, at the zenith of his presidency, more than 40 percent of voters wanted to give him the boot. For that matter, his victory in 1984 wasn't as big as the victory recorded in 1972 by Richard Nixon. Now there was a unifying force. <br> Only in retrospect has Reagan been tagged as a twinkly, grandfatherly presence, a firm but gentle leader who transcended ideology and brought us together to defeat the Soviet Empire. Things didn't go so smoothly at the time. In his dealings with the Soviets, for example, Reagan was hampered at every step--first by liberals for being too rough, then by conservatives for being too soft. The firing of the air traffic controllers, the huge tax cuts of 1981, the huge tax hike of 1982 (in the middle of a recession!), the nuclear freeze movement, aid to the contras and to the mujahedeen, the "three million" homeless, budget cuts, the invasion of Grenada, the Iran-contra scandal and the subsequent calls for impeachment--the real story of the Reagan years is a story of endless contention, much of it bitter, wrenching, and, to a squeamish public, unpleasant to watch. <br> What fogs our memory and makes the retrospective Reagan seem like a unifying force is his success. Success, they say, has a thousand fathers, and we kid ourselves into believing we all of us were papa to the Reagan revolution. According to today's popular accounts he won the Cold War and touched off a great economic boom, so of course the country stood unified in support. Who, after all, could have argued with such improbable accomplishments as they took shape? Everybody loved him! <br> Trust me, though: They didn't. <br> Our infatuation with "unity" is a recurring delusion of American politics. Among the many examples are the hapless attempts that political geeks make year after year to form third parties that will transcend ideology and return us to our natural, prelapsarian state of cooperation. Ross Perot capitalized on the delusion by telling voters they could join together, hire a managerial expert to run the government "like a business," and do away with a political class that was driving them apart (and not paying enough attention to him). The most recent and consequential example of it is the mesmerism of Barack Obama's presidential campaign. <br> Unity is a phantasm raising hopes for something that can't be delivered--or that, once delivered, would be so un-American it would scare us half to death. Yet unity was Obama's theme. The sales pitch was a proposition that seemed self-evident: The only way "to get things done" and "move this country forward" was to "bring us together," just as we believe Reagan did even though he didn't. <br> Whether Obama really thinks such a thing is possible is anybody's guess. He doesn't look like a cynic to me. As a career politician, he has been required by his profession to face opponents and defeat them if he wants to get his way. Division is what politicians do. He's got to know this, even if his blissed-out followers don't. In his endless campaign, though, he never stopped talking as if the clashing political interests and contending ideas of a big, complicated, self-governing country were all just a terrible misunderstanding. His final stump speech--which his campaign called, with customary pomposity, the "closing argument," as though the candidate had suddenly turned into Perry Mason--was drenched in togetherness. Right at the top he promised that his victory would "put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election; that tries to pit region against region, city against town, Republican against Democrat . . ." <br> Obama's theatrical gift is such that his listeners seldom pause to think about what he's saying. He communicates through a kind of subverbal music, half-heard and absorbed rather than cogitated on. But consider that promise above. What kind of "politics . . . divides the nation just to win an election"? Well, every kind. Elections presuppose a divided nation; if the nation weren't divided it wouldn't need an election. Besides, politics, of whatever kind, doesn't cause the divisions; it expresses them and clarifies them. Experience shows that this method of expressing division is far preferable to the alternatives, which often involve bazookas. You will note too that he declares his contempt for a politics that pits Republicans against Democrats. Republicans pitted against Democrats? Horrifying. Please make it stop. <br> And of course Obama's chief pledge is to make it stop. He'll be elected and unity will ensue. But how? It goes without saying that the easiest way to unify the country is to eliminate those elements within it that make trouble for the unifier. Stalinists and Nazis were terrific at unifying countries. Their techniques are closed to him, of course, Obama being neither a Stalinist nor a Nazi but only a hardworking, ambitious, well-meaning American pol. But in dealing with the wayward elements, he has other options. He can declare that the nonunifiers are philosophically or morally indecent. Or he can pretend they don't exist. <br> Obama does both, depending on the rhetorical point he's trying to make. When his opponents dissented from his tax plan, he said they were making "a virtue of selfishness." They were, he said, coddling criminal CEOs and responding with Pavlovian discipline to the commands of sleazy lobbyists. They refused to honor American troops and veterans. Their cynicism was instinctual. Obama's "new politics of unity" would end "the old politics of division" by labeling those old politicians and their arguments irredeemably corrupt, hence unworthy of consideration. Obama's supporters were asked to divide the country between those who were united--that would be them--and those who weren't, for whatever reason. In a platform trick reminiscent of Huey Long, Obama actually asked his supporters during campaign rallies how much money they made, the better to drive them away from the unsavory, nonunited elements that earn more than they do. <br> When these elements have been dispensed with, unity becomes a simple matter of people identifying their own best interests and falling into one another's arms. In his stump speech, Obama pretended that every major political disagreement was merely the consequence of a false choice. "When it comes to health care," he said, "we don't have to choose between a government-run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now." But of course nobody--really, nobody--thinks those are the only alternatives in the health care debate. "When it comes to jobs," he said, "the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around America or allowing every job to disappear overseas." Who says it is? "When it comes to giving every child a world-class education," he said, "the choice is not between more money and more reform." <br> This is more than rhetorical license. By positioning himself as the third way between two absurd alternatives that no one favors, Obama has persuaded voters of his reasonableness and moderation; and thus of his ability to get things done. That illusory advantage will go poof soon enough, though. Think about his third way in education reform. There he sits, or so he says, nobly perched between the (nonexistent) more-money and more-reform factions. President Bush, if I can mention the unmentionable, thought he was putting himself in the same position in 2001. He managed to bring his "conservative reformers" together with liberals like Senator Edward Kennedy, water carrier for the educational establishment. Together they produced a complicated and expensive set of reforms that appeared to lasso every warring faction into a united effort. <br> The unity didn't last long, as you've probably noticed, though in a way, I suppose, No Child Left Behind did prove a unifying force: When put into practice, it managed to frustrate and anger nearly every interested party--for contradictory and irreconcilable reasons. When the law lapses next year, President Obama will find himself smack in the middle of these crosswires, where every move touches off an explosion, often on time-release, set to blow when you least expect it. If we're lucky he won't go back to blaming criminal CEOs and sleazy lobbyists. But we probably won't be lucky. <br> Like vacation brochures or soft-core pornography or TV ads for Ronco's Chop-O-Matic, political campaigns are exercises in fantasy. They sell something that could never exist in the real world, at least in its advertised form. Certainly the campaign of Obama's opponent--who promised, among much else, to balance the federal budget in four years--was built largely on fantasy. Reagan sold some fantasies of his own, as his critics never tired of pointing out. Obama's chief fantasy is that he's a politician who will relieve us of the burden of politics. He may wind up, like Reagan, a successful president. But if he does, it will be because, like Reagan, he engaged his ideological and political opponents in ferocious battles and beat them. Maybe unity will ensue--but only in hindsight, 20 years on or more, after we've forgotten how we got there. By Andrew FergusonReprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard 
 This column was written by Jonathan Cohn.<hr width="50%">You hear lots of talk about which former president Barack Obama should use as a model. Bill Clinton comes up regularly. Franklin Roosevelt, too. But what about the guy in the White House now? <br> I know, President Bush's approval ratings are hovering around 30 percent. This election was in many ways a referendum on his tenure and the verdict could not have been more unambiguous. The voters didn't like it. "Saturday Night Live" got an entire skit (and a pretty funny one) out of John McCain trying to escape the stigma of his failure. <br> But was Bush really a "failure"? That depends on how you define it. <br> Consider what Bush has accomplished. He has overhauled the tax code, tilting it towards the wealthy and significantly reducing federal revenues. He signed a landmark education reform that changed the curriculum in virtually ever public school. He gutted the regulatory state and hollowed out the bureaucracy. He added a drug benefit to Medicare, thereby enacting the largest single entitlement expansion since the 1960s. He tipped the Supreme Court's ideological balance with two strongly conservative appointees. <br> And that's just what he did on domestic policy. Bush also sponsored a massive program to help treat AIDS in under-developed countries. He rewrote long-standing doctrine on foreign policy and human rights. And, oh yeah, he engineered--and then prosecuted--a war that overthrew a dictator, destabilized a region, and committed the U.S. to an occupation whose end is still unknown. <br> That's quite a tally--arguably, one that no president since Lyndon Johnson can match. (Before that, you'd have to go back to FDR.) And with the exception of the Medicare drug program, every single one of those accomplishments represent a realization of goals that he, his fellow travelers in the conservative movement, or both had sought for years or even decades. <br> America today looks radically different than it did in January, 2001. And it looks that way because Bush made it so. <br> Now, for the most part, the country doesn't seem to think Bush's changes have left us better off. And I'd agree, with a few key exceptions. (High on the list would be that AIDS program, for which I believe Bush deserves more credit than he's received.) But he still achieved quite a lot. And, simply in terms of leadership style, President-elect Obama could do worse than to take a page or two from Bush's playbook. <br> One of Bush's most remarkable qualities--and one, I admit, that I frequently admired--was his stubborn focus on goals and willingness to push political boundaries aggressively. It took a president of uncommon gumption and boldness to push such a radical agenda; America, after all, is not a radical country by nature. But Bush understood political opportunity when it presented itself and he seized it. And while I'd hate to see Obama systematically ignoring policy experts and manipulating intelligence--or deliberately stoking partisan division for the sake of winning elections--I wouldn't mind if, like Bush, Obama showed the same sort of singular focus. <br> Like Bush, Obama is pursuing an ambitious agenda: Re-organizing the country's economy and infrastructure to fight climate change and achieve energy independence; overhauling its massive health care system; undoing all of the tax changes Bush signed into law and, in the process, addressing the country's long-term fiscal crisis; beginning unprecedented levels of investment in young children's education and well-being; repairing America's image in the world and, in the process, finishing the fight against Islamic extremism. <br> Already, the opinion class is tut-tutting. It's too expensive, they say, and too radical. But it's not all that different from what Bush tried. The difference is that Obama would be pushing in the opposite ideological direction and, if the polls are to be believed, in a direction that the country happens to favor. <br> Not only does that mean Obama should, if anything, have an easier time achieving it. It also means that, if he accomplishes those goals, he can leave with his party's majority intact--and his approval ratings higher than 30 percent. <br> Fortunately, Obama seems to get this. He hasn't given up the talk of "changing Washington" and bipartisanship; I imagine he believes it, too. But he's also made it clear he's not about to back away from goals just because they'll encounter initial resistance. <br> When asked repeatedly in the final weeks which of his legislative goals he planned to discard, because of the financial crisis, he refused to play along, insisting his agenda remained the same. Just today, incoming Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said something similar on ABC's "This Week." After making the case for energy independence and health care reform, even in the midst of an economic calamity, Emanuel said "This opportunity, this crisis, provides--as the president-elect has said repatedly--the opportunity to do things Americans have pushed off for years." President Bush couldn't have said it better. By Jonathan CohnReprinted with permission from The New Republic 
 This analysis was written by U.S. News World Report columnist Michael Barone.<br><br>What will an Obama administration and a Congress with increased Democratic majorities do? That's a relevant question, given the Democrats' leads in the polls. And it's a little hard to answer, given the financial crisis that has been raging and the recession that seems to be ahead. <br> One thing they will certainly do is raise taxes on high earners. The Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire in 2010, and congressional Democrats will gleefully allow the top rates to rise. Left-leaning Democrats, like <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> himself, want to "spread the wealth around," as the candidate told Joe the Plumber in October. Blue Dog Democrats want to reduce the budget deficit and will welcome the additional revenue that the Congressional Budget Office's static-analysis models will promise. Raising taxes when the economy is weakening is not the medicine prescribed by Keynesian economics, and it is probably not what Obama's economic advisers would prescribe if they were starting from scratch today. It is what Herbert Hoover and Congress did in the early 1930s, and it helped to produce the Great Depression. But it is baked into the pie. <br> So is a slide toward trade protectionism. The breakdown of the Doha Round and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's refusal to bring the Colombia Free Trade Agreement to a vote mean that both multilateral and bilateral trade liberalism channels are clogged. Obama may or may not try to renegotiate NAFTA, as both Canada and Mexico have center-right governments satisfied with current arrangements. But the trend will be toward less free trade. <br> The prospects are cloudier for two other issues on which Obama has made big promises. Much of the next Congress's time and psychic energy will be taken up with refashioning financial regulation--a subject of considerable difficulty. And the looming recession will make it politically risky for Democrats to push big spending programs. <br> This means that Congress in the next two years may not pass Obama's national health insurance plan. The weakening economy and the enraged reaction earlier this year to $4-a-gallon gasoline also make it less likely that Congress will pass carbon reduction legislation--certainly not a carbon tax and probably not a cap-and-trade system. <br> Regional impact. In any case, health insurance and carbon reduction will be heavily lobbied, despite all the denunciations of lobbyists issued by Obama (and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span>). Any one-size-fits-all healthcare bill affects various regions differently, because we have many healthcare delivery and finance systems across the country. The same goes for carbon reduction legislation, as the economies of some regions depend more heavily on coal than do others; it may be hard to convince voters there that we have to impose burdens on them today to achieve promised benefits in 2050. These disparities cut across party lines and helped defeat the Clinton healthcare proposals in 1994. They will probably come into play again if far-ranging bills are pressed forward. <br> Two issues pushed by Democrats in this Congress have no budgetary costs. One is the "fairness doctrine," which is intended to shut down talk radio, the one communications medium in which conservative voices are dominant. The other is the so-called card check bill, which requires employers to bargain with unions when their organizers secure signatures on cards from a majority of employees; secret-ballot unionization elections, required now, would be a thing of the past. The aim is to vastly increase union membership, pumping money into a Democratic pressure group. <br> What might happen in the unlikely event McCain is elected and faces a Democratic Congress? Presumably he would try to hold tax rates down, but to do so he might have to embrace the kind of bipartisan tax reform enacted in 1986, with low rates and fewer preferences. Democrats might be willing to bargain if they could get rid of the alternative minimum tax, which threatens their core constituencies. McCain's plan to end the tax preference for employer-provided health insurance could be the basis of compromise with a similar plan advanced by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden that has bipartisan support. McCain might also seek a bipartisan carbon reduction bill. <br> Much depends, whoever wins, on whether Democrats elect enough senators to overcome filibusters. Even more may ride on the course of the economy and the depth of the recession, which could scotch either candidate's proposals.By Michael Barone 
 This column was written by Jonah Goldberg. <br> Plans, shmans. <br> Under <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama's</span> plan, 95 percent of Americans will get a tax cut. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain's</span> plan will deliver portable, affordable health care to all Americans. Obama has a plan to win in Afghanistan. So does McCain. There are plans for how to implement plans and plans for how some plans will be replaced by other plans. Go through their respective Web sites and you'll fine more plans than at the hall of records. <br> But none of it is real, not really. Some historians claim that 19th-century Prussian field marshal Helmuth von Moltke, not President Eisenhower, authored the aphorism that no plan survives contact with the enemy. But my guess is that the first Neanderthal who came back from a woolly mammoth hunting party with some flattened comrades and a lot of broken spears said something similar. <br> The simple fact is that planning is very hard. Even plans to build houses often require countless revisions. But planning for people is so much harder. Every weekend I have a plan for how my one 5-year-old child will spend her day. Keep in mind: I am literally the boss of her. She has no money, little education and no reliable means of escape. And yet, she foils my plans time and again. But somehow we're supposed to believe that a plan involving billions or trillions of dollars, millions of people (each with their own agenda) and thousands of communities influenced by countless interested parties and bureaucracies is not only possible, but the highest responsibility of our elected leaders. <br> Mao and Stalin had their five-year plans and benefited from the added flexibility that comes with the ability to kill millions of their own people, and yet that worker's paradise always seemed just one more five-year plan away. Every football team goes into a game with a plan. Only one comes out victorious. <br> This is not to say that some plans don't work out. But what makes for a successful plan is a complicated thing, the details of which will have to wait for another day. <br> The simple, relevant fact is that the more detailed and extensive a plan a president proposes, the less likely it is that it will be enacted. One basic reason for this - often overlooked by politicians and the journalists who cover them - is that presidents don't make laws in our system. Congress does. And Congress usually has plans of its own. Bill Clinton promised health-care reform, and his wife had a plan thicker than the New York City Yellow Pages. Congress never even voted on it. <br> Much like Obama, Bill Clinton barnstormed the country promising a middle-class tax cut. Once he got into the White House, that got filed under "never gonna happen." George H.W. Bush said "read my lips" about his plan to never, ever, ever raise taxes. It turned out that "never" is a term open to many interpretations. <br> Now, depending on your perspective, you might think such reversals are profiles in courage, and you might even be right. But the point is that it is juvenile to believe that voting for a president is synonymous with holding a referendum on a plan. And yet we have these interminable, often Jesuitical debates on what the fine print of the candidates' plans says. Journalistic fact-checkers take their jeweler's glasses to every footnote and appendix as if the ultimate merit of each candidate can be found in a binder. <br> Even worse, after every debate we are subjected to an endless parade of focused-grouped "swing voters" who think they're oh-so-terribly sophisticated for wanting to hear ever more details about this candidate's plan for education reform or that candidate's scheme for health care. It's all absurd intellectual vanity. These voters are undecided not because they haven't been spoon-fed enough policy detail, but because they haven't been paying attention and haven't bothered to do even minimal research about the candidates. <br> I'm not saying that candidates shouldn't have platforms. But voters - and journalists - should look at them as mission statements, not the political equivalent of instructions that come with a disassembled bicycle. <br> The real hints for how to choose a candidate, at least in a general election (as opposed to a primary), reside in the realm of judgment, philosophy, track record and temperament. And, using those criteria, the choice shouldn't be hard at all.By Jonah GoldbergReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by William Kristol. <br> The odds are against <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vp-candidate-profile-sarah-palin/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Sarah Palin</span> winning this election. It's not easy to make up a 6-point deficit in the last four weeks. But it can be done.Look at history. The Gore-Lieberman ticket gained about 6 points in the final two weeks of the 2000 campaign. Ford-Dole came back more than 20 points in less than two months in the fall of 1976. Both tickets were from the party holding the White House, and both were running against inexperienced, and arguably risky, opponents. <br> What's more, this year's race has already--twice--moved by more than 6 points over a span of only a few weeks. The race went from McCain up 2 (these are the Real Clear Politics averages) on September 14 to Obama plus 6 on October 2, less than three weeks later. In the four weeks before that, the race had moved from Obama plus 5 on August 12 to McCain plus 2 on September 12. <br> So while there's reason for McCain-Palin supporters to worry, there's no reason to despair. <br> Despair is what the Obama campaign is hoping and working for. If a campaign can convince supporters of the other candidate that the race is effectively over, the enthusiasm and volunteer efforts drop off--as does, ultimately, their turnout on Election Day. Just as important, undecided and loosely affiliated voters become persuaded there's no real contest and lose any incentive to look closely at the candidates. This explains the efforts of the Obama campaign--aided by a colluding media--to sell the notion that the race is over, that McCain supporters should give up, and undecided voters should tune out. <br> That's why the events at the end of last week were so important.On Thursday night, Sarah Palin more than held her own in the vice-presidential debate against <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vp-candidate-profile-joe-biden-23-08-2008/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Joe Biden</span>. She may well have stopped the McCain campaign's slide and, with her assaults on Obama's tax-and-spend liberalism and his willingness to lose in Iraq, set up McCain for a strong performance in Tuesday night's debate. <br> On Friday, enough House Republicans came around to pass the $700 billion financial bailout. It's no magic bullet, either in terms of the economy or the McCain campaign. But it gives both a chance. <br> McCain's decline in the second half of September is easily explained. A huge financial crisis coming to a head less than two months before Election Day is going to hurt the candidate of the incumbent party. The situation was made worse by the perception that not only was a Republican administration presiding over a financial meltdown, but congressmen from the same party were obstructing efforts to deal with it. <br> McCain's decision to come back to Washington to try to work out a deal was therefore sensible. While the Bush administration and the congressional Republicans were squabbling and Rome burned, McCain had no chance. Now there is a deal, and the political bleeding may have been staunched. McCain can go on the offensive for the final weeks. <br> But what kind of offensive? <br> The positive component is pretty straightforward: McCain and Palin are common sense conservatives and proven reformers. The record of reform can be emphasized and contrasted with Obama's and Biden's record of conventional, go-along, get-along liberalism. And implicitly: If McCain and Palin are reformers and outsiders, it's not Bush's third term. More important is the negative message. The McCain campaign has to convince 51 percent of the voters they can't trust <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> to be our next president. This has an ideological component and a character component. <br> Character is a legitimate issue. Obama hasn't shown much in the way of leadership or political courage, and he's consorted with dubious figures. It's fair to ask whether Barack Obama is personally trustworthy enough to be president, and the McCain campaign shouldn't be intimidated from going there. <br> But one shouldn't underestimate the ideological issue, and the potency of the fact that Obama and Biden are orthodox liberals. They're for raising taxes, federally funding abortions, naming activist judges, and losing wars. The American people may think--they do think--the country's on the wrong track, that the Bush administration has made too many mistakes and that the Republican party's no great shakes. But they haven't suddenly become liberals. And they probably aren't crazy about the prospect of a liberal administration governing unchecked, hand in hand with a liberal Congress. During the next four weeks, the McCain-Palin campaign should make this risky prospect vivid.By William KristolReprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard 
 This column was written by Robert Gordon and James Kvaal.<hr width="50%">Witnessing the collapse of one Wall Street titan after another seemed unthinkable a year ago, but the U.S. has seen worse before. When Franklin Roosevelt took office, four thousand banks had closed in just two months. From his improvisatory response--like a quarterback calling plays, as he once described it, back when quarterbacks called plays--the framework for the modern banking system emerged. <br> With wiser leadership, that framework might have prevented the current meltdown. For years, Senator Paul Sarbanes pressed for anti-predatory lending measures that would have slowed the disastrous subprime boom. At the Federal Reserve, the late Ned Gramlich sought new scrutiny of loans by the barely regulated bank affiliates with the worst portfolios. Arthur Levitt, then chairing the Securities and Exchange Commission, opposed the deregulation of the credit default swaps market in which AIG placed its most disastrous bets. And only months ago, Representative Barney Frank pressed for aggressive federal action to work out defaulting loans and stem the decline of foreclosures. <br> But policymakers put too much faith in "market discipline" to stem excess risk, and now here we are. The first focus is stemming the crisis, which may soon require a new entity to manage the liabilities that government is taking on. But whatever happens on that score, the time will soon come to rethink the entire regulatory structure. The aim should be a system that can withstand the bubble-based thinking that has brought us so low. That will require major changes. <br> The alphabet soup created by Roosevelt and his successors no longer tastes so good. Regulatory responsibilities are hopelessly muddled, and the jurisdictional lines between the regulators no longer make much sense. There are five federal banking regulators, plus state regulators. While the SEC regulates the sale of stocks and bonds, a different agency regulates some derivatives, while others go unregulated. Insurance--one of the largest financial industries--is regulated almost entirely by states. In a world of complicated new instruments, like collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, it's become difficult to know who is supposed to regulate what. Today's large financial institutions compete in multiple markets and across state and national lines. By adjusting their legal status, companies can effectively choose their own regulator, making it difficult to hold them to strict rules. <br> Despite all the regulators in place, the current system overlooks many of the most important transactions. Half of our financial markets--controlling some $10 trillion in assets--are barely regulated at all. These entities include investment banks, hedge funds, and mortgage companies (which are not banks but made the bulk of subprime mortgages). <br> Straightening out the system will require both reorganizing and strengthening the regulators. Senator <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> clearly does not grasp this. <br> Never one to worry about consistency, he bitterly assailed Wall Street this week--but only after weeks of sending coded love notes to the very same crowd. He has maintained his close ties with Phil Gramm, the former senator who never met a financial regulation he didn't hate. McCain warned earlier this week that "We cannot tolerate a system that handicaps our markets and our banks." Earlier in the year, in a major address on the housing crisis, he called for "removing regulatory, accounting and tax impediments to raising capital." <br> Of course, the removal of regulatory requirements for raising capital has played a part in the current crisis. The most interesting line in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span>'s speech Tuesday was his comment about how "we repealed outmoded rules instead of updating them"--a veiled shot at late 1990s deregulation pressed by Gramm and signed into law by Bill Clinton. <br> Obama went on to lay out six principles for reform that get the big things right. Most important are stronger safeguards in areas of the greatest risk. Many investors have borrowed to increase the size of their investments, lifting their potential profits but leaving no cushion if things go sour. As Roger Altman and Steve Rattner have argued, these risky investments will need to be backed by more reserve capital. They should also be subject to stronger disclosure requirements, to give markets a chance to work. <br> The Federal Reserve has decided to make investment banks eligible for short-term loans previously made only to traditional banks, putting taxpayer dollars on the line to prevent widespread economic damage. But this federal benefit should come with some of the same oversight given traditional banks. Otherwise we are effectively allowing investment banks to gamble with taxpayer money. <br> As Obama said, we need to reorganize our regulatory agencies around what institutions do, not what their legal status happens to be. The current system is like setting different speed limits for different brands of cars. Obama didn't specify an alternative, but one natural possibility is to give different regulators different core missions--system risk here, consumer protection there. Regulations would depend on the nature of the risk, not the legal status of the entity regulated. <br> Also important are two steps beyond the six principles Obama enumerated in his address. The most urgent task is resolving the millions of troubled mortgages, whose value is still unknown. We need to get homeowners into mortgages they can afford to repay--a step that would accelerate our recovery as well as help millions of families. And then, as many have sought for years, Congress should ban the predatory and abusive mortgages that sparked the crisis, starting with prepayment penalties that lock homeowners into unaffordable loans. <br> The final issue, important for its symbolism, is excessive executive pay. CEOs of companies whose stock underperforms Treasury bonds routinely earn nearly $3 million a year. More spectacularly, Merrill Lynch's leadership trio, who saw their venerable firm's value plummet until it needed to be taken over by Bank of America, may make $200 million this year alone. Such absurdities threaten the trust and cinfidence that markets need to thrive. <br> Stripping the Fannie and Freddie CEOs of their golden parachutes was a fine first step, but the SEC ought to go further and let shareholders vote on CEO pay packages. Loopholes have made a mockery of the Clinton-era law limiting the deductibility of executive pay unless it is based on performance; repairing that law is worth a closer look too. <br> Some people call these kinds of measures a step on the road to socialism. But Franklin Roosevelt, having used his first moments as president to declare that the money changers had fled the temple, would have disagreed. And his willingness to rein in the capitalists ultimately saved them. Besides, with the Federal Reserve taking an 80 percent stake in a gargantuan private insurance company, it is hard to know who the socialists are anymore.By Robert Gordon and James KvaalIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 EDITOR'S NOTE: At last week's Republican convention in St. Paul, vice-presidential nominee <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vp-candidate-profile-sarah-palin/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Sarah Palin</span>, under fire from Democrats who belittled her experience as a small-town mayor, struck back at <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span>, questioning whether his experience as a community organizer is a qualification for the presidency. "I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a community organizer," Palin said, "except that you have actual responsibilities." Palin's remarks set off a controversy over Obama and community organizing, forcing Obama himself to defend his experience. But it also raised a more basic question: Just what did Obama do as an organizer in Chicago in the 1980s? A few months ago, NR's Byron York traveled to Chicago to explore Obama's experience there. He wrote this report for the June 30 issue of National Review: <br> Barack Obama often cites his time as a community organizer here in Chicago as one of the experiences that qualify him to hold the nation's highest office. "I can bring this country together," he said in a debate last February. "I have a track record, starting from the days I moved to Chicago as a community organizer." <br> When Obama says such things, the reaction among many observers is: Huh? <br> Audiences understand when he mentions his years as an Illinois state legislator, or his brief tenure in the U.S. Senate. But a community organizer? What's that? <br> Even Obama didn't know when he first gave it a try back in 1985. "When classmates in college asked me just what it was that a community organizer did, I couldn't answer them directly," Obama wrote in his memoir, Dreams from My Father. "Instead, I'd pronounce on the need for change. Change in the White House, where Reagan and his minions were carrying on their dirty deeds. Change in the Congress, compliant and corrupt. Change in the mood of the country, manic and self-absorbed. Change won't come from the top, I would say. Change will come from a mobilized grass roots." <br> If you substitute "Bush" for "Reagan," you have a fairly accurate description of Obama's 2008 campaign. That's not a coincidence; it suggests that something about community organizing was central to Obama's world view back then, and has remained central to his development as the politician he is today. What was it? <br> I counted myself among those who didn't have a good idea of what a community organizer does. So I came here to learn more about Obama's time in the job, from 1985 to 1988. What did he do? What did he accomplish? And what in his experience here stands as a qualification to be president of the United States? <br> THE RADICAL'S RULES<br>Perhaps the simplest way to describe community organizing is to say it is the practice of identifying a specific aggrieved population, say unemployed steelworkers, or itinerant fruit-pickers, or residents of a particularly bad neighborhood, and agitating them until they become so upset about their condition that they take collective action to put pressure on local, state, or federal officials to fix the problem, often by giving the affected group money. Organizers like to call that "direct action." <br> Community organizing is most identified with the left-wing Chicago activist Saul Alinsky (1909-72), who pretty much defined the profession. In his classic book, Rules for Radicals, Alinsky wrote that a successful organizer should be "an abrasive agent to rub raw the resentments of the people of the community; to fan latent hostilities of many of the people to the point of overt expressions." Once such hostilities were "whipped up to a fighting pitch," Alinsky continued, the organizer steered his group toward confrontation, in the form of picketing, demonstrating, and general hell-raising. At first, the organizer tackled small stuff, like demanding the repair of streetlights in a city park; later, when the group gained confidence, the organizer could take on bigger targets. But at all times, the organizer's goal was not to lead his people anywhere, but to encourage them to take action on their own behalf. <br> Alinsky started in the 1930s with workers in the Chicago stockyards. Many years later, when Obama arrived here, he came from a different perspective. <br> "Barack had been very inspired by the civil-rights movement," Jerry Kellman, the organizer who hired Obama, told me recently. "I felt that he wanted to work in the civil-rights movement, but he was ten years too late, and this was the closest he could find to it at the time." Obama, in his memoir, put it more simply when he said he went to Chicago to "organize black folks." <br> Kellman, a New Yorker who had gotten into organizing in the 1960s, was trying to help laid-off factory workers on the far South Side of Chicago. He led a group, the Calumet Community Religious Conference, that had been created by several local Catholic churches. The Calumet region - basically the farthest southern reaches of Chicago plus the suburbs in northern Indiana - was an industrial area that had been hard hit by the closings of Wisconsin Steel and other industries. Kellman and the churches hoped to get some of those jobs back. <br> But there was a problem in the Chicago part of the equation. The area involved, around the Altgeld Gardens housing project and the neighborhood of Roseland, was nearly 100 percent black. Kellman was white, as were others who worked for CCRC. "The people didn't open up to him like they would to somebody who was black and really understood what was going on in their lives," Yvonne Lloyd, one of the key "leaders" - that is, local residents who worked closely with Obama - told me. "Black people are very leery when you come into their community and they don't know you." Lloyd and another leader, Loretta Augustine-Herron, insisted that Kellman hire a black organizer for a new spinoff from CCRC to be called the Developing Communities Project, which would focus solely on the Chicago part of the area. <br> So Kellman set out to find a black organizer. He ran an ad in some trade publications, and Obama responded. But at first Kellman wasn't sure Obama was right for the job. "My wife was Japanese-American," Kellman recalled. "I showed her the rsum, with the background in Hawaii. The name's Obama, so I asked, 'Could this be Japanese?' She said, 'Sure, it could be.'" It was only when Kellman talked to Obama on the phone, and Obama "expressed interest in something African-American culturally," that a relieved Kellman offered Obama the job. <br> But Kellman had to sell Obama to the leaders. "Jerry introduces Barack, and Barack is so young, it's like, 'Oh my God,'" Loretta Augustine-Herron remembered. Obama was obviously smart, and he wanted to be an organizer, but he was, in fact, quite young (24) and he didn't actually know much about the job. Despite those drawbacks, he seemed to work some sort of magic on the leaders. "He had a sensitivity I have never seen in anybody else to this day," Augustine-Herron told me. "He understood." The women were sold. "He didn't have experience," Augustine-Herron said. "But he had a sensitivity that allowed us to believe that he could do the job." So Obama it was. <br> WHAT'S YOUR SELF-INTEREST?<br>New to Chicago, Obama set about conducting dozens of one-on-ones, that is, individual interviews with South Side residents in which he tried to discover which issues were most important to them. "You have to understand a person's self-interest - that's Alinsky's terminology," Mike Kruglik, an organizer who worked with Kellman and Obama, told me. "What's happened to that person in his or her life? Where are they going? Why are they going there? What are they really passionate about?" <br> After the initial interviewing, Obama went to work on a number of projects. <br> The long-term goal was to retrain workers in order to restore manufacturing jobs in the area; Kellman took Obama by the rusted-out, closed-down Wisconsin Steel plant for a firsthand look. But the whole thing was a bit of a pipe dream, as the leaders soon discovered. "The idea was to interview these people and look at education, transferable skills, so that we could refer them to other industries," Loretta Augustine-Herron told me as we drove by the site of the old factory, now completely torn down. "Well, they had no transferable skills. I remember interviewing one man who ran a steel-straightening machine. It straightened steel bars or something. I said, well, what did you do? And he told me he pushed a button, and the rods came in, and he pushed a button and it straightened them, and he pushed a button and it sent them somewhere else. That's all he did. And he made big bucks doing it." <br> That, of course, was one of the reasons the steel mill closed. And it became clear that neither Obama nor Kellman nor anyone else was going to change the direction of the steel industry and its unions in the United States. Somewhere along the line, everyone realized that those jobs wouldn't be coming back. <br> So Obama looked for new opportunities. One thing he spent a lot of time on was creating a network of contacts beyond the white Catholic priests who originally sponsored the Developing Communities Project. "Many of the parishes were in predominantly African-American communities, and I think all of the priests were non-African-American," Rev. Alvin Love, head of the Lilydale First Baptist Church on 113th Street, told me. "Barack came to me and wanted to try to connect with the whole community." <br> Trying to construct a wide-ranging alliance of churches, Obama succeeded with Love and a few other ministers, but he was hampered by the fact that he didn't go to church himself. "I said, 'If you go to a pastor, and you ask him to come get involved in a community effort, and you say you have a group of churches, and that pastor asks you what church you belong to, and you say none - then it's hard to get that pastor on board,'" Love recalled telling Obama. "He said, 'I know, I understand, I'm working on it.' He said, 'I believe, I'm just waiting for the right spot, the right place, the right time.'" Love wasn't the only minister to bring that up with Obama, and before long Obama, drawn to the preaching of Rev. Jeremiah Wright, joined Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street - where he would stay until political pressure created by Wright's anti-American outbursts, combined with the anti-white message from another Obama friend, South Side priest Michael Pfleger, led him to resign his church membership. <br> Obama got the ministers involved in several projects, without great success. There was a push to get more city money for South Side parks after the Justice Department told the Chicago Park District it had to spend more on minority neighborhoods. There were plans for after-school programs, and job retraining for adults. But if you ask Obama's fellow organizers what his most significant accomplishments were, they point to two ventures: the expansion of a city summer-job program for South Side teenagers and the removal of asbestos from one of the area's oldest housing projects. Those, they say, were his biggest victories. 
 This column was written by Robert L. Borosage Katrina vanden Heuvel .<hr width="50%">Electric. When <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> receives the Democratic presidential nomination before 75,000 people in Denver's Mile High Stadium on the forty-fifth anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, new possibilities will be born. A historic candidacy, a new generation in motion, a nation yearning for change. Even the cynics running the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> campaign might be touched, if they weren't so busy savaging Obama as a vain celebrity not up to the task of leading a nation. <br> No one should be blinded by the lights. It will take hard work to turn the nomination into victory in a campaign that has already turned ugly. Moreover, even if victorious, Obama will inherit the calamitous conditions wrought by conservative failures -- a sinking economy, unsustainable occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan, accelerating climate change, Gilded Age inequality, a broken healthcare system and much more. <br> Obama will also be limited by the constricted consensus of an establishment not yet able to contemplate the changes needed to set this country right again. To be successful, his presidency will have to be bolder and more radical than now imagined. <br> A historic candidate, the forbidding conditions and the constricted consensus make it vital that progressives think clearly and act independently in forging a strategy over the next months. The following is a contribution to a rich and ongoing discussion. We invite others to join it at thenation.com in the weeks to come. <br> A Sea-Change Election <br> The Obama nomination sets the stage for a sea-change election, one that could not only elect a Democratic President and increased reform majorities in both houses of Congress but also mark a clear turn from the conservative ideas that have dominated our politics for three decades. <br> In recent weeks, the media -- primed by a Republican strategy contrasting Obama's purported doublespeak with McCain's alleged Straight Talk -- have focused on Obama's compromises and backsliding. Much of the alleged retrenchment has been exaggerated. Some of it -- like his fold on the FISA wiretap bill, mixed signals on trade, the compromise on offshore drilling -- has been clear and deplorable. Many on the left were dismayed as the Obama campaign trotted out advisers from a Democratic bench that had championed the toxic Rubinomics brew of corporate trade and financial deregulation. <br> These concerns should not distract us from the central reality: this election features a stark ideological contrast. Although marketed as a trustworthy maverick, McCain accurately describes himself as a "foot soldier in the Reagan revolution" and attests that "on the transcendent issues, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush." He is committed to the full Bush catastrophe: continued war in Iraq, more tax cuts for the wealthiest, more corporate trade deals, more deregulation, more hostility toward labor, more conservative social policies and reactionary judges. Indeed, he's Bush on steroids. McCain seeks not only to privatize Social Security but also to unravel employer-based healthcare, leaving people to negotiate alone with insurance companies liberated from regulation. His bellicose posturing on Iran and Iraq is as disastrous as his pledge of impossibly deep cuts in domestic programs. He embraces the corporate economic and trade agenda that has so devastated the American middle class. If he is defeated, it will mark the end of the Reagan era. <br> Obama clearly offers a change of course. His victory in itself will require overcoming the racial fears that have so long divided this country. He carries a reform agenda -- largely driven by progressives -- into the election: an end to the occupation of Iraq, using the money squandered there to rebuild America; affordable healthcare for all, paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy; a concerted drive for energy independence, generating jobs while investing in renewable energy and conservation. He is committed to empowering labor, to holding corporations and banks more accountable and to challenging our trade policies. A social liberal, his judicial appointees will keep the right from consolidating its hold on the federal judiciary. Obama may not be a "movement" progressive in the way that Reagan was a "movement" conservative, and he may have disappointed activists with his recent compromises, but make no mistake: his election will open a new era of reform, the scope of which will depend -- as Obama often says -- on independent progressive mobilization to keep the pressure on and overcome entrenched interests. <br> As this is written, an election Obama should win handily is locked in a virtual tie. Both the Obama and McCain campaigns treat the race as a referendum on Obama, with the former focused on getting Americans comfortable with trusting a young African-American with an unusual name, and the Rove minions in the McCain campaign intent on stoking the fears that enabled them to assemble a white majority party in the past. <br> Obama's campaign will not succeed without the independent efforts of progressive activists. One central task is winning support among wary white blue-collar workers, the core target of the Rovian poison. This will require persuasion as well as mobilization; the work of the AFL-CIO, Change to Win, Working America, religious groups and others with a base in these communities in swing states will be of critical importance. <br> Progressives generally -- and independent media and the blogosphere specifically -- can contribute by reminding voters there's a clear choice in this election, with McCain representing the same old, same old. While exposing McCain's doubletalk, his Bush-redux agenda and the money and interests behind the scurrilous right-wing independent expenditure campaigns, progressives can also help build support for reform. The new Health Care for America Now coalition, for example, has the resources to expose McCain's healthcare folly, thereby building a mandate for universal coverage. The antiwar movement should be challenging McCain's saber-rattling on Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, helping to strengthen US support for a change in course. With gas prices at the center of American concerns, the environmental alliance around jobs and energy can consolidate support for a concerted drive toward energy independence, while challenging absurd claims that we can drill our way out of the crisis. Driving Reform <br> While focusing on what is certain to be a difficult campaign, progressives should start thinking now about strategy for an Obama presidency. Clearly his election and inauguration would mark an exciting moment. At home, a new sense of energy and idealism will be unleashed. Across the world, his election will begin the process of restoring America's ravaged reputation. Not only will Obama usher a new generation into politics, but for the first time a President with experience as a community organizer will have the ability to mobilize directly a dedicated following larger than any other in politics [see our roundtable forum of community organizers]. <br> In the first months of an Obama administration, progressives should be pursuing an inside-outside strategy in relation to the administration. For example, in the transition, we should push to place allies in strategic positions, particularly in the areas of economic policy and national security. The AFL-CIO and other groups are preparing lists of potential candidates. These inside efforts should be complemented by watchdog monitoring and reporting on potential nominees. No free pass should be given to those who drove the financial and trade policies that led to the current economic debacles or supported the invasion of Iraq, the worst foreign policy fiasco in recent history. <br> For Obama to achieve his core promises, he will have to push significant reforms early. As Dan Lazare has argued, our entire political system is designed to block reform, not facilitate it. Periods of significant change in American politics are rare, but they feature spasms of furious activity: Roosevelt's first 100 days, Johnson's push in 1964-65, Reagan's reaction in 1981-82. Inevitably, these spasms don't last long before reaction sets in. So it is vital to move rapidly and boldly and across many areas to have any chance at success. <br> Obama's first decision -- to be made, no doubt, during the transition -- will be the most telling. He has pledged that he will instruct the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a sensible plan for ending the Iraq occupation. Already, Democratic security advisers who initially supported the war are calling for "conditional engagement," arguing that the United States can't afford simply to set a timetable to get out. Thus it is vital that the peace movement organize aggressively during the campaign, and mobilize independently and visibly immediately after the election. The Obama White House must have no doubt about the firestorm in Congress, in the streets and within the Democratic Party that would be caused by a retreat from this pledge. <br> If the Iraq promise is kept, progressives will sensibly work to help define Obama's agenda from the inside and support key parts from the outside. He will lay out a major initiative on jobs and energy. He has said that he'll try to push through healthcare reform quickly -- although that is likely to trigger trench warfare in Congress (and progressives will have to overcome deep internal divisions to ensure that fundamental reform succeeds). Obama will reverse many of the reactionary Bush executive orders, from the global gag rule to secrecy excesses stemming from the "war on terror." His first budget decisions most likely will have to deal directly with a broader stimulus plan to get the economy going. He has pledged to support passage of the Employee Free Choice Act, enabling workers to organize unions without employer harassment. <br> But Obama will encounter formidable obstacles. He'll face a business lobby girded for battle. Corporations have already begun moving more of their money to Democratic incumbents and are snapping up former Democratic legislators and staffers for their lobbies [see "Dollars for Donkeys" on page 28]. They will do everything they can to stall healthcare and drug-pricing reform, empowerment of workers and re-regulation of Wall Street. Moreover, while Democrats are likely to enjoy larger majorities in both houses, their caucuses are likely to be less progressive as they pick up seats in very conservative, formerly Republican districts. <br> Progressives will enjoy their greatest strength mobilizing independently to support Obama's promises. We can organize constituent pressure on politicians who are blocking the way, something even a President with Obama's activist network would be loath to do. We can expose the lobbies and interests and backstage maneuvers designed to limit reforms. Now that newspapers increasingly lack the resources for investigation, progressive media, online and off, and the independent progressive media infrastructure -- from The Nation to Media Matters to Brave New Films to The Huffington Post -- must assume a greater role in monitoring the opposition, even as we mobilize activists in targeted districts across the country. <br> In doing this, we can help give backbone to the Obama agenda, even as we supply muscle and energy to help pass it. The best way to achieve this is to generate large-scale independent-issue campaigns. A clear example is the Healthcare for Americans Now Coalition, which is ready to take on the insurance companies and support the White House's commitment to universal care. The new Half in Ten Campaign, spearheaded by ACORN and the Center for American Progress Action Fund, will help ensure that poverty does not disappear from the agenda. Progressives generally should join the AFL-CIO and Change to Win in their drive to pass the Employee Free Choice Act. The Apollo Alliance and a range of environmental efforts will support the initiative on jobs and energy. <br> Acting in support of Obama will require challenging legislators in both parties who stand in the way, a task progressives should undertake aggressively. The Service Employees International Union has already taken the lead in announcing a $10 million "accountability program," designed to force politicians to heed the will of their voters, with a new plan -- Justice for All -- as the core vehicle. This should be complemented by other independent efforts, despite likely objections from the Democratic Congressional leadership and possibly the White House. Democrats should be on notice from their own constituents that they will be expected to help move reform, not stand in its way. <br> The Constricted Consensus <br> The great challenge for progressives is whether the energy and idealism unleashed by the Obama candidacy -- and the collapse of conservatism -- can expand the limits of the current debate. McCain promises merely more of the same bankrupt policies, but Obama's reform agenda is itself limited by a very constricted establishment consensus that is an obstacle to real change. <br> On national security, both candidates have pledged to increase the size of the military, adding billions to a bloated budget that already represents nearly half the world's military spending. Both assume America's role as globocop; neither suggests unraveling the US empire of military bases. Both seem intent on deepening the occupation of Afghanistan. Neither has dared to embrace the conservative RAND Corporation's conclusion that the very notion of a "war on terror" is counterproductive, and that aggressive intelligence and police cooperation should be the centerpiece of our strategy. <br> Obama has called for a second stimulus plan focused on new energy and rebuilding America, but he hasn't suggested anything like the major public initiatives -- the combination of public investment, revised global economic strategy, industrial policy and financial regulation -- that would be essential to get the real economy moving again while responding to the threat of catastrophic climate change. <br> Obama has made affordable healthcare for all a centerpiece of his agenda, but he has not addressed the unraveling of the private social contract once delivered through corporations and unions. It will take independent efforts to drive an economic bill of rights, from healthcare to pensions to Social Security to guaranteed paid vacation, in addition to paid sick days and family leave. <br> Obama laid out promising principles for financial reform in his Cooper Union speech in March, but he hasn't challenged the Wall Street bailout, nor has he mobilized support for policing the shadow banking system that has proved so destructive in its greed. <br> Obama defends liberal social reforms, but a serious war on poverty -- or an initiative to transform our brutal criminal system of injustice that is devastating the lives of young minority men -- is not yet on the agenda. <br> And while Obama is a former professor of constitutional law, he hasn't called for dismantling the imperial presidency. It will take independent efforts to reclaim for the Congress and the people the powers Bush has arrogated to the presidency. <br> This corrosive consensus reflects the entrenched power of the established order. It is enforced by aggressive lobbies -- the military-industrial complex, Wall Street, corporate interests -- and rationalized by well-upholstered house scholars. The establishment's strength is its ability to simply exclude alternatives from serious consideration. <br> After the first flurry of activity, an Obama administration may well realize that the dire condition of the country demands a far bolder agenda than what is now on the table. Progressives should recognize that an Obama administration would have no alternative but to be one of constant experimentation. We should embrace the best of the public-policy proposals that scholars are developing in our universities and think tanks. These ideas challenge limited assumptions about government and call for everything from dismantling our empire of military bases to curbing the imperial presidency, from passing progressive tax reforms to strengthening the public commons. Again, independent campaigning -- particularly regarding concerns not high on the national agenda -- will help lift issues into the mainstream. <br> Here it will be vital to sustain a reform infrastructure independent of the administration or the Democratic leadership in Congress. Progressives in the Senate and House, many grouped around the Progressive Caucus, can provide both leadership and a public forum for new ideas. Independent research institutes -- like the Institute for America's Future, the Institute for Policy Studies, the Economic Policy Institute and others -- can help think outside the establishment box. Progressive bloggers can track the limits of the debate and give new ideas greater visibility. Reform leaders at the state and local levels, coordinated by centers like the Progressive States Network, can champion legislation -- like paid sick days, mandated vacation minimums, early childhood education, tighter regulation of insurance companies, creative financing for energy conservation projects -- that will be a model for the national agenda. Grassroots organizing -- neighbor to neighbor, supported by the energy of the young, linked to national concerns -- will be essential if Obama's election is to generate thoroughgoing reform. <br> When John F. Kennedy was elected President, he too summoned a new generation into politics. While Kennedy's agenda was limited, the energy he unleashed helped build the civilizing movements of the following decades -- the antiwar, civil rights, women's, environmental and gay rights movements. <br> America now is very different from the America of the 1960s. Those movements, nurtured in the cradle of postwar prosperity, assumed the country could afford to be more just. This generation has grown up with much greater economic insecurity, is laden with debt and is struggling to find decent jobs. It faces an economy that cannot be sustained -- and must be transformed. <br> But once more a young and exciting candidate, seeking the presidency after a long and failed conservative era, can spark the hope and sense of possibility that carry far beyond his campaign platform. Progressives should be focusing less on the limits of the Obama agenda and more on the possibilities that a successful candidacy opens up. <br> As a former community organizer, Obama has taught that "real change comes from the bottom up." It comes about by "imagining and then fighting for and then working for -- struggling for -- what did not seem possible before." As President, he will face conflicting pressures, and undoubtedly he will carefully pick his fights. The movement that he has called into being will have little choice but to embrace his charge and mobilize across the country to achieve what "did not seem possible before." By Robert L.

 This column was written by Cesar Conda.<hr width="50%">Senator <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> declared in a recent interview on the business cable channel CNBC: "Look, I am a pro-growth, free-market guy. I love the market." And Obama's economic team appears to support this claim. His main advisers, Jason Furman and Austan Goolsbee, are both centrist, pro-free traders; one is a defender of Wal-Mart, and the other is a self-described "free-market type" who has drawn praise from the likes of George Will. <br> If Obama wins the White House, Furman and Goolsbee are slated to be at the center of the economic policymaking universe, with Furman a likely appointee as director of the National Economic Council and Goolsbee the top candidate to be the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. So do these possible appointments indicate that a President Obama would move towards the center and become a "free market guy" as feared by the left or follow through with his statist campaign platform of protectionism and expansion of the regulatory state? <br> Although Austan Goolsbee is a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, he is not a part of the famous "Chicago School" of such prominent free-market macro-economists as George Stigler and Milton Friedman. Rather, he's one of the young economists whose work is referred to as the "new social economics," focusing on how people behave and make decisions in their everyday lives. He has written columns for the New York Times on such topics as why Americans came to embrace reality TV and why billionaires line up to bid for professional sports franchises. <br> On the left-to-right spectrum, Goolsbee appears to be smack-dab in the middle. He is pro-free trade, not an alarmist on globalization, and a defender of subprime lending on the grounds that it has expanded home-ownership for minorities. But he is opposed to supply-side tax cuts--especially any further reductions in the top marginal rate--and personal retirement accounts for Social Security, and thinks the Internal Revenue Service should become the nation's largest tax preparer. <br> According to George Will: <br> Both Furman and Goolsbee have admirers on the right. Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute (one of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span>'s economic advisers) calls Goolsbee "an honest and honorable scholar who can be quite clever academically. He is left-leaning, but would be a voice of reason in an Obama administration." Of Furman, Hassett says: "Jason is a lot like Goolsbee, but has been more politically active. His deep well of experience will serve Obama well." Glenn Hubbard, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush, said: "Austan Goolsbee is a very talented young economist; indeed, I wish he was on my faculty at Columbia Business School (even though I disagree with his research showing a small distortionary effect of high marginal tax rates)." Hubbard went on to say: "A team of Austan and Jason gives the Obama campaign punch in economic ideas--though the statist platform of the candidate suggests they have a tough road ahead!" <br> With such fans, it's not surprising that Furman and Goolsbee's roles on the Obama campaign are generating quite a bit of angst on the left. Lori Wallach of Public Citizen told the Los Angeles Times: "Furman seems like a liability, given his anti-worker writings and statements about Wal-Mart, fair trade and other middle-class issues." In that same article, Marco Trbovich of the United Steelworkers said: "[Furman] is a very bright fellow, but he is an unalloyed cheerleader for the trade policies that have been very destructive to manufacturing jobs in this country." In an article in the Nation about both Furman and Goolsbee, entitled "Obama's Chicago Boys," Naomi Klein wrote: "But before Obama can purge Washington of the scourge of Friedmanism, he has some ideological housecleaning of his own to do." <br> But how much comfort can conservatives take from Obama having such "reasonable" economic advisers? There is certainly no question that an Obama administration is a frightening prospect for free-market advocates. This self-described "free market guy" has said he opposes the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and will reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He would sign legislation raising the minimum wage and ending secret balloting for workers deciding on unionization. He would require employers to pay for health insurance for their workers, mandate coverage for all children, and expand Medicaid and other government programs. He wants higher fuel-economy standards for new cars and trucks, power companies to produce some of their electricity from solar and renewable sources, and federal ethanol mandates. <br> Furman and Goolsbee are obviously in agreement with much of this agenda, and both have been strong advocates of progressive taxation. Goolsbee, in particular, has taken direct aim at the conservative movement's biggest economic policy achievement of the past three decades: the sharp reduction in marginal tax rates, especially the top personal income tax rate. He is a leader in the liberal onslaught against the Laffer Curve, producing research to show that income tax cuts "for high-income taxpayers likely gave windfalls to those whose incomes were already sharply rising because of broader market forces." <br> And, while both Furman and Goolsbee purport to believe in free trade, they seem to have no trouble working for a candidate with a pronounced and public protectionist bent. Obama's promise to reopen NAFTA alone should cause any degree of free-market economist pause. The facts about NAFTA's benefits are unassailable: Since its enactment in 1993 through 2001, U.S. employment increased from 120 million to 135 million. Jason Furman should certainly know the benefits of NAFTA inside and out; he served as a special economic assistant to President Bill Clinton, for whom the passage of NAFTA was a major political victory in 1993. That Furman and Goolsbee have suspended their belief in free trade does not bode well for how hard they would fight protectionism in an Obama White House. <br> The next president and his economic team will face enormous challenges--from managing the decline in the housing market to stabilizing the U.S. dollar and reducing energy prices. Furman and Goolsbee will be at the elbow of a President Obama, if there is one. To date, they have shown little appetite for fighting for free-market views and appear perfectly comfortable working for a candidate who is running on a statist platform of protectionism and bigger government.

 This column was written by Jonathan Chait.<hr width="50%">Do you remember when conservatives used to speak warmly, and sometimes rapturously, about <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span>? That was back when they were certain that the Clinton voodoo magic would make Hillary the nominee, and Obama her sympathetic roadkill. Since then, the right has made the horrifying discoveries that Obama is, successively, a left-wing ideologue, a coddler of anti- Americanism, a wine-sipping elitist, and, now, a shameless flip-flopper. The man will say anything, discard any position, in order to win the election. <br> If such a tragic tarnishing of the reputation could happen to a fresh-faced reformer like Obama, it could happen to anybody. And, in fact, it has -- at least to anybody who has happened to attain the Democratic presidential nomination at any point over the last five election cycles. John Kerry, as everybody remembers, came to be defined almost exclusively as a flip-flopper. (A 2004 Wall Street Journal news article described him as "a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways.") <br> Al Gore was relentlessly attacked by Republicans for his alleged waffling. ("Mr. Gore has a bit of a reputation for flip-flopping and corner-cutting," reported The New York Times in 2000.) Bill Clinton was attacked by George H.W. Bush for "turn[ing] the White House into a Waffle House" and the subject of a famous Time cover story titled, "Why Voters Don't Trust Bill Clinton." <br> It was true: Voters didn't trust Clinton -- or Gore, or Kerry. In all of those elections, polls showed the Democratic nominee scoring higher on most of the issues, but the Republican nominee scoring higher on honesty and other personal qualities. Either this is because the Democratic Party keeps nominating weasels for president, time and time again, or else there's something systemic that makes Republicans (and the press) portray them as such. I'm going with explanation number two. <br> Here's my systemic explanation. In the late 1980s, the popular revolt against government that had bubbled up in the mid-'60s began to peter out, sapping the power of straightforward anti-government appeals. And, starting in 1992, Democrats ruthlessly purged nearly all their political liabilities by embracing anti-crime measures, welfare reform, and middle-class tax cuts, and, more recently, by abandoning gun control. What's left is a political terrain generally favorable to Democrats, which has, in turn, forced Republicans to emphasize the personal virtue of their nominees. <br> And so, every four years, we have a Democratic candidate campaigning on health care, the minimum wage, education, Medicare, or Social Security, and a Republican candidate campaigning on themes like Trust, Courage, and so forth. President Bush in 2004 was explicit about his elevation of character over issues: "Even when we don't agree," he would say, "at least you know what I believe and where I stand." <br> The details of the Republican character narrative vary a bit from campaign to campaign. (In 1992, 1996, and 2008, Republicans waxed rhapsodic about the moral virtues inherent in military service; in 2000 and 2004, they played them down.) The alleged flip-floppiness of the Democratic nominee, though, is a hardy perennial. Flip-flopping is a simple accusation that campaign reporters can sink their teeth into. Moreover, there's always grist for the accusation, because getting to the position of running for president without changing your stance on a few issues is essentially impossible. <br> And, so, whatever two or three issues the Democratic nominee has changed his emphasis on are inevitably blown up into a devastating character indictment. The Charles Krauthammers and Sean Hannitys of the world can be counted on to whip themselves into a moralistic frenzy against the feckless Democrat. And news reporters will stroke their chins and ponder, because the question is being asked: Just who is Obama (Kerry/Gore/Clinton), anyway? Yes, he may have a detailed platform on domestic and foreign policy, but do we really know anything about this man? <br> If one needs any final proof of the ridiculousness of this quadrennial exercise, it is the fact that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> has embraced the flip-flopper attack. John McCain! I've said this before, I'll say it again: This is a man who, in his quest to make himself an acceptable GOP nominee, reversed his political philosophy (crusading anti-business progressive in the Teddy Roosevelt mode); his political orientation (frequently siding with, and nearly joining, Senate Democrats); and almost every particular undergirding it (taxes, the Lieberman-Warner climate change bill, his own immigration bill, etc.). But if you actually think that flip-flopping is a sign of flawed character, and not just a handy partisan cudgel, then, sure, Obama might be slightly cynical, but McCain must be a dangerous sociopath. <br> Now, allegedly Obama can be held to a higher standard because he has loftily set himself above ordinary politicians. (McCain has, too, but never mind.) The operating theory here is that Obama represents a New Politics of the purest and most innocent sort, and to expose him as a mere politician is to destroy the very rationale of his candidacy. Obama's "flip-flopping," writes Krauthammer, proves he's "just a politician." His "dash to the center," mourns National Review editor Rich Lowry, "falsifies the very essence of his candidacy." <br> It is no doubt true that some liberal Obamaphiles interpreted his disdain for "politics as usual" as a pledge to abstain from all political maneuvering and lead a campaign of monkish purity. Those people have had their eyes opened and should not vote for Obama or, for that matter, anybody. <br> However, there's a more likely, and less suicidal, interpretation of the "different kind of politics" Obama has practiced. First, he uses a more elevated, professorial, and less demagogic brand of rhetoric than most politicians. Second, Obama believes in the necessity of mobilizing his supporters as a counterweight against the power of organized special interests. This belief flows from his background as a community organizer, and requires active and continued participation from his supporters. <br> But, yes, he's just a politician -- which is to say, he's willing to make some compromises to win. And, if Obama doesn't win, the Democrats will find a new nominee in four years -- a shameless flip-flopper, no doubt.By Jonathan ChaitIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by Michael Sean Winters.<hr width="50%"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> has a Catholic problem. While Catholics constitute only 23 percent of the nation's population, their numbers are higher in such critical states as Nevada, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. And he lost badly among those voters this winter and spring. In New Hampshire, at the beginning of the primary season, Hillary Clinton took 44 percent of the Catholic vote to Obama's 27 percent. Toward the end of the primary season, in Pennsylvania, Clinton won 70 percent of the Catholic vote to Obama's 30. Pundits and pollsters have mostly focused on other demographic characteristics among Clinton's supporters: They were older, less educated, and earned less than $50,000. There is undoubtedly a great deal of overlap. But Obama consistently ran better among Protestants than he did among Catholics. <br> Obama doesn't need to take drastic action to make up for this deficit. He doesn't need to bring a Catholic priest into his "brain trust" like FDR did in 1932, and he doesn't need to win overwhelmingly among Catholics like John F. Kennedy did in 1960. But here's the interesting part: In articulating his economic views in ways that are especially accessible to Catholics, Obama would do much more than just increase his chances with that constituency. He'd discover that Catholic social thought provides Democrats with the kind of moral vision and linguistic clarity that their economic positions have lacked for decades now. <br> In early July, the Obama campaign had itself a "values week." It was a big to-do. The candidate called for extending Bush's faith-based initiatives. He gave a beautiful testimony about his own conversion experience and spoke movingly about how he "let Jesus Christ into my life." Obama has always littered his rhetoric with quotes from Scripture, and he did so even more a few weeks ago. He even allowed that "war and poverty, joblessness and homelessness, violent streets and crumbling schools -- are not simply technical problems ... they are moral problems." But the overall impression of the week was that a ticket was being punched, a check mark put next to the words "values voters" on the campaign checklist. The question is whether he will mention values not just on specifically designated occasions during "values week", but if he'll demonstrate how his values ground his economic and other policies. So far he hasn't. <br> He could start by borrowing from Catholic social thought, which rests on two foundations: the inalienable dignity of the human person and the common good. Human dignity, though recently derided in TNR has both a religious and a liberal pedigree. For Christians, Jews, and Muslims, it is rooted in the belief that man is created in the image and likeness of God. Modern liberals embrace the notion in different ways, but particularly espouse Kant's argument that a human being is never a means but always an end. In the American context, Lincoln said it best: "As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy." <br> Human dignity's necessary social corollary is the common good. Not only are we all essentially equal; we are all in this together. The common good embraces the idea that property rights are not absolute and that the good of everyone in a society has a claim on each of us within that society. In the 2004 convention keynote that first catapulted Obama to national attention, he referenced a biblical injunction that speaks to the same core idea: "Alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga, a belief that we're all connected as one people. ... I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper." <br> Too often, though, Democrats speak of economic plans as if they were distinct and unrelated to any common national purpose. They speak in abstract, de-personalized terms. Health care is presented as "a right" and education policy as an exercise in acquisitiveness ("Our plan for success for pre-schoolers!"). But insuring the uninsured is also a decent thing to do, providing better education is in part about valuing the work and wisdom of our ancestors, and raising living standards for the poor and near-poor is what we owe our least fortunate. Economic realities are, for everyone except economists, existential realities -- and all these policies help enhance human dignity and further the common good. Yet, in his major speech on health care in Iowa last year, Obama reverted to legalese, claiming health care was "a right" instead of invoking the moral obligations Americans owe to one another as citizens and as fellow human beings. <br> Another long-standing principle of Catholic social thought -- combining both the dignity and social good arguments -- is that the government must intervene whenever the private sector fails to protect and provide for a specific group of people. The seminal papal encyclical on social justice, Rerum Novarum, issued in 1891, was clear: "Whenever the general interest or any particular class suffers, or it is threatened with evils which can in no other way be met, the public authority must step in to meet them." Whatever you think of Republican policies in economic terms, they are repugnant in moral terms, and it would behoove Obama to make that case. He hasn't done a good enough job of convincing Americans that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span>'s health care proposal does little or nothing to help the poor; that his flip-flop on the Bush tax cuts has robbed him of both his most courageous vote and a principled stand against the unlimited acquisition of gross wealth; and that time and again, the GOP has stood for the rights of property above the well-being of the whole society. <br> Government intervention on behalf of the common good is also well-suited to issues that cross geographic and generational boundaries, such as environmental and educational policy. Your factory in Ohio could cause acid rain that pollutes my farm in New York, so individual self-regulation or even policy initiatives at the state level are insufficient. Global warming is, well, global in scope and will require diplomacy to avert its horrific consequences. Educational policy must reflect the moral commitment of one generation to the next: We may not directly and materially benefit from the education our grandchildren receive, but we have a moral obligation to them nonetheless. Self-interest, the foundation of the GOP's laissez-faire approach to problems, lacks the moral weight to adequately address such issues. <br> In April 2006, Michael Tomasky famously argued that Democrats should embrace the common good, and chastised them for relying overmuch on rights-based language. He noted the many and varied sources for the idea of the common good, from Rousseau's social contract to parts of Madison's writings in the Federalist papers. But Tomasky shunned the religious roots of his argument. This was a mistake: More Americans are familiar with Obama's reference to the biblical letter of St. James than they are with the writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and church-goers (which most Americans are) encounter the countless biblical invocations to solidarity more regularly than they flip through their copies of the Federalist papers. Tomasky was correct about the limits of rights-based language, but he missed how speaking about the common good can help Democrats attract religiously motivated voters. <br> There are, of course, other ways to reach out to Catholics beyond economic issues. Obama can tie his struggle against racial bigotry to the earlier struggle of immigrant Catholics against ethnic and religious bigotry. He can reach out to Latino Catholics by invoking Pope Benedict's call to make keeping families together a focal point for immigration reform. He can go to a Catholic university and discuss how the fiasco in Iraq might have been avoided, not only by reading the National Intelligence Estimate, but also by consulting the 5th century just-war theories of St. Augustine. <br> Alan Wolfe, one of the nation's foremost analysts of how politics and religion collide in our society and culture, recently wrote (happily, while blurbing my new book) : "As Catholics go, so goes America." In 2008, with all the focus on the economy, Catholics are ripe for Obama to pick if he can master the distinctive ways they view economic issues. Unlike the gloom-and-doom preaching of Calvin's heirs, Catholicism has a more positive take on the possibilities of human culture and politics that would fit Obama's politics of hope nicely. And unlike the disconnected, valueless recipes for economic policy that have plagued previous Democratic campaigns, Obama can unite his policies into a moral vision for where he wants to lead America. Doing that could win him the White House -- and, more importantly, it could give him a blueprint for how to lead once he's there.

 This column was written by Matthew Continetti.<hr width="50%">Plenty of commentators, including yours truly, argued during the Democratic primaries that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> had shown a weakness with Latino voters which could last through the general election and help <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> on Election Day. McCain, known for his strong support for "comprehensive immigration reform" including a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the United States, would be able to make inroads into this growing demographic group. The thinking went like this: When you combined Obama's perceived weakness with Latinos in the primary and McCain's strengths as a candidate, the Republican nominee could hope to do at least as well as, and maybe better than, George W. Bush's 40 percent of the national Latino vote in 2004. <br> Well, here's a revised prediction. That's not going to happen. Obama has already shown strength among Latinos in recent general election polls, strength that will likely continue through November 4. Obama will match John Kerry's percentage of the 2004 Latino vote, perhaps do better. <br> What's the reason for this revised prediction? I went to see the two candidates address the seventy-ninth convention of the League of United Latino Citizens (LULAC) in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. It was a study in contrasts. McCain spoke around lunchtime and received a polite welcome. LULAC officials noted the long-standing ties the senator has with the group and his support for immigration reform. The audience respected McCain. They didn't heckle and seemed open to hearing him out. <br> I'm not sure they liked what they heard, however. McCain's speech was geared for a national audience, not a special interest group like LULAC. He largely repeated his economic message, drawn heavily from a speech delivered the previous day in Denver. The audience applauded loudly when McCain extolled the virtues of small business and pledged to double the income tax deduction for dependents from $3,500 to $7,000. But that was about it. The LULAC folks wanted to hear about pathways to citizenship, health care, and means to address the skyrocketing dropout rate among Latino secondary school students. McCain touched on some of these subjects, but spent most of his time extolling the virtues of his "Lexington Project" to make America "energy independent." The audience perked up again toward the end of the speech when McCain mentioned immigration and the sacrifices made in war by immigrants to America. By then, though, the speech was finished. <br> Obama appeared late in the afternoon. There was more energy in the ballroom, more campaign signage, more people, and louder music. The elevator muzak that had preceded McCain's speech was replaced with Shakira's "Hips Don't Lie." McCain's speech felt like your typical rubber-chicken affair. Obama's felt like a party. And Obama made the wise choice of having one of the nation's senior-most Latino elected officials, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, introduce him. McCain might've had Florida Senator Mel Martinez do the same for him. He didn't. The LULAC leadership introduced McCain. <br> Obama brought the audience to its feet when he entered and exited the stage. He had them cheering throughout. His speech used the theme of diversity to argue for immigration reform and economic policies aimed at the Latino working class. This is LULAC's bread and butter, and the audience ate it up. The room clearly supported the Illinois senator. <br> Obama's speech was of course well delivered, but it also contained some major flaws. Obama portrayed himself as a champion of immigration reform, but Obama did as much as anyone to scuttle the 2007 immigration bill, as Fred Barnes first reported here). (Also, see this David Brooks column from June.) And in what appeared to be an ad lib, Obama said he had stood by the Latino community during the Democratic primary, when things got rough during the debates. He may have been referring to an MSNBC debate last October, when he said then-New York governor Eliot Spitzer's plan to issue drivers licenses to illegal immigrants was "the right idea." By saying she opposed Spitzer's plan but supported what he was trying to do, Sen. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span> famously got trapped trying to please every constituency. Obama simply supported Spitzer. His stance was clear (at least during that long ago debate). It was also unpopular. <br> McCain could make drivers licenses for illegal immigrants an issue, but he's unlikely to do so. It seems he wants to stay as far away from the immigration issue as possible. That's because the right continues to distrust McCain, and championing immigration reform won't do anything to allay that distrust. Look for McCain to mention immigration as little as possible, and to emphasize border security when he does. Which means the issue has been ceded to Obama -- and with it the Latino vote.By Matthew Continetti 
 <i>This column was written by Matthew Continetti<hr width="50%">A few months back, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> explained why he had not won more support from voters in Appalachia. <br> You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate, and they have not. And it's not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment, as a way to explain their frustrations. <br> The onetime lecturer in law was addressing a phenomenon that has puzzled liberals for years: Since it is self-evident to them that liberal economic policies benefit working-class voters (defined, for our purposes, as voters without college degrees), why does the working class so often support conservatives? The liberal answer, with which Obama appears to agree, is that the working-class voter is either fooled or scared -- never persuaded -- into voting on cultural, not economic, grounds. <br> The conservative authors of "Grand New Party" largely agree with this analysis. The difference is that Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam argue it is entirely rational for working-class voters to cast ballots on social and cultural concerns. That's because issues "from abortion and marriage law to the death penalty and immigration" are "at the root of working-class insecurity." They reverse the left's chain of causation. Whereas the left says social pathologies result from economic immiseration, Douthat and Salam say that economic anxiety increases in direct proportion to social instability. <br> (Full disclosure: The article that served as the basis of "Grand New Party" first appeared in these pages -- "The Party of Sam's Club," November 14, 2005 -- and the authors are my friends.) <br> It's hard to disagree with them. The social disruptions of the last 40 years -- rising levels of divorce, illegitimacy, drug use, and crime -- have hit voters without college degrees the hardest. Those disruptions prevent the formation of stable families. And without stable families, people lack both a refuge from and a mechanism by which to cope with larger structural changes in the global economy. <br> No family, less stability, less of a chance to improve one's condition. <br> This is bad for the working class, for America, and for the GOP. Republicans all too often come into power backed by working-class majorities, only to alienate those majorities and get tossed out of office. Douthat and Salam want to break the cycle. They think a conservative politics offers the best chance for a strong and prosperous America, and write that it is therefore necessary for conservatives to reform the "welfare state so that it serves the interests of the working class, rather than the affluent." <br> In so doing, the Republican party may forge a "conservative class consciousness among working-class voters." And this, in turn, would create a "unity of political allegiance and socioeconomic identity that, in its liberal form, made the Roosevelt coalition so potent and enduring." Voil - -there's your lasting Republican majority. Clearly the left has not cornered the market on audacity. "Grand New Party" is an unusual book: part history, part political analysis, part policy brief. It challenges the widely held idea on the right that the GOP isn't small-government enough. And at a time when the word "neocon" is a slur, Douthat and Salam argue that the GOP is most successful when it governs according to the principles of "applied neoconservatism." By this they mean "a conservatism that promised to fix the welfare state, rather than abolish it; to reform the Great Society, but leave the New Deal more or less intact." <br> How to do this? The authors have plenty of ideas. Some are plausible, others are implausible, and still others are a mixture of both. For example, Douthat and Salam back a dramatic expansion of the child-tax credit -- a sensible idea that could conceivably become law. But then they muse that, in order to stigmatize illegitimacy, the credit ideally would be "targeted to married couples (and extended to widows and widowers, and possibly divorcees) and withheld from single and cohabiting parents." Not gonna happen. <br> Large portions of the book are written in the language of subsidies and tax credits and public "investments." The libertarians among us are likely to blanch, even pass out. To increase the time mothers are able to spend raising children, Douthat and Salam propose "subsidies to parents who provide child care in the home and pension credits that reflect the economic value of years spent in household labor." To reward work, they write that a "program of wage subsidies" is a "tool that's worth considering." <br> All of these ideas will cost money; it's unclear how much. The authors provide neither a cost estimate nor a means to pay for the new expenditures. It's simply assumed that the money will be there, or that revenues will rise to cover the cost of the new programs. And while Douthat and Salam are probably more open than other conservatives to increasing revenue by raising taxes, they avoid the question of which taxes ought to be raised, and by how much. <br> This raises a larger criticism, which is that the authors neglect economic growth. They seem more concerned with how to spend the money that a free economy generates. But without growth there is no revenue for wage subsidies. Without growth, all classes stagnate. As Irving Kristol has written, "It was only the prospect of economic growth in which everyone prospered, if not equally or simultaneously, that gave modern democracies their legitimacy and durability." Douthat and Salam often appear to assume that government programs are the only way to help the working class. Not so. Growth helps, too. "Grand New Party" is about domestic policy. But it is also worth considering the role national security has played in winning working-class support for the GOP. Reaganism combined a stirring belief in American exceptionalism with a commitment to American military strength. This marriage of American ideals and American power has been key to every successful Republican campaign in the last quarter-century, and nowhere is this more clear than in presidential contests. Who is the only Democrat to have won the presidency since Jimmy Carter, the only one to win reelection since Franklin Roosevelt? Bill Clinton. When did he hold office? During a time when America was widely perceived to be at peace. <br> The national security issue cuts both ways. Douthat and Salam barely mention what they call President Bush's "failure in Iraq." This gives short shrift to the most important issue of our time. The war on terror, of which Iraq is a part, has helped and hurt Bush among voters without college degrees. Congressional Republicans won the working-class vote in 2004 when the war in Iraq was increasingly unpopular but also seen as winnable. By 2006 Iraq was in chaos, the war was even more unpopular, and voters began to think the effort was a lost cause. Republican congressional candidates won only 43 percent of the working-class vote. The Democrats swept back into power with a narrow congressional majority. The Iraq war, not the absence of a "world-class telecommuting infrastructure," drove the working-class vote into the Democrats' eager embrace. <br> How long will that embrace last? One troubling sign for Republicans is Obama's recent hiring of Jason Furman as policy adviser. Furman is a centrist economist whom Douthat and Salam cite repeatedly. He's just the sort of guy who could adopt the message of "Grand New Party" and use it to further Democratic ends. Meanwhile, Obama seems open to the populist messages of Democrats like James Webb of Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. He could mix populist rhetoric and center-left economic policy into a potent brew. It may be awhile before the working class gets its fill. <br> But not necessarily, for two reasons. First, Obama's ideological commitments to familial diversity, feminism, affirmative action, Roe v. Wade, and all the other shibboleths of social liberalism will inevitably spur a reaction among working-class voters. It's just a question of whether that happens before or after he becomes president. <br> Second, Iraq in 2008 is nothing like Iraq in 2006. The war is not a "failure." Voters are beginning to realize this. They may have reached a consensus that the war should not have been fought, but they are ambivalent about how to go forward. They trust <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span>'s national security judgment. They are uncertain that a 46-year-old lawyer who seemingly came out of nowhere four years ago is a plausible commander in chief. McCain's job is to convince them that he is not. <br> This may be enough to win the working-class back from the Democrats in 2008. Those Republicans who want to keep them would do well to read this learned, judicious, and enjoyable book.By Matthew Continetti 
 This column was written by James C. Capretta.<hr width="50%">In describing the health-care plan of the presumptive Democratic nominee, Sen. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span>, reporters invariably parrot the campaign line that he would build on, not replace, today's dominant employment-based system of private insurance. This is reassuring to those millions of voters who see the need for reform but are generally satisfied with the coverage they get today. Unfortunately, the Obama spin is nothing more than that. In truth, the Obama plan would sow the seeds of destruction for private health insurance, whether provided by employers or offered on the open market. <br> Fortunately, voters will not have to rely exclusively on information from a swooning press corps and the Obama propagandists for the duration of the coming campaign. There are, and will be, more rigorous assessments by outsiders of what the Obama plan would really mean, financially and otherwise. Indeed, a partial assessment of an Obama-like plan is already available - financed by an Obama ally, no less. Tellingly, even it points to the inescapable bottom line: Obama's plan would put the country on an irreversible fast-track to government-run health care for everyone. <br> The Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based philanthropy, has a well-deserved reputation as a very deep pocket for left-leaning health-policy initiatives and research. Chances are, if a new study supports an expanded government role in health care, Commonwealth Fund money made it happen. <br> Recently, three Commonwealth executives - Cathy Schoen, Karen Davis, and Sara R. Collins - published a proposal to rework health-insurance arrangements in the United States. The plan is of special interest because it is indistinguishable from the Obama plan in its basic design. <br> First, the Commonwealth executives, like Obama, would impose so-called "play or pay" on America's employers. All U.S. businesses would either have to organize coverage for their workers and finance a portion of the premium, or pay a tax - seven percent of their payroll - to the federal government to offset the costs of enrolling workers in government-organized insurance. <br> Second, they, like Obama, would have the federal government establish a new national "insurance exchange" for small-business workers and individuals who don't get coverage through a job. The government would impose heavy regulations on participating insurers, including mandatory benefits and limits on the range of premiums they could charge to different enrollees. <br> Third, and most importantly, both the Commonwealth executives and Obama want to initiate, as an additional option in the insurance exchange, a new publicly run insurance plan, modeled on Medicare. With this option, the federal government would act as the insurer, collecting premiums from enrollees to cover the cost of paying health-care claims on their behalf. <br> This public-insurance option is the crucial pivot upon which these plans, and others like them, tilt toward a government takeover. The Commonwealth executives make it clear that the new publicly run insurance would import Medicare's arcane and elaborate rules for paying hospitals, physicians, and other providers. These payment rates are not negotiated with the suppliers of services; they are imposed by the federal bureaucracy on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. There is no efficiency gain or improvement in the quality of care. Rather, the government simply fixes payments at below-market rates. In time, such actions always lead to constrained supply and frustrated demand. <br> Private insurers, of course, also try to control costs, using whatever levers are at their disposal. They can't dictate fees for doctors and hospitals, but they can try to steer enrollees to a limited number of preferred providers, to whom they promise volume in exchange for lower prices. Many also try to manage care for the most expensive, chronically ill cases, sometimes to the great frustration of patients and doctors. And they usually require patients to pay at least some of every bill to provide a financial incentive for thinking twice before using services. But even the most aggressive, cost-cutting insurers are no match for a government determined to use its sovereign power to set prices and shift costs to others. An analysis accompanying the Commonwealth executives' plan, produced by consultants at The Lewin Group, estimates that the public-insurance option could charge premiums 30 percent below what an average employer plan cost in 2007. Such a premium differential would have dramatic implications in the marketplace. Lewin estimates that, of the 60 million small-business workers and others getting their insurance through the national "insurance exchange," 40 million would choose to enroll in the new public insurance option because of its lower cost. This would effectively double the size of the population covered under Medicare payment rules. The Commonwealth executives also propose expanded enrollment in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), adding another 12 million Americans to public programs. <br> Once in place, the momentum toward the new public-insurance option would be impossible to reverse. Large employers might, for a time, continue playing rather than paying as a service to their workers. But with each passing year, the premium differential between private plans and the public option would grow and induce additional migration from private to public insurance, which, in turn, would increase the government's ability to impose lower prices, further widening the premium gap. It would be just a matter of time before all employers abandoned the effort to compete with a monolithic government-run plan. <br> If the only consequence of such a shift in power were lower premiums, many analysts and ordinary voters would cheer on the change. But, of course, government control brings government bureaucracy, inefficiency, and heavy handedness. The tragedy is that price controls are only effective if they control and limit the supply of services. In time, that means waiting lists and other barriers to accessing care, along with skyrocketing costs to the taxpayer. That's the true bottom line of the Obama plan.By James C.

 This column was written by Deroy Murdock.<hr width="50%">While Americans focus on the interminable Clinton-Obama celebrity death match, Senator John McCain is using clear-headed, compellingly crafted speeches to propose surprisingly bold free-market ideas. With one huge exception, the Arizona Republican advocates more limited, open government as his Democratic rivals promise tax hikes and an even busier state. Voters should welcome this stark contrast. <br> On spending, McCain would rule with a tight fist. <br> "In my administration, there will be no more subsidies for special pleaders - no more corporate welfare - no more throwing around billions of dollars of the people's money on pet projects, while the people themselves are struggling to afford their homes, groceries, and gas," McCain said April 15 in Pittsburgh. "I will veto every bill with earmarks, until the Congress stops sending bills with earmarks," McCain continued. "I will seek a constitutionally valid line-item veto to end the practice once and for all." More impressively, McCain said, "We will institute a one-year pause in discretionary spending increases with the necessary exemption of military spending and veterans' benefits." <br> Such prudence would be a welcome relief from the Bush/GOP Congress years that did for fiscal responsibility what the Playboy Mansion has done for sexual restraint. <br> John McCain displayed far more courage than the average GOP presidential contender when he flew to Iowa to tell its farmers what they can do with their ears of corn. <br> "I have to give you a little straight talk about the farm bill that is wending its way through Congress," McCain declared in Des Moines on May 1, before lawmakers approved a $307 billion agricultural bailout bill. "I do not support it. I would veto it." He added: "I would do that because I believe that the subsidies are unnecessary." <br> As he told the National Restaurant Association in Chicago on May 19, "If I am elected president, I will seek an end to all agricultural tariffs, and to all farm subsidies that are not based on clear need. I will veto any bill containing special-interest favors and corporate welfare in any form," He explained: "The original idea was to provide a buffer to small farmers in tough times and to assure a stable supply of food for our country. But nowadays, the small farmers have been forgotten, and instead the Congress sends a steady supply of subsidies to agribusiness." <br> The GOP desperately needs a leader who can stand up to America's rural welfare queens. If he can "just say no" to them, perhaps other privilege-seekers will notice and draw their snouts from the public trough. Had President Bush not given away money as if it grew like grain, it might have been easier to kill or at least lasso this year's farm fiasco. Instead, with a few brave exceptions, Republicans gleefully lined up to help Democrats fatten farmers, as if they were hogs bound for the abattoir. <br> McCain's fiscal discipline would make it easier to reduce taxes. He wants to make President Bush's tax cuts permanent. He would slice corporate taxes from 35 to 25 percent. "We have the second-highest tax on business in the industrialized world," McCain said. "High tax rates are driving many businesses and jobs overseas - and, of course, our foreign competitors wouldn't mind if we kept it that way." <br> McCain also would scrap the Alternative Minimum Tax, double the dependents' exemption from $3,500 to $7,000, "and sign into law a reform agenda to permit the first-year expensing of new equipment and technology . . . to ban Internet taxes, permanently . . . to ban new cell phone taxes... and to make the tax credit for RD permanent, so that we never lose our competitive edge." <br> Most significantly, McCain would let Americans choose to file taxes under today's rules or volunteer for a simpler, flatter rate of perhaps 25 or 15 percent. <br> Rather than yesterday's unemployment-insurance system, McCain explained in Pittsburgh that he favors "using the unemployment-insurance taxes to build for each worker a buffer account against a sudden loss of income - so that in times of need they're not just told to fill out forms and take a number." He would let community colleges tap into existing federal training programs to help displaced workers develop new skills. <br> Regarding healthcare, McCain warned in Tampa on April 29 that his opponents "urge universal coverage, with all the tax increases, new mandates, and government regulation that come along with that idea. But in the end, this will accomplish one thing only. We will replace the inefficiency, irrationality, and uncontrolled costs of the current system with the inefficiency, irrationality, and uncontrolled costs of a government monopoly." <br> Instead, McCain believes "the key to real reform is to restore control over our health-care system to the patients themselves." He would expand Health Savings Accounts, and more dramatically, offer a tax credit of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families to help Americans purchase their own coverage, even across state lines. Freeing Americans to buy health policies outside their own states will create a national market for individual insurance and allow consumers to select coverage as simple or as comprehensive as their preferences and budgets permit. <br> "The health plan you chose would be as good as any that an employer could choose for you," McCain said. "It would be yours and your family's health-care plan, and yours to keep." <br> McCain also calls for reining in the misguided, multi-trillion-dollar Medicare drug plan. "People like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet don't need their prescriptions underwritten by taxpayers," McCain observed. "Those who can afford to buy their own prescription drugs should be expected to do so. This reform alone will save billions of dollars that could be returned to taxpayers or put to better use." <br> McCain previewed how he would lead. Beyond weekly press conferences, McCain told Ohio voters May 15, "I will ask Congress to grant me the privilege of coming before both houses to take questions, and address criticism, much the same as the Prime Minister of Great Britain appears regularly before the House of Commons." This excellent idea would strengthen transparency and accountability. Legislators could grill McCain on his performance, while McCain could straight-talk senators and representatives - right to their faces. If this reform became a standard practice, the only candidates who would run for president would be those who grasp the priorities and details of governance and could communicate them clearly while under withering rhetorical fire. How refreshing. <br> There is a cautionary note among these encouraging signs: John McCain has beer-bonged the Kool-Aid on global warming. <br> "We need to deal with the central facts of rising temperatures, rising waters, and all the endless troubles that global warming will bring," McCain said May 12 at a Portland, Oregon wind-power research facility. <br> He desires "a cap-and-trade system to change the dynamic of our energy economy." His specific goal is to reduce CO2 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Former Virginia state climatologist Patrick Michaels estimated in the May 16 Washington Times that this would lower per-capita emissions "to 19th-century levels." <br> Before relegating America's mid-21st-century economy to the norms of the Grover Cleveland era, McCain should heed the expanding caucus of experts who believe so-called "global warming" is exaggerated, if it even exists. <br> On May 19, the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine released a petition signed by 31,072 Americans scientists, including 9,021 Ph.D.s. They reject the idea that CO2 is boiling the Earth. So much for climate science being "settled." <br> One hopes McCain will listen on this issue. Just as he recently has warmed to tax cuts, perhaps he will cool on "global warming." <br> Nonetheless, McCain will remain a mixed bag. Sometimes he will annoy the Right. Other times, he boldly will go where no GOP standard bearer has gone since Ronald Reagan. As a wise man said, "John McCain is not perfect. Just perfect enough." <br> NRO contributing editor Deroy Murdock is a columnist with the Scripps Howard News Service and a media fellow with the Hoover Institution.<br>By Deroy MurdockReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by The Editors.<hr width="50%">For the past month, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> has been determined to sap the charisma from his campaign. In his quest for the elusive white working class, he has steered away from the type of oratory that once made middle-aged men act like "American Idol" fans. By remaking his stage presence -- lots of nerdy detail, lots of combative rhetoric -- he finally managed to bring <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span>'s impressive electoral machinery to a screeching halt. <br> But, in the course of assuming this new political persona, he ditched one of his most potent themes. It was a theme that coursed through his best speeches, like the one he gave after winning the Iowa caucus, and it prompted genuinely stirring moments. A few minutes into his victory speech, he had just finished a refrain about people "choosing hope over fear ... choosing unity over division" when, out of the crowd, there suddenly arose a chant. It was a chant that, while familiar to hockey fans and Republicans, was not one typically associated with Democrats. Obama's supporters were chanting "USA! USA!" <br> This patriotism was at the very core of Obama's original appeal -- the undercurrent of his "one nation" speech at the 2004 convention and his "only in America" autobiographical narrative. And you can understand why it has produced such raw displays of national pride: At a time when Newsweek publishes covers about American decline and polling shows mass despair about the trajectory of the country, Obama's story captures the best about the dynamism and fluidity of our society. It's a shot of idealism when the conversations about our foreign policy and economy have slipped into a despairing realism. <br> And it's exactly the theme to which he should now return as he turns his campaign toward a Republican foe. The political calculations behind such a pivot are straightforward. The Republicans have already revealed how they will try to portray Obama. Any attacks that smack of race-baiting have the potential to backfire -- which is presumably why <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> has been so reluctant to criticize Obama for the words of his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. So Republicans will strike a more xenophobic tone. They won't necessarily argue that Obama is actually from another country -- although there will no doubt be some subterranean efforts to do so -- but they will try to paint him as a cultural foreigner. That, of course, is what McCain is trying to do when he attacks Obama for his association with the former Weather Underground member Bill Ayers or for his "endorsement" from Hamas, as if it makes Obama a terrorist himself. It's not just sleaze but Obama's own negligence that has allowed his greatest political strength to become a liability. <br> How can Obama counter these attacks? He doesn't have a record of military service to fall back on (although, as the Frenchman John Kerry learned in 2004, sometimes not even that is enough). He's also demonstrated an admirable refusal to engage in the silly symbolism that passes for patriotism. But he does have a simple message that insulates him from any charge that he -- and his values -- are foreign. As he famously told the 2004 Democratic convention: "We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America." The criticism launched against him by Clinton and McCain presumes America is irrevocably divided by race and culture. His campaign's central theme is opposition to that prognosis. <br> Conservatives, too, once appreciated Obama's message. It's a commonplace now among some liberals that the enthusiasm many conservatives displayed for Obama late last year was nothing but political posturing -- an effort to diminish Clinton, who they then assumed would be the Democratic nominee. And there's no doubt that some conservatives were being disingenuous in their early Obamamania. But, at the same time, it's not difficult to see in Obama qualities that conservatives could find appealing. Although some now complain that his post-partisan rhetoric has not been matched by a post-partisan voting record, Obama has taken some notable departures from Democratic orthodoxy. On education, for instance, as Josh Patashnik outlined in these pages ("Reform School," March 26), Obama has supported test-based accountability and performance pay for teachers--two things that are anathema to the teachers' unions and that, for the sake of political expediency, Obama therefore sought to downplay in the Democratic primaries. <br> But, more than any policy positions, it's Obama's state of mind and unorthodox nature that has the potential to appeal to conservatives. As Douglas Kmiec, a conservative legal scholar who's an "Obamacan," wrote in endorsing the Illinois senator, "Obama and I may disagree on aspects of ... important fundamentals [such as abortion and traditional marriage], but I am convinced, based upon his public pronouncements and his personal writing, that on each of these questions he is not closed to understanding opposing points of view and, as best as it is humanly possible, he will respect and accommodate them." <br> It's his ability to respect and accommodate that Obama should be able to use to great effect against McCain this November. Although McCain himself was once considered an unorthodox politician, he's largely abandoned his heterodox streak. Indeed, the facts are on Obama's side when he argues that a McCain presidency will be, in essence, a third term for the policies of George W. Bush -- from Iraq to health care to, perhaps most importantly, the economy. The last issue is Obama's most obvious opening. It's not just the fact that we're headed into a recession and McCain has admitted to having a limited knowledge of economics; it's that he has shifted his position on taxation in wildly divergent directions in a relatively concentrated period of time. <br> This provides ample ground for attack and contrast. And Obama's opposition to the gas-tax holiday was a return to the unconventional Obama. The controversy over the gas tax shows that the press (and even the public) will reward him for standing on principle in the face of potential political damage. But it was merely a first step. And, now that Obama has apparently dispatched with Hillary Clinton, it's time for him to go back to being the candidate he was when he started his campaign -- a candidate of national unity and reconciliation -- because that's the candidate who can win a general election.By The EditorsIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by Robert Scheer</i>.<hr width="50%">Would President <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> forget who made that 3 am call to the special White House phone? I suspect that his aides would not just let him nod off back to sleep, even if they were intimidated by the prospect of one of his alleged intemperate outbursts, but might our septuagenarian President be less than fully focused? <br> Most likely he would be, although as someone born in the same year as the senator, I too bristle at suggestions that age has made me less perfect than I once was. But it has. Sadly, those brain cells do go, and "senior moments" of befuddlement are more than a joke. But that shouldn't automatically disqualify one of us still-agile silver foxes from the White House, as few of my contemporaries are likely to turn in a worse performance than the much younger current occupant. However, looking at the top two men in the present Administration, the age question does make a compelling case for very carefully evaluating McCain's vice-presidential choice. <br> That was my point when I raised the age issue on a Los Angeles Times Book Festival panel last Sunday, and my sparring partner, right-wing radio pundit Hugh Hewitt, wanted me instantly voted off the island of constant noise. He compared my "ageist" comment to someone making a racist charge against <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span>. <br> I take his point, as absurd as it first appeared. Absurd because it is obviously true that aging, as opposed to skin color or gender, does have a deleterious effect on one's physical and mental functioning, and to deny this evident biological reality is as nonsensical as denying evolution itself. The species survives when each generation burns out and is replaced by a hopefully superior one, and while it is natural to want to linger on the scene as long as possible, we cannot insist on our personal indispensability to the continuation of the human experience. <br> Of course Hewitt was not doing anything of the sort, any more than he would genuinely embrace creationism, summarily dismiss fears of global warming or otherwise honestly endorse the tenet of the sort of phony science that right-wing pundits must from time to time condone. They do so for opportunistic reasons, and that is why the significance of McCain's age must be denied by those eager to maintain the GOP's hold on the presidency. They will hold their noses and vote for him despite the sensible positions he has at times had the temerity to advance, impervious to their blackmail. Impervious, that is, until he decided to make a second run for the presidency, leading him to sharply reverse his past principled stances and accommodate torture, tax cuts for the rich, Pat Robertson and other favored fetishes of the Republican base. The right-wing talk show bully boys still don't trust him, but he's the only horse left to ride. <br> While they continue to loathe him for his fatal flaw of occasionally embracing a moderate thought, they are dependent upon his electoral victory to extend their vastly disproportionate political power. They fully expect McCain to betray key points of their cryogenic agenda; on Sunday, Hewitt condemned most of McCain's Senate performance and in particular his reasonable stance on immigration. <br> Their hope of retaining influence rests on saddling McCain with a proven rightist as his vice-presidential choice. The hunt is now on for the new Cheney, but such a candidate has to be brought in under the radar because the public is for the first time in modern history keenly aware that the Vice President can play an enormously destructive role. That is particularly true if the potential President himself is, actuarially speaking, more likely to kick the bucket. Or, less dramatically, simply underperforms. <br> Let's not kid any longer. Age is a factor in this race and nowhere is it so important as in McCain's vice-presidential choice. If he picks from the very thin ranks of reasonable Republicans, it will be reassuring to more moderate voters attracted to McCain for his independence of thought as reflected in support of campaign finance reform and his opposition to some outrageously bloated military weapons expenditures that he has on occasion done much to expose. But if he turns to the loony wing for a running mate, we must become very concerned about the ability of a man in his 70s to fully perform in the world's most important office. Is there another Cheney lurking in the wings? By Robert ScheerReprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by presidential candidate, Senator John McCain R-Ariz..<hr width="50%">What exactly is the problem with the American health-care system? <br> The problem is not that Americans don't have fine doctors, medical technology, and treatments. American medicine is the envy of the world. The problem is not that most Americans lack adequate health insurance. The vast majority of Americans have private insurance, and our government spends many billions each year to provide even more. <br> The biggest problem with the American health-care system is one of cost and access, and as a result tens of millions of individuals have no insurance. For example, we currently spend for about 2.4 trillion dollars a year on health care. A decade from now that number, under current projections, will double to over four trillion dollars. <br> The <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span> response to these problems is to promise universal coverage, whatever its cost, and the massive tax increases, mandates, and government regulation that it imposes. But in the end this will accomplish one thing only. We will replace the inefficiency, irrationality, and uncontrolled costs of the current system with the inefficiency, irrationality, and uncontrolled costs of a government monopoly. We'll have all the problems, and more, of private health care - rigid rules, long waits, and lack of choices, and risk degrading its great strengths and advantages including the innovation and life-saving technology that make American medicine the most advanced in the world. <br> I have a different approach. I believe the key to real reform is to restore control over our health-care system to the patients themselves. To that end, my reforms are built on the pursuit of three goals: paying only for quality medical care, having insurance choices that are diverse and responsive to individual needs, and restoring our sense of personal responsibility. <br> American families know quality when they see it, so their dollars should be in their hands. When families are informed about medical choices, they are more capable of making their own decisions, less likely to choose the most expensive and often unnecessary options, and are more satisfied with their choices. Health Savings Accounts are tax-preferred accounts used to pay insurance premiums and other health costs. They put the family in charge of what they pay for, and should be expanded and encouraged. <br> Americans also need new choices beyond those offered in employment-based coverage. They want a reformed system so that wherever you go and wherever you work, your health plan goes with you. And there is a very straightforward way to achieve this. <br> Under current law, the federal government gives a tax benefit when employers provide health-insurance coverage to American workers and their families. This benefit doesn't cover the total cost of the health plan, and in reality each worker and family absorbs the rest of the cost in lower wages and diminished benefits. But it provides essential support for insurance coverage. Many workers are perfectly content with this arrangement, and under my reform plan they would be able to keep that coverage. Their employer-provided health plans would be largely untouched and unchanged. <br> But for every American who wanted it, another option would be available: Every year, they would receive a tax credit directly, with the same cash value of the credits for employees in big companies, in a small business, or self-employed. You simply choose the insurance provider that suits you best. By mail or online, you would then inform the government of your selection. And the money to help pay for your health care would be sent straight to that insurance provider. The health plan you chose would be as good as any that an employer could choose for you. And if a church or professional organization wishes to sponsor insurance for its members, they should be able to do so. The bottom line: Health insurance would be yours and your family's health-care plan to keep without worrying that it will go away along with your job. <br> The value of that credit - 2,500 dollars for individuals, 5,000 dollars for families - would also be enhanced by the greater competition this reform would help create among insurance companies. Millions of Americans would be making their own health-care choices again. Insurance companies could no longer take your business for granted, offering narrow plans with escalating costs. It would help change the whole dynamic of the current system, putting individuals and families back in charge, and forcing companies to respond with better service at lower cost. Again, choice and competition are indispensible to real reform that brings costs down and broadens access while maintaining quality. <br> But we also need to ensure that those without prior group coverage and with preexisting conditions, who have the most difficulty in the individual market, have access to the high-quality coverage they need. As with other problems our nation has faced, states have taken the lead in experimenting with ways to cover the "uninsurables" and give us a window into what works and what doesn't work. I will consult with the governors to solicit their ideas about a best practice model that states can follow - a Guaranteed Access Plan or GAP - and work with Congress, the governors, and industry to make sure that it is funded adequately and has the right incentives to reduce costs such as disease management, individual case management, and health and wellness programs. The details of a Guaranteed Access Plan would be worked out with the collaboration and consent of the states that wish to participate. <br> This cooperation among states in the purchase of insurance would also be a crucial step in ridding the market of both needless and costly regulations, and the dominance in the market of only a few insurance companies. Right now, there is a different health-insurance market for every state. Each one has its own rules and restrictions, and often guarantees inadequate competition among insurance companies. Often these circumstances prevent the best companies, with the best plans and lowest prices, from making their product available to any American who wants it. We need to break down these barriers to competition, innovation and excellence, with the goal of establishing a national market to make the best practices and lowest prices available to every person in every state. <br> Families also place a high value on quickly getting simple care, and have shown a willingness to pay cash to get it. If walk-in clinics in retail outlets are the most convenient, cost-effective way for families to safely meet simple needs, then no policies of government should stand in their way. And if the cheapest way to get high quality care is to use advances in web technology to allow a doctor to practice across state lines, then let them. <br> Effective reform must also deal with another source of needless cost and trouble in the health care system which comes from the trial bar. Every patient in America must have access to legal remedies in cases of bad medical practice. But this vital principle of law and medicine is not an invitation to endless, frivolous lawsuits from trial lawyers who exploit both patients and physicians alike. We must pass medical liability reform, and those reforms should eliminate lawsuits directed at doctors who follow clinical guidelines and adhere to patient safety protocols. If Sen. Obama and Sen. Clinton are sincere in their conviction that health care coverage and quality is their first priority, then they will put the needs of patients before the demands of trial lawyers. They can't have it both ways. <br> Finally, we must personally do everything we can to prevent expensive, chronic diseases. Our rights in this country are protected by our personal sense of responsibility for our own well being. Cases of diabetes are going up, not only in the baby-boom generation, but among younger Americans obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure are all on the rise. Parents must impart to their children a sense of personal responsibility for their health, nutrition, and exercise. <br> We can build a health care system that is more responsive to our needs and is delivered to more people at lower cost. The "solution," my friends, isn't a one-size-fits-all-big government takeover of health care. It resides where every important social advance has always resided - with the American people themselves, with well-informed American families, making practical decisions to address their imperatives for better health and more secure prosperity.By Senator John McCain R-Ariz.Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Frank J. Gaffney Jr..<hr width="50%">Are Americans unusually stupid or is it something our President put in the water? As millions surrender their homes and sacrifice other standards of our nation's economic and political reputation to the caprice of the Bush-Cheney imperium, a majority of voters tell pollsters that they might vote for a candidate who promises more of the same. <br> Assuming that likely voters are not now thinking of yet another Republican President simply because <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> is the only white guy left standing - an excuse as pathetic in its logic as the decision four years ago to return two Texas oil hustlers to the White House because they were not Massachusetts liberals - must mean that tens of millions of Americans have taken leave of their senses. <br> If not the white-guy syndrome, why would even a shocking minority of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> supporters say they prefer McCain to the other Democrat? How otherwise to explain the nation's widespread bipartisan rejection of the Bush presidency and yet a willingness to let McCain continue in that vein? <br> To be sure, as a senator, McCain has exhibited flashes of independence on behalf of taxpayers, as in his support of campaign-finance reform in which he partnered with Democrat Russ Feingold. McCain's investigations of the military-industrial complex's shameless exploitation of terrorism fears set a high standard, as in exposing the air-tanker scandal that dispatched a Boeing exec and a former Pentagon employee to prison. But his political ambition is showing. Although he previously harshly criticized the enormous waste in the Iraq occupation, today, as a presidential candidate, he opens the door to a hundred years of taxpayer dollars tossed down the drain in Iraq. The man who was tortured now hugs a leader who authorized the same. <br> By so unabashedly embracing the most glaringly failed U.S. President ever, McCain has surrendered the right to be considered an independent candidate, judged on his own merits and personal history. A vote for McCain is a vote for that rancid recipe mixing religious bigotry, imperial arrogance and corporate greed that he had stood against in the run-up to the 2000 presidential election when he challenged George W. Bush, but to which he now has capitulated. <br> Too harsh? Then consider just how tight the space is between the rocks of our failed Mideast policy and the hard place of our impending financial disaster. The sudden out-of-control spike in the cost of oil - the key short-term market variable, the specter that stokes inflation fear and limits moves to avoid recession - is not a natural disaster or in any realistic way the result of inefficiency in the use of energy. What more than doubled the price of petroleum in the short run was not that too many of us bought Hummers, but rather that the political stability of the region that contains the bulk of that oil was deliberately and recklessly roiled. <br> In the name of fighting the 9/11 terrorists, the Bush Administration overthrew the one Arab government most adamantly opposed to the Saudi financiers of that son of their system, Osama bin Laden. Instead of confronting the royal leaders of a kingdom that supplied fifteen of the nineteen hijackers, we invaded a nation that supplied not a single one. While Bush overthrew Saddam Hussein, who had no ties to the hijackers, he embraced the leaders of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the only three nations in the world that had diplomatically recognized and supported the Taliban sponsors of Al Qaeda. <br> Consider that historical marker at a time when the UAE and Saudi Arabia bankers are buying major positions in distressed US financial and other key corporate institutions. I know, it all sounds too conspiratorial, like imagining that we might wake up from this national nightmare and discover that the CEO of Halliburton, who replaced Dick Cheney when the latter selected himself to be Bush's Vice President, now has his headquarters in Dubai, tucked safely into the obscenely oil-revenue-rich UAE that our troops were sent to Iraq to protect. <br> There is no national outrage, or even seriously sustained media interest, over the fact that Cheney's old company profited enormously from ripping off U.S. tax dollars going into the Iraq occupation. Nor is there even much curiosity about the shenanigans of Halliburton, which is doing business with Arab oil sheiks at a time when the U.. banks these Middle Eastern oil interests bought into are moving to foreclose on American homeowners. <br> It's just the sort of egregious betrayal of the trust of the taxpayers that Senator McCain would have gone after, before he sought to don the soiled robes of the Bush presidency.

 This column was written by Michael Burgess and Newt Gingrich.<hr width="50%">Nothing is certain except death and taxes, and physicians will tell you that death is much less complicated than the American tax code. <br> The complexity of today's tax code is a consequence of countless deductions and exemptions aimed at promoting a variety of congressionally determined policy agendas. The result is federal law loaded with opportunities for avoiding taxes and exploiting loopholes at the expense of fellow Americans. Behind every loophole there is a lobbyist. <br> Everyone is familiar with the problems inherent in our convoluted tax code. Criticizing it is as American as apple pie and baseball. And for good reason. Each year Americans spend billions of hours and billions of dollars complying with the complex code. We also spend countless more hours complaining about it. <br> Time is precious, and often we don't have enough time for personal priorities like raising our families, cooking dinner, or even spending time with friends. Then there is the dollars-and-cents side of the equation, where time is money and resources are spent navigating tax law instead of spent growing the economy and creating jobs. <br> Taken together, this argues for a strong prescription of real change: Reform the tax code. <br> When President Reagan cut taxes in 1981, several good things happened. The economy grew, revenues increased, and jobs were created. <br> It's hard to think of better medicine for our ailing economy than replicating successful reform of the tax code on an even greater scale. <br> How do we do it? Flatten tax rates; simplify the code; and, shift the burden away from our families and small businesses. The encouraging news is we have a practical and effective blueprint for delivering this real change across-the-board. It's called the optional flat tax plan, or the "one page, one rate" tax plan. <br> In 1981, Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka proposed a boldly simple tax structure that would transform the Internal Revenue Service and our economy by creating a single rate of taxation for all Americans. <br> Today, several states have implemented this single rate structure, and from Utah to Massachusetts, citizens are seeing the benefits. <br> In Colorado, a single income-tax rate generated so much surplus revenue that one lawmaker actually proposed reducing the rate ten years after its implementation, and today the rate is below its original level. In Indiana, the economy boomed after a single rate went into effect in 2003. Since that time, corporate income tax receipts have increased by almost 250 percent. Admiring such success, Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina currently is pushing for an optional flat tax on Palmetto State income. <br> In Congress, members like Michael Burgess of Texas, David Dreier of California, and Paul Ryan of Wisconsin are working to establish an optional tax structure for the United States that is flatter and simpler. Senators Arlen Specter and Sam Brownback support similar measures on the other side of the Capitol. <br> A faster, flatter, fairer tax structure would be simple: tax returns would be done on a single page, perhaps even on a postcard. Subtract from your income a standard deduction, multiply the result by a fixed single rate of taxation, and the process is over. Gone will be the stressful hours spent figuring out whether your military service or marital status will adversely affect your return. No more headaches trying to determine where estimated tax payments go. Tax preparation fees might be money spent on something more rewarding. <br> Secondly, a new deduction, which would be above the established poverty level, means an optional flat tax would not unfairly target the poor. Approximately the lowest 42 percent of income earners would potentially be exempt from paying taxes altogether, and any taxes they did pay would only be on the amount that exceeded the deduction. <br> An optional flat tax would also eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax. And if a person had twice as much income as another, he or she would be taxed twice as much. Furthermore, a single rate tax structure would eliminate taxes on savings, capital gains, and dividends. Saving would increase and businesses would expand to create new jobs. By reducing dramatically the world's second-highest corporate income tax rate means that U.S. companies would have less incentive to move their jobs abroad. And here is where the all-American principle of freedom comes into the prescription: opting for a one rate, one page tax plan would be entirely left up to the individual or business to decide, not Uncle Sam. <br> An optional flat tax would save taxpayers more than $100 billion per year and reduce compliance costs by over 90 percent. This is a stimulus package that would have an immediate effect on our American economy. <br> Recent polling by American Solutions shows that over 80 percent of Americans favor the option of filing taxes on a one page tax return with one rate. After all, who would complain about making something easier, less costly, and less time consuming? <br> This is a political year, with elections right around the corner. You can't help but hear talk about change. Let's consider how the right change could improve the most complicated of institutions (the IRS), save time, money, and some peace of mind for the taxpayer, and most importantly, deliver enduring prosperity for all Americans. An optional flat tax is a plan for real change worthy of everyone's vote. It's also a plan that will finally make taxes less complicated than death.By Michael Burgess and Newt GingrichReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by James C. Capretta.<br>In his 1994 State of the Union address, President Bill Clinton waved his pen at the Democratic-controlled Congress and said he would veto any health-care-reform bill that did not "guarantee" the right to health insurance for every American. The threat worked. Congress didn't send him a bill he would have to veto - or any reform bill at all, for that matter. <br> Then-First Lady <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span>, heading up her husband's health-care task force, undoubtedly had a hand in that disastrous 1994 line in the sand. Now that she is running for president, she says she has learned her lesson. But has she? It hasn't seemed so over the last two months on the campaign trail, as the take-no-prisoners rhetoric and finger-pointing ultimatums have returned with a vengeance. <br> The 1994 effort was a debacle of biblical proportions for the Democratic party. To win the presidency, everyone assumed Hillary Clinton would need to erase memories of her flawed leadership of that catastrophe. And doing so would mean showing voters she had the capacity for a different kind of leadership, one based on openness to the private sector, appreciation for the complexity of the task, and policy flexibility - not 1990's style war-rooms and the promised destruction of opponents with differing views. <br> For a time last fall, it seemed as if Clinton understood she had an image problem that needed correcting. In announcing her new plan for health care, she stressed choice and pluralism. She claimed - falsely - that under her plan no one would be forced to drop the coverage they have today if they were happy with it. She suggested the plan is built on general principles, not detailed legislative particulars, and she pledged to work with Congress to formulate a workable compromise. She even endorsed Republican-sounding tax credits to bolster her claimed support of more private health insurance options. <br> Conservatives, of course, never believed for a minute that her overall goal had changed, and rightly so. Her plan is cleverly drawn, but a careful reading shows it would lead to a government takeover. Still, there was no denying a change in salesmanship. <br> The only problem was that the new, seemingly more open-minded Clinton didn't work - politically, that is. She lost her frontrunner status for the Democratic presidential nomination and a slew of caucuses and primaries to Senator <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span>. It turns out that he, too, had a health-care plan he was touting, one that isn't all that different from hers. And he had already cornered the market of voters interested in promises of consensus-building leadership. <br> In recent weeks, in a last-ditch attempt to draw clearer distinctions with Obama, Clinton has done what comes naturally to her, promising, that if elected, she will again lead a no-holds-barred campaign to defeat any and all opponents who stand in her way on health care. And, just like her husband did in 1994, she has defined the fight as a struggle between those who support "universal coverage" and those who don't. <br> Of course, it is convenient, and not a coincidence, that Obama is on the wrong side in this fight, as Clinton describes it. He has refused to endorse the provision which Clinton argues is the non-negotiable foundation of Democratic health-care orthodoxy: mandatory enrollment by every American in government-approved health insurance. Clinton has virtually accused Obama of heresy for daring to defy a tenet of the universal-coverage church. <br> In response to Clinton's attacks, Obama has pointed out that such a mandate would hurt exactly those households a "universal" health-care plan is supposed to help - low-wage families who can't afford private coverage but who are ineligible for public programs. It would seem these families would be forced into a choice between bad and worse with the Clinton mandate. Either they pay premiums for coverage they cannot afford and forego other necessary goods and services for their family, or they pay a lesser financial penalty to save some money but still go without coverage. Either way, they are worse off financially than they are today. <br> But that's exactly the dilemma Clinton wants to force onto the public agenda. She understands that mandatory insurance enrollment would be the engine for a health-care train with many more cars attached to it, and these would inevitably shift the balance of political pressures toward a government-run system. <br> It's not difficult to see her logic. If the government requires everyone to have insurance, it will quickly become incumbent on politicians to make sure there are "affordable" options for everyone too, based on ability to pay. For a time, that might be accomplished with lavish new subsidies, which Clinton promises in her plan. But, if costs continue to escalate rapidly (as they would under her approach), pressure would build for predictable and reliable controls, as neither the government nor households could manage indefinitely with premium increases far exceeding wage gains. Inevitably, the federal government would respond to escalating costs the same way it has tried to reign in Medicare spending, with elaborate payment schedules, price setting, and heavy-handed regulation aimed at artificially lowering costs and limiting the supply of services. <br> Clinton has argued that her plan will slow cost escalation without price fixing. It would not. She proposes to invest in more widespread use of health information technology and fund research into what works and doesn't in health-care delivery. These proposals, which most Republicans also support, may result in some modest easing of cost pressures, but no credible expert believes they are a real answer to the larger problem, and certainly they would not be enough to offset the substantial new costs associated with a universal system of health-insurance subsidies. <br> To slow rapid cost escalation, there really are only two choices. The first would have the United States go the way of Europe and Canada, with all that would mean for reduced access, lower quality, and less innovation. <br> But there is a better way. A second option would have the government adopt policies that promote a functional marketplace, with cost-conscious consumers selecting from among numerous offerings of insurance and services based on price and quality competition. In time, such competition would increase productivity, improve the quality of services provided to patients, and ease cost pressure, making insurance more affordable for those who want coverage. <br> Clinton has made it abundantly clear which approach to cost control she favors. Her 1994 plan sought to impose "premium caps" on insurance, which would have quickly become price controls for hospitals, physicians, and products. She staunchly opposed the 2003 Medicare drug bill because it relies heavily on price competition and private insurance. And she frequently rails against "privatization schemes." There should be no doubt that, once in power, she would couple her mandate to buy insurance with significant new government power to impose cost constraint. <br> Just like 1994, Clinton wants to frame the choice for the country as between universal coverage, or not. She failed last time because the country was presented with overwhelming evidence that the real choice was between a government-run system and one based on individual choice and competition. The lesson she appears to have learned from that episode is to do all she can to hide her true intentions.By James C. CaprettaReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Michael Tanner.<br>For some time now, the debate over how best to reform the American health-care system has been dominated by the question of "universal coverage," how to provide health insurance to those without it. That remains the battle cry of Sen. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span>, who promises to provide "health insurance for every single American." <br> However, if <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> become the candidates for president this fall, we may see a subtle but useful shift that could actually lead to improving how health care is provided in this country. Both McCain and Obama recognize that the key question in health-care reform is not coverage, but cost. <br> Clinton and Obama have clashed over the question of an individual mandate (requiring every American to purchase insurance). Hillary supports such a mandate, claiming that it's the only way to ensure universal coverage. Obama opposes one, arguing that "the reason people don't have health insurance is not because they don't want it, it's because they can't afford it." Instead of a mandate, therefore, Obama would focus on a combination of cost cutting and subsidies to reduce the price of insurance. While he believes that his proposal would greatly increase the number of Americans with insurance, he admits it will fall short of 100-percent coverage. <br> John McCain also steers clear of attempts at universal coverage. "Bringing costs under control is the only way to stop the erosion of affordable health insurance," McCain says on his website. A McCain spokesman adds, "You worry about the uninsured, but they are a symptom of a larger problem. Unless you do something about cost, you are chasing your proverbial tail." <br> Obama and McCain are reflecting a growing consensus among health-care experts that the continued growth of health-care spending is unsustainable and that something must be done to bring costs under control. The United States spends roughly 17 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on health care, far more than any other country, and that is projected to rise to 20 percent of GDP by 2015. While that spending has undoubtedly helped buy the highest quality health care in the world, the distribution of costs has clearly made care unaffordable for many businesses and individuals. Nor should we forget that the skyrocketing cost of government health-care programs like Medicare and Medicaid is threatening to bury our children under a mountain of debt and taxes. <br> That is not to say that Obama and McCain agree on how to reduce health-care costs. Obama would rely much more on the heavy hand of government. Among other things, he would impose caps on insurance premiums and price controls on drug companies. He would have the government establish national practice standards for doctors. And, he would create a National Health Insurance Exchange as a sort of clearinghouse to make it easier for businesses and individuals to shop for the best insurance. <br> McCain, in contrast, would attempt to promote greater competition among private health insurers. He would allow people to buy insurance plans across state lines, which will help drive down rates. And he would try to shift away from our current employment-based insurance system toward a system where individuals purchase and own their own insurance plans. He would do this by replacing the current tax break for employer-provided insurance with a refundable $2,500 tax credit for individuals, and $5,000 for families. The idea is that once people start to buy their own insurance, they'll be in a position to insist on lower prices and higher quality - just as they do with every other product they buy. <br> Both Obama and McCain would take other steps as well, including encouraging greater use of generic drugs, promoting the use of electronic medical records, emphasizing prevention, and providing incentives for more integrated medicine - treating illnesses rather than symptoms. Studies suggest, however, that savings from these proposals may be less than either candidate has hoped. <br> But regardless of who becomes president, we can expect major changes for the American health-care system. And it's a good sign that we're beginning to debate the right things.By Michael TannerReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by E.J. Dionne, Jr.<br>Liberals who have sung the praises of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> in the past confront a fascinating test of consistency, integrity and political commitment now that McCain is the virtually certain Republican nominee. <br> It could be an amusing moment. I should know, since I'm one of them. <br> Over the years, I've said a lot of nice things about McCain. In 1996, I suggested that Bob Dole pick him as his running mate. (Dole didn't listen.) I praised McCain's work on campaign finance reform, admired him for opposing President Bush's tax cuts and was upset when he was being cut down by the Bush machine in 2000. I wrote a friendly review of one of McCain's books, and even once asked, in print, that God bless him (for his refusal to bash immigrants). <br> Even my punditry has been sympathetic to McCain. In July of 1999, I said he'd emerge as the main challenger to George W. Bush, and I pointed to the beginnings of a 2008 McCain comeback in early November of last year. <br> Please forgive those self-referential paragraphs. I offer them to underscore that the problem I'm writing about is not somebody else's. It's mine. <br> Liberals can't ignore their past praise of McCain and trash him now just because he's the Republican nominee. After all, isn't he the guy many liberals once wanted the GOP to nominate? <br> Yet neither does it make sense for liberals to ignore all the issues on which they disagree with McCain - for starters, his commitment to continuing the occupation of Iraq indefinitely, his flip-flopping on those tax cuts, his opposition to government-sponsored universal health coverage - even if aspects of his persona are appealing. <br> McCain made the liberals' work easier by renouncing parts of his past so he could win this year's Republican nomination. His reversal on taxes is breathtaking, and he doesn't even own up to why he opposed Bush's tax cuts in the first place. <br> His new position is that he's for making the Bush tax cuts permanent simply because he never wants to vote for a tax increase. But if these tax cuts were a bad idea, why should they be continued? <br> And McCain now claims he opposed the Bush tax cuts because they were not accompanied by spending cuts. But that wasn't his thrust at the time. "I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us, at the expense of middle-class Americans who most need tax relief," he said in 2001. Too bad that John McCain isn't running this year. <br> His efforts to pander to the religious right that he so bravely opposed in 2000 (he called Pat Robertson and the late Jerry Falwell "agents of intolerance") aren't very attractive, either. <br> And it's mystifying that while <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> has been willing - in the phrase he made fashionable - to "reject and denounce" Louis Farrakhan because of Farrakhan's anti-Semitism, McCain hasn't gone nearly as far in dealing with Pastor John Hagee. The evangelical leader, who called the Roman Catholic Church "the great whore," has endorsed McCain. McCain distanced himself from Hagee's anti-Catholicism - there are, after all, a lot of Catholic swing voters - but why is McCain so reluctant to use much stronger language about Hagee himself? <br> All this points to what is maddening about McCain. At times, he has acted with courage and honor. At other times, he behaves like a crafty politician. There is an independent side to McCain that has made him an authentic maverick. But on so many issues, he is nothing more (or less) than a thoroughly conventional conservative politician. <br> Perhaps the issue that matters most, especially to liberals, is his turnabout on Bush himself. Face it: Many liberals found McCain most attractive when he was being smeared and assaulted by Bush's lieutenants in the 2000 campaign. The more the Republican establishment attacked him, the more anti-establishment McCain became. Liberals loved that. <br> But McCain got to where he is now by making his peace with Bush. <br> Notably on Iraq but also on economics, he seems to be running for George W.'s third term. That's not what the country needs. <br> So what's the path of integrity for one-time McCain fans on the center and left? It would be to base our judgments on the extent to which the rebellious McCain we admired has given way to the McCain who is as conservative as he always said he was - even if many liberals (and, for different reasons, many conservatives) didn't want to believe him.By E.J.

 This column was written by Eric Rauchway.<br>With <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> winning 11 contests since Super Tuesday, and appearing well on his way to winning a clear majority of elected delegates, it looks unlikely that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span> could win the Democratic nomination without depending on the unelected party stalwarts ("superdelegates") to push her over the top. History provides us with a test case of this scenario, in which a major party faced a choice between the managerial (but perhaps less than visionary) heir to a successful previous administration, and an inspiring, popular speaker. The inspirational candidate had the edge going into the convention and enjoyed the approval of voters, but the nomination went instead to the party insider. The leaders of the Democratic Party in 2008 should learn from the errors the leaders of the Republican Party made in 1912. <br> Then as now, most Americans wanted change from Republican governance. With the exception of the two Grover Cleveland interregna, Republicans had held the presidency since before the Civil War. They had passed policies favored by corporate management and allowed industry executives into the highest councils of the party. Even a great many voters who preferred Republicans to Democrats believed their party had betrayed them, allowing the banking and business centers of the East to take advantage of farmers and homesteaders on the frontier. They wanted more popular participation in elections and in policymaking, more progressive taxation, and less corporate control of policy. <br> Recognizing this demand for change, the former president Theodore Roosevelt challenged the incumbent, William Howard Taft, for the Republican nomination, running an insurgent campaign to take back the GOP for the people. Taft's strategy to stop Roosevelt's momentum bears striking resemblance to those employed by Clinton in her race against Obama. Taft tried to reckon with the Roosevelt insurgency by claiming America had no real need for change, and suggested demands for reform were unpatriotic: He did not understand "the continued iteration and reiteration of the proposition, 'Let the people rule,' " saying, "I do not hesitate to say that the history of the last 135 years shows that the people have ruled ... [U]nder our present constitution and our present laws we have had a really popular government." Taft also criticized the rules that made Roosevelt's challenge possible, saying they were "unfair," especially the open primaries. Neither of these tactics particularly endeared him to an electorate excited by the twin prospects of a real shift in American politics and the opportunity to vote directly for it themselves. Realizing this, Taft tried to co-opt Roosevelt's appeal, asking plaintively "whether I am not entitled to the same name of progressive." <br> Perhaps slightly unfairly, the electorate appeared to think the answer to this question was, "No." To claim the "progressive" name, Taft could point to a vigorous record of antitrust prosecution, as well as constitutional amendments to permit an income tax and the direct election of U.S. senators that were passed on his watch. But he had urged neither with particular energy, and until he was threatened with Roosevelt's return to politics, seemed content to present himself as a devoted public servant of the status quo. <br> Unable to deny the progressive impulse or the democratized primaries their legitimacy, and equally unable to benefit from them himself, Taft wondered if Roosevelt and his followers suffered messianic delusions, asking, "Can he usher in the millennium?" Such drama poorly suited the normally grave Taft, who lost one primary after another. Under the pressure, Taft wept in an interview when he thought of his rejection by his former friend - and his party's voters. <br> Of the delegates chosen by voters, Roosevelt had an overwhelming majority: 278 to Taft's 48. But in the convention, a candidate would need 540 delegates to claim the nomination, and hundreds of delegates would be awarded by the Republican National Committee, a majority of whose members were Taft men. They put him over the top. Roosevelt and his supporters bolted the party and formed the Progressive party. In the general election, Taft came in a pathetic third behind Roosevelt and the victorious Woodrow Wilson. <br> Should Obama win a majority of delegates chosen by voters, the Democrats will head into their convention facing much the same choice as the Republicans of 1912: Either they can use party machinery to crown Clinton, or they can use the evident wishes of their constituents as a fine excuse to set aside prior pledges, and instead elevate the popular favorite and the candidate of the change Americans claim to crave. <br> A Clinton nomination would be unlikely to literally split the Democratic Party, as it did the Republicans in 1912. But it would echo the unpopularity of the Taft selection and reflect the party's determination to ignore the obvious electoral signal. Roosevelt's popular run for the nomination was not only the product of his monstrous ego, but a symptom of the deep desire within his party for change, and the Republicans suffered for deflecting that desire by choosing Taft. Eschewing the more popular Obama for the relatively unexciting Clinton would deliver a similarly dispiriting blow to the Democrats this year. <br> As James Chace and others have argued, a Roosevelt run and win almost certainly would have been better for the Republican Party in the long run as well: The inspiring Roosevelt, with a track record of reform, persuasively represented the cross-party appeal of Republican progressivism in a way that the competent Taft, with a track record of conservatism, never could. Likewise, the inspiring Obama - who has a more substantive track record than his opponents and flippant commentators appear to believe - would represent liberalism more persuasively and appealingly in a general election than the trimming Clinton, while simultaneously offering the promise of a post-partisan appeal to independent voters. <br> The lessons of history cannot bind us so tightly that we ignore obvious differences between the past and present: While Clinton may have thus far followed the Taft script surprisingly closely, Obama has avoided anything like Roosevelt's talking points; the Bull Moose called his former friend a "puzzlewit" and a "fathead," and the avoidance of low tactics (so far, at least) accounts for a large part of Obama's charm. He seems now to have Roosevelt's major virtues - courage, speaking talent, a progressive record - without his characteristic vices. And as with Roosevelt, it seems clear that if Obama does indeed win a majority of popularly chosen delegates, the party will be best served - both at the polls and in policy formation going forward - by letting the loyalties of pledged partisans yield to the choice of actual voters.By Eric RauchwayIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by John J. DiIulio Jr. .<hr width="50%"> My American politics undergraduate students tease me without mercy for predicting a year ago that the Democratic nomination was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span>'s to lose. (I also predicted that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-mike-huckabee/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Mike Huckabee</span> would outlast all the Republican hopefuls except maybe <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span>. "Professor D's latest lucky guess," they joke.) <br> But when the teasing stops the questions start. "Do you think there is any way that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> can lose?" they ask. I say nothing, and they share self-reassurances: "There's no way for Clinton to beat him nowright?" "C'mon, McCain is way behind him in the polls!" I can no longer stay mum: "Well, Hillary led by double-digits in all but a few polls for over a year, and she's still ahead in Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania." Their somber faces make me wish I had said "Hey, nine straight with Wisconsin; he's in!" or handed out "Yes We Can" buttons. <br> Hillary-backers and College Republicans are not extinct on my campus. But the undergraduate enthusiasm for Obama transcends gender, race, religion, region, income, and party affiliation. I have been teaching American politics for a quarter-century and never have I seen so many students inspired by a candidate. And it's not just an Ivy League or secular-elite university phenomenon. The national polling data prove as much, as do exit poll numbers on young voters. Colleagues who teach at religious and other colleges attest to it too. <br> My students may yet get their wish. But for all that Obama has achieved so far as a hope-inspiring, crowd-swelling candidate with great appeal to young voters, and despite the successive thrashings that Clinton has received since Super Tuesday, she can still win the Democratic nomination. And if Obama does get by Clinton, an even steeper challenge awaits in John McCain. <br> Obama has had some stirring, even brave, things to say: most notably concerning how public education has failed too many low-income children in urban America. Organizationally, the teachers' unions are the Democratic party's throbbing heart. Obama, to his credit, was not on their Valentine's Day list. They will lean against him in several upcoming big-state primaries, and as a super-delegate bloc too. <br> And Clinton can deflate Obama's "change" balloon by relentlessly asking him why he decries the "politics" of the "past 15 years." Does he dislike the Clinton-era presidential politics that expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, widely regarded as the single most successful anti-poverty initiative of that period? Does he mean the bipartisan bills of the 1990s that led to work-based welfare reform? Does he mean the politics of the "past" that yielded the State Children's Health Insurance Program? Or maybe he means rolling back post-1993 expansions in Medicare coverage or college loans or spending on low-income (Title I) schools. <br> Older Democrats, respectful of legislative accomplishments, particularly may not like that Obama often voted "present" as an Illinois legislator, or that his state and federal records seem so thin. Blue collar voters who earn $50,000 a year or less defected from Clinton in the Potomac primaries and again in Wisconsin. But in Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania she may hold voters who can't cut work the way college kids can cut class to attend midday campaign rallies. <br> Indeed, with big Latino turnouts expected in Texas, older working-class Ohio voters sticking to her like rust, and friends in Pennsylvania like Governor Edward Rendell and Philly's popular new mayor Michael Nutter, Clinton can still nab the nomination. Fence-sitting super-delegates would quickly warm to a three-state sweep. <br> Obama and his proxies keep repeating that "party insiders" (aka Clinton-backing super-delegates) should not decide the election against the "will of the people." Obama also favors the Democratic National Committee (it doesn't get any more "inside" than that) denying Clinton the delegates she won when millions of people expressed their will by casting ballots in the Florida and Michigan Democratic primaries. <br> Clinton herself agreed to have Florida and Michigan penalized for moving up the date of their primaries. But that won't keep her from trying to turn Obama's public relations flank and use the "will of the people" against him - while also depicting front-running him as the "establishment" candidate. Listen for her to get at how the people's will squares with deference to national insiders' right to punish the states' insiders for holding their primaries before the former "party bosses" had dictated. Listen for her seconds to echo this: Situational solicitude for the "will of the people" might be expected from politicians drenched in the "past," but from the "change" candidate? With the press now dialing back its year-old Obamamania, the disingenuous whining might just work. <br> Clinton and Obama have not had a serious debate about Iraq. As Obama proclaims, almost as often as he says "change," he opposed from the start giving the president war-making authority. Stipulate that he was right - as most Democrats and a public plurality do - and then ask how, exactly, he reasoned his way to that decision when Colin Powell, John Kerry, and many others with no less information and much greater experience did not? Did he analyze the available prewar data differently, and, if so, how? Unlike Democrats from Joe Biden to Joe Lieberman, why did Obama never offer a serious plan to fix the poorly executed, pre-surge occupation? <br> As pleasing as his pledge is to the party faithful, how can he be so absolute about bringing all troops home by a date certain? How does that year-before-the-act pledge constitute being "as careful" getting out as we were "careless" going in? Conceding that a "new" global politics would be welcome, what wisdom is he seeking with crusty old foreign policy hands like Zbigniew Brzezinski on his national security team? <br> If Clinton does not have this debate with Obama, McCain surely will. There is no reason to trust any pre-October 2008 polls showing Obama beating McCain, including those now showing him beating McCain by a larger margin than Clinton would. Obama would be the second consecutive Democratic standard-bearer ranked the Senate's most liberal member by nonpartisan outlets like National Journal. He leapt leftward as he positioned himself to run for president: a "composite liberal score" of 95.5 out of 100 in 2007, up from 82.5 and a 16th-place finish in 2005. (Clinton's 2007 score was 82.8, and her lifetime score is 79.4.) <br> In a general election, there will be some McCain Democrats. Obama Republicans are more of a question, and independents could be either man's flock. Many general election scenarios remain possible, but, as I reckon it, the only one forecasting a Democratic victory that respects mass-electorate math and state-by-state statistics is a few-point win over McCain that involves McCain getting millions fewer evangelical votes than Bush did in 2004, the Democratic ticket getting as many or more African-Americans as Kerry-Edwards did in 2004, and the sleeping giant Latino vote going decisively against McCain. <br> Other scenarios for a Democratic win against McCain all pretty much assume that the stubborn post-1996 red state-blue state realities will be changed by a change-agent candidate. Obama generated voter enthusiasm even in Republican Kansas, and he may prove to be a party-realigning candidate, but believing so at this stage requires, well, the audacity of hope. <br> If Obama wins any two of the Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania primary trio, then he is virtually certain to be the nominee. One thing is for sure: If he doesn't win, I won't be teasing my sure-to-be down-hearted students.By John DiIulio Jr. 
 This column was written by Jonathan Chait</i><hr width="50%">A couple of years ago, as part of his campaign to reassure conservatives of his ideological reliability, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> sat for an interview with Stephen Moore, a Wall Street Journal editorial writer and fervent advocate of supply-side economics. In the course of the interview, McCain acknowledged that not all his positions were acceptable to the right, but he hinted that further rightward evolution might be possible. "His philosophy is best described as a work in progress," wrote Moore somewhat hopefully. As McCain put it, "I'm going to be honest: I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated." <br> I knew I had heard McCain say something like this before. I dug out an old interview I had conducted with him back in January 2000. At the time, he was just beginning to alienate the Republican establishment by contradicting its most cherished economic orthodoxies. McCain acknowledged that he was moving to the left, and I asked why this evolution was happening so late in his career. Sure enough, I found the same confession: "In the interest of full disclosure," he told me, "I didn't pay nearly the attention to those issues in the past. I was probably a 'supply-sider' based on the fact that I really didn't jump into the issue." <br> At the time, this was one of the most endearing things I had ever heard a politician say. He was candidly confessing his own failure, and he left me feeling that he was bound to move closer to my viewpoint as he studied the issue more carefully. But seeing McCain offer up almost the same line to Moore - and getting the same gratified reaction - was jolting. <br> The prevalent view of McCain is that he is a generally conservative figure with a few maverick stances and an unwavering authenticity. Nearly every liberal editorial board that has made a Republican endorsement has chosen McCain, and nearly all have offered variations on the same theme. "Voters may disagree with his policies, but few doubt his sincerity," editorialized The Boston Globe. "The Arizona senator's conservatism is, if not always to our liking, at least genuine," concluded the Los Angeles Times. This is the consensus: McCain's basically a right-winger, but at least you know where he stands. <br> Actually, this assessment gets McCain almost totally backward. He has diverged wildly and repeatedly from conservative orthodoxy, but he has also reinvented himself so completely that it has become nearly impossible to figure out what he really believes. <br> Political conversions are hardly new or scandalous. McCain's ideological transformation is unusual for two reasons: First, he has moved across the political spectrum not once - like Al Smith or Mitt Romney - but twice. And, second, he refuses to acknowledge his change. <br> McCain ran for his Senate seat as Barry Goldwater's ideological heir, and, with the exception of a couple maverick episodes - his crusades against Big Tobacco and for campaign finance reform - he fulfilled that pledge. But something dramatic changed during, and after, his 2000 presidential campaign. <br> Conservatives complain constantly of McCain's disloyalty, but the full extent of that disloyalty is not widely known. Even though it is in the public record, McCain's voting behavior during Bush's first term is almost never mentioned in the press anymore. Yet McCain's secret history is simply astonishing. It is no exaggeration to say that, during this crucial period, McCain was the most effective advocate of the Democratic agenda in Washington. <br> In health care, McCain co-sponsored, with John Edwards and Ted Kennedy, a patients' bill of rights. He joined Chuck Schumer to sponsor one bill allowing the re-importation of prescription drugs and another permitting wider sale of generic alternatives. All these measures were fiercely contested by the health care industry and, consequently, by Bush and the GOP leadership. On the environment, he sponsored with John Kerry a bill raising automobile fuel-efficiency standards and another bill with Joe Lieberman imposing a cap-and-trade regime on carbon emissions. He was also one of six Republicans to vote against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. <br> McCain teamed with Carl Levin on bills closing down tax shelters, forbidding accounting firms from selling products to the firms they audited, and requiring businesses that gave out stock options as compensation to reveal the cost to their stockholders. These measures were bitterly opposed by big business and faced opposition not only from virtually the whole of the GOP but even from many Democrats as well. <br> McCain voted against the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts. He co-sponsored bills to close the gun-show loophole, expand AmeriCorps, and federalize airport security. All these things set him against nearly the entire Republican Party. <br> Republicans who fought the legislative battles of those days now regard the prospect that McCain could become their party's standard-bearer with incredulity. These figures are stumbling around in rage and disbelief, like Jimmy Stewart in "It's A Wonderful Life" discovering that his beloved hometown has been taken over by Henry Potter. Former Senate Republican Conference chairman Rick Santorum bitterly noted that "almost at every turn, on domestic policy, John McCain was not only against us, but leading the charge on the other side." Former House speaker Dennis Hastert - in what, by his somnolent Midwestern standards, counts as an angry tirade - complained that McCain usually "allied with Democrats." <br> And, indeed, by 2002 the Arizona senator had transformed himself beyond recognition. McCain was not exactly a conventional liberal. He still opposed abortion (though he could muster little passion on the subject). And he remained a hawk (though, at the time, many Democrats were hawks as well). Yet he was also more willing to fight the business lobby than were most moderate - and even many liberal - Democrats. <br> McCain was best described as a progressive - like Teddy Roosevelt, whom he cited constantly. McCain tended to see politics as a contest between the national interest and the selfishness of private agendas, and he favored a role for government in counterbalancing the excesses of organized wealth. In 2002, for instance, he was asked about the Bush administration's view, with regard to the Enron scandal, that "[t]he company had a duty to inform its shareholders and its employees about things that were going on inside the company. That's not a federal government responsibility." McCain thundered in response, "Well, Theodore Roosevelt would not agree with at least that rhetoric....We have had regulatory agencies always to curb the abuses or potential abuses of the capitalist system." <br> Even McCain's most putatively conservative stance, his opposition to pork-barrel spending, fell comfortably within the progressive tradition. Pork-barrel programs by definition are those requested by legislators rather than federal agencies. They do not have to justify their effectiveness and usually serve parochial, rather than national, interests. Opposition to pork is in keeping with the reformer's battle against the machine. <br> It hardly signals any general animus toward government. Pork, after all, represents just a sliver of the federal budget. True movement conservatives hope to scale back the federal government to something approximating its pre-New Deal size. They approve of fighting pork, but so do liberals. This is an issue that divides politicians from non-politicians, not left from right. <br> Roosevelt, as McCain knew full well, abandoned the GOP over what he regarded as its subservience to big business. McCain did not leave his party, but he came close. The Washington Post (at the time) and The Hill (again last year) reported that, in 2001, McCain met with Democratic leaders to ponder a party switch. McCain and his allies deny these accounts, which are obviously devastating to his current prospects, and reporters almost never mention it in their McCain coverage. They also rarely mention how, in 2004, John Kerry wooed him to join his ticket as vice president. The reported half-dozen conversations the two held on the topic are about a half-dozen more than would have been needed if McCain truly was a dyed-in-the-wool conservative Republican. 
 This column was written by Victor Davis Hanson</i><hr width="50%">Just a few months ago, the 2008 presidential contest seemed predetermined. The New York lawyers Rudy Giuliani and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span> were far ahead in their respective party polls. And in the one-on-one match-up, Sen. Clinton was all but declared the foreordained winner a year in advance. <br> But not now. <br> After <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span>'s unexpected surge in Iowa, Bill and Hillary Clinton resorted to chewing him up through their trademark politics of personal destruction. Thanks to Clinton Inc., we now hear almost daily that Obama is inspirational but inexperienced, that he had admitted to drug use, that his middle name is Hussein, that he really was not against the Iraq war, that he consorts with Chicago slumlords, that he spins fairy tales, and that he likes Ronald Reagan. <br> Hillary found her many voices and pulled out all the stops - screeching, accusing, and nearly crying - until finally Bill Clinton himself was unleashed. <br> Long gone was Bill's carefully crafted veneer of ex-president as global humanitarian and bipartisan senior statesmen. Instead, the Bill of old lost his legendary temper at reporters. He shook his finger. He bent the truth. Always he distorted Obama's record. <br> Then a funny thing happened. Hillary's liberal audience jeered at the pro-wrestling tactics of the Clinton tag team. The Democratic referees warned the Clintons to stop the eye gouging. Liberal spectators were bewildered not so much at the familiar Clinton knee-in-the-groin, but that it would be turned on one of their own good guys - and a young, soft-spoken and idealistic African-American at that! <br> Suddenly, "shocked" Democrats cried foul and recalled the tawdry pardons and impeachment - the tainted Bubba of the 1990s, not the rehabilitated William Jefferson Clinton who helps tsunami victims and presides over the Clinton Global Initiative. <br> When the Clintons' return to power crashed into liberal dogmas about race and gender, all sorts of unexpected ironies arose: <br> Bill, as our first "black" president, had encouraged identity politics among a collective black electorate, so why was he angry that African-Americans might vote collectively for Obama? And had any recent ex-president ever regressed to such nasty character assassination on the campaign trail? As a committed feminist, why was Hillary calling for a male bailout by outsourcing her dirty work to her husband? And whom were we now voting for -- Hillary, Bill or some sort of Clinton centaur, her supposedly rational head and torso implanted on his frisky body and legs? <br> The result of all this has been that while Hillary still polls ahead of the surging Obama in most states, in hypothetical general-election polls she runs behind Republican frontrunner, Sen. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span>. <br> End of story? <br> Hardly. In reaction to McCain's own surge and the Republican windfall, the conservative base went ballistic. Soon a Republican civil war broke out over how best to lose the election. <br> Despite McCain's 82-percent career ranking by the American Conservative Union, and his support for balanced budgets, an end to pork-barrel spending and earmarks, strong support for the war, and expressed regret over once supporting the Bush illegal immigration reform package, McCain was branded by the conservative media as a sellout and a near liberal. Not to mention that he was supposedly too old and hot-tempered to be the Republican nominee. The more McCain was discovered not to be a perfect conservative, the more he was accused of not even being a good one. <br> Even stranger, the various Republican candidates began invoking Ronald Reagan's three-decade-old tenure as the new litmus test of the times - apparently to show how moderates like the wayward McCain fell far short of the Gipper's true-blue conservatism. <br> Were conservatives supposed to forget that a maverick Reagan raised some taxes, signed an illegal-alien amnesty bill, expanded government, appointed centrist Supreme Court justices, advocated nuclear disarmament, sold arms to Iran, and pulled out of Lebanon - but to remember only that John McCain was not for the original Bush tax cuts or once supported the administration's offer of a quasi-amnesty? <br> The Democratic cat-fighters are doing their best to give away a once-sure general election, but the Republicans seem to be doing even more to ensure that they forfeit the unexpected gift they've been given. <br> If Hillary Clinton does end up winning her party's nomination, November's vote may hinge on whether moderates and liberals are nauseated enough by the Clintons' brawling and character assassination to cross over and vote for a decorated Republican war hero - that is, if his own flag-waving party doesn't destroy him first.By Victor Davis Hanson Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Noam Scheiber.<br>You hear a lot these days about the chaotic state of the GOP race, which is obviously true insofar as lots of candidates still have a shot at winning. But I don't think it's true in the sense that several candidates have an equal shot of winning. <br> My sense is that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-mitt-romney/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Mitt Romney</span> emerges from Michigan with some pretty clear advantages. For one thing, the first kind of chaos ("type 1") makes it pretty tough for Romney's rivals to raise money, which will, perhaps more than anything else, influence the outcome of the 21 February 5th contests. As this Politico piece notes, the GOP's general fundraising environment was already tough. Type 1 chaos doesn't make it any easier -- both because people are reluctant to bet on a potential loser, and because the bettors end up splitting their money among several candidates. Romney's personal fortune is obviously a huge help here. <br> Second, Romney doesn't need enough money/momentum to win the nomination outright. He just needs enough money mo' to survive a winnowing of the field down to two candidates. Should he make it into a one-on-one scenario with any of his four plausible rivals (I don't consider <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Fred Thompson</span> plausible at this point, though he could prove me wrong Saturday), I suspect the GOP establishment will rally around him with lots of money and support. <br> The reason is that each of these rivals inspires much discomfort in some significant corner of the party establishment. There is deep suspicion of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> among lobbyists (hard feelings over Jack Abramoff), anti-tax people (particularly Abramoff pal Grover Norquist), and the various interest groups (gun-rights, anti-abortion, etc.) whose lives McCain made more difficult with campaign-finance reform. And that's before you get to the evangelical leadership, which hasn't forgotten his "agents of intolerance" diss in 2000. (See this recent Washington Post piece for a complete list of establishment McCain-haters.) <br> Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-mike-huckabee/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Mike Huckabee</span> provokes all sorts of fear and loathing among security hawks and supply-siders (whom he derides as part of the Wall Street-Washington axis), while <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-rudy-giuliani/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Rudy Giuliani</span> obviously has his share of problems with the social-conservative industrial complex. <br> Romney has no such problems. While grassroots evangelicals may have their doubts about him, the elite portion of the movement likes him just fine. Supply-siders seem swayed by his businessman cred while the hawks take comfort in his obsession with doubling Guantanomo and jihadist caliphates. <br> Now run through the practical scenarios: <br> If McCain wins South Carolina, Huckabee and Thompson are finished. (Thompson for obvious reasons, Huckabee because the state is about as ideal demographically as it's going to get for him. If he can't win there, where can he win?) I suspect Rudy is done, too, since he and McCain appeal to similar voters -- security hawks, social moderates -- and McCain will have all the momentum. That means a Romney-McCain playoff. <br> If Huckabee wins South Carolina, Thompson is done and McCain is damaged goods, while Giuliani and (obviously) Huckabee are still alive. With his war chest, Romney should be able to sneak into the top two in Florida, and the person who falls to third -- Giuliani or Huckabee -- is probably done, too. That means a Romney-Huckabee/Giuliani playoff. <br> If Thompson somehow wins South Carolina, Huckabee is done, McCain is seriously damaged, and Romney has a great shot at first or second in Florida, since Thompson will have a steep hill to climb there. <br> The biggest risk to Romney is a fourth-place finish in South Carolina, which raises questions about his viability and sends him limping into Florida. That's probably why you see Romney continuing to run ads there even though he's ostensibly conceded the state. <br> Short of that, I'd say his prospects look pretty good -- or as good as they can in a race this wide open.By Noam ScheiberIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion, and criticism 
 This column was written by the editors of National Review Online.<br>John McCain's aides complain that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-mitt-romney/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Mitt Romney</span> is running a negative campaign. Those same aides have been attacking Romney themselves, but for the most part they can outsource the negativism to their friends in the press -- starting with the Union Leader, a prominent conservative newspaper in New Hampshire that has endorsed him. (We have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitt-romney-for-president/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">endorsed</span> Romney.) <br> The Union Leader's advocacy of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> has become so fierce and lopsided that it has practically transformed itself into a pro-McCain 527 organization. It has not formalized the arrangement, which is lucky for it: If it had, McCain would, on his campaign-finance principles, have to try to shut it down. <br> There is a lot to like about Senator McCain, and we do not fault the Union Leader for endorsing him. We do fault its double standards. The newspaper counts it as a damnable "flip-flop" every time Romney has changed his position or even his emphasis. McCain can switch his views on the very same issues without a disparaging word from the Union Leader. <br> Take taxes. Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, stayed neutral in the battle over President Bush's 2003 tax cuts. We wish he had spoken up in their favor. Senator McCain, alas, was not silent: He voted against the tax cuts, as he had voted against the 2001 tax cuts. He flip-flopped on estate taxes, defending them after having voted to get rid of them. As he geared up to run for president this time around, however, McCain became a born-again supply-sider. Now he wants to keep the tax cuts he originally opposed. <br> The Union Leader has blasted Romney for changing his mind on immigration. It accused him of lying, too, for saying that McCain wanted to let illegal immigrants earn Social Security benefits while working here illegally. But Romney was right. McCain has voted to let illegal immigrants who meet certain conditions become citizens and then receive benefits for their prior illegal work. Few Senate Republicans joined him. <br> We won't throw around the word "lie" quite as recklessly as the Union Leader, but its candidate first argued for an "amnesty" and then spent months claiming that his immigration bill did not amount to one. And if flip-flopping on immigration is a crime, McCain can be charged with it, too. He himself says that he has changed his position on the issue. One of the principal points at issue in the debate over his bill was whether we should try "enforcement first." Since the bill's collapse, McCain has said that he now understands that we should. If that is not a flip-flop, it is only because his claims of a change of heart are insincere. (The liberal newspapers that have endorsed him seem to think so.) <br> Some of Romney's critics allow that all politicians change their positions over time, but say that Romney stands out for changing his very political identity. Supposedly he ran as a moderate technocrat in Massachusetts, but is running as a culture warrior in the Republican primaries. We think both halves of this characterization are overstated, but in any case it is not a critique that John McCain's supporters can credibly make. McCain was a reliably conservative legislator for 15 years. Then he moved left for three years, so much so that liberals began urging him to change parties. Then he zigged back to the right. <br> For us, the most important question about a flip-flop is whether the movement is in the right direction. We are glad that Romney has changed his mind about abortion and McCain has changed his about taxes, although we prefer Romney's open admission that he was wrong in the past to McCain's evasiveness. We hope McCain comes around some more on immigration, and campaign-finance reform, and a lot of other issues -- and we will not attack him as a flip-flopper if he does. Voters who hold flip-flops against politicians, however, should be warned: McCain is every bit as much of one as Romney is, and all the bile of New Hampshire's editorialists cannot change the fact.By the editors of National Review OnlineReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Noam Scheiber.<br>"It's an exciting time to be alive," Bill Clinton exclaims. No seven words would sound more banal in the hands of a lesser politician. Clinton says them with the wonderment of a toddler who just learned to walk -- at least if that toddler could speak in complete paragraphs and had a sponge-like memory for detail. "When I ran for president the average cell phone weighed five pounds," he muses. "Go figure. You know how many sites there were on the Internet? The whole shebang? Fifty. We add 50 every five minutes now." <br> It's an early Saturday morning in West Des Moines, less than two weeks out from the caucuses, and Clinton has lured some 350 Iowans to a local high school. We've ostensibly come to hear the definitive case for Hillary -- and Bill clearly intends to make it. But, then, this crowd would have shown up to hear Clinton make the case for energy-efficient windows. (Which is fortunate, since he'll be doing that, too.) <br> This is a point that's generally lost in the coverage of Clinton. In the cost-benefit analysis that looms over any discussion of the former president these days, there is, on the one hand, the '90s -- that distant period of low unemployment, high-growth, and relative peace and security. This is the asset side of the ledger, the stuff that's supposed to help Hillary. On the liability side is the politician who defined the decade -- the serial triangulator and sometime adulterer. The more voters look past the '90s and focus on Clinton himself, the more problematic his presence is supposed to be. <br> What this analysis misses -- that strange, erratic "Charlie Rose" appearance notwithstanding -- is the sheer pleasure of seeing the big guy work. You'd be hard-pressed to recall a Democratic presidential field richer in talent than the current one. And yet, five minutes into any Clinton riff, you realize you're watching some freakish hybrid of the party's top-tier. There's the policy fluency to rival his wife's: "If you took any country's health care system, and dropped it in America -- Japan, Germany, you just go pick one -- it would cover everyone and cost you $700 billion less than we spend today," he says. There's enough soaring rhetoric to embarrass Barack Obama: "Every other area we're the 'can-do' country ... except in health care, where we say, 'I'm sorry, we're a 'can't-do' country.' ... It's pitiful. I'm tired of hearing it." <br> And, despite those eight years in the White House, the frequent jet-setting and the eye-popping speaking fees, Clinton still oozes enough ordinary-Joe to make John Edwards look like the leisure class. "How many times have you showed up in a new doctor's office and before you can get the first pill or the first examination, you have to sit there and answer five pages of questions about your medical history?" Clinton asks, evoking numerous head-nods. "I had to have a little dental procedure and ... I wanted to scream that I was president and governor, I had very good medical records. I am 60 years old. I do not remember the answer to half of these questions. You've all been there, haven't you?" <br> Clinton's speeches seems like rambling affairs as you listen to them -- the bullet points pile up so quickly it's hard to keep them straight. But they always leave you with something profound. If Obama at his best is a preacher, Edwards a trial lawyer, and Hillary a high-school valedictorian, then Bill is the great balladeer of American politics. Often the take-away is some variation on the following: There's a solution to pretty much any problem if you get deep enough into the details. In practice, this message can leave audiences slightly bewildered, as if they can't believe the answers are so easy, but can't find a flaw in Clinton's logic either. At one point a voter asks a question about Hillary's health-insurance tax credits: What if you make too little money to pay income taxes, but too much to qualify for Medicaid? "The answer is that the tax credit's refundable," Clinton says. "It doesn't matter whether you actually have a net tax bill." The room goes quiet. <br> Watching Clinton in Iowa is like watching Gandalf the White -- a familiar and comforting presence, whose magical powers seem too good to be true, come back from another realm to save the day. Clinton's magical power is to make tradeoffs disappear. Won't universal health-insurance lower the quality of care? No, says Clinton. If you paid doctors according to how well they treated patients, not how many tests they ordered, costs would drop and quality would rise. Won't reining in global warming hurt the economy? Not a chance: "Greening" our buildings will cut power usage by 30 percent and spawn whole new industries. <br> Okay, fine, but what about that other tradeoff? What about change versus experience? Nonsense, Clinton says. "As long as I have known [Hillary], she's been a word-class change agent." We hear about how a young Hillary helped author the report that led to the Individual with Disabilities Education Act. How, as first lady of Arkansas, she imported a parenting-skills program from Israel that had expanded to 25 other states by 1992. Hillary engineered a school-reform plan that, ten years later, moved one expert to label Arkansas schools the most improved in the country. "She did that with no public office," Clinton says. <br> Not that any of this necessarily translates into a single vote. Bill's charisma is distinctly his own -- if anything, the comparison with Hillary diminishes her. Ditto for the recitation of Hillary's accomplishments -- on some level, they only remind you that she was second fiddle. But there is this: Hillary was part of a world-famous political brand -- Clintonism -- which Bill's appearances have a way of rehabilitating. <br> We in the pundit class tend to deride Clintonism as ideologically empty and politically craven. "Clintonism was about winning," Susan Estrich tells Matt Bai in his recent New York Times Magazine essay. There's a kernel of truth to this. (Though, as Bai points out, the philosophy Clinton laid out in a series of speeches in 1991 closely foreshadowed the way he actually governed.) But even if Clintonism was light on ideology and with polls, watching Bill reminds you it was also heavy on good-faith. "It's better to fail struggling in the right direction than to succeed taking the country in the wrong direction," Clinton says near the end of his appearance. Everyone in the audience murmurs in agreement. Then, a little later, he says of George W. Bush: "If Bill Clinton was for it, there must be something wrong with it." More murmurs and some laughs. Sitting in this high school atrium, watching him mesmerize his thirteen-thousandth audience, you can't help feeling that if Bill Clinton is for something -- or someone -- then it must be right.By Noam ScheiberIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by Deroy Murdock.<br>As a cross subliminally looms behind former governor Mike Huckabee in his now famous TV ad, a question occurs: Is this Republican primary about rendering unto God the things that are God's, or rendering unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's? Whether one believes Jesus of Nazareth was a highly influential philosopher or the son of God, nobody knows if the Second Coming (or the First, according to Judaism) is scheduled for 2008, 3008, or another date. <br> What is metaphysically certain is next month's 94th Coming of the IRS's 1040 Form, straight to 135 million U.S. taxpayers. <br> Would America's presidential candidates please address this? <br> The God-O-Rama that the Republican presidential campaign has become has eclipsed the GOP's signature issue: Taxes. <br> Assuming life still matters here on Earth, not just in the hereafter, it might be useful before balloting begins to evaluate the top three GOP candidates and their executive tax records. <br> "There's a lot of support for a tax at the wholesale level for tobacco. And that's fine with me," former governor Huckabee reassured state legislators in 2003. "Others have suggested a surcharge on the income tax. That's acceptable. I'm fine with that. Others had suggested perhaps a sales tax. That's fine. Yet others have suggested a hybrid that would collect some monies from any one or a combination of those various ideas and, if that's the plan that the House and Senate agree upon, then you will have nothing but my profound thanks." <br> Thanks to Huckabee's hikes on sales, gasoline, cigarette, and other levies, Arkansas's average tax burden (revenue as a proportion of personal income) expanded 47 percent on his watch. Thus, one wonders how hard President Huckabee would push his proposal to replace today's income tax with the "FAIR" federal sales tax. <br> "Of the 30 states to raise fees this year, only nine are bringing in $100 million or more from those fee hikes," the Boston Globe's Rick Klein wrote July 24, 2003. "Massachusetts reported $501.5 million in fee hikes." As the Lowell Sun explained that February 28, "Romney's fiscal 2004 budget calls for increasing 57 fees and creating 33 new ones" that "would hit a broad spectrum of people, including the blind, mentally retarded, veterans, drivers, hunters, lawyers, boaters, skaters, inmates, developers, aircraft owners, and golfers." Romney raised fees on IDs for blind people, deed registrations, driving permits, marriage licenses, and more. <br> Romney also sought revenue by closing $283 million in "tax loopholes." Put another way, he slipped nooses around previously untaxed activities. This included retroactive new taxes on incomes, sales revenue, severance pay, and nonqualified pensions for individuals who work or trade in Massachusetts but live elsewhere, such as New Hampshire. In their first year alone, these new taxes cost out-of-state residents some $36 million. <br> Romney did arrange a two-day, tax-free shopping holiday, property-tax relief for seniors, and accelerated a $275 million capital-gains tax rebate. <br> Romney also tried to cut the state income tax from 5.3 percent to 5, but that effort foundered. His health-insurance mandate, however, has had a lasting effect. As a Massachusetts state website warns: "If you do not have health insurance, you will face a stiff tax penalty." Next year's fine will be $219 for individuals and $295 per uninsured worker at companies with at least 11 employees. Interestingly, Romney did not increase the co-pay for subsidized abortions, still just $50. <br> Under Romney, the Tax Foundation's ranking of Massachusetts's business friendliness slid from 26th to 37th in America. Meanwhile, Massachusetts's overall tax burden swelled 10.8 percent, congruent with Romney's "C" on Cato's gubernatorial report card. <br> Giuliani reduced taxes $9.8 billion, lowering Gotham's overall tax burden 17 percent. He did not sign one tax cut, then move on. Instead, he curbed taxes 23 times throughout his tenure, slashing levies on wages, business income, hotel rooms, and more. Proving that tax cuts are pro-family, a mom and dad making $50,000 saw their taxes fall 23.7 percent, freeing funds to nurture their two children. Giuliani also curbed the marriage penalty for filing couples. Asked if he planned to hike taxes after September 11, Giuliani slammed this as "a dumb, stupid, idiotic, and moronic thing to do." <br> Giuliani wants to make President Bush's tax cuts permanent, "give the death tax the death penalty," and cut the corporate tax from 35 percent to 25. Among major economies, only Japan's corporate tax is higher. This dramatically would increase America's global competitiveness. <br> Giuliani recently proposed an optional, one-page tax form. "O.K.," he admitted. "The print may be a little small." Not bad, but he should advocate an optional, flat tax. Americans who like the 67,204-page tax code can keep it. Others may volunteer for, say, a 17 percent flat tax. Telling New Hampshire voters, "It's your tax. It's your choice" likely would buoy Giuliani's stock among the Granite State's "Live Free or Die" electorate. <br> As voters learn that Huckabee -- for all his poise and piety -- rarely met a tax he didn't like, and Romney rarely met a fee he didn't hike, Republicans eager for the GOP to revitalize its limited government, low-tax roots may elevate Rudolph W. Giuliani to supply-sider in chief.By Deroy MurdockReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Whitney Blake.<br>The House and Senate squeezed through last-minute bills in a marathon session last week akin to the final exams period some members' college-aged children just muddled through. A bleary-eyed, sleep deprived House and Senate finally emerged with the passage of some key pieces of legislation on energy, the Iraq war, the alternative minimum tax, children's health insurance, and a massive omnibus spending bill. In the end, Republicans proved to be the more astute bunch, pushing through Bush's lame duck agenda despite their minority status. <br> With Democrats emerging victorious just a year ago in the 2006 midterm elections claiming a mandate to drive the country in a new direction, one would have hardly predicted headlines like "Bush, GOP prevail in host of Hill issues" in the Associated Press, "Dems cave on spending" in the Hill, and the Politico's "Liberals lose bigtime in budget battle." <br> Leading mainstream publications agreed that Democrats had surrendered to Republican demands, and the left's base was utterly furious at the outcomes. In reaction to the $70 billion Iraq and Afghanistan troop funding vote, comments such as, "You are kidding yourself if you think the Democratic Party stands for anything - clearly they do not - This is an outrage," were posted on Daily Kos. Huffington Post entries included, "Democrats lose evey [sic] time becuase [sic] they are a pack of spineless cowards". <br> Even Republicans were surprised with the outcome. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell remarked, "If we had been having this press conference last January and I had suggested that a Republican minority in Congress would be able to meet the president's top line, you all would have laughed at me." <br> "We couldn't have scripted this to work out better for Republicans they conceded almost every issue," said Rep. Paul Ryan, (R-WI). <br> Not only did Democrats eventually meet Bush's required $933 billion appropriations spending level, they also capitulated on unconditional funding for the troops, an energy plan without corporate taxes, a one-year patch to the alternative minimum tax without additional taxes (a $50 billion violation of Democrats' pay-as-you-go principles), and a straight extension of SCHIP without a large expansion. <br> At first, the record is baffling, but the explanation for Republican success is simple. Not only was superior "strategery" involved on the part of the minority, to borrow a word from Bush's lexicon, but equally important was Democrats' miscalculations. <br> Republicans decided early on to stick together on issues such as taxes and Iraq, said one senior Republican aide. Democrats were much more fractured. One Washington Post headline declared, "Democrats Blaming Each Other for Failures." The article cited House Democrats accusing their Senate counterparts of selling out and folding. In December 2006, Reid said in an interview, "legislation is the art of compromise and consensus building and I'm going to compromise." House Democrats didn't embrace this theme. <br> They either failed to realize or didn't want to realize that anything they proposed still had to meet approval in the Senate, where compromise and coalition building are unavoidable, with 60 votes required to move any legislation through. "It took some people 11 months to figure this out," said one senior Republican aide. <br> From the beginning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set up a structure that didn't emphasize debate and hearings, said Republican California Rep. Kevin McCarthy. The controversial spots were never worked out in the far-left appeasing bills that passed through the House. <br> Even after the Senate voted a resounding 88 to 5 in favor of an AMT patch without offsets in the beginning of December, the House passed another version, attached more taxes to make up for the lost revenue, and sent it back to the Senate. The Senate had to vote three times just to show the House Democrats that it did not have the required 60 votes to pass a patch with offsets. <br> Democrats were not only divided, they also misjudged the public's perception. The "general aversion to tax hikes" worked to the Republicans' advantage, and the overall success of the war in Iraq also played a key factor, said the senior Republican aide. <br> Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid commented right before the recess, "I share the frustration of the American people who want to see real change." But Republicans argue Reid's idea of change is not in line with that of most Americans. <br> They "got the wrong message from the election," which wasn't one of a "repudiation of conservative values," said Ryan. It was a call for "clean and transparent government." <br> They "overreached" after the honeymoon period and "frittered away" high expectations "by taking a sharp turn to the left," he added. <br> A CNN/USA Today poll taken back in May and June revealed that 57 percent of Americans favored making permanent the Bush tax cuts, while 37 percent wanted to repeal the temporary cuts. On the broader fiscal topics of taxes, government spending, and regulations for businesses, 41 percent of Americans consider themselves "conservative," 43 percent "moderate," and just 12 percent "liberal," according to a Rasmussen Reports study released about a month ago. <br> Some Republicans admit Democrats could have gotten more of what they wanted had they played their cards right. Democrats had a "missed opportunity," said McCarthy, who has experience in a closely divided legislature as a former Republican floor leader in the California State Assembly. <br> The majority could have still put forth very partisan bills at the outset, but "come back to where common ground was," said McCarthy. Democrats would have "enjoyed much more success" in the center, said Ryan. <br> Some Republicans were reportedly amenable to partial offsets to the AMT. Perhaps if Democrats had not held onto appropriations spending $23 billion above Bush's request for so long, there would have been more time left to avoid axing the entire difference. Or if taxes were not as high as $22 billion for energy companies in the Democrats' version of the energy bill, some taxes may have been part of the compromise. <br> But Democrats "were more interested in making a point than making law," said Don Stewart, communications director for Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. It didn't get them very far: They essentially handed Republicans their agenda on a platter at the eleventh hour to prevent a government shutdown. <br> In the end, Democrats were "driven by the clock and not by the product of what's created," McCarthy added. Serious negotiations could have occurred much earlier in the year, instead of holding out stubbornly until the end of the session when all eyes were on several major unresolved bills. Sensible bipartisan compromises in piecemeal over the year look much more authoritative, organized, and productive than the harried disarray that unfolded in the past month. <br> Incidentally, according to McConnell, the only truly bipartisan piece of legislation where genuine compromise was part of the equation was ethics reform, signed into law in September. But even Democrats, who heralded the landmark reforms, took advantage of the loopholes in the bill to insert about 300 air dropped earmarks which had not been taken up by either the House or Senate on the floor or as part of a vote. <br> Now, with the Democrats' base up in arms, the Democrats' infighting publicly aired, and the minority declaring victory, backed up by the mainstream media no less, the bills don't even appear bipartisan. Democrats came out with the short end of the stick, even though the odds were clearly in their favor after the midterm elections. <br> While Hillary is busy wrapping up universal health care, and "bring troops home" presents for potential voters, Democrats won't be able to deliver these or any other promised initiatives this Christmas season.By Whitney Blake 
 This column was written by the editors of The Nation.<br>It has been more than a year since the first group of Democratic hopefuls announced their candidacy for president of the United States. Seventeen debates or forums have been staged, and more than $150 million has been spent on advertising, polling and other campaign expenses. Pundits have pronounced their conventional wisdom, so easily reversed, on who is most "electable," "presidential" or "inevitable." Celebrities and surrogates have rung their appeals, and the deforming machinery of electoral money and math has whirled into place. And yet despite all this, something remarkable, almost magical in its resilience, will take place on January 3. Thousands of neighbors will gather in schools, churches and public libraries across Iowa to caucus. It's an imperfect, curious system -- one that privileges the indirect democracy of delegates and the momentary passions of a state that is, demographically speaking, unrepresentative of America. Nonetheless, during the evening hours, when candidates and campaign staff are relegated to the sidelines, the circus of democracy will be suspended and something approaching actual democratic deliberation will unfold. But who should the voters of Iowa -- and then New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and the states that follow in this crowded primary season -- select as the Democratic Party's standard-bearer? <br> This is not an easy question to address. To put this election in context, it is the first time since 1928 that a sitting president or vice president has been absent from the field. The calamitous administration of George W. Bush has slashed and burned its way through Iraq, our Constitution and the remnants of the social safety net. It has pursued imperial aggression, lethal incompetence and crony capitalism as if they constitute official policy, leaving the next president with a multitude of crises, from Iraq to New Orleans to Guantnamo Bay. <br> But to take a page from the free-market gospel: where there is crisis, there is opportunity. Indeed, throughout this uncommonly long election cycle, beyond-the-Beltway progressives have driven their issues to the forefront of the Democratic agenda. The leading candidates share positions that were considered political suicide as recently as 2004, and topics once shunted aside, like global warming, are of central importance. Withdrawal from Iraq, which John Kerry couldn't bring himself to call for, is embraced by all the current candidates, albeit on varying timetables. Unfettered free trade, a hallmark of the Clinton administration, is now viewed by most Democrats as an untenable position. Health care for all, an idea that many thought would doom Hillary Clinton's candidacy, is a mainstream proposition. And it is not just these issues that have taken center stage but the core progressive values they represent: diplomacy over militarism, workers' rights, the responsibility of government to see that social needs are met. Meanwhile, the Republican campaign has seemingly taken place in an alternate reality, with GOP candidates competing to win the title of Most Likely to Nuke Iran and Most Xenophobic. <br> With Democrats running left and Republicans slouching right, we believe this election presents a historic opportunity to precipitate a progressive realignment. There is ferment in the air, a yearning for change and for a resuscitation of America's most inspired dreams of justice and equality. The kindling is in place, but the right spark has not yet been struck. There is a danger that many of this campaign's most contentious issues could find resolution in policies even more malign than the status quo. The question of immigration reform combined with the rhetoric of economic populism could lead to a jingoistic backlash against the most vulnerable workers in America. The war in Iraq could slide into a Democratic-led occupation with no end in sight; worse, it could spill over into Iran. And then there are the issues, already neglected, that could fade from view: a progressive tax policy that would eliminate breaks for corporations and the mega-rich; public investment in schools and urban infrastructure; an end to the "war on drugs" and a reorientation of our criminal justice system; a plan to address media consolidation; and a robust agenda for urban renewal. <br> What is needed most now is not a candidate but a movement to surround that candidate, to brace his or her resolve, to press for the best platform and to hold him or her accountable for implementing it if elected. For this reason, we choose not to endorse a candidate for president at this time but rather to call for the rise of a broadly based small-d democratic movement, as only such a movement can create the space necessary to realize this moment's full potential. Nonetheless, we see differences among the candidates that reflect their relative willingness and ability to foster this movement and advance its agenda. <br> In his stands on the issues, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-dennis-kucinich/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Dennis Kucinich</span> comes closest to embodying the ideals of this magazine. He has been a forceful critic of the Bush administration, opposing the Patriot Act and spearheading the motion to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney. He is the only candidate to have voted against the Iraq War in 2003 and has voted against funding it ever since. Of all the serious candidates, only he and Governor <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-bill-richardson/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Bill Richardson</span> propose a full and immediate withdrawal from Iraq. And only Kucinich's plan sets aside funds for reparations. Moreover, Kucinich has used his presidential campaigns to champion issues like cutting the military budget and abolishing nuclear weapons; universal, single-payer healthcare; campaign finance reform; same-sex marriage and an end to the death penalty and the war on drugs. A vote for him would be a principled one. <br> But for reasons that have to do with the corrupting influence of money and media on national elections as well as with his campaign's shortcomings -- such as its failure to organize a grassroots base of donors and web activists -- a democratic mass movement has not coalesced around Kucinich's run for president. The progressive vision is there, but the strategy necessary to win and then govern is lacking. In most cases, the rules of the Iowa caucus require that a candidate reach 15 percent of the vote to achieve "viability"; supporters of candidates who fail to do so can choose another candidate. Simply put, many Iowans will soon face a question that the rest of us may have to answer later: if not Dennis, then who? 
 This column was written by the editors of National Review Online.<br>Many conservatives are finding it difficult to pick a presidential candidate. Each of the men running for the Republican nomination has strengths, and none has everything - all the traits, all the positions - we are looking for. Equally conservative analysts can reach, and have reached, different judgments in this matter. There are fine conservatives supporting each of these Republicans. <br> Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate. In our judgment, that candidate is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-mitt-romney/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Mitt Romney</span>, the former governor of Massachusetts. Unlike some other candidates in the race, Romney is a full-spectrum conservative: a supporter of free-market economics and limited government, moral causes such as the right to life and the preservation of marriage, and a foreign policy based on the national interest. While he has not talked much about the importance of resisting ethnic balkanization - none of the major candidates has - he supports enforcing the immigration laws and opposes amnesty. Those are important steps in the right direction. <br> Uniting the conservative coalition is not enough to win a presidential election, but it is a prerequisite for building on that coalition. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-rudy-giuliani/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Rudolph Giuliani</span> did extraordinary work as mayor of New York and was inspirational on 9/11. But he and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-mike-huckabee/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Mike Huckabee</span> would pull apart the coalition from opposite ends: Giuliani alienating the social conservatives, and Huckabee the economic (and foreign-policy) conservatives. A Republican party that abandoned either limited government or moral standards would be much diminished in the service it could give the country. <br> Two other major candidates would be able to keep the coalition together, but have drawbacks of their own. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain</span> is not as conservative as Romney. He sponsored and still champions a campaign-finance law that impinged on fundamental rights of political speech; he voted against the Bush tax cuts; he supported this year's amnesty bill, although he now says he understands the need to control the border before doing anything else. <br> Despite all that and more, he is a hero with a record that is far more good than bad. He has been a strong and farsighted supporter of the Iraq War, and, in a trying political season for him, he has preserved and even enhanced his reputation for dignity and seriousness. There would be worse nominees for the GOP (see above). But McCain ran an ineffectual campaign for most of the year and is still paying for it. <br> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-fred-thompson/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Fred Thompson</span> is as conservative as Romney, and has distinguished himself with serious proposals on Social Security, immigration, and defense. But Thompson has never run any large enterprise - and he has not run his campaign well, either. Conservatives were excited this spring to hear that he might enter the race, but have been disappointed by the reality. He has been fading in crucial early states. He has not yet passed the threshold test of establishing for voters that he truly wants to be president. <br> Romney is an intelligent, articulate, and accomplished former businessman and governor. At a time when voters yearn for competence and have soured on Washington because too often the Bush administration has not demonstrated it, Romney offers proven executive skill. He has demonstrated it in everything he has done in his professional life, and his tightly organized, disciplined campaign is no exception. He himself has shown impressive focus and energy. <br> It is true that he has less foreign-policy experience than Thompson and (especially) McCain, but he has more executive experience than both. Since almost all of the candidates have the same foreign-policy principles, what matters most is which candidate has the skills to execute that vision. <br> Like any Republican, he would have an uphill climb next fall. But he would be able to offer a persuasive outsider's critique of Washington. His conservative accomplishments as governor showed that he can work with, and resist, a Democratic legislature. He knows that not every feature of the health-care plan he enacted in Massachusetts should be replicated nationally, but he can also speak with more authority than any of the other Republican candidates about this pressing issue. He would also have credibility on the economy, given his success as a businessman and a manager of the Olympics. <br> Some conservatives question his sincerity. It is true that he has reversed some of his positions. But we should be careful not to overstate how much he has changed. In 1994, when he tried to unseat Ted Kennedy, he ran against higher taxes and government-run health care, and for school choice, a balanced budget amendment, welfare reform, and "tougher measures to stop illegal immigration." He was no Rockefeller Republican even then. <br> We believe that Romney is a natural ally of social conservatives. He speaks often about the toll of fatherlessness in this country. He may not have thought deeply about the political dimensions of social issues until, as governor, he was confronted with the cutting edge of social liberalism. No other Republican governor had to deal with both human cloning and court-imposed same-sex marriage. He was on the right side of both issues, and those battles seem to have made him see the stakes of a broad range of public-policy issues more clearly. He will work to put abortion on a path to extinction. Whatever the process by which he got to where he is on marriage, judges, and life, we're glad he is now on our side - and we trust him to stay there. <br> He still has some convincing to do with other conservatives. Romney has been plagued by the sense that his is a passionless, paint-by-the-numbers conservatism. If he is to win the nomination, he will have to show more of the kind of emotion and resolve he demonstrated in his College Station "Faith in America" speech. <br> For some people, Romney's Mormonism is still a barrier. But we are not electing a pastor. The notion that he will somehow be controlled by Salt Lake City or engaged in evangelism for his church is outlandish. He deserves to be judged on his considerable merits as a potential president. As he argued in his College Station speech, his faith informs his values, which he has demonstrated in both the private and public sectors. In none of these cases have any specific doctrines of his church affected the quality of his leadership. Romney is an exemplary family man and a patriot whose character matches the high office to which he aspires. <br> More than the other primary candidates, Romney has President Bush's virtues and avoids his flaws. His moral positions, and his instincts on taxes and foreign policy, are the same. But he is less inclined to federal activism, less tolerant of overspending, better able to defend conservative positions in debate, and more likely to demand performance from his subordinates. A winning combination, by our lights. In this most fluid and unpredictable Republican field, we vote for Mitt Romney.Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by the editors of the National Review Online.<br>Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid return to work this week. But the Congress they lead is already a failure, no matter what they now do. <br> When they took power, they had three major goals: to end the war in Iraq, cripple this presidency, and pave the way for a Democratic sweep next year. They have failed in all three respects. <br> Even with public opinion behind them, they were unable to force a withdrawal from Iraq. Instead, our military got the time it needed to start making progress on the ground. The Democrats' allies tried to discredit Gen. David Petraeus. Now the Democrats are being forced to concede that the surge is working. Jack Murtha, the leader of the House withdrawal caucus, is the latest to make that admission. <br> For a lame duck, President Bush has run rings around the Congress. He has been able to maintain his highest-priority policy - the war - which was the highest priority of his opponents to change. He has gotten a new attorney general confirmed. Along with congressional Republicans, he has blocked the Democrats from achieving the vast majority of their domestic agenda. The unions, in particular, haven't gotten their payoff. They want to be able to organize companies without going to the trouble of having employees vote by secret ballot. Senate Republicans kept them from getting their wish. Thanks to market forces and popular sentiment, union membership and power will continue to decline. <br> The Democrats could have a sweep in 2008, but if they do it will not be because of anything this Congress or its leaders did. The congressional majority has inflicted very little political damage on the Republicans, either through show trials or through legislation. They had some success, to be sure, in portraying Republicans as opposed to children's health care; but by next November that debate will have widened into an argument about the future of American health care, which was unavoidable anyway and in which the Democrats may be overreaching. <br> Meanwhile, the Democratic Congress has, through its inability to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax, even for a year, ensured that taxpayers will receive their refunds late. Republican politicians may not always be as sharp as we would like, but surely they have the wit to channel public blame where it belongs. <br> We do not mean to deny that Democratic control of Congress has had consequences. It has slowed the progress of free trade and the confirmation of judges, for example. But when Congress changes hands, the new majority typically achieves its greatest victories in its first term. The Republican Congress never enacted anything more revolutionary than the welfare reform it passed in its second year. This Congress is on track to do nothing similar. The left-wing "netroots" seem to be disappointed with Reid and Pelosi, as they should be. This alliance should prove to be as happy as it is effective.By the editors of National Review OnlineReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Drew Westen.<br>From "Blinded by the Right," in which he spoke of his experiences as a conservative "hit man," to his work with Media Matters, David Brock has made us all aware of just how easy it is for those on the right to refract data through the prism of radical conservatism and watch it spread like wildfire from The Drudge Report and The American Spectator to the most cherished outlets of the "liberal media." Every time the media (and even Democratic leaders) repeat the well-crafted, market-tested phrases constructed by a multi-billion dollar conservative messaging infrastructure - from "the war on terror" to "support our troops" - they are putting political capital into the piggybank of the Republican Party. (In case it needs repeating: "War on terror" conflates the battle against al Qaeda and other Islamic terrorist groups with the Iraq War; "support our troops" conflates concern for our men and women in uniform with support of their deployment to Iraq, which now seem to be logical opposites, although Democrats' acquiescence to the language of "support our troops" has deterred them from making that case at every turn.) <br> A recent - and particularly insidious - case in point is an idea that has spread from right-wing pundits to Democratic strategists and prestigious media outlets: The notion of an unruly "liberal base" that is pulling the Democratic Party hopelessly away from mainstream America. While channel-surfing last month, I watched Tucker Carlson earnestly advise Democrats on the dangers that will befall them if they pay too much heed to the liberal rabble, as manifested by bloggers. But the more Democrats fall prey to the myth of the liberal base, the more they undercut the progressive values that unite Americans from the center to the left. And in so doing, they also unwittingly participate in a conservative branding campaign against the work of some of their most effective advocates. <br> For example, along with VoteVets, MoveOn.org has produced some of the most powerful television ads over the last several years in support of progressive positions, and they happened to have been well ahead of the curve in opposing two of the most egregious political acts in modern American history, the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the rush to war in Iraq. Yet a campaign by the right designed to deflect attention from the fiasco in Iraq had senators scrambling to censure the architects of an ill-advised title of a newspaper ad-when they had never censured the architects of the disastrous war itself. <br> When Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell made outrageous statements that make MoveOn's headline seem milquetoast by comparison (e.g., about gays and the ACLU causing everything from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina), the Republicans never considered censuring them. They simply waited until the storm blew over (if there even was a storm) and continued their weekly White House meetings with them. But it didn't take long for a flood of Republican officials and candidates (such as presidential contender Fred Thompson) to call for all Democratic candidates to return any money ever donated to them by the tainted group. <br> Conservatives have good reason to want to brand MoveOn as part of the out-of-touch (and now blog-infested) liberal elite: As Fox News's Major Garrett wrote: <br> Answer: MoveOn. <br> And it isn't even close. <br> In the last two election cycles, MoveOn.org Political Action Committee spent more than $58 million in pro-Democrat political advocacy, according to Federal Election Commission records. <br> I should be clear that I do not write this as an apologist for the "radical left," wherever they may be hiding. I haven't really seen many of them since my days in college in the late 1970s. Most Democrats I know have no idea that Tom Franks' "What's the Matter with Kansas?" is probably the most elegant description of Karl Marx's concept of "false consciousness" written since Marx's early writings. No one talks anymore about the "military-industrial complex" (although radicals like Dwight D. Eisenhower did). I would certainly not deny that one can find some "angry young men" and rebels without a cause (or rebels with a cause, probably displaced from their relationships with their fathers) among the ranks of liberal bloggers. On the other hand, it isn't hard to find angry young, middle-aged, and old men among devotees of Rush Limbaugh, either. <br> But even if I wanted to write as an apologist for the unruly, radical, left-wing "base" of the Democratic Party, I would be a poor messenger for that apology. I have too much equity in my home, and appreciate too much both the medical discoveries and technological wonders that only entrepreneurship can produce. I wouldn't be a credible spokesman for any Lenin other than John. As a progressive son of the South, I also know what red clay looks like. And as far as I know, I was the only person to speak this year at the annual conventions of both the Democratic Leadership Council and the Yearly Kos - rendering me, I suppose, the only progressive ever to triangulate in his pajamas. <br> The reality is that I can't find either the moral or pragmatic grounds from which to condemn people who care about the most fundamental values that lie at the heart of contemporary progressive politics: That tolerance is a virtue, not a sign of moral decline; that compassion is a strength, not a weakness; that national security, economic security for our families (what Roosevelt called "freedom from want"), and protection of the liberties generations of Americans have fought and died for are the first and most important jobs of government; that all Americans, regardless of their wealth, status, skin color, or sexual orientation, are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect and to have a fair chance at fulfilling their hopes and aspirations; that the open-minded pursuit of knowledge, the humble acknowledgement of what we don't know, and the ability to live with the paradox that we can hold beliefs strongly but must tolerate others who hold opposing views are the essence of good citizenship, not bad character; that we have an obligation to leave to our children a nation - including our land, our water, our infrastructure, our standing in the world, our Constitution - stronger, richer, and healthier than the country our parents and grandparents left us; and that opportunity for every member of our community is all of our responsibility, just as personal responsibility is an obligation of every member of our community. <br> Those are the values of the "liberal base." They are also the values of the progressive centrists I know. And those are precisely the values that are threatened when well-meaning journalists, pundits, or progressives succumb to the conservative spin-machine's branding of the out-of-control liberal base. <br> Consider a front-page news story published recently in The New York Times. The article provides an index of just how thoroughly the myth of the liberal basis has spread into the "liberal media," and how even our most prestigious newspapers can find themselves, if unwittingly, pushing right-wing propaganda. The article, entitled "Liberal Base Proves Trying to Democrats," described a situation faced by openly gay Congressman Barney Frank. Frank was taking some heat from members of the transgendered and transsexual communities for not including them in the Employment and Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit discrimination in the workplace against gays and lesbians but does not include the phrase "gender identity" or explicitly protect the "T" in "LGBT." Why not? Because it's taken years to reach the point where most Americans believe gay people shouldn't be discriminated against on the job. Martin Luther King focused on voting rights first and put off challenging anti-miscegenation laws (forbidding "mixing of the races") with his comment, "I want to be a white man's brother, not his brother-in-law." <br> The problem with the Times article lay in the way the author used this case as if it were a prototypic example of the problem Democrats have with their unruly liberal base, so far outside the mainstream of American society that its agenda includes transsexual bank tellers and an end to the Iraq War. <br> Wait, what was that juxtaposition? <br> Watch how the Times piece pivots from Frank's plight with the transsexuals to the party's plight with the anti-war "contingent" of the electorate: <br> The tension between Democratic lawmakers and their base has been most visible on the Iraq war, where the insistence by some of the most outspoken antiwar groups on setting hard deadlines for the withdrawal of American troops has often handcuffed Senate Democrats trying to reach a bipartisan deal on legislation to change the war strategy. <br> The frustration with both the president's policies in Iraq and the failure of the Democratic leadership to take on the president with more than rhetoric and symbolic votes is not a conflict between the leadership in Congress and the liberal base. It is a conflict between the Congress and the people who elected them. You don't have to cut off funding of the war to end the war. Just make the president pay for it: Demand that he show the courage (and use that word, with all its military overtones) to tell us whose taxes the Bush tax bill will increase to pay for this war, because right now it is being paid for by our children and grandchildren. The president wants to be the tax and spend liberal without the tax part? Demand that he put his money where his mouth is, and the war will be over faster than you can say "read my lips." <br> As long as progressives and Democrats do not brand themselves effectively, they will succumb to the branding of the right, and they will fall into traps conservatives and Republicans lay for them. Voters will continue to hear tales of a wild-haired anti-war fringe pulling the Democrats hopelessly to the left. Like, say, Jim Webb. Now there's a hippie in Birkenstocks. <br> The only antidote to conservative branding is progressive branding. It is time to articulate a progressive vision.If you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by Larry Kudlow.<br>An energetic and forceful <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-fred-thompson/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Fred Thompson</span> sat down with me last week on "Kudlow and Company" to talk politics and the economy. The former Tennessee senator was in good form - more animated than I've seen him, and definitely a different person than the one I interviewed six months ago. <br> I asked him about Dick Armey, the former Republican House majority leader. Armey recently predicted that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span> will be the next president, reasoning that the GOP has departed from the first principles of limited government and lower taxes. Armey said budget overspending and the proliferating corruption of earmarks are what led to the landslide defeat of Republicans a year ago. To date, Dick Armey is unimpressed with the circa 2007 GOP message. <br> And Thompson agreed. He said, "If we don't tend to business we are going to be in big trouble. Pendulum's swinging against us. We are down in the polls. Independents are leaning the other way [where they] used to lean with us. So we've got to . . . adhere to the principles that made us a great party and a great nation." <br> That was a strong dose of honesty and self-examination. Good for Fred Thompson. <br> Speaking of limited government and budget overspending, I asked if a President Thompson would veto the $300 billion earmark-pocked pork-barrel farm bill now before Congress. He called this legislation "disgraceful," noted that it wouldn't even help small family farms, and that it would block the expansion of world free trade. <br> When I asked him about Warren Buffett, the famous investor billionaire, Thompson turned up the heat. In testimony before the Senate last week, Buffett advocated a whole series of tax hikes, such as an increase in the death tax, higher capital gains and dividend taxes, and more taxes on private partnerships, hedge funds, and private-equity buyout firms. Thompson labeled this policy dead wrong. He said Buffett is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party. He argued that the wealth of the government is the not the same thing as the wealth of nations, and that history proves lower tax rates promote economic growth. <br> And he said Hillary Clinton and the other Democratic candidates are blind to all this. He noted that the top 5 percent of income earners now pay 60 percent of all tax collections; that the tax code is progressive enough; that there's plenty of economic mobility in the country; that for those who have fallen behind, the problem is poor education, not tax rates; and that America is the freest, most prosperous, most powerful nation in the history of the world. <br> We talked about his controversial Social Security reform plan that would slow down future benefits by indexing them to inflation rather than wages, while providing for add-on private savings accounts with a government match, much like the system for 401(k)s. <br> Lower benefits? Isn't that the proverbial third-rail of politics? Not according to Mr. Thompson. He said big problems ought to be tackled: "If you can't do the right thing, say what you believe and what everybody really basically knows, why do it? Why bother? Life is too short for the aggravation." <br> Thompson wants to tell the truth about Social Security and force everyone else in the game to respond. This issue is a real character-building definer for Fred Thompson. No one else on the campaign trail, in either party, is willing to discuss Social Security in such frank terms. <br> But that's the revitalized Fred Thompson. The more I challenged him, the more animated he became. He simply refused to stand down. <br> Some people say Thompson doesn't have the fire in his belly to go the distance. I don't think that's true. And I'm not picking or endorsing any candidates here. But Thompson has an honest, clear, straightforward message of economic freedom and problem solving. <br> Then I brought up the CNBC/Wall Street Journal debate of a few weeks ago, when Thompson slammed <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-rudy-giuliani/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Rudy Giuliani</span>. I asked if he intended to continue to pound Giuliani on the campaign trail. He said, "I haven't pounded all day." I asked, What about yesterday? He said, "Well, we're pointing out some policy differences. [Giuliani] believes in federal funding for abortion. He went to court to stop our bill outlawing sanctuary cities. He's never met a gun-control bill he didn't like." <br> A sharp-edged Fred Thompson. <br> Can he win? His campaign strategists told me they are pouring tons of money into Iowa advertising. They see a strong opportunity for a Thompson surge in the state, undermining <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-mitt-romney/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Mitt Romney</span> and inflicting damage on Giuliani. Walking off the set, Thompson told me this election will be about peace and prosperity. And he intends to fight hard.By Larry KudlowReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Ben Crair.<br>Last October, Dr. Jack Ludmir, the head of obstetrics and gynecology at Pennsylvania Hospital, oversaw the emergency-room treatment of a young woman who was seven months pregnant, hypertensive, and convulsing. Although her condition was, according to Ludmir, "rarely seen in the United States," his team diagnosed it quickly: She was suffering from eclampsia, a severe pregnancy-related disorder that can lead to premature birth, seizure, stroke, even death. <br> In this country, the condition is usually caught in its early stage known as pre-eclampsia, which can often be managed with prenatal care; but, with the mother already in the ER, doctors had no choice but to deliver the baby prematurely. <br> Over the next three months, the newborn was threaded with respiratory tubes while doctors flushed the mother's brain of excess blood three times. "You can't imagine the costs," says Ludmir. For as little as a few hundred dollars worth of prenatal care, he says, this tragedy - and at least $250,000 of medical care - could have been avoided. Unfortunately, this was not an option. The mother was an undocumented immigrant and therefore was ineligible for publicly funded prenatal care in Pennsylvania. <br> The one health care issue that Republicans and Democrats agree on these days is that illegal immigrants like Ludmir's patients should not have access to publicly funded health care. Republicans see this as a facet of the immigration issue - House Minority Leader John Boehner recently issued a press release charging that providing health care to illegal immigrants "increase[s] the tax burden on American families," while conservative commentators like Michelle Malkin are more naked in their hysteria, warning that the United States is in the midst of becoming "the land of the limit-less health care handout for 'undocumented immigrants.'" <br> The Democrats, meanwhile, are too cowed by the anti-immigration lobby - and the prospect of losing support for their individual health care plans - to defend the undocumented. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-edwards/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John Edwards</span> have already decided to exclude illegal immigrants from their universal-coverage proposals, while <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> has held his tongue on the issue. As a result, doctors such as Ludmir are likely to continue to see undocumented immigrants when their medical situation is most dire - and costly to society. <br> This isn't the first time that the combination of Republican hostility and Democratic timidity on the immigration issue has adversely shaped policy. In 1996, as part of welfare reform, Republicans insisted on banning legal immigrants from receiving Medicaid and S-CHIP (which assists families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid) for the first five years of their residencies. President Clinton grudgingly agreed to the provision in order to shepherd the welfare-reform bill through Congress. <br> The Republican argument that cheap public health care was attracting impoverished illegal immigrants into the country has since been called into question: In 2000, a study from Health Affairs found that less than 1 percent of undocumented immigrants "cited obtaining social services as the most important reason for immigrating." But, although its foundation has rotted, the policy still stands, setting the tone of the current debate: If we don't provide publicly funded health care even to some legal immigrants, why extend it to illegal ones? <br> There are currently 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States - the majority of whom are uninsured. Among all immigrants, both documented and undocumented, less than 40 percent receive employer-sponsored coverage. The only federal health care program that covers undocumented and newly arrived legal immigrants is known as "emergency Medicaid." Under this program, the government will pay for emergency hospital care for the pregnant, elderly, and disabled, and for children or the parent of a child. (Although what, exactly, qualifies as an "emergency" is ambiguous: The federal government recently informed New York state that it would no longer fund chemotherapy.) Those who do not qualify for emergency Medicaid must pay for their treatment out of pocket, or the hospital must write it off as uncompensated care for which it should eventually be reimbursed, at least in part, by the federal government. <br> While it is true that the ER expenses of immigrant children are greater than the per capita average, probably because they are sicker when they finally seek care, immigrants tend to spend less money on health care than their U.S.-born counterparts. (One study in the American Journal of Public Health found that, in 1998, the average health care expenditures of a Hispanic immigrant, documented or undocumented, totaled $972. For a white, U.S.-born citizen, they were over $3,000.) Part of the reason for this discrepancy is because immigrants are, on average, younger and healthier than citizens. This would seem to be an argument for keeping the current system rather than expanding coverage, which tends to raise expenses as patients become insulated from the costs of their care. But, although immigrants may arrive in this country healthier, they regress toward the mean, developing many of the chronic conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, endemic to U.S.-born citizens. They are also aging as a population. As a result, the number of disabled and elderly illegal immigrants is on the rise, and a recent study of North Carolina's emergency Medicaid system found that "[t]he largest spending increases [among the undocumented] ... are occurring among the elderly and disabled groups." <br> The obvious way to contain these costs is to insure the undocumented, so that they have access to preventive care before they degenerate into the tax siphons conservatives already claim them to be. And there is an additional reason to take this step: public health. Just a few unvaccinated individuals can threaten a whole community, a threat that is particularly acute among the undocumented, since they often work in the food service and agricultural industries. Unfortunately, Democrats continue to conflate the health care issue with the immigration one. Clinton and Edwards claim the health care problem will solve itself after they pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. But this is unlikely to happen anytime soon, and, by the point it does, the benefits of incorporating the undocumented population today, while it's still largely young and healthy, will have expired. <br> In the regrettable absence of comprehensive federal legislation, there are some smaller, more feasible measures that should be considered. One is to extend publicly funded health care to all legal immigrants. The second is that more states should extend prenatal care to the undocumented. On this front, the federal government has already done its part: In 2002, President Bush expanded s-chip eligibility to fetuses, giving states the option to cover the prenatal care of mothers ineligible for Medicaid, including undocumented immigrants. Disappointingly, most states, including a majority of the so-called "new-growth states" - those states whose immigrant populations grew most quickly in the 1990s - have not accepted the federal government's offer and provided the necessary matching state funds. <br> This is unfortunate, because there are compelling reasons to do so. A study by researchers in Colorado, a new-growth state, found that only 52 percent of the state's undocumented women received prenatal care during the first trimester, as opposed to 83 percent of all other women. Consequently, 40 percent of undocumented mothers experienced a complication of delivery, as opposed to less than 30 percent of all other mothers. And, beyond the moral imperative, there's an economic one. Researchers in California, the epicenter of undocumented immigration, have estimated that one dollar in prenatal care can save over three dollars in postnatal care.

 pThis column was written by Ben Crair.<br><br>Last October, Dr. Jack Ludmir, the head of obstetrics and gynecology at Pennsylvania Hospital, oversaw the emergency-room treatment of a young woman who was seven months pregnant, hypertensive, and convulsing. Although her condition was, according to Ludmir, "rarely seen in the United States," his team diagnosed it quickly: She was suffering from eclampsia, a severe pregnancy-related disorder that can lead to premature birth, seizure, stroke, even death. In this country, the condition is usually caught in its early stage known as pre-eclampsia, which can often be managed with prenatal care; but, with the mother already in the ER, doctors had no choice but to deliver the baby prematurely. <br> Over the next three months, the newborn was threaded with respiratory tubes while doctors flushed the mother's brain of excess blood three times. "You can't imagine the costs," says Ludmir. For as little as a few hundred dollars worth of prenatal care, he says, this tragedy -- and at least $250,000 of medical care -- could have been avoided. Unfortunately, this was not an option. The mother was an undocumented immigrant and therefore was ineligible for publicly funded prenatal carein Pennsylvania. <br> The one health care issue that Republicans and Democrats agree on these days is that illegal immigrants like Ludmir's patients should not have access to publicly funded health care. Republicans see this as a facet of the immigration issue -- House Minority Leader John Boehner recently issued a press release charging that providing health care to illegal immigrants "increase[s] the tax burden on American families," while conservative commentators like Michelle Mal- kin are more naked in their hysteria, warning that the United States is in the midst of becoming "the land of the limit-less health care handout for 'undocumented immigrants.'" <br> The Democrats, meanwhile, are too cowed by the anti-immigration lobby -- and the prospect of losing support for their individual health care plans -- to defend the undocumented. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-hillary-clinton/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hillary Clinton</span> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-edwards/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John Edwards</span> have already decided to exclude illegal immigrants from their universal-coverage proposals, while <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-barack-obama/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Barack Obama</span> has held his tongue on the issue. As a result, doctors such as Ludmir are likely to continue to see undocumented immigrants when their medical situation is most dire -- and costly to society. <br> This isn't the first time that the combination of Republican hostility and Democratic timidity on the immigration issue has adversely shaped policy. In 1996, as part of welfare reform, Republicans insisted on banning legal immigrants from receiving Medicaid and s-chip (which assists families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid) for the first five years of their residencies. President Clinton grudgingly agreed to the provision in order to shepherd the welfare-reform bill through Congress. The Republican argument that cheap public health care was attracting impoverished illegal immigrants into the country has since been called into question: In 2000, a study from Health Affairs found that less than 1 percent of undocumented immigrants "cited obtaining social services as the most important reason for immigrating." But, although its foundation has rotted, the policy still stands, setting the tone of the current debate: If we don't provide publicly funded health care even to some legal immigrants, why extend it to illegal ones? <br> There are currently 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States -- the majority of whom are uninsured. Among all immigrants, both documented and undocumented, less than 40 percent receive employer-sponsored coverage. The only federal health care program that covers undocumented and newly arrived legal immigrants is known as "emergency Medicaid." Under this program, the government will pay for emergency hospital care for the pregnant, elderly, and disabled, and for children or the parent of a child. (Although what, exactly, qualifies as an "emergency" is ambiguous: The federal government recently informed New York state that it would no longer fund chemotherapy.) Those who do not qualify for emergency Medicaid must pay for their treatment out of pocket, or the hospital must write it off as uncompensated care for which it should eventually be reimbursed, at least in part, by the federal government. <br> While it is true that the ER expenses of immigrant children are greater than the per capita average, probably because they are sicker when they finally seek care, immigrants tend to spend less money on health care than their U.S.-born counterparts. (One study in the American Journal of Public Health found that, in 1998, the average health care expenditures of a Hispanic immigrant, documented or undocumented, totaled $972. For a white, U.S.-born citizen, they were over $3,000.) Part of the reason for this discrepancy is because immigrants are, on average, younger and healthier than citizens. This would seem to be an argument for keeping the current system rather than expanding coverage, which tends to raise expenses as patients become insulated from the costs of their care. But, although immigrants may arrive in this country healthier, they regress toward the mean, developing many of the chronic conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, endemic to U.S.-born citizens. They are also aging as a population. As a result, the number of disabled and elderly illegal immigrants is on the rise, and a recent study of North Carolina's emergency Medicaid system found that "[t]he largest spending increases [among the undocumented] ... are occurring among the elderly and disabled groups." <br> The obvious way to contain these costs is to insure the undocumented, so that they have access to preventive care before they degenerate into the tax siphons conservatives already claim them to be. And there is an additional reason to take this step: public health. Just a few unvaccinated individuals can threaten a whole community, a threat that is particularly acute among the undocumented, since they often work in the food service and agricultural industries. Unfortunately, Democrats continue to conflate the health care issue with the immigration one. Clinton and Edwards claim the health care problem will solve itself after they pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. But this is unlikely to happen anytime soon, and, by the point it does, the benefits of incorporating the undocumented population today, while it's still largely young and healthy, will have expired. <br> In the regrettable absence of comprehensive federal legislation, there are some smaller, more feasible measures that should be considered. One is to extend publicly funded health care to all legal immigrants. The second is that more states should extend prenatal care to the undocumented. On this front, the federal government has already done its part: In 2002, President Bush expanded s-chip eligibility to fetuses, giving states the option to cover the prenatal care of mothers ineligible for Medicaid, including undocumented immigrants. Disappointingly, most states, including a majority of the so-called "new-growth states" -- those states whose immigrant populations grew most quickly in the 1990s -- have not accepted the federal government's offer and provided the necessary matching state funds. <br> This is unfortunate, because there are compelling reasons to do so. A study by researchers in Colorado, a new-growth state, found that only 52 percent of the state's undocumented women received prenatal care during the first trimester, as opposed to 83 percent of all other women. Consequently, 40 percent of undocumented mothers experienced a complication of delivery, as opposed to less than 30 percent of all other mothers.

 This column was written by Ramesh Ponnuru.<br><br>The four leading Republican candidates for president have demonstrated that they have four distinct styles of flip-flopping. <br> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-mitt-romney/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Mitt Romney</span> is the most notorious flip-flopper in the field, and his most notorious flip-flop concerned abortion. He claims that a conversation with scientists about human cloning made him see how abortion had devalued human life. Nobody can prove that Romney isn't telling the truth, but nobody quites believe him, either. Romney has also changed positions on guns, immigration, and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. But it is not the number of his flip-flops that has impressed people so much as how they have altered his political character. He was a moderate technocrat a few years ago, but has become a culture warrior. <br> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-rudy-giuliani/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Rudy Giuliani</span> presents himself as a man who respects conservatives too much to pander to them. Social conservatives, he argues, should trust him more since he doesn't alter his positions to suck up to them. But Giuliani has switched his positions on guns, partial-birth abortion, immigration, and civil unions, in each case moving rightward. He has been pretty consistent in his flip-flop methodology: He finds some detail that justifies the switch. The detail is usually bogus. He said, for example, he was able to support a ban on partial-birth abortion because it included a life-of-the-mother exception - but the one he had opposed had included that exception, too. He said that he would no longer support the lawsuit he initiated against gunmakers, primarily because the case had "taken several turns and several twists that I don't agree with." (He then qualified that with a "probably.") But the principal turn is that the plaintiffs have scaled back their demands. He came out against "comprehensive" immigration reform not because it included amnesty, but because it didn't create adequate databases. <br> When Al Gore flipped from pro-life to pro-choice during his first run for president, one of his aides told a reporter that his strategy for dealing with his past was to "deny, deny, deny." <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-fred-thompson/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Fred Thompson</span> seems to have copied his abortion strategy from the man whose Senate seat he took. The difference is that it's a pro-choice past that he denies having. He distinguishes himself from Romney on abortion by saying that he, Thompson, was with pro-lifers yesterday and will be with them tomorrow. What Thompson can't admit is that he wasn't with pro-lifers the day before yesterday. <br> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-john-mccain/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">John McCain's</span> main flip-flop has been on taxes. He voted against Bush's tax cuts, but now he wants to keep them. He justifies the switch by saying that circumstances have changed. He hasn't apologized for his earlier vote. But to allow the tax cuts to expire now would be to raise taxes. As David Brooks noted the other day, McCain is never terribly convincing when he does something he doesn't believe in. Earlier this year he said that tax cuts always raise revenue. It's a nonsensical claim, but it also makes his overall argument impossible to sustain. One of his principal objections to the Bush tax cuts was that they would increase the deficit. If he now thinks that tax cuts increase revenue, he was wrong and should say so. <br> If I had to judge the matter, I'd say that Thompson and Giuliani go about their flip-flopping with a bit more dishonesty than Romney and McCain. But if you want edification, look away from the whole field.By Ramesh Ponnuru Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Michael Barone.<br>Education is not ordinarily thought to be in the purview of a Federal Reserve chairman. So it's striking when Alan Greenspan in his memoir, "The Age of Turbulence", raises the subject. <br> "Our primary and secondary education system," he writes, "is deeply deficient in providing homegrown talent to operate our increasingly complex infrastructure." The result: "Too many of our students languish at too low a level of skill upon graduation, adding to the supply of lesser-skilled labor in the face of an apparently declining demand." <br> So if you're concerned about widening disparities in income, Greenspan tells readers attracted to his book by its publicists' promise of criticism of George W. Bush, then what you need to do is to "harness better the forces of competition" in educating kids. <br> As Greenspan concedes, we have done that to some extent. Governors Republican and Democratic have worked to make public schools more accountable, charter schools provide some needed competition, and the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act has further prodded states and localities in those directions. But except for a few cities, notably Milwaukee and Cleveland, we have not had school-choice programs with vouchers allowing parents to choose private as well as public schools. <br> Vouchers are adamantly opposed by the teacher unions, which spent millions persuading Utah voters last week to repeal a voucher law passed by the legislature. No one can say for sure how much vouchers would improve education. But they are "forces of competition," as Greenspan puts it, which we're almost entirely prevented from harnessing because of the power of teacher unions - the power, more specifically, that they wield in the Democratic party. <br> I was reminded of this by a recent exchange on theatlantic.com between libertarian blogger Megan McArdle and liberal bloggers Matt Yglesias and Kevin Drum. These are three of the most intellectually interesting and usually independent-minded young liberal bloggers, but on vouchers they advanced one lame argument after another. On this issue, they were playing team ball. <br> The teacher unions are an incredibly important source of money and volunteers for the Democratic party - about one in ten delegates or their spouses at recent Democratic national conventions have been teacher union members. When they snap their fingers, the Democrats jump. Vouchers threaten to dry up dues money, and that is that. <br> Teacher unions are not the only public employee unions important to the Democrats - nearly half the union members in the country are public employees. And you can see their power exerted as well in House Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel's tax reform proposal. <br> Rangel, who deserves credit for raising the issue of broad tax changes, proposes vast tax increases in order to eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT, originally designed to make sure that a few millionaires could not avoid paying income tax, has never been indexed for inflation, and threatens to engulf 20 million taxpayers next year unless Congress passes another one-year "patch" or, as Rangel wants, abolishes it. <br> The AMT has no deduction for state and local taxes, and tends to hit high earners in high-tax states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and California - heavily Democratic states, you'll notice. These states tend to have highly paid unionized public employees, and their union leaders surely understand that the AMT threatens to create political pressure to lower state and local taxes and therefore spending. If voters can't deduct their state and local taxes, their tax burden will go way up, and they may start a tax revolt. Better not let that happen! So eliminating the AMT is an imperative for Democrats. <br> Looking ahead to future fiscal burdens, many people understand that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid threaten to consume an ever-larger share of the economy over the years. But so do state and local governments if public employee unions get their way. And to get it, they rely on taxpayer's funds - all their dues income comes from the public fisc. <br> Their goals are to increase pay, which runs counter to taxpayers' interests, and to minimize accountability, which runs counter to citizens'. Republicans are not their reliable adversaries - union leaders get cozy with Republican legislators when they can, by letting them know they won't oppose them. But the Democrats are, with some few exceptions, their humble obedient servants - from the young liberal bloggers up to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

 This column was written by Eric Rauchway.<br><br>This November 8 marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of Franklin Roosevelt's election as president of the United States. Chosen to resolve the worst non-military crisis in the nation's history, Roosevelt led the country through the Great Depression as well as its greatest military crisis since the Civil War. Americans have memorialized him on the dime and in Washington, DC. Yet for some reason Republicans want to run against his legacy. It's a fight Democrats should let the GOP pick. <br> Three-quarters of a century ago this week, about a quarter of the American workforce was officially unemployed and around half of those working had only part-time jobs. In the summer of 1932, the U.S. Army dispersed veterans of the Great War who had gathered in Washington to ask for relief. Americans watching the newsreel footage saw citizens like themselves fleeing tanks. Under those circumstances, Roosevelt won with fifty-seven percent of the popular vote, and the Democrats swept to an overwhelming Congressional majority. In the first hundred days of Roosevelt's presidency, Congress passed vague laws giving him almost plenary powers to fight the Depression. <br> Now, if you believe the Republican punditocracy, the ensuing years brought a swelling of the state for its own sake. As Amity Shlaes puts it, "The New Deal had a purpose beyond curing the Depression. It was to make people look to Washington for help at all times." And so the state grew, as George Will writes: "Before Roosevelt, the federal government was unimpressive relative to the private sector. Under Calvin Coolidge ... its revenue averaged 4 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 18.6 percent today." Will goes further: the New Deal inaugurated "the era of confidently comprehensive, continent-wide attempts to reform complex social systems." <br> Will's gratuitous alliteration can be fun. Let's try some: this critique of Roosevelt results from crudely compressing history into compartments convenient to the cramped credo of contemporary conservatism. <br> It also rests on a treatment of figures that falls between fudging and fibbing. For example, Will says, accurately, that under Coolidge, federal revenues averaged about 4 percent of GDP. Then he implies it was the New Deal that pushed them up to modern levels. But in 1936, just after the New Deal's big relief bill and the "soak the rich" tax act, revenues ran to 4.78 percent of GDP. The highest they got during the New Deal was 6.49 percent of GDP, in 1938 - but that was more because GDP shrank in the 1937-38 recession than because revenues grew; by 1939 revenues were back down to 5.41 percent of GDP. They did not begin their spike into modern territory until after World War II: in 1947 revenues jumped sharply from around 10 percent to around 14.5 percent of GDP and stayed high through the Eisenhower years. Yet Will blames the New Deal for the events of the postwar era when, as U.S. News and World Report wrote in 1950, the "Cold War [became] almost a guarantee against a bad depression." <br> There's more of the same in Shlaes's treatment of unemployment figures (which I've written about here) and still more when Jerry Bowyer and Glenn Meakem characterize the eight or so percent average annual growth the U.S. economy turned in during the New Deal's first years, and the ten or so percent it averaged during the New Deal's later years as "merely not shrinking." This is true, in the same way it is true that Roosevelt's win in 1936 with over 60 percent of the popular vote was "merely not losing." <br> One could keep on cleaning up this cascade of querulous crotchets (okay, I'll stop). One could acknowledge the New Deal's failures and enumerate its more important successes, pointing out that its lasting policies did not increase the state's power to do things, but rather used the state as a lever to improve Americans' own negotiating power. One could point out that, for example, instead of setting wages and benefits, the New Deal gave legal standing to unions so they could negotiate wages and benefits -- as Senator Robert Wagner said, "we intend to rely upon democratic self-help by industry and labor instead of courting the pitfalls of an arbitrary or totalitarian State." Indeed, a good short book on the New Deal would take due notice of both its weaknesses and strengths while offering such an analysis. One could further point out that truly conservative small-r republicans fretting over the growth of the state and erosion of our liberties should love the New Deal, which kept us from going down the "course toward Europe," and should worry instead about the national security apparatus. <br> But for our purposes here we had better ask why right-wing pundits have been so busily seeking to desecrate a dead man's legacy, like so many pigeons on a monument. Partly, of course, they act in hope of together, over time, achieving the pigeon effect: no single assault matters much, but add them up and they might destroy the statue. But mostly it's because they worry the party of Roosevelt could return, bringing with it sane extensions of the New Deal - into health care, for example - while providing a responsible strategy for national defense. <br> If so, the Democratic candidates for President ought to be running, in this anniversary year, as the legatees of the New Deal. At the moment, the front-runner is running from it: there are only a few mentions of the New Deal on Hillary Clinton's campaign site. Barack Obama and John Edwards do a bit better. But it's an easy choice to make: between the avian vermin and the guy on the nation's pedestal, stand by the man who - four times - placed first in the hearts of his countrymen, and whose legacy the American voters still support.By Eric RauchwayIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by Jonathan Chait.<br>Most of us have come to know <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidate-profile-rudy-giuliani/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Rudy Giuliani</span> as the candidate of choice for Republicans who like President Bush but wish his Middle East policy were a little less restrained or that he invoked September 11 a bit more frequently. But there's another, less well-known aspect to Giuliani: He is the ne plus ultra of the economic right. <br> Compared to other Republican presidential contenders, Giuliani identifies himself as a "supply-sider" in public more aggressively and has mopped up more financial support from oil, gas, and other bastions of the financial right. But economic right-wingery has conquered the GOP so thoroughly that there's not much Giuliani can do to stand out, platform-wise. What truly sets him apart is the apparent depth of his convictions, and the extent to which he is willing to follow the right's philosophical premises through to their grim conclusion. <br> Consider Giuliani's position on health care reform. Like most Republicans, he rails against socialist HillaryCare. Like many Republicans, Giuliani's proposed health care reform is to provide a tax deduction for individual health care. Of course, the value of a tax deduction is proportionate to your income level. If you're in the top tax bracket, you could deduct 35 cents of every health care dollar you spend. If you don't earn enough to owe income taxes, or if you have a pre-existing condition and can't afford coverage, a tax deduction would probably be worthless. Giuliani's tax deduction remedy would therefore do virtually nothing to cover the uninsured. <br> Now, many Republicans who feel obliged to have some kind of health care "plan" endorse the health care tax deduction. Most just don't care very much about the uninsured. Giuliani, by contrast, is not indifferent to the plight of the uninsured. He actually seems to revel in it: <br> Of course, this analysis is insane, unless you think most of the uninsured lack coverage because they'd rather splurge at Best Buy than spend money on health insurance. Alas, this appears to be exactly what Giuliani believes. "[The uninsured] may be buying a television, ... they may be buying a cell phone," he said at last week's debate. <br> Giuliani also thinks that insulating people from the costs of sickness or injury will make them more likely to get sick or injured. "There is no incentive to wellness," he complains. Perhaps you thought wellness was an incentive in and of itself. Obviously, you lack Giuliani's grasp of free-market homilies. As Giuliani understands, when you don't pay the cost of a good, you have every incentive to consume more of it. That's why those of us with insurance are always borrowing handkerchiefs from people with communicable diseases or juggling steak knives barefoot. <br> Some think Giuliani's extreme-right economic views are a form of pandering, to compensate for his pro-choice, pro-gay rights beliefs. But his economic right-wingery seems to flow from a deep-seated punitive impulse, which he has transferred from the shiftless New York City underclass to vast swaths of the population. Giuliani has echoed the language of economic libertarianism with more frankness, and less pretense of compassion, than any recent Republican presidential candidate. <br> That Giuliani so closely embraces the values of economic conservatives no doubt accounts in part for their intense support for his campaign. But just as important is the historic opportunity he represents -- to give them, at last, unfettered primacy among the factions of their party. <br> Social conservatives have reacted to this threat with confusion and panic. For years, they have accepted their subordinate position within the party -- Republicans expend political capital only on economic priorities, never on social priorities -- with little complaint. Among their consolations has been an understood informal requirement that GOP presidential nominees share their beliefs, or at least profess to. (Supply-sider Steve Forbes, who now supports Giuliani, had to undergo a dramatic conversion to social conservatism before his 2000 campaign.) To now nominate a candidate who is avowedly pro-choice, among other social heresies, would strip away their last fig leaf, making the economic wing's de facto control of the party explicit. It would be the equivalent of the barbarian Odoacer crowning himself Emperor of Rome in 476. <br> Giuliani, of course, is careful not to antagonize social conservatives. But his campaign is in fact an attempt to define social conservatism out of the Republican platform. While most Republicans define their party's values by invoking three parts -- small government, strong military, social conservatism -- Giuliani only mentions the first two. A recent editorial in the pro-Giuliani New York Sun proposed a list of GOP values. Item one was a belief that tax cuts make revenues rise. Social issues did not make the list at all. Last winter, Giuliani told a crowd at the Hoover Institution that the GOP must redefine itself around economic issues -- health care, school choice, taxes -- as the "Party of Freedom." <br> Of course, Giuliani's vision of "freedom" is not necessarily about liberating the human spirit. "[F]reedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be," he once explained as mayor. "Freedom is about authority." It's also about the freedom to inherit a vast fortune tax-free, or the freedom to get sick and die. Or, as another philosopher of the topic, Janis Joplin, once put it, "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose."By Jonathan ChaitIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer.<hr width="50%">The big news headline for the fires now called The Beast is this: "Few Die In Massive Southern California Wildfires." <br> It is that rare thing, a good news headline, if only in a silver-lining kind of a way. It is also the polar opposite (and, yes, I know the poles are melting and that's why we have wildfires and floods, etc.) of the news headline that flooded out of Hurricane Katrina: "Many Die, Suffer In Massive Katrina Flooding Due To Local, Federal Failure." <br> One possible lesson from this is that all levels of government learned the hard way from Katrina that they can't blow the big ones. After the disastrous handling of that disaster, there was a flood of punditry proclaiming that "competence" would become the primary demand made by political consumers. The idea was that the polarized and schizophrenic vox populi might stop arguing over whether government should be big or small and focus instead on making it minimally able to do the basics. Candidates would emphasize that management function and steer away from ideology and high-flying rhetoric. <br> That, of course, did not come to pass. Yes, President Bush learned enough to act involved and he headed to California right away. But that is stagecraft not statecraft. It is politics not governing. <br> Ray Nagin was re-elected mayor in New Orleans. Republicans did lose their hold in Congress, but because of the Persian Gulf not the Gulf of Mexico. None of the major presidential candidates in this cycle are campaigning on government competence and efficiency more than usual. Office-seekers always promise clean and able government. This Congress has passed little substantial legislation and has not addressed the deficit, entitlements or tax reform. <br> The amorphous beast known as Government - state, local and federal - is no more or less competent than usual in any generalized way. The truth is more prosaic. Most of the time large organizations face a crisis the response is chaotic and the outcome is neither failure nor success, but somewhere in the middle. The more organizations that are involved, the more chaos ensues. <br> The disaster of Katrina was exacerbated by political corruption in Louisiana and Mississippi, cronyism at FEMA, chronic under-funding of infrastructure maintenance and emergency preparedness. But a response that was deemed a stunning success would have been an anomaly, a shocker. <br> That is all good reason to be especially attentive to and grateful for the more skillful handling of The Beast. Over the next few days and weeks, there will be investigations and news stories that will uncover acts of stupidity, ineptness and bureaucratic bone-headedness. I would suggest focusing on the stories of bravery, ingenuity and cooperation instead. <br> The team that looks good on paper does not always win, as the Colorado Rockies have proven so perfectly this year. Part of what makes a winner is confidence, guts and attitude. We the voters, the political consumers of America, have allowed a generation of politicians to de-motivate and degrade government and public service. <br> It is not just an issue of small budgets and pork-barrel politics, though that matters greatly. Candidates get elected by declaring that "government is the problem, not the solution." And they attack each other relentlessly. We in the news business rarely are willing to cross the street to find an example of public servants who aren't in the military doing something well. I'm guilty as hell of this myself. <br> And in this period of political climate change, we -- the spoiled, litigious and generally ungrateful citizens - expect sacrifice, perfection and accountability from our public servants. We resent our tax bills and berate not just politicians but government workers. When things go wrong, we are shocked and outraged and want scalps. <br> This no way to create a winning government. We're like George Steinbrenner and our government plays like the Yankees, not the Rockies. <br> Good behavior in government and in bureaucracies is rarely rewarded, especially in public. The fact that so few people died amidst a "perfect storm" of fire and the evacuation of over a million people is astounding. It's the headline. 
 This is column written by John McCain.<br><br>We face a choice on health care: We can reform the system through the mechanism that has made the American economy the envy of the world - free markets and competition - or we can promote more government intervention in the false hope that bigger government will be the elixir to our health-care ills. <br> I offer a conservative vision of health-care reform, while the Democrats offer their usual stew of government mandates and regulations, and the inevitable imposition of massive tax increases on Americans to pay for their "reform." Back in 1993, I opposed President Clinton's health-care proposal because I knew it would lead to more and more taxes, huge increases in federal spending, and the rationing of care for Americans. Today, I'm sure Democrats would gladly pass that plan in a heartbeat if they could only convince a skeptical American public to go along. But they can't. Instead, Democrats are pushing incremental government control of health care, as we just witnessed with the S-CHIP debate, and hoping no one notices. <br> I reject this sleight-of-hand. <br> My reform to strengthen our health-care system preserves the most essential of American values - freedom. Conservatives believe in the pursuit of personal, political, and economic freedom for everyone. We believe that free people may voluntarily unite, but cannot be compelled to do so, and that the limited government that results best protects our individual freedom. In health care, we believe in enhancing the freedom of individuals to receive necessary and desired care. We do not believe in coercion and the use of state power to mandate care, coverage, or costs. <br> My plan is built on a simple premise: bringing spiraling health-care costs under control through market competition and personal responsibility will benefit consumers and patient care, increase coverage by making insurance more affordable, and strengthen American economic competitiveness across the globe. It empowers individuals and families so they have more affordable and portable insurance choices that meet their needs. It puts the needs of individuals and families first, rather than those of government and insurance bureaucracies. <br> For example, it provides all individuals with a refundable tax credit of $2,500 and families with a $5,000 refundable tax credit toward the purchase of health insurance. It also rewards innovative insurance by allowing any money remaining to be deposited in tax-free Health Savings Accounts. <br> It promotes robust health-care markets by, among other things, busting up geographic monopolies and allowing individuals and families to purchase insurance across state boundaries. Opening state insurance bureaucracies to national competition will encourage more innovation and lower costs in the health insurance market. As a recent Wall Street Journal editorial noted, if you "allow people to purchase policies across state lines, which is currently prohibited, people [could] choose the coverage levels that best serve their needs, and make insurance far more affordable for people in mandate-heavy states like New York and Massachusetts." <br> Furthermore, Americans should have the option to purchase insurance through any willing, responsible provider, such as an association they belong to or the church they attend, if they are not satisfied with the choices offered by their employer. Again, I believe the more options folks have the better. Families place a high value on quickly getting simple care, and have shown a willingness to pay cash to get it. If walk-in clinics in retail outlets such as Wal-Mart are the most convenient, cost-effective way for families to safely meet simple needs, why should anyone stand in their way? I will not. <br> Our veterans should also have more health-care choices. They should not have to wait for access to a VA facility that is hours away. Under my plan, our veterans would have the option to control the means of financing their care - in an electronic card or other device - so they can choose the care that best suits their needs. <br> Along with veterans' care, we must modernize other government health programs such as Medicare - a program now speeding toward bankruptcy - to improve quality and lower costs. Like most of our system, Medicare reimbursement now rewards institutions and clinicians who provide more and more complex services. I believe we need to change the way providers are paid to focus their attention more on chronic disease and managing its treatment. This is the most important care and expense for an aging population. And in a system that rewards quality, Medicare should not pay for preventable medical errors. <br> I am appreciative of the therapeutic benefits of modern pharmaceuticals, and seek to harness market competition in order to lower pharmaceutical costs by fostering a more efficient process for bringing cheaper generic drugs to consumers sooner, and developing a workable system that permits the safe re-importation of drugs. However, in 2003 I strongly opposed adding another unfunded entitlement to the fiscal train wreck that is Medicare Part D by providing all seniors with a costly drug benefit, even those - like me - who can more than afford to pay for their medicine. <br> Of course, any real reform plan must deal with the trial lawyers who game the current system to maximize their profit margin while raising health costs for everyone else. We cannot let the search for high-quality care be derailed by frivolous lawsuits and excessive damage awards. We must pass medical liability reform, and those reforms should eliminate lawsuits for doctors that follow clinical guidelines and adhere to patient safety protocols. If the Democrats are sincere in their conviction that health-care coverage and quality is their first priority, than they will put the needs of patients before the demands of trial lawyers. But that's about as likely to happen as Democrats keeping taxes low. <br> Finally, one thing left out of most reform talk is personal responsibility. We must personally do everything we can to prevent expensive, chronic diseases. Our rights in this country are protected by our personal sense of responsibility for our own well being. Cases of diabetes are going up, not only in the baby boom generation, but among younger Americans; obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure are all on the rise. Parents who don't impart to their children a sense of personal responsibility for their health, nutrition, and exercise have failed their obligations. Also, parents are responsible for ensuring that their children are covered by health insurance and, under my plan, will have more options beyond what is currently available to them. <br> As with national security, voters in 2008 will decide in which direction our nation should move on health care. We should not cede the health-care issue to the Democrats. When presented with two competing visions on how best to reform our system, I believe voters will choose the conservative vision that empowers people, and frees our current out-dated health-care system from the heavy hand of government. <br> By John McCain Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Jonathan Cohn.<br>Everybody knows how much contempt conservatives show for Hillary Clinton whenever she talks about health care. But people tend to forget how much liberals have been deriding her, too. It was just a few months ago that Michael Moore attacked her in Sicko, alleging that campaign contributions from people in the health care business had made her a tool of that industry. Last week, when asked about Clinton and health care, John Edwards made a similar charge, pointedly noting that, "in order to have universal health care, you have to be willing to take on ... insurance companies, drug companies, and their lobbyists." In other words, he would deliver what Hillary could not. <br> By unveiling a new health care plan last week that did, in fact, promise to cover every single American, Clinton put to rest the worst of these suspicions. But, even after last Monday's blockbuster roll-out -- which provoked a press frenzy rare for what was, after all, a policy speech -- questions remained. It is one thing to put these ideas on paper. But just how serious is she about them, particularly given all her talk about the "scars" she has from 1993 and 1994, the "lessons" she learned from that episode, and the need for "consensus" this time around? If compromise is necessary, then what, specifically, is she willing to compromise away? Enacting universal health care is bound to mean waging some fights. Is she really willing to do that -- and which fights will she pick? <br> Those were the questions I hoped to ask Clinton in a telephone interview a few days after the announcement -- although, truth be told, I didn't expect many answers. Mine was one of a series of interviews she was doing during the week, leading up to a string of appearances on five Sunday morning talk shows. By the time I talked to her, she had already dispensed plenty of carefully calibrated, almost perfectly anodyne, statements: "I've learned some valuable lessons"; "This is not a government-run health care system"; "I know how important it is to work with the Congress." <br> The start of my interview played out the same way. To a question about when she had first sat down to seriously discuss with her staff what this new plan would look like, she gave the boilerplate version of her health care resum: "I've been committed to universal health care for fifteen years. When we weren't successful after '93 and '94, I kept working to try to expand coverage" -- and so on. But then she shifted gears, and, over the next few minutes, as we discussed both the details of what she had proposed and her ideas about how to make it law, she gave some answers I hadn't expected. In the process, she put to rest many of my lingering doubts while demonstrating what may be her strongest assets as a champion of health care reform: her unrivaled mastery of the subject and her savvy sense of how to move a proposal through Congress. <br> Does this mean Clinton is the best candidate on health care? Not necessarily. But it may help explain why she's running such a strong campaign among Democratic primary voters right now. The assumption going into this race was that Clinton would position herself as the centrist alternative to her chief rivals, Edwards and Barack Obama. But on health care, which has emerged as the campaign's top domestic issue, she's positioned herself as far to the left as they have -- offering a plan of similar reach and pledging to push it with similar political will -- while managing to stay within the boundaries of what passes for mainstream political debate. You could say this reflects a welcome and politically viable consensus on how Democrats should approach health care in the coming years -- or, if you're disappointed in the substance of what she's proposing, you could say it reflects a failure by both Edwards and Obama to stretch the boundaries of debate further. Either way, though, it means she's winning over liberal primary voters even as she positions herself for both the general election and -- should she win -- a battle to actually enact health care reform. That's no small feat. <br> It's not hard to see how the 1993-1994 debacle shaped Clinton's thinking on health care -- and, in certain critical ways, how it reduced her ambitions. Most notably, she has decided against blowing up the existing health care system, even though there's a pretty good case for doing so on the merits. As she learned the hard way in 1993-1994, starting from scratch would force the majority of Americans to switch coverage, thereby scaring the very large portion of the U.S. population that already has some form of insurance and likes it. So, this time, Clinton is doing her best to reassure those folks. If you have health insurance and you're pleased with it, she says, that's fine -- you get to keep it. But, if you don't have insurance or you don't like the coverage you have, then you could buy new insurance on your own. You would do it through a purchasing pool set up and maintained by the government -- selecting from a choice of plans in much the same way federal workers and employees of large companies do now. You'd get the same sort of benefits these people get: No insurer could deny you coverage or charge you more because of your medical conditions, and the prices would be more affordable because of the relatively low overhead. And, if you were still too poor to afford this coverage, the government would give you financial assistance while continuing to make Medicaid and other safety-net programs available to the very poor. <br> This might like seem like precisely the sort of plan that would disappoint at least some traditional supporters of universal coverage -- namely, those who believe the best systems are those run directly by the government, or so-called "single-payer" systems. That's because the new Clinton scheme assumes most working-age people will continue to get private health insurance. (To many single-payer advocates, this was precisely the problem with the old Clinton scheme, too: It relied on private insurers, not the government, to deliver coverage for most people.) But there's another wrinkle in Clinton's proposal. Among the insurance options she'd make available to people would be a plan run by the government, perhaps using the basic Medicare model. The idea would be to let this public program operate alongside the private ones -- in effect, competing with them for business. If the public program were as efficient and popular as advocates of public insurance believe it will be -- and, for the record, I'm one of those advocates -- then, over time, it would attract more and more people, naturally evolving into a single-payer system. <br> None of this makes Clinton unique among her rivals. Both Edwards, who unveiled his plan in February, and Obama, who introduced his in May, offer essentially the same deal to the insured -- allowing them to keep their coverage while the government constructs and oversees a new system for everyone else. Both Edwards and Obama also have public insurance options that open a door to single-payer -- a model that bears the intellectual fingerprints of Yale professor and sometime New Republic contributor Jacob Hacker, who has met with all three campaigns. Clinton's plan does have one key difference with Obama's: She would require everyone to get some kind of coverage, a requirement known as an "individual mandate." Obama decided against calling for a mandate initially, preferring to wait and see whether it was really necessary for achieving universal coverage -- and until he knew for sure that insurance would be affordable for everyone required to buy it. But, while that's not a minor difference, in the grand scheme of things it's not a colossal one, either. Meanwhile, the differences between what Clinton proposed and what Edwards proposed are downright miniscule. In fact, the plans are virtually identical. <br> The lack of huge substantive differences in these plans makes it all the more important to figure out which candidates will push their proposals with maximum determination. And, here, Edwards has set a pretty high standard. Not only was he the first major candidate to put forward a serious plan to cover every American; he has also made clear it's his top priority by, among other things, pledging that he would pursue universal coverage even if it meant postponing some progress on deficit-reduction. Obama, too, has cautioned that health care expansions may have to come before complete budget balance. But, it turns out, Clinton pretty much shares this view. While she told me she is determined to make some progress on reducing the deficit -- she very deliberately did not use all of the savings from President Bush's expiring tax cuts to pay for her plan -- she agrees that establishing universal health care may have to precede balancing the budget outright, if only because you can't do the latter until you get medical costs (which drive up the price of government programs) under control. "I think we've got to begin making a down payment on fiscal responsibility, but it has to come over time," Clinton said. "If you don't get ... quality, affordable care to everybody, you can't realize a lot of the savings that will help you with deficit-reduction, with Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs." <br> Although Clinton constantly invokes the need for having an open mind while dealing with former adversaries in Congress, she also says that universal coverage is a core principle with which she's not prepared to part. "We have to remain committed to the goal of quality affordable care for everybody," she told me. "That has to be one of those principles that we'd take into whatever the negotiations are." Similarly, for all of Clinton's talk about consensus, she's not particularly tolerant of the insurance industry -- or, at least, the way it practices business now. "Remember," she said, "this is an industry that spends $50 billion a year excluding people, either altogether, by denying them coverage, or by denying them care that they need." <br> Clinton leaves open the possibility that the industry could retool itself so that insurers compete on cost and quality rather than on their ability to pick out the most healthy beneficiaries (the way they typically do now). This was, she explained during the interview, a new "business opportunity" just waiting for smart companies to take advantage of it. But she also seemed to recognize that doing so runs against the nature of many insurers today -- noting that even some of the industry's erstwhile allies in the corporate world are getting fed up. "I think there's an awareness," she said, speaking of CEOs she's met, "that the health insurance industry is not working in a way that makes economic sense for the rest of the economy -- and I think that's a revelation for them." <br> What a clever rhetorical construction: It pits the interests of the business community against the interests of the insurance industry, effectively splitting the traditional opposition to universal coverage. And it may hint at the political strategy Clinton intends to pursue if she gets elected. While she isn't signaling compromise on universal coverage or going soft on insurers, she is embracing business -- constantly invoking the wisdom of CEOs, talking up the need to establish partnerships with them, and tailoring her proposal with their companies' needs in mind. Clinton would require all larger firms to contribute toward their workers' health benefits. But she would let these firms provide workers with coverage directly (rather than simply pay a tax) if that's the company's preference -- because, she notes, even CEOs frustrated with rising benefit costs "still want to have control." Firms with fewer than 25 employees would be exempt from the requirement to pay for health insurance, although, if these firms did offer their workers insurance, they would get a tax credit. <br> That last part seems to be a unique feature of Clinton's plan; neither Edwards nor Obama have indicated they would let firms with so many employees off the hook (although they would give those firms access to much cheaper insurance than they can get now). And, substantively speaking, that's a serious concession. According to Professor Jonathan Gruber of MIT, such a large exemption concedes about two-thirds of the total available revenue from employers. In other words, Clinton gives up a large pot of money -- money necessary to finance the subsidies for low-income people -- that she then must find elsewhere. (She finds most of it through efficiency gains.) Clinton's advisers say the difference isn't as stark as it seems, since most other proposals would end up easing at least some of the burden on small businesses -- generally by exempting or subsidizing the very smallest employers. Whatever the impact in terms of dollars, though, the decision to avoid slapping small-business owners with a requirement to pay for health care seems to be primarily political. The small-business lobby played a pivotal role in bringing down the old Clinton plan. And, while some of this opposition reflected nothing more than ideology, much of it stemmed from that plan's small-business mandate. In one of the most memorable episodes of that fight, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce effectively reversed itself -- backing out of a planned endorsement of a mandate on business -- because a rival organization, the National Federation of Independent Business, was winning over members who wanted no part of such a requirement. <br> Taken together, these moves suggest a divide-and-conquer strategy, in which Clinton would try to pry the business community from the ranks of the determined opposition. And this may reflect the influence of Clinton's uniquely experienced advisers. All three Democrats have turned to the same informal network of health-care experts for ongoing counsel -- people like Gruber and Hacker and the New America Foundation's Len Nichols. And all three candidates have smart people working exclusively for them. But it was Clinton who inherited the senior staff from her husband's White House, including Chris Jennings and Gene Sperling, who spent years figuring out how to navigate legislation through a hostile Congress. (Whether that experience is helpful today depends, admittedly, on just how good you feel about the old Clinton era.) <br> Of course, the degree to which Hillary relies on these and other advisers is open to question. "A lot of people ask me, who is Senator Clinton's closest health adviser," says Nichols, who was first called to brief her about two years ago. "The truth is, Senator Clinton does not really need a lot of health advising. ... She has what we health policy wonks do for a living down cold." <br> Make no mistake, Clinton still carries into the fight on health care plenty of political liabilities, starting with her lack of sheer oratorical talent. She can't exude passion and empathy the way Edwards (or her husband) can; she can't convincingly offer soaring, transformational rhetoric like Obama. Those are no small things, given the necessity of rallying public support to overcome hostile special interests. Moreover, Clinton starts with a greater reservoir of ill will than either one of her rivals. Consider a recent Zogby poll commissioned by Forbes Small Business. The poll asked small-business owners about their attitudes on health care reform and discovered a discernible turn to the left. Not only was the cost of health care their top political concern, but a plurality, 34 percent, said they thought the best solution was to have the government step in and somehow make sure everybody got insurance. "Small-business owners normally fear and loathe the government," John Zogby, whose polls have tracked small business owners since 2000, told the magazine. "But, in this instance, we could be at a tipping point caused by health care insecurity." That's good news for fans of universal health care, but not, as it turns out, for Clinton -- because, when Zogby asked about presidential candidates, she finished first in both the "least favorite candidate" and the "least likely to do something for small business" categories. And which Democrat did they feel was most likely to help small business? Edwards. Obama, meanwhile, fared better than not only all other Democrats but also the leading Republicans in the favorability category. <br> Then again, Clinton has already proven capable of winning over fans in surprising quarters. On The New York Times op-ed page last week, the accolades for her health care plan from David Brooks were no less strong than those from Paul Krugman. E.J. Dionne had only good things to say about her in The Washington Post, which perhaps isn't so surprising. But Brit Hume was also praising her on Fox News, which most certainly is. The rap on Hillary Clinton has always been that she lacks her husband's political dexterity. But, too often during the 1990s, Bill's trademark triangulation succeeded only in angering both sides of the political divide. With her health care roll-out, Hillary has done the opposite: generated serious enthusiasm from observers across the ideological spectrum. If she can keep that up, she'll go very far indeed.By Jonathan CohnIf you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by David Freddoso.<br>Democrats are all about raising taxes - they have certainly earned the reputation. All three of their leading presidential candidates have promised to raise income taxes, capital-gains taxes, dividend taxes, and the estate tax. <br> Last week they voted to increase cigarette taxes by 61 cents. Emboldened by their new majority, they have just this year proposed tax increases on small cigars, independent landlords, hedge-fund managers, oil companies, carbon emitters, multinational corporations, and health-care plans. <br> Democrats have even proposed a "piggyback tax" to pay for the Iraq war, and don't have any illusions that such a tax would end with the war. More than 100 years after it was established, President Clinton vetoed repeal of the 1898 Spanish-American War tax on phone service. (It was only abolished last year by the Treasury Department.) <br> Democrats love taxes, and higher taxes are better ones. So isn't it interesting that they are now the ones trying to revive the three-martini lunch? <br> The fame of this gluttonous noontime repast dates back to the Carter administration, whose simple-minded zeal for "tax simplification" usually involved tax increases instead of cuts. Business owners, the complaint went, were "cheating the government" by writing off massive business lunch tabs (which in that civilized age included copious quantities of alcohol). <br> Although Carter never succeeded in taxing the "three martini lunch," his successor, President Reagan, went along with a Democratic Congress to limit this deduction to 80 percent in the 1986 round of tax reform. Prior to that, the allowable write-off for qualified business meals and entertainment had been 100 percent. In 1993, as part of President Clinton's tax hike, the allowable deduction was reduced again to 50 percent - much to the dismay of the restaurant industry. <br> Now an obscure Senate bill (S. 58) seeks to repeal the Clinton tax-hike on business meals and entertainment. Surprisingly, the return of the three-martini lunch is being proposed by Democrats. Sen. Daniel Inouye is sponsoring the bill, and its companion House bill is sponsored by his colleague in the Hawaiian delegation, Rep. Neil Abercrombie. The Hawaiian connection is not hard to figure out - tourism and hospitality are the largest industries in the Aloha State, accounting for nearly a quarter of its economy. It is a very popular location for business conferences, which qualify for the meals and entertainment write-off. This tax cut would boost Hawaiian restaurants and hotels, perhaps even giving them some room to raise their prices and adding as much as $108 million to the state's annual economy, according to the National Restaurant Association. <br> It goes without saying that no conservative could possibly oppose such a tax cut. Yet conservatives also buy into the idea that every change in the tax code creates an incentive of some kind, and therefore some tax cuts are better than others. This provision would allow business owners to eat and drink more freely with their clients - an unmistakable good, and certainly a good thing for the restaurant, sports, and entertainment industries. <br> By contrast, however, a cut to income, capital gains, or corporate tax rates benefits everyone by encouraging economic growth. When the government siphons off less of the nation's economic production, this encourages Americans to invest more freely in their businesses or in the financial markets - both of which ultimately create all of the jobs Americans hold in the private sector. When top marginal rates are reduced, there is less disincentive to expand further and take on more employees. No martini deduction could ever do this so effectively. <br> "We wouldn't necessarily oppose this bill," said one GOP aide on Capitol Hill. "But it's a clear case of misplaced priorities when Democrats worry about Hawaiian conferences while Middle Americans deal with higher mortgage rates and the higher taxes they're planning to pass." <br> Along the same lines, Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., is sponsoring a bipartisan bill in the House with Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., to cut the excise tax on beer from $18 to $9 per barrel. (North Dakota is the nation's largest barley producing state, producing 40 percent of the national crop in 2003.) <br> Whether it's about martinis, beer, or solar energy, the Democrats' approach to taxes is simple: It all depends on who benefits. The government can use a carrot to pick winners and losers among special interests such as the beer, restaurant and oil industries. Then it can use a stick on all the rest of us - investors and wage earners. For Democrats, tax cuts are for special interests, not general economic growth or the common good. <br> These tiny Democratic tax cuts are probably going nowhere in this Congress, although there is always the off-chance that they will be included in next year's Alternative Minimum Tax package. <br> But it is wonderful to see a few Democrats trying to decrease taxes for a few people. Wouldn't it be even better if they'd at least stop trying to raise taxes on everyone else to make up for it?By David FreddosoReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Yuval Levin.<br>The 2008 presidential campaign has seen the Democrats more outspoken on health care than they have been since the early 1990s. The three frontrunners have produced health care proposals that would greatly increase the role of the government in funding and managing the nation's health insurance system, and all constantly speak about health care on the stump. <br> An aggressive approach would seem to make political sense. Americans are clearly concerned about the cost of health care - often listing it just behind the war in Iraq among their worries - as well as the instability of coverage and the plight of the uninsured. But when pollsters begin to dig into these worries, what they turn up is not quite what the Democrats are hoping. <br> To begin with, those Americans who are insured - which, of course, includes the vast majority of voters - are very happy with their coverage and care. Almost 90 percent of them rated their coverage good or excellent in last year's Kaiser Foundation poll on health care, the highest rating in the two decades Kaiser has been polling. In the same poll, 93 percent were happy with their quality of care, 86 percent with their ability to get a doctor's appointment when they want to, and 77 percent with their ability to get non-emergency care without having to wait. A surprisingly high 64 percent even said they were satisfied with their health care costs. These are not voters clamoring for radical change in their health care. <br> Americans are also not eager to see a more intrusive federal role in health insurance. In early September, Senate Republicans were briefed on the results of recent polling of women and swing voters in key 2008 states which showed that "government-run health care" was a very powerful turn-off for these crucial constituencies. More recent surveys turn up the same result: Voters are anxious about health care, but the prospect of a new bureaucracy to manage their care worries them, too. <br> What troubles them about the current system is the inherent instability of employment-based health insurance, which links changes in jobs to changes in health coverage. Rising costs, moreover, mean that those just barely holding on to coverage must constantly worry about losing it. Add in the fact that tens of millions of Americans are without insurance, and you have a real desire for action. <br> But the Democrats' approach to health care, which would essentially dismantle our existing insurance system and replace it with a new one with the government at its center, is a grossly excessive response to these concerns. The candidates' plans would seriously undermine what the vast majority of Americans appreciate about their health care and would introduce new sources of concern. The Democrats made this mistake in 1993, and Republicans were able to crush HillaryCare by just pointing to its profound flaws. In 2007 voters have more serious concerns about health care (and recognize the genuine problems of the uninsured); Republicans will need something to counter with. <br> Rather surprisingly, though, the Republicans may be prepared. In recent months, without fanfare, a Republican health care consensus has emerged. It is backed by the administration, which introduced a series of proposals in a low-key presidential speech in June. It has the support of Republican leaders in Congress, who have taken to speaking more about health care this summer. And in one form or another it has made it into the stump speech of the leading presidential contenders. The approach consists of three parts: reform of the way health insurance is taxed, more control for consumers in how health care dollars are spent, and more flexibility for states to use Medicaid funds to help the uninsured. Each of these pieces is larger than it seems. <br> Tax law is the principal shaper of America's health care-insurance system, because money spent by employers on health insurance (unlike money spent on salary or other benefits) is not taxed, which creates an enormous incentive to pay for health coverage through our employers. Republicans from George W. Bush to Rudy Giuliani to Mitt Romney have proposed creating a standard health care deduction (or tax credit), which would make it equally sensible for individuals to buy their own insurance as it is to get it through work. An individual insurance policy would stay with you if you changed jobs, and such a market would make it cheaper for small-business workers and the self-employed (a significant portion of the uninsured) to afford coverage. <br> Individually purchased health care coverage would also create more cost-conscious consumers. Galloping growth in health care costs is a major source of the public's anxiety about coverage. The Bush administration has begun to use the lever of Medicare payments to force physicians and hospitals to make prices publicly known, and Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail have pushed for greater openness about costs too. Together with the long-standing campaign for Health Savings Accounts, this begins to point the way toward a more consumer-driven health care market. Health care is not quite like any other commodity (nor should it be), but it can be subjected to some market pressures to control costs and empower patients. <br> Finally, Republicans have also proposed allowing states more latitude in using Medicaid dollars that now pay for "uncompensated care" (which mostly covers care for the uninsured who do not directly qualify for Medicare) to provide subsidies for the uninsured to help them buy their own private coverage. As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney used such an approach. But rather than a national version of his state's plan, in August Romney proposed giving each state the ability to design its own approach to the problem. (In the same speech, he also lined up behind a tax reform proposal and consumer-driven health care.) The Massachusetts model, he suggested, could help other states. But for the federal government, his preferred solution is much like Bush's and, by all indications so far, like those of all the prominent Republican presidential candidates. It is the new GOP health care consensus. <br> This mix of proposals is not without its own problems. Medicaid flexibility, for instance, has tended to encourage state irresponsibility with federal dollars in the past. And consumer-driven health care, if carried too far too fast, can increase the anxiety of families by forcing them to make unfamiliar choices. But on the whole, Republicans have put forward serious yet modest proposals that address voters' concerns about the stability and portability of their insurance coverage and help the uninsured while keeping in place a private insurance system that works quite well for the great majority of Americans. <br> The overreaching of the Democrats may hand Republicans an unexpected opportunity on health care reform. Both parties are seeking to address the concerns of the middle class and uninsured, but the Republican approach builds on what most middle-class voters like about the current system (its relative freedom, lack of waiting, and decent quality), while the Democratic approach builds on what they don't like (bureaucracy and loss of control over health decisions). <br> Some Democrats are clearly aware of their vulnerability. In rolling out her health care proposal last week, Hillary Clinton was notably defensive. "This is not government-run," she said in her two speeches announcing the plan. "There will be no new bureaucracy." But her plan calls for a new federal individual health insurance mandate (which will require an entirely new national regulatory structure for coverage) and includes a new public government-run insurance program on its menu of coverage options. It points precisely to bureaucracy and government-run health insurance. The lady doth protest too much. <br> A savvy Republican candidate would talk about two sets of health care problems: The first are the problems of the system we have, and the second are the prospects of centralized, bureaucratic, government-managed health care, which the Democrats support - slowly dismantling our health care system and replacing it with a huge bureaucracy from the people who brought you the post office and the DMV. <br> The new Republican approach to health care would address both problems through targeted reforms that control costs, give more people access to private insurance, improve the stability and portability of coverage, and increasingly put insurance decisions in the hands of individuals and families, where they belong. This is the platform the Republicans have long needed.By Yuval Levin 
 This column was written byTrudy Lieberman.<br>If ever there was a motherhood-and-apple-pie issue, reauthorizing the popular State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) is it. Yet the Bush administration, right-wing think tanks and health insurance companies have managed to turn a no-brainer into a pitched battle over the direction of healthcare reform, jeopardizing the future of S-CHIP itself. The fight over S-CHIP, which must be renewed by September 30, reflects deep divisions in Washington and shows the difficulties of making improvements in the healthcare system. <br> By every measure, the ten-year-old program - passed during the Clinton administration as a bipartisan, incremental effort to expand health coverage to millions of poor kids - has been a success. Thanks to S-CHIP, the number of low-income uninsured kids dropped by one-third over the decade, even as the number of uninsured adults went up. Three out of four eligible kids participate, and studies show they receive preventive care and have improved health outcomes and school performance. "It has been the only success story in initiatives to improve healthcare access," says Cindy Mann, who directs Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. <br> S-CHIP enjoys broad support among Democratic and Republican governors. Its flexibility allows states to tailor their own programs or build on existing Medicaid arrangements to target children typically in families with incomes of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level (about $41,300 for a family of four this year). Last year 91 percent of kids on S-CHIP lived in families with incomes at or below that amount. States have stepped in to fill a gap the federal government has refused to address: Nineteen states target or plan to target kids from families whose income is greater than 250 percent of the poverty rate, and some cover pregnant women and parents of eligible kids, a strategy that has proved successful in reaching more children. <br> What's wrong with this picture? It doesn't square with the right's ideology or the profit goals of the insurance industry, which has the upper hand in Congress. This summer the House and Senate passed bills reauthorizing S-CHIP, but by mid-September it became clear that the House bill, which added 5 million uninsured kids to the rolls and paid for their coverage partly by cutting government overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans, would lose to the more minimal Senate approach. Giving health insurance to more kids instead of overpaying highly profitable insurance companies seemed like a good trade. But the Senate, lobbied all year by the insurance industry, didn't see it that way. <br> The Senate bill covers only 4 million uninsured children, paying for the coverage with a 61-cent increase in the tobacco tax. It also retains the government handouts to insurance companies, which receive on average 12 percent more than it costs Medicare to provide benefits to seniors under the traditional. Influential GOP senators, targeted by sellers of Medicare Advantage plans heavily marketed in rural areas, are adamantly against cuts to Medicare Advantage. "It's very frustrating to see a phenomenal House bill and then move toward the Senate bill," says a spokesperson for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Negotiators say the issue of overpayments will be taken up later this year, when Congress must consider whether to implement scheduled cuts in Medicare payments to doctors, a fight that will pit doctors against insurance companies. But the insurance lobby has won this round. <br> Neither the House nor the Senate bill covers all the children in need. Nearly 9 million kids now have no health insurance, and up to two-thirds of them are eligible for S-CHIP or Medicaid. Even so, for the Scrooge in the White House, both bills cover too many children. He has threatened to veto any bill, labeling the expansion a step toward "government-run healthcare." Never mind that S-CHIP kids get care from private doctors or managed-care organizations that contract with the government, just as Medicare beneficiaries do. The Senate bill puts $35 billion more into financing S-CHIP; the House bill would have added $50 billion. Bush would add only $5 billion, not even enough to maintain the 6 million kids who are currently covered. <br> The Administration is taking no chances. To make sure that more kids will go without health insurance, in August it short-circuited the legislative process, issuing a "guidance" that makes it almost impossible for states to expand coverage to kids in families whose incomes are above 250 percent of the poverty level unless the state can show that 95 percent of children in families under 200 percent are enrolled, a standard that's unachievable for a voluntary program (participation in Medicare Part B is about 93 percent, and enrollment is automatic). The number of uninsured children has started to climb again, as employers continue to drop coverage for their parents. Loss of employer coverage has declined for families at all income levels targeted by S-CHIP expansions. <br> The guidelines halt expansions already under way in states like Oklahoma and Louisiana, which had approved eligibility for kids from families whose incomes are at 300 percent of the poverty level, and in Vermont, where more than 2,000 children from families with incomes between 225 and 300 percent of poverty will lose their insurance. "It's really outrageous," says Alan Weil, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. "The dirty secret is that the Administration had been approving states to do what they have now told them not to do." <br> Apparently the Administration prefers to unleash families into the Darwinian jungle of the private insurance market, where only the wealthiest and healthiest can buy a policy. Public programs like S-CHIP, it argues, "crowd out" insurance sold by WellPoint and United Healthcare, depriving them of profits they earn selling coverage to S-CHIP families. Meanwhile, each year medical insurance consumes a greater share of family income. The truth is that most families can't afford those policies. The price for family coverage now averages $12,000, or about 20 percent of income for a family of four with income at 300 percent of the poverty level. <br> Families can, of course, buy one of the new bare-bones policies, such as the one sold in Ohio by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield with deductibles ranging from $4,000 to $20,000 ($8,000 to $40,000 if the family uses out-of-network providers). The policy covers only two doctor visits per year, and families must pay 30 percent of any hospital bill after satisfying the deductible. Pity the family whose child suffers recurring strep infections or needs an emergency appendectomy. Insurers also have long lists of health conditions people cannot have if they hope to get coverage. If poor kids have asthma, were born prematurely or are prone to ear infections, they're out of luck. <br> The realities of the health insurance marketplace have not stopped the "educational" efforts on Capitol Hill by right-wing think tanks, which have provided the ideological muscle for the assault on S-CHIP. Their rhetoric has reached the point of silliness; one recent memo on the Heritage Foundation website is titled "The House S-CHIP Bill: Enlisting States as Agents of Government Dependency." The Cato Institute held a briefing called "Sinking S-CHIP: A First Step Toward Stopping the Growth of Government Health Programs." Heritage and the American Legislative Exchange Council called their briefing "S-CHIP Expansion: Bad for Kids, Families, and Taxpayers." They are equating healthcare for poor kids with socialism. If that's the case, our children will be the first casualties on the way to marketplace perfection.By Trudy LiebermanReprinted with permission from the The Nation 
 This column was written by the editors of National Review Online.<br>Only two groups of Americans should worry about Hillary Clinton's new health-care plan: the healthy and the sick. The healthy are going to pay more, since one of Clinton's ideas is to prohibit insurance companies from giving them a discount. <br> For many of the sick, the Clinton plan will mean worse care. She promises to generate $35 billion in savings by insisting on "best practices" and reducing the "geographic variation in care." These are code words for rationing. And there will be more rationing to come. Clinton's plan is likely to cause health costs to rise. For one thing, it expands every government health-care program in sight, including the ones that are already insolvent. Government-imposed rationing will be the only way to control these costs once her system is in place. <br> The federal government provides a tax break for employer-provided coverage; Clinton would take it away from high-income workers. Something like that could be done as part of a tax reform that would reduce the federal government's distortion of health markets. But the way she does it, it's just a tax increase - one of many in her plan. <br> Senator Clinton is being treated as a political genius for leaving all the unpleasant parts of liberal health reform for later. Her plan features no explicit rationing, and she even claims that it would create no new bureaucracies. (Then who's going to keep track of whether everyone has complied with the mandate to get health insurance?) Republicans should fill in the blanks, and explain that there are better ways to reform health care. <br> By the editors of National Review Online Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Jonathan Cohn.<br>Of all the reasons President Bush and his conservative allies have given for opposing an expansion of government-financed health insurance for children, the one that sounds most persuasive is that a lot of these kids or, more precisely, their families don't need the help. <br> The argument goes like this: It's fine to have the government help really poor children, who couldn't get health insurance without taxpayer assistance. But under the proposals now on the table, health benefits provided by the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) could be available to some children in families with incomes of up to four times the poverty line or a little more than $80,000 a year for a family of four. And that, say the conservatives, is simply too much. <br> "This bill essentially extends a welfare benefit to middle-class households," the administration announced last month, after an S-CHIP expansion bill passed the Senate. Over at National Review's The Corner, David Freddosso put the issue a little less delicately. "Come on, people! We're talking about whether the government should pay for your two kids' health insurance plans when you make more than $51,000 a year (more than the new national median income). I know that health insurance is not cheap, but neither are your mortgage and car insurance. You're not going to ask the government to pay for those, too, are you?" <br> Quotes like this make it sound like S-CHIP would become as much a middle-class accessory as minivans and cappuccinos. Not so. Many states already offer S-CHIP insurance to families with higher incomes, thanks to special waivers they received from the federal government. Yet the vast majority of children in S-CHIP, more than 90 percent, are still from families that make less than twice the poverty line, or around $41,000 for a family of four. <br> And it would remain that way under either the Senate S-CHIP bill or its counterpart in the House. Both bills would dedicate significant new sums of money to the program, $35 billion over five years in the Senate version and $47 billion in the House. And both would allow states to expand eligibility to families with incomes over twice the poverty line. But in both cases, it's assumed that most of the money will be spent on enrolling truly low-income children for the most part, kids who are already eligible for S-CHIP (or Medicaid, the other federal health insurance program servicing the poor) but haven't yet signed up. This isn't coincidence: Some of the most important provisions in the two pieces of legislation are those calling for better recruitment and outreach. <br> Still, the proposed S-CHIP expansions would likely bring in some new children from wealthier families. (And possibly adults, too, but that's a topic for another time.) That's what has the right so angry and ready for a fight. President Bush has already indicated he will veto anything that looks like the House or Senate bills. And, just last month, his administration issued a dictum to states, warning them that it will no longer grant permission to expand eligibility except in narrow circumstances. <br> But there are all sorts of reasons why a middle-class family looking for health insurance might have a genuine need for government assistance. If you can't get health benefits through your employer and, in case you hadn't heard, employer-sponsored insurance has been in a pretty steady decline for two decades now you have to buy it on your own. Yet if you look for non-group coverage, as it's known, you'll quickly find it's a lot more expensive than the group kind, because of higher administrative costs. And if you do buy coverage, you'll likely find it less reliable and convenient. The non-group market is notoriously unstable, with small-time carriers constantly jumping in and out, plus it's famously prone to fraud. And, of course, it's in the non-group market where insurers try hardest and have the most ability to avoid enrolling people that pose serious medical risks. Simply put, if you have even a moderate pre-existing condition, chances are good you won't find affordable coverage if, indeed, you can find coverage at all. <br> Another reason why some middle class Americans might need assistance getting health insurance becomes apparent when you consider exactly which states are most interested in enrolling these people. Right now, the state with the highest income eligibility for S-CHIP is New Jersey. There, children in families making up to 350 percent of the poverty line can enroll. New York has recently said it would like to make insurance available to even wealthier families those at up to four times the poverty level. Other states interested in raising levels include California and Connecticut. <br> Notice a pattern here? These are the states with very high costs of living and very expensive health insurance. It might seem crazy that somebody making $80,000 a year would need help getting health insurance until you consider that the cost of living in New York is crazy, too. As The New York Times noted in an editorial this past weekend, "Health officials in New York calculate that families in New York City or on Long Island, where two-thirds of the state's uninsured children live, would need incomes above 300 percent of the poverty level just to pay for life's other necessities, like housing, food, transportation, child care and taxes, leaving no money for health insurance." 
 This column was written by Bruce Bartlett.<br>The basic theological tenets of the Church of Scientology are well known: a fanatical hatred for psychiatry coupled with a creation myth that involves an evil alien ruler named Xenu and his sundry galactic allies. The basic tenets of its tax policy are somewhat less familiar. But Scientologists promulgated and, at one point, heavily promoted a proposal that would replace all federal income taxes with a national retail sales tax (NRST). And the theology and tax policy aren't entirely unrelated: Xenu used phony tax inspections as a guise for destroying his enemies. <br> In a strange confluence, the Scientologist proposal happens to be nearly identical to one of the trendiest conservative tax proposals of the year, the so-called FairTax, which has been endorsed by John McCain and Fred Thompson, as well as second-tier presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Tom Tancredo, Duncan Hunter, and Democrat Mike Gravel. Georgians John Lindner and Saxby Chambliss have introduced FairTax legislation in the House and Senate that would establish a 23 percent national sales tax. <br> But, when you mention any hint of the nexus between Scientology and the NRST - as I did briefly in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed - you'll be denounced by FairTax supporters as a smear artist. This retort, however, is simply evidence that these FairTax supporters don't know the history of their own proposal. That's too bad. Perhaps if they understood its origins in Scientology, they might have a greater appreciation for its inherent flaws. <br> The story of the FairTax's provenance is one that I can tell with some firsthand knowledge. In 1993, fresh from a stint at the Treasury Department, I spent a few months at the Cato Institute. I was filling in for Steve Moore - now an editorial writer at The Wall Street Journal - who took a brief leave from his job as director of the think tank's fiscal studies program to advise former Texas Representative Dick Armey. It was there that I was visited by a man named Steven L. Hayes, the founder of group called Citizens for an Alternative Tax System (CATS) that promoted the NRST, and who was, as Moore pointed out to me, a prominent Scientologist. <br> It wasn't hard to figure out the Scientologists' motives for hawking the NRST. The IRS had refused to recognize Scientology as a legitimate church - a fact that seemed to enshrine their popular reputation as a "cult." To remedy this situation, Scientologists waged war against the IRS. At various points, the Church attempted to infiltrate the tax authority and even hired private investigators to examine the private lives of IRS officials. And the same impulse behind these measures led them to devise the NRST. One church spokesman told National Journal's Paul Starobin, "We thought, If this [discrimination] is happening to us, there must be a lot of people to whom this is happening.' ... How could some positive changes be made?" Since nearly every state has a sales tax, it would be a simple matter to get them to collect a federal NRST, rendering the IRS instantly superfluous, a ripe target for abolition. <br> As Starobin told the story, CATS wooed the Texas political elite, including Robert A. Mosbacher Jr., the son of George H.W. Bush's secretary of Commerce. Mosbacher urged Hayes to reach out to Jack T. Trotter, an attorney close to Texas Representative Bill Archer, the ranking Republican on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. Although Trotter and Hayes held several meetings, nothing came of it. According to Starobin, Trotter feared that the Scientology connection would turn off too many potential supporters. (Hayes, for his part, has always denied that the church played any role in his group after helping found it.) But Trotter was hooked by the sales tax idea and wanted it expanded to include the payroll tax as well. He formed Americans for Fair Taxation (AFT) in 1995 to promote the CATS proposal, but without the taint of Scientologist involvement. AFT promoted the FairTax for a decade, elevating the plan to its current popularity. <br> By the time that Trotter had shunted the Scientologists aside, the church was losing interest in tax reform. In 1993, the IRS finally recognized Scientology as a legitimate religion, ending the rationale for a vendetta against the tax collectors. CATS basically withered. Its last tax return, filed in 2005, showed contributions totaling $1,725. A year later, the group appeared to be completely defunct. (Interestingly, in 2003, the group's tax returns listed my old colleague Steve Moore as a director.) <br> A brief digression: A few years after I encountered Hayes, he gained notoriety by suing an anti-Scientologist organization called the Cult Awareness Network (CAN). When CAN declared bankruptcy in the wake of this suit, Hayes purchased the organization's assets and name at auction. Overnight, CAN ceased to be a thorn in Scientology's side. <br> The reason I brought up the Scientology connection in the first place was not to create guilt by association. Rather, it was to explain that CATS had one very specific goal: the abolition of the Internal Revenue Service. Anything else that the NRST might accomplish was entirely secondary. And, in the rush to rid the world of the IRS, the plan's authors neglected some important details, not to mention some key facts. <br> For starters, the FairTax is deceptively calculated. When you think of a 23 percent sales tax, you think of paying an extra 23 cents on the dollar. That's how every sales tax in the world works. The FairTax, on the other hand, doesn't represent 23 percent of the pre-tax value of the item you bought, but the post-tax value of the item. So, under FairTax, you wouldn't pay $1.23 for a $1 widget - but $1.30, since the 30-cent tax is 23 percent of $1.30. How straightforward! <br> The legerdemain doesn't end there. Unlike every other sales tax in the world, the FairTax actually applies to everything - every pencil, every tank - the government buys. Unfortunately, the FairTax proposal doesn't take into account this increase in government spending. Thus, it will either provoke a massive cut in federal spending or a massive increase in taxes. <br> And what about the poor who bear the brunt of this highly regressive tax? The FairTax would track every household's monthly income and then cut checks to minimize the pain, a logistical challenge that will ultimately resemble some welfare state nightmare. What's more, this would cost gobs of money, forcing further cuts in spending. <br> For these and other reasons, every reputable tax expert who has ever looked at the FairTax has concluded that the true tax rate would have to be much, much higher than 23 percent (or even 30 percent) to work - and, even at that unrealistically low rate, the plan would inspire massive tax evasion. In short, the FairTax is a crackpot scheme from beginning to end. That would be true even if the Scientologists hadn't authored it. <br> EDITOR'S NOTE: The New Republic has printed a response to this article from Leo Linbeck, Chairman and CEO, Americans for Fair Taxation.

 This column was written by Cesar Conda.<br>Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani was recently in New Hampshire touting the 23 tax cuts he supposedly pushed through as mayor of New York City. He also announced his support for extending the Bush tax cuts and promoted other tax-relief measures he would advocate as president. <br> Upon closer inspection, however, Giuliani's record on taxes isn't as conservative as advertised. In fact, a nonpartisan independent organization found that Mayor Giuliani actually opposed significant tax cuts, and would have denied hundreds of millions of dollars in tax relief for New Yorkers had he gotten his way. <br> FactCheck.org, which is run by the non-partisan Annenberg School at the University Of Pennsylvania, has pointed out that Mayor Giuliani fought Republican efforts to kill the city's commuter tax, and actually went to court to keep it alive. In 1999, New York state senate Republicans called for an end to the tax, which amounted to .45 percent of earned income for most non-residents working in New York City. Giuliani not only opposed this tax cut, but said the commuter tax should be higher. The Giuliani administration went so far as to file suit to retain the tax, but ultimately and fortunately lost, which saved taxpayers in New York state, New Jersey, and Connecticut $360 million annually. <br> In another instance, FactCheck.org reported that Giuliani strenuously opposed a personal-income-tax-rate cut amounting to $469 million - but now claims credit for it as one of the 23 taxes he cut. In 1998, a 12.5 percent personal-income-tax surcharge was set to expire, but Giuliani fought to keep it in place, arguing that the city needed the tax revenue. A true supply-sider would have argued the opposite: Lower tax rates lead to higher tax revenue. The tax surcharge was allowed to expire only after Giuliani caved in to demands by the Democrats on the city council who supported killing the tax. <br> Rudy Giuliani's recent attempt to portray himself as Reaganite tax-cutter just doesn't square with the hard facts about his record opposing broad-based tax relief. The mayor honestly admits that he is more liberal than many Republicans on social issues, but has yet to admit that his economic record is similarly out of sync. Moreover, his refusal to sign Americans for Tax Reform's "Taxpayer Protection Pledge" raises serious doubts among economic conservatives about his commitment to keeping income-tax rates low. 
 This column was written by Stephen F. Hayes.<br>On March 11, Fred Thompson told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday that he was giving "serious consideration" to joining the race for president. Within a month he had made his decision: He would run. <br> Almost immediately, he was a first-tier candidate. News stories noted the intriguing new prospect, previously unenthusiastic Republican activists seemed invigorated, polling by news outlets and rival candidates showed Thompson as one of the top three Republicans. And he had not yet entered the contest. Times were good. So good, in fact, that Thompson joked about delaying any announcement indefinitely. <br> "I told somebody the other day: I can't afford to announce. I'm doing too well." <br> Now, after a series of well-publicized missteps and months of being subject to media scrutiny usually reserved for announced candidates, the opposite seems to be true: Thompson can't afford not to announce. <br> Although he had many friends and supporters encouraging him to join the race last spring, Thompson opted instead to form a "testing-the-waters" committee that enabled him to raise money and begin putting together a campaign operation. But Thompson's noncampaign has been marked by lackluster fundraising and personnel issues more characteristic of the final days of a losing campaign than the first days of a winning effort. Thompson hired veteran Washington hand Tom Collamore to serve as his campaign manager and fired him a short time later. The top communications staffer was brought on and dismissed in similar fashion, and another press officer left, too. An early effort to raise $5 million in June came up short, and in an interview last week with the Politico's Jonathan Martin, Thompson acknowledged that the numbers from the summer would not impress. "I imagine we will fall off some in July and August and have a great September," he said. <br> There have been other difficulties. Thompson's team mishandled reports that he had lobbied for an abortion rights group in the early 1990s, strongly denying the story at first only to allow later that he didn't remember the details of those interactions. He told a tax reform group on videotape that he would "absolutely" sign legislation replacing the income tax with a consumption tax, but later said his answer was misunderstood. <br> Does any of this matter? Several Thompson supporters believe he made a mistake by waiting to join the race. They worry that his wink-and-a-nod candidacy has undermined his main strength: his ability to present himself as a plainspoken, no-nonsense conservative. What's more, they say, Thompson's refusal to actively campaign reinforces what rival campaigns have suggested is Thompson's chief weakness: laziness. 
 This column was written by Victor Davis Hanson.<br>George Bush is not a very popular fellow. <br> Witness the enraged reaction last week from critics to his suggestion that leaving Iraq now could have the same dire consequences as our withdrawal from Vietnam did. "It just boggles my mind, the distortions I feel are perpetrated here by the president," cried historian Robert Dallek. "Misleading rhetoric," chimed in Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa. <br> What is it about Bush that evokes such furor? <br> Let's start with the hard left, whether in Hollywood or the blogosphere, or among the academic elite. They hate George Bush. To them, his tax cuts, alliance with the religious right, opposition to abortion and gay marriage, and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq foster the image of an illiberal, imperial America. His strut and mangling of words are more salt in their wounds. <br> The mainstream Democratic Party has been pretty vocal in its dislike, too. Al Gore's veins bulge when he speaks of George Bush. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's lips curl. <br> Many Democratic politicians still smart from the loss of the 2000 election, when they won the popular vote but still lost the White House. By making an opposition president a constant target, Democrats only help their party in the national elections, as we saw in 2006. <br> That's why Democratic elders haven't really signed onto the president's occasionally progressive agenda: liberal immigration reform, big increases in entitlements and support for democracy-building abroad. <br> However venomous this current Democrat attack machine, it is somewhat similar to what Republicans did to Bill Clinton in the 1990s. That's what rough-and-tumble two-party politics is about. <br> Of course, there are even Bushophobes among Republicans and right-wingers. Ultra-conservatives don't like open borders or the president's big increases in federal spending. As neo-isolationists, they don't think Iraq is worth one dead Marine. <br> Now even mainstream Republicans are inching away from their lame duck president. These Republicans - Bush's base - are worried that the president's ratings have sunk low enough to sink them, too. <br> Overseas, the president continues to get no love. <br> Sophisticated Europeans don't like the idea that the world's most powerful military is run by a Texan with a twang and a Bible who's full of missionary zeal about changing the status quo. <br> Arab reformers aren't fans of the president, either, though you might think many should be. After all, for years, they faulted the United States for our support for authoritarian dictators. Then rode in George Bush with his high talk of universal freedom - and the obligation of the United States to use its resources to force democratic change upon a reluctant Middle East. <br> But talking is one thing, acting another. No Arab intellectual wishes to see Western force used against fellow Muslims - apparently even if they are murderous Saddamites or primordial al Qaeda jihadists. <br> Finally, there is at least one group whose hatred of Bush is more than welcome: bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorists. <br> Now, if you were to believe the criticisms of the president by many of the groups outlined above, it would follow that bin Laden would actually be delighted by Bush's "war on terror." <br> After all, Bush supposedly waged an unnecessary and divisive war that only empowered his enemies. The administration supposedly drove "moderates" into bin Laden's camp, divided the American public over Iraq and turned off allies with Guantanamo and wiretaps. We are surely less safe, it is argued, post-9/11. <br> But why then does bin Laden hate George Bush so passionately? He serially rants about the president. In October 2004 he even released a pre-election video addressed to Americans, lambasting Bush in hopes that he would lose the election. <br> The truth is that, thanks to Bush, bin Laden's original bases in Afghanistan are lost. His al Qaeda followers in Iraq are being systematically decimated - with the help of Sunni tribesmen repulsed by jihadist atrocities. A recent poll from the Pew Research Center revealed a precipitous drop in support among Middle Easterners for the tactics of suicide bombing, and a growing unpopularity for bin Laden himself. <br> Al Qaeda terrorists no doubt hate every American president. But bin Laden's venom for feisty George Bush is special, galvanized by the president's success in eroding al Qaeda militarily while trying to foster enough reform to ruin the terrorist organization politically. <br> George Bush's war on radical Islamic terrorists and their sponsors apparently makes a lot of widely different people uncomfortable. But the irony here is that bin Laden's dislike for the president should show Bush-haters here and abroad that he deserves some praise. Their common enemy is as enraged as he is reeling. <br> By Victor Davis Hanson Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Peter Beinart.<hr width="50%">What does Markos Moulitsas have against Mike Gravel? The ber-blogger recently called for exiling the longshot presidential candidate from future Democratic debates. "Mike Gravel is a waste of our time," he wrote in an August 7 post. "[He's] a running joke." <br> That's an odd assessment coming from the founder of Daily Kos. Every time Gravel gets behind a lectern, he flays the Democratic Party for knuckling under to militarists and corporations. In other words, he sounds just like Markos Moulitsas. Gravel was a hero of the anti-Vietnam fight and is arguably the most radical Democrat running for president. (Dennis Kucinich comes close, but Moulitsas doesn't much like him, either.) It's understandable that Moulitsas and his Kossacks wouldn't support a quixotic candidate like the former senator from Alaska, but you'd think they would at least afford him some respect the way Ralph Reed treated Alan Keyes in 2000. You might even think they would want him on stage, pushing the Democratic debate to the left. Instead, they mock the poor guy. In the most recent poll of Kos readers, he got 1 percent. <br> Gravel's sin? He's impractical. It's not just that he doesn't have a prayer of becoming president it's that he doesn't seem to care. The thing that set Moulitsas off was Gravel's discussion of his national sales tax at the YearlyKos presidential debate. Moulitsas disapproves of the tax on its merits, but what really angered him was Gravel's acknowledgement that the proposal would never pass. "At least Kucinich pretends his agenda matters," he fumed. "Gravel won't even give us that courtesy." <br> It's no secret that Moulitsas cares more about victory than ideology. He's said it repeatedly. But it's worth pausing for a moment to recognize how remarkable this ultra-pragmatism is. As long as there has been an American left, American leftists have been arguing about their relationship to "the system." Can fundamental change come through one of the two major parties, or through the ballot box at all? Or must the system itself be overthrown through some sort of direct action? <br> For at least a century, this debate has been playing itself out again and again. It's Samuel Gompers versus Bill Haywood in 1905. Walter Lippmann versus John Reed in 1917. Franklin Roosevelt versus Norman Thomas in 1932. Bayard Rustin versus Stokely Carmichael in 1964. Michael Harrington versus Tom Hayden in 1968. Al Gore versus Ralph Nader in 2000. The outsiders have generally lost, but they have been a powerful force. Haywood's Industrial Workers of the World with its call for a revolutionary general strike enjoyed real strength in the pre-World War I American West. In 1932, 53 prominent intellectuals, including THE NEW REPUBLIC's Edmund Wilson and Malcolm Cowley, signed a statement demanding "the establishment of a workers' and farmers' government which will usher in the Socialist Commonwealth." And by 1965, after Lyndon Johnson spurned the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and escalated the Vietnam war, much of the New Left abandoned electoral politics in favor of outright resistance. <br> Today, by contrast, the debate is so lopsided that it barely qualifies as a debate at all. Among the netroots, it's taken as a virtual given that the best way to fundamentally change America isn't just to work through the political system, but through one of the two major parties and, at the presidential level, through mainstream candidates. (Even in 2004, the netroots overwhelmingly favored Howard Dean who at that point didn't want to withdraw troops from Iraq over Kucinich, who did.) The netroots aren't infinitely flexible, of course. Had Joe Lieberman won the Democratic nomination in 2004, some might have bailed. But, by historical standards, they're at the pragmatic extreme. Perhaps no progressive movement in U.S. history has so wholly identified itself with one party and with the political system writ large. That's the movement's great strength and, potentially, its greatest weakness. <br> What explains the netroots' faith in the Democratic Party? First, as Jonathan Chait has noted ("The Left's New Machine," May 7, 2007), they are using the right as a model. Between 1964 and 1980, the conservative movement captured the GOP. And, since then, the divide between movement groups like the Christian Coalition and the party itself has largely disappeared, with right-wing activists taking over the party in state after state. But just because conservatives took over the GOP doesn't explain why the netroots were so confident they could do the same in the Democratic Party. After all, although movement conservatives faced cultural barriers in overthrowing old-guard Rockefeller Republicans, they never threatened the people who paid the party's bills. Indeed, starting in the 1970s, corporate America's new hostility to government regulation meshed nicely with the concerns of the Goldwaterites and Christian conservatives then crashing the GOP's gates. The Democratic Party, by contrast, relies on big donations from people sharply at odds with the economic leanings of the netroots. (Though the netroots may be changing that by becoming a significant source of donations themselves.) After the 1990s when Democrats became more dependent on corporate money and Bill Clinton pushed an aggressive free-trade agenda it would have been reasonable for some on the left to argue that a progressive movement couldn't take over the Democratic Party in the way conservatives took over the GOP, and that the anti-corporate left needed to build a party of its own. <br> In fact, someone did make that argument: Ralph Nader. And herein lies another explanation for the netroots' devotion to the Democrats. There have been lots of progressive third-party candidates in U.S. history Eugene Debs, Robert La Follette, Norman Thomas, Henry Wallace all arguing that, even if they didn't win, they would push American politics to the left. Whether they succeeded is debatable. But, until Nader, no progressive third-party candidate had dramatically pushed American politics to the right as Nader did when he helped elect George W. Bush. In the process, he discredited progressive third parties for a generation. Had Nader once a liberal icon showed up at YearlyKos, he probably would have been booed. 
 This column was written by Fred Barnes.<br>It's not particularly visible at the moment, but there is a road to political recovery for Republicans. Chances are they won't get far enough down it to recapture the House or Senate or even hold the White House in 2008. But they might. <br> Three things have to happen for Republicans to recover in effect, a political hat trick. Events must work in their favor, notably in Iraq. Democrats must screw up badly. And Republicans must change their ways, in a compelling fashion. This last requirement may be the toughest. <br> Let's start with events. The debate over whether a war gone bad in Iraq was the primary cause of sweeping Republican losses in last year's midterm election will never be resolved. Clearly the war hurt more than a little. Just as clearly, a turnaround in Iraq would help enormously. <br> But even if the "surge" is as successful as it appears it might be, there's a problem. While public support has increased recently, the war still faces deep-seated opposition. There's a widespread view that its cost in lives, money and national prestige has been too high. This won't change overnight. Public opinion isn't quite that fickle. <br> It's not immutable, however. What if military success by Gen. David Petraeus, the American commander, is matched by a political breakthrough engineered by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki? Or matched by the acceleration of political reconciliation at the provincial rather than the national level in Iraq? Either scenario is possible. <br> Grass-roots reconciliation is already spreading at a pace not far behind military gains. And this, after all, is the formula on which the surge was based that success in fighting al Qaeda, Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias would be accompanied by, or lead to, political progress. Should the situation continue to improve, American attitudes about the war, President Bush and Republicans, would surely improve, marginally at least and perhaps a bit more. <br> Nothing would boost Republicans more than visible progress in Iraq, yet other conceivable events would help. Mr. Bush can't erase the memory of his inept handling of Hurricane Katrina. But if another disaster occurred and the president responded effectively, that would counteract the memory of his Katrina performance. <br> So would a serious confrontation with Congress over spending, assuming Mr. Bush and Republicans win public approval as thoughtful budget cutters. And so, too, would the absence of an economic downturn as the president prepares to leave office enhance the reputation of Republicans for pursuing sensible economic policies. In short, a positive turn of events, while unpredictable, is the best hope of the GOP. <br> A spectacular Democratic blunder? Republicans shouldn't count on it. Democrats have downplayed cultural issues like abortion and gun control that alienated voters in the past. They championed organized labor's agenda, but the most egregious items (ending secret ballot certification elections and unionizing Transportation Security Administration employees) failed to pass and are now forgotten. Democrats tried mightily to force a troop drawdown in Iraq and failed there, too. This may revive, over the long term, their reputation for weakness on national security. For now, they're OK. 
 This column was written by the editors of National Review Online.<br>Advocates of a national sales tax to replace the income tax have built an impressive grassroots army. They have given their idea an appealing, if somewhat gimmicky, name: the Fair Tax. And they have managed to get five Republican presidential candidates to suggest that they would sign a sales-tax bill if it reached their desk. Some observers credit the enthusiasm of the Fair Taxers for Gov. Mike Huckabee's surprisingly strong showing in the Iowa straw poll. Huckabee is the candidate most committed to the Fair Tax. <br> Former senator Fred Thompson is, however, backing away from the idea. Fair Tax advocates have released a video in which Thompson, asked about the proposal, appears to say he would "absolutely" sign it if elected. On August 10, however, Thompson wrote those advocates a letter that said merely that the Fair Tax was a good starting point in thinking about tax reform. <br> Mitt Romney's campaign says that the Fair Tax has some attractive elements, but that the candidate would need to see details before making any pledges. Rudolph Giuliani has said that he does not think he would sign any such legislation. <br> The leading candidates are right to be wary. The tax code needs major reform to become fairer, simpler and more efficient. The Fair Tax is one instantiation of those goals, but its political impracticality makes it fatally flawed. If conservatives force a choice between a Fair Tax and no tax reform at all, the latter is what they are likely to get. <br> There is widespread confusion about what the Fair Tax would entail. If you bought $100 of clothing and paid a $30 tax on it, you would probably think you had paid a 30 percent tax. The Fair Taxers say that you paid a 23 percent tax: $30 is 23 percent of the $130 you paid in total. When they say they want a 23 percent tax, that's what they mean. <br> Since there would be no more income tax in this system, there would also be no more standard exemption to make sure that the basic necessities of life went untaxed. The Fair Taxers would solve this problem by sending out monthly "prebate" checks to all Americans. <br> The great, undeniably attractive selling point of the Fair Tax is that it would allow the country to dispense with the IRS. But the sad truth is that if the federal government is going to collect as much money as it currently does which the Fair Taxers say their system would its methods of tax collection will inevitably be intrusive. The real difference between the current system and this proposal is that the primary brunt of tax collection will be borne by a smaller group of people: business owners. <br> Over time, then, enforcement measures could become more draconian than they are today: especially since a massive retail sales tax would create a massive incentive to evade it. That's why every country that has ever tried to impose retail sales taxes this high has quickly moved to a Value Added Tax levied at every stage of production. Consumers rarely see or keep track of these taxes, and they seem to be fairly easy for governments to raise. <br> These pitfalls are beside the point, however, since a national sales tax is not going to become law. No presidential candidate could be elected on a sales-tax platform, and no Congress would enact one if he were. <br> A candidate who ran on the national sales tax would be able to run on nothing else. He would have to spend all of his time defending the idea. Off the top of our heads, we can think of three devastating lines of attack an opponent could use in television ads. One ad could argue that getting rid of the mortgage deduction would send home prices into free fall (something that voters are going to find especially worrisome now). Another could ask why senior citizens, having paid taxes all their lives as they made income, should have to spend their retirements paying taxes on everything they use that money to buy. A third could simply ask voters if they look forward to paying a brand new tax. <br> There are answers to each attack. But no Republican candidate, especially in the daunting environment of 2008, is going to want to have to make them. Republicans cannot win a national election without the tax issue. If they ran on the national sales tax, Republicans would be taking one of their natural strengths and making it into a liability. Which is why we expect them to say nice things about the Fair Taxers' passion, and move on.By the editors of National Review Online Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Jim Geraghty.<br>Suppose you're an undecided Republican voter with mixed feelings about the big-name Republican presidential candidates. You respect John McCain, but he doesn't look like a viable option which is just as well since he bugged you with his crusade for speech-limiting campaign finance reform and lost you with the immigration deal with Ted Kennedy. <br> Mitt Romney has wowed you in the debates, but you can't forget that while you agree with all his positions, he had strikingly different ones not too long ago. And you would prefer a nominee who has won more than just one political race in his life. <br> You love Rudy Giuliani's crime-fighting record and 9/11 leadership, but the thought of a non-pro-life Republican nominee gives you pause and the messy home life troubles you a bit. <br> You were very excited about Fred Thompson, and nearly fainted with anticipation when you saw his smackdown of Michael Moore. But lately you feel like you're playing a character in "Waiting for Godot," and you're wondering if he got lost somewhere on the way to the announcement. <br> Those still shopping for a candidate could do a lot worse than former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who with the second-place finish in Ames is not merely now a "top tier" candidate, as Newt Gingrich recently declared, but arguably belongs in the middle of that first tier. <br> For four straight debates, Republicans have watched Huckabee and put him in the intriguing long-shot category. Smart guy, can turn an artful phrase or two, good executive experience with one big drawback: Who's actually going to vote for him? <br> But after his second-place finish at the Ames straw poll this past weekend, Huckabee can make the case that he's the candidate social conservatives can unify behind, with signs of appeal well beyond the "religious Right." And that's just what he did in a meeting with reporters and bloggers at the Monocle restaurant just off Capitol Hill Wednesday afternoon. <br> Like many of his rivals, Huckabee brings his own deviations from conservative orthodoxy from the table. Ordinarily when a presidential candidate declares that he's "for Main Street, not Wall Street" and laments that he doesn't want his party to stand for "the CEO making $100 million instead of the guy who gets laid off because of that," one's reflexively response is "oh, go back the hair salon, John Edwards." But these are Huckabee's words. <br> Make no mistake, without many policy specifics, Huckabee talks like a populist who would bring a tear to the eye of Bob Shrum. When he talks about the need for a president who knows what it's like to lose your job, "who can look into your eyes and know what it's like to not know how you're going to pay the rent, groceries, doctor's visits," it reminds one of that other former Arkansas governor, going on how much he feels someone's pain. <br> And yet, to follow a Republican president who's spent much of his second term under fire for being "out of touch," Huckabee's earnest emoting for the little guy might be a refreshing change of pace. Even during the better days of his administration, Bush has scored poorly on the "shares the concerns of people like you" poll question, suggesting that as a child of privilege, working-class Americans think he has little personal capacity to relate to their circumstances in hard time. <br> Hearing Huckabee refer to the Club for Growth as "The Club for Greed" is enough to make most free marketers take an angry spit-take. But opinion polls have shown for quite some time considerable national anxiety about the economy, despite a booming stock market and steady growth in the GDP. Huckabee's rhetoric may match the times, and with a Fortune magazine cover declaring "Business Loves Hillary!" and detailing how Wall Street has filled her coffers, one may wonder how many times a Republican presidential candidate must come running to the rhetorical aid of corporate executives. <br> Huckabee's populism comes out in odd ways at times he says he doesn't turn to the business page first, he turns to the sports page and the obituaries, and later says he his first step into a country club came at his 10-year class reunion but he stands out among the GOP contenders as the one who could obliterate Democrats' class-warfare instincts. In a match-up against Hillary Clinton, it's easy to imagine Huckabee using Al Gore's "I'm for the people, not the powerful" line against her. <br> While Huckabee has cut some taxes, he's also raised taxes, including Arkansas' gasoline tax which he quickly points out was approved by 80 percent of state voters and he says, met a dire need. "Trucker's magazine said we had the worst roads in the country," Huckabee says. "Five years later, they said we had the most improved." He points out that his state has a disproportionately high amount of miles of state-managed road, and a disproportionately low level of funding to take care of it. When Huckabee talks about spending money to invest in infrastructure well, his line that "our infrastructure is the skeleton of our economy" sounds a little different after the Minnesota bridge collapse. <br> He answers foreign-policy queries like a governor right-sounding generalities. On Iraq, while criticizing some of the postwar decisions (like deBaathification), he says he believes the surge is working, and cites not just the press accounts but personal conversation with a college friend, a colonel in the Army, who is working with General Petraeus. Asked what he would do differently today, he says he wants more diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iraq's neighbors. His preferred message: "We've got our finger in the dike, and we're not going to keep it there forever. If it bursts, we're not going to fix it. You guys can't sit on the sidelines." <br> The overall package is a unique Republican offering: a vague populist with a fresh face who has quietly accumulated 10 years of executive experience. He's a smooth communicator folksy, but not too much so (it's hard to imagine him responding to a question about lobbying for an abortion group with a Zen-like "the flies are buzzing"). <br> Shining in the spotlight like his Arkansas-shaped gold cuff links, this is Mike Huckabee's moment. <br> By Jim Geraghty Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by John B. Judis.<br>Every political reporter has a Karl Rove story, and I have mine. I met Rove in Austin in 1995, when I was writing a profile of presidential aspirant Phil Gramm. Rove had done direct mail for Gramm's campaigns for Senate, and I expected nothing but praise for the senator. Rove did praise him, but he would occasionally interject a surprisingly critical note about Gramm. He said that people in Texas were "sick of being dunned for money" by Gramm. Gramm was, Rove said, "one of the least flexible men I've ever met in public policy." I left the interview very proud of myself for having cleverly extracted these candid admissions from a Gramm supporter. They went directly into my profile of Gramm. Several years later, I realized that Rove had known exactly what he was doing. He was already working for George W. Bush, had his eye on a Bush presidency in 2000 and didn't want to do anything to help a rival Texas politician. <br> In this incident and in hundreds of others Rove showed himself to be a master of political guile. In managing Bush's election in 2000 and reelection in 2004, he also showed himself to be an expert tactician. But Rove has always wanted to be remembered as something more than a successful consultant he wants to be remembered as "the architect," in George W. Bush's words, of a new realignment that would do for the Republican party what Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal did for the Democratic Party. As early as 1998, Rove was predicting that the 2000 election would be a realigning election similar to that of 1896. "I look at this time as 1896, the time where we saw the rise of William McKinley and his vice president, Teddy Roosevelt ... That was the last time we had a shift in political paradigm," Rove told the Austin American-Statesman in November 1998. Rove suggested that in 2000 a "charismatic leader" championing a "new paradigm" could displace "the old paradigm of Cold War politics and the old New Deal." Now who could he have been referring to? <br> Rove continued to promote the 1896 analogy during the 2000 election, promising a new Republican realignment that would include Hispanics, suburbanites, and independents, but Vice President Al Gore's popular vote edge temporarily stilled Rove's talk of realignment. After the 2002 election, however, he was back again talking up 1896 and realignment. He told an audience at the University of Utah after the November election that it wasn't just that Republicans had won seats in Congress in the first off-year election, but that they had picked up 195 state legislative seats when on average the party in power is expected to lose 350. "We are 545 seats ahead of where we should [be] if we were suffering the normal depredations of the first off-year election," Rove declared. "I think something ... fundamental is happening there, but we will only know it retrospectively, in two years or four years or six years [when we] look back and say the dam began to break in 2002." <br> After Bush's victory in 2004, Rove was at it again. Here he is with Mike Wallace: <br> ROVE: It does. We'll only tell with time. I mean, the victory in 1896 was similarly narrow, and I mean not narrow, similarly structured. But it took you know, we only knew that it was an election that realigned American politics years afterwards. And I think the same thing will be here. <br> What, then, is Rove's political legacy? In his public statements about the 2002 and 2004 elections, Rove dutifully credited Bush and the "Bush agenda," but in his discussions with political journalists, he conveyed a different message: that these victories were the product of a novel new strategy that he had developed after 2000. The new strategy consisted of expanding the Republican base in the "exurbs" and rural areas; using a "72-Hour Task Force" to mobilize that base on election day; and using discrete spending programs and micro-targeting to pick off vulnerable Democratic constituencies among Hispanics, African-Americans, and Catholics. The theory was that with demography favoring the Republicans, these tactical maneuvers would be sufficient to guarantee a Republican majority. In "One Party Country," a laudatory book about Rove that appeared before the 2006 election, Los Angeles Times reporters Tom Hamburger and Peter Wallsten wrote that "like a dominant sports franchise, the Republican Party has put in place a series of structural and operational advantages that give the GOP a political edge for the foreseeable future." 
 This column was written by John Nichols.<br>In a Congress where it has become fashionable to gripe about earmarks of a few hundred thousand dollars to pay for small-town museums and urban parks and, until last week, for construction and repair of bridges the most expensive waste and corruption is always contained in the annual Department of Defense appropriation. Nowhere in the whole of the budgetary blueprint for allocating tax dollars could a serious observer of federal programs find more bloat, inefficiency, hidden excess and overt overspending that in the Defense plan. <br> Yet, while members in both parties preach from their bully pulpits about the need to do away with earmarks, the House with virtually no debate on Sunday approved $459.6 billion in new money for the Pentagon. You want earmarks? "This bill has more than 1,300 earmarks. The notion that these had proper review is simply not reasonable," said Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who gave a good speech but still joined the overwhelming majority of House members in voting for every one of those earmarks and the rest of the $459.6 billion in spending. <br> Of course, that amount does not include the extra $147 billion in Iraq war funding that the Bush administration has demanded that Congress approve when the Congress returns from its August recess. <br> Nor does it include the include the various and sundry additional requests to cover nuclear weapons costs, international FBI expenses, the rising demands of the General Services Administration's National Defense Stockpile and Selective Services requirements. Add on debt costs attributable to defense spending and, according to authoritative Center for Defense Information estimates, U.S. taxpayers will dole out at least $878 billion to cover military costs in 2008. <br> As CDI notes, the final total "will probably be even more." <br> The key word there is "probably," because even the most skilled analysts can never place a precise figure on what the Pentagon is or will be spending. <br> What is certain is the fact confirmed by conservative and liberal analysts that the bloated defense budget contains waste on a scale unimaginable to even the most ardent earmarkers. <br> So why was there no serious debate on the Pentagon budget? It's not just that the Bush administration and its Republican allies in Congress continue to use the war on terror as an excuse to enrich defense contractors such as Dick Cheney's Halliburton. As Winslow Wheeler, a veteran of 31 years working with mostly Republican senators on defense issues and a former assistant director of evaluations of national defense programs with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, "Now in control of Congress and having made multiple promises to restore oversight of the war in Iraq and the executive branch in general, the Democrats have been successfully rolled by the White House, the military services, and the big spender pundits." <br> Adds Wheeler, who now directs CDI's Straus Military Reform Project, "Knowing a patsy when they see one, the defense contractors are now piling on" And they are getting a lot more "free money" than any of the communities across the U.S. that hope for a tiny earmark here or there to pay for a new bike path or a polka museum. <br> So how many members of the House refused to get rolled? Not many. The final vote on the Pentagon appropriation for the 2008 fiscal year was 395-13. The "no" votes came from: California's Bob Filner, Barbara Lee and Lynn Woolsey, Georgia's John Lewis, Massachusetts' Barney Frank, Minnesota's Keith Ellison, New York's Nydia Velzquez, Oregon's Earl Blumenauer; New Jersey's Donald Payne, Ohio's Dennis Kucinich, Washington's Jim McDermott and Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin all Democrats and a single Republican "fiscal conservative": Michigan's Vernon Ehlers. <br> Twenty-four additional members, 14 Republicans and 10 Democrats, did not vote. Two Republican presidential candidates were among their number: Texan Ron Paul and Colorado's Tom Tancredo. <br> Kucinich, it should be noted, is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. <br> So far, he is the only contender for the presidency to actually come out against the most excessive and irresponsible spending in the federal budget. <br> Other presidential candidates Democrats Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Chris Dodd an Joe Biden and Republicans John McCain and Sam Brownback will have a chance to vote on the Pentagon spending bill after the August recess. <br> How they vote will tell Americans everything that needs to be known about who is "fiscally responsible" and who is not. <br> By John NicholsReprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by The Weekly Standard.<br>There's no obvious way to measure such a thing, but as a matter of intuition, you'd have to say that the most hated people in America today are sensible Democrats. The hard-core partisans of the Democratic left have never had a bigger megaphone than they now have on the Internet, and while they are united in the view that George W. Bush is public enemy No. 1, with Alberto Gonzales and Karl Rove alternating in the No. 2 slot, what really pumps up the volume is any sign of deviationism on their own side. <br> This is an especially acute problem for the Democratic foreign policy establishment the people who will actually be staffing a Clinton or Obama administration at the National Security Council, the State Department and the Pentagon. Whether you agree with them on policy or not, they are serious people who recognize they're going to have to deal with the world as it is. Unfortunately, this sensibility often runs afoul of the netroots view that the world flowed with milk and honey until Bush ruined everything. <br> When Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack of the Brookings Institution travel to Iraq and report on the New York Times op-ed page that conditions there are improving, they aren't doing so in order to give aid and comfort to the Bush administration, but because as a defense expert and regional expert respectively, that's what they are seeing. Nevertheless, they were flayed alive by angry left-wing bloggers, who challenged everything from their qualifications to their competence to their honesty to their eyesight. <br> The policy and political headquarters for sensible Democrats has long been the Democratic Leadership Council, which was founded in response to Walter Mondale's massive defeat running as an orthodox liberal against Ronald Reagan in 1984. The DLC was closely associated with Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign as a "New Democrat" a centrist candidate, that is, who was not beholden to the party's traditional constituencies. Only by moving to the center, such key DLC figures as Al From and Bruce Reed argued, could Democrats expect to achieve national majorities. <br> The DLC had its annual "National Conversation" late last month in Nashville, and the headline was who didn't show: namely, any of the candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. Why not? Maybe because, as Noam Scheiber put it in another New York Times op ed, the DLC is now "radioactive" for the Democratic mainstream and especially its netroots agitators. Long ago, Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas pronounced a fatwa on the DLC and all its works, and his hostility to any suggestion that the left wing of the party needs to tone it down a bit for national consumption is now ubiquitous. <br> It's certainly shared by Scheiber, who bade to offer a eulogy for the DLC: "Two decades of work by the Democratic Leadership Council and a not inconsiderable assist from President Bush have made the Democratic Party the healthiest it has been in the 22 years of the council's existence. Democrats should thank the group and then tell it that it's no longer needed." Blogger Susan S at the Daily Kos (where antipathy toward the New Republic, Scheiber's employer, occasionally reaches the level of its disgust for the DLC) celebrated his piece under the headline, "Noam Scheiber Puts the Final Nail in the DLC Coffin." <br> A sure sign that you are in the fever swamps of partisan politics is that "final nail" locution: The blogger at Daily Kos so wants the DLC dead that she will pronounce it dead whether or not that makes the slightest bit of sense. Which, of course, it doesn't. The idea that the DLC is dead, or for that matter that it will happily go away in response to being told "it's no longer needed," is just fantasy. <br> It's obviously true that the Democratic Party is on a roll feisty, and reveling in its own success. And no one can dispute that the number of Democrats willing to call themselves "liberals" has been on the rise, in step with a decline in the percentage of Democrats who call themselves moderate or centrist. Seven years in opposition to a president you have regarded as illegitimate from the outset will indeed increase partisan solidarity, which in turn reduces the need for internal differentiation, such as between "New Democrats" and old. Put it this way: If you're a Democrat and the administration of George W. Bush hasn't brought out your inner liberal, nothing will. <br> Unlike Daily Kos, Scheiber understands that the DLC has had something to do with the current success of the Democratic Party. Yes, Democrats, left to themselves, will increase taxes and spending both, as well as regulation of the economy. They will dream glorious dreams about getting rid of guns. But as a practical matter, and thanks in large part to the DLC centrists, they will do none of these things to the same extent a Mondale administration would have which is, as the DLC says, the reason there was no Mondale administration. <br> When Bill Clinton said in 1996, "The era of big government is over," he didn't mean that the era of small or even shrinking government had begun, but he did mean that massive new bureaucratic "solutions" to social problems were no longer on the agenda, and they have remained off ever since, relegated to Democratic fantasies about a better world with no Republicans in it. <br> Democrats have been in a triumphalist mood before: in 1993-1994, when they were in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. In its grip, the early Clinton administration lost its connection with the "New Democrat" agenda of the campaign. The political strategy was not bipartisanship but a reliance on the Democratic congressional majorities to produce the votes necessary to enact legislation. And besides the tax increases and "stimulus package" of spending, the most prominent item on the administration's agenda was a health care reform that looked all too massive and bureaucratic. <br> If Democrats conclude they don't need to reach to the center any more, they will be behaving just as foolishly as they did 14 years ago, and as House Republicans did in 2005-06, when most all the legislative action seemed focused on buttering up social conservatives. Understanding this has been the specialty of the DLC for two decades, and Democrats still need it. <br> By Tod Lindberg 
 Weekly commentary by CBS Evening News chief Washington correspondent and Face the Nation host <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/bob-schieffer/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Bob Schieffer</span>.<hr width="25%">Congress passed a tough ethics reform bill last week. Washington ethics has become such an oxymoron that ethics reform usually draws a yawn, but it shouldn't this time. <br> The FBI investigation of Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, which coincidentally came to the fore as the bill passed, shows how badly it was needed. <br> Stevens is no newcomer just learning the rules. He is 83 and the longest serving Republican Senator ever. He is an expert at bringing home federal dollars to his state and, in one case, slipped a secret request into a federal spending bill to obtain 1.6 million dollars for an Alaskan Marine Biology Center. <br> What raised questions is that the Center then used the money to buy some land from the business partner of Stevens' son. <br> Legal or not, is that how the rest of us want out tax money spent? <br> Then there is the other part. The FBI wants to know why an Alaskan Energy Company that does a lot of business with the government, and whose owner has pleaded guilty to bribing state legislators, apparently took over the remodeling of the Senator's house. <br> The Senator claims no wrongdoing, but who would even put themselves in such a position? <br> The new law is not perfect, but it will make it harder to do all those things. <br> As for Stevens, a friend says he sincerely believes he has done nothing wrong. To me, that's the most damning part. If that is what one of the Capitol's longest serving legislators really believes, then there is no question tougher laws were needed. 
 This column was written by Jonathan Cohn.<br>In New Hampshire on Tuesday, Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani released a new health care plan except that it is not really new and it's not much of a plan. <br> Instead, it's just a two-page summary of Giuliani's general approach to reform which, from the looks of it, is closely modeled on an idea President Bush proposed in January of this year. While there may be some differences between the two it's impossible to know, since the campaign isn't getting into such details it's fair to judge Giuliani's proposal based on the verdict experts rendered when Bush trotted out his idea. And that verdict wasn't too good. At best, the Bush plan would have made only a small dent in the number of people without insurance at a time when even other Republicans were endorsing far more sweeping schemes. And at worst? It could have resulted in more people struggling with their health bills. <br> Since that time, of course, two of the leading Democratic candidates (John Edwards and Barack Obama) have published detailed proposals of considerably greater ambition, with a third (Hillary Clinton) likely to follow soon. By that standard, Giuliani's proposal seems even more diminutive. But does that bother the former mayor? Probably not. In the last few days, he's spent as much time trashing those Democratic ideas as promoting his own. For Giuliani, you get the feeling, it's all about what his plan isn't (Michael Moore, Cuba, "socialized medicine") rather than what it is. Or, to put it more bluntly, it's about stopping universal health care not achieving it. <br> Which, perhaps, is a good thing. Giuliani hasn't made a meaningful contribution to the policy debate. But he has offered an important preview of what universal health care's opponents will say during the presidential campaign and afterwards, if Congress seriously takes up the issue. <br> The central feature of Giuliani's proposal would be a tax deduction of up to $15,000, available to all Americans who buy an insurance policy regardless of whether they buy it on their own or through an employer. That's a change from the present setup, in which only people who buy coverage through employers get the break. <br> Making the tax treatment of individual insurance more like that for employer insurance could have far-reaching effects. Most experts agree that the tax break for employer-sponsored insurance has been instrumental in propping up our existing health insurance system, in which it's assumed most working people will get coverage through their jobs. That's been particularly true in the last few years, as employers have grown weary of bearing such a huge financial burden on behalf of their workers. Reducing or eliminating that preference will likely weaken the system further, because as fewer workers demanded such coverage even fewer employers would provide it. <br> In principle, that would be just fine employer-based health insurance is nobody's idea of a perfect system just as long as Giuliani proposed to create something in its place. But there's no such effort from Giuliani. Instead, he'd just let people shop around in the individual insurance market, buying whatever policies they could find. <br> And here's where the problems start. People with pre-existing conditions and if you have even a minor condition, like allergies, that means people like you frequently can't find affordable coverage because insurers won't offer it. (Or, if they do offer coverage, it will be prohibitively priced.) Giuliani hails his approach as giving consumers more choices. But for these people, it'd actually mean less choice or no choice at all. <br> That's one reason that, at the end of the day, Giuliani's plan is unlikely to make a significant dent in the uninsured. Another is that tax deductions, by definition, are worth less to people who are in lower tax brackets who, as you might imagine, tend to make up the bulk of the people without health insurance. In a recent analysis of the latest Bush proposal on which, again, the Giuliani proposal is patterned the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities noted that married couples with taxable incomes between roughly $15,000 and $60,000 (the second lowest tax bracket) would get a tax break of $2,250. That's not chump change, for sure, but when group coverage for the average family costs $12,000 and when individual coverage costs much more than that, as it does because of higher overhead and marketing expenses for insurers who sell to that market it's easy to see why few analysts think it will enable many more people to buy coverage. <br> Precisely what result this produces is unclear, since some of the details are murky and Giuliani has said he won't put out specific numbers for a few months. (My efforts to clarify the plan were fruitless. Giuliani's advisers referred me to the official organizing committee; a spokesperson there, Maria Comella, referred me to the speech and official campaign materials) Among the key unanswered questions: Would Giuliani cap the existing employer deduction at $15,000 for a family, like Bush would, or simply offer an individual tax credit worth up to that amount? For the poor, would he offer the deduction as a refundable credit, which would be worth more? Would he pay for it with cuts in Medicaid? <br> Still, it looks like the Giuliani proposal will be relatively close to the schemes which Bush has proposed, about which we do know quite a bit. A year ago, after Bush first floated an embryonic version of his proposal, economist Jason Furman wrote in the National Tax Journal that "Empirical estimates show that eliminating the tax incentive for employer-provided insurance, without creating another pooling arrangement, could increase the number of people without insurance even in a relatively limited proposal like that of President Bush." What's more, research has suggested that those getting insurance will probably be relatively healthy, while those losing it will be relatively unhealthy. <br> Some might complain that Furman, though a well-respected economist in his own right, worked in the Clinton White House and frequently advises Democrats. (As it happens, that's true of most highly regarded economists who work on health care. Make of that what you will.) But the Joint Committee on Taxation came to the same conclusion. Even the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which is part of the administration, strained to put an attractive gloss on this idea when Bush trotted it officially out this year. Its own evaluation, under favorable assumptions, suggested the proposal would reduce the number of uninsured by 3 to 5 million meaning around 40 million people still wouldn't have coverage. <br> In sheer scope, that's a far cry from what Giuliani's counterparts the ones seeking the Democratic nomination are proposing. In fact, it's not even close to comparable. <br> Why might Giuliani support such an approach? One possibility is that he simply doesn't think the problem of people losing health insurance is, well, a problem. Among Giuliani's advisers is David Gratzer of the Manhattan Institute. Gratzer, a physician, is a smart and prolific writer. And among his many articles are repeated protestations that the problem of the uninsured is significantly overstated because, among other things, a lot of them are already eligible for public programs or lose coverage for only part of the year. <br> Gratzer's other passion which he shares with Sally Pipes of the Pacific Research Institute, another Giuliani adviser is deep opposition to universal health care. Both Gratzer and Pipes are Canadian by birth. Both have spent enormous time warning people that health care in their country means long waits, no cutting-edge care, and maddening bureaucracy. And what's true of Canada, they suggest, would be true of any system giving insurance to everybody. "A universal health-care system run by government will reduce the quality and access to health care for all Americans," Pipes wrote for National Review Online in 2003. "It's a prescription for disaster." <br> This is a pretty good harbinger of how the debate over universal health care will play out should it become a huge, all-encompassing fight in 2009, just like it was in 1993 and 1994 when Bill Clinton tried it. Conservatives will promise a little help, for some people, but mostly they'll tell scare stories about universal health care. <br> And the arguments are weak. People eligible for public programs frequently don't sign up because enrollment procedures are so difficult, frequently by design since states are reluctant to spend too much money on them. (Put another way, if everybody eligible for these programs signed up, the states would quickly find other ways to reduce their public programs, probably by limiting eligibility.) If somebody loses insurance for only part of the year, it's still a problem particularly if it coincides with a medical problem, which will very quickly induce serious financial distress. Indeed, if anything the 40-something million figures understate the problem. Studies have shown that 80 million Americans over a quarter of the population lose insurance at some point during a two-year period. That's a lot of people worrying about medical bills and, in many cases, rationing their own care because they fear the cost. <br> As for the supposed deficiencies of systems abroad, that's been covered pretty exhaustively in these pages before as well as by folks like Kevin Drum, Matthew Holt, Paul Krugman, Maggie Mahar, and Ezra Klein. But just in case anybody needs a refresher, the horror stories abroad have been wildly exaggerated. A lot of those supposedly inferior countries seem to get overall results that are as good, if not better, than the U.S. while spending less. And the best countries like France, Germany, Switzerland, take your pick do it while offering as much if not more convenience and immediacy than the U.S. does to its citizens. <br> Still, Giuliani's argument will likely resonate with a lot of voters thanks, in part, to Michael Moore. "Sicko" did a great service by highlighting the very real problems in American health care and stressing the far superior systems of (some) European countries. But his hyping of Cuba has given people like Giuliani an easy line of attack, like this quip from a speech on Monday: "Only Michael Moore, Hillary Clinton, [and] Barack Obama want to go to Cuba for health care." <br> Needless to say, neither Clinton nor Obama have ever said anything remotely of the sort. But maybe it's good that Giuliani puts this propaganda front and center now because it will force them and other universal health care advocates to start thinking up responses. <br> A new memo from the strategy firm of Democracy Corps, published last week, might help in that effort. Based on a recent poll, they concluded that the issue of insurance security whether you feel like your insurance will be there and take care of you resonates more than mere affordability how expensive your insurance is. Reasonable people can dispute the poll's true meaning. And, to be quite honest, I've often thought the opposite might be true. But the Democracy Corps conclusion does have a certain logic to it, given the rising number of people without insurance and the creeping sense, even among the insured, that their coverage won't be there when they need it. Keep in mind, too, that pollster Stanley Greenberg is one of the founders of Democracy Corps. He was Clinton's pollster during the 1993-94 debacle, so if anybody knows the perils of misinterpreting health-care polling, it's him. <br> If the finding is right, then the best rejoinder to Giuliani and others who make similarly flawed arguments may be to ignore the policy minutiae and focus on the big picture. A candidate who supports universal health care can make voters this promise: "You will have health insurance from the day you are born until the day you die, and nothing can take it away." Giuliani and his allies can't make the same promise. And maybe that's enough to do the trick, no matter how many times they scream about "socialism." <br> By Jonathan Cohn If you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by the editors of the Nation.<br>So now it's official. The New York Times has announced that "economic populism" is the new flavor in politics, and Democrats are lapping it up. Don't we wish. We have mixed feelings, because the "populist" story has a perennial quality. It's the flower that blooms in the springtime of presidential election cycles, then shrivels suddenly. The country has arrived at an important political moment possibly a watershed but this moment does not yet belong to the people. <br> In Washington parlance, the historic meaning of populism has been corrupted and trivialized as a sentimental oddity. The word is now invoked by the press and campaign operatives to say, Hey, the politicians are talking like they might actually do something for the folks. How quaint. In a political system accustomed to serving powerful interests, putting people first has become a man-bites-dog news story. <br> The original populism, the agrarian revolt of the late nineteenth century, was creative and robustly defiant of entrenched power. Oppressed farmers, humble people in the bleakest circumstances, forged their own politics and audaciously took on Washington and Wall Street (read Lawrence Goodwyn's The Populist Moment to learn the full, amazing saga of this bottom-up rebellion). The populists failed in the end to acquire governing power, but their agenda ultimately changed the nation. It was rich in big ideas about how to use government to protect society from the depredations of concentrated wealth and corporate power. Populists created an intellectual seedbed that influenced the next fifty years of progressive reform, climaxing in the New Deal. <br> This is what's missing from the Democrats' "new" populism the big ideas for fundamental change, the hardheaded analysis that confronts national decline in all its ugly manifestations. We know some Democrats yearn to begin this kind of broad-gauged assault on the status quo, and the new concern in party circles about income and wealth inequality is encouraging. But the party, and most presidential candidates, are still too shy on the big questions. Where is the party's comprehensive critique of taxation not just the wildly reactionary rate structure but the corrupted federal tax code, which allows the wealthiest players to decide for themselves how much tax they will pay (see David Cay Johnston's devastating reports in the New York Times and Perfectly Legal, his shocking book)? What do Democratic candidates have to say about how to redeem government as a trustworthy agent for the general welfare and an equitable society? The government's loss of integrity and effectiveness is growing, and citizens know the degradation did not originate with George W. Bush. To restore reliable government, a reforming party will have to cut corporate power down to a size society can tolerate. <br> How would the next Democratic president set out to redeem a dysfunctional regulatory system? It is not enough to say he or she would appoint better people and tell them to obey the law. Regulatory agencies people once trusted, like the Food and Drug Administration, have been captured by the industries they are supposed to regulate. <br> The dismantling of financial regulation, likewise, did not begin with Bush I or II or even Ronald Reagan. It began in the late 1970s, when Democrats were in power. Are the Dems prepared to address their big mistakes and begin the hard task of re-regulating the banking and financial systems to protect the people from the familiar spectacles of outrageous gouging and unpunished crimes of fraud? <br> If our nation is at a great turning point, an opening for momentous reforms, a party that seeks to win the governing majority cannot duck on any of these matters. We understand the hesitations; we are familiar with the obstacles. But to put it plainly, you cannot run on "populist" politics and count on robber barons to finance your campaigns. It might fool people for a season or two, but when nothing changes, they will punish the culprits. <br> Does a populist temperament still dwell in the American people the fighting spirit to reclaim citizenship and self-government? We are sure it does, though these aspirations are buried under cultural distractions and elite propaganda. The Nation will do its best to revive and encourage the democratic ethos, because it is only the people who have the power to force change on political institutions, including the Democratic Party. Forget the words and slogans. Populism cannot be authentic unless it is driven by and for the people.By the editors of the Nation Reprinted with permission from the The Nation 
 This column was written by Cesar Conda and Robert Stein.<hr width="50%">Tax reform has been the Holy Grail of conservative economists since the early 1990s. But after years of conservative ascendance in Washington, the tax code remains a mess. <br> Two major problems plague the flat tax, the retail sales tax, and other "big bang" tax reforms. First, utopianism. Ending the mortgage interest deduction might make perfect sense on a blackboard. But putting at risk the most valuable asset many taxpayers have is the equivalent of policy-making suicide. <br> Second, many free market economists treat families as an after-thought. As far as they are concerned, the tax code should be "neutral" about raising children. In effect, they say the U.S. government should be indifferent to whether the people that created it exist in the future. What these experts fail to recognize is that Social Security and Medicare have created a huge fiscal bias against raising children, "crowding out" the traditional motive to raise children to protect against old-age poverty, a bias that would exist even in a mandatory saving program. <br> We suggest a different approach to tax reform, one that achieves the major conservative policy goals of a simple, flatter, and fairer tax-and can be enacted with broad bipartisan support. The proposal would simplify the tax code-no more itemizing, no more alternative minimum tax-cut marginal tax rates on capital investment and high-income labor (the activities most sensitive to marginal rates), reduce the tax burden on the middle class and below, treat married couples as equal partners, and offset the anti-parent bias in Social Security and Medicare. <br> Rather than re-creating the tax code from scratch or imposing new taxes, we would make the following changes to the existing code. <br> First, remove impediments to capital investment. Cut the corporate tax rate to 32 percent and make cash dividends fully deductible at the corporate level (taxable as regular income for individuals). Reduce the corporate tax rate-currently the second highest in the industrialized world-to encourage equity financing of new investment, raising worker wages, and improving the competitiveness of U.S. firms. <br> Additionally, let firms expense 25 percent of plant and equipment in the year of purchase. Replace the separate tax structure for capital gains with a 100 percent exclusion for gains up to $5,000 and a 50 percent exclusion for long-term gains above that level. Eliminate the tax on inheritances. <br> Next, scrap the individual alternative minimum tax and every itemized deduction except two: mortgage interest and charitable donations. Make these two deductions available to all taxpayers, not just itemizers. Reduce the limit on the principal amount on which interest is to be deducted, but only to keep the total amount of mortgage interest deductions the same as under current law. Similarly, for the charitable deduction, adjust minimums, maximums, and verification standards to keep the amount the same as under current law. <br> After deductions, individuals face only two income tax brackets: 15 percent and 32 percent. Make the 15 percent bracket twice as wide for married couples as singles to acknowledge that husbands and wives share their incomes. Then apply credits based on family size to reduce taxes owed. <br> Replace the standard deduction and personal exemption for each filer with a nonrefundable credit of $2,000. (Married couples get up to $4,000; singles up to $2,000.) Replace the personal exemption for children, child credit, child care credit, and adoption credit by a new $4,000 credit per child that offsets both income taxes and payroll taxes. (Citizenship requirements would apply, and those taking the earned income credit could not take the child credit too.) Dependents not covered by the $4,000 credit get $500 instead. Given the generosity in the child credit, eliminate the "head-of-household" filing status and treat them as singles. Index the 15 percent brackets and filer credit for inflation; index the child credit for wages, like the Social Security tax base. <br> These changes would make a huge difference. The typical married couple with two children would get a tax cut of more than $5,000 per year. <br> Additionally, the plan promotes better health care by converting the employer deduction into a worker deduction with a cap, empowering consumers to purchase affordable health insurance. <br> The common arguments against a $4,000 child credit do not withstand scrutiny: <br> The child credit is a large transfer payment. Although it's called a "credit," it is not a lump-sum payment. It works like a deduction applicable against both income and payroll taxes. Taxpayers only get the full credit if they have enough earnings and taxes to offset. <br> Nonparents already pay for schools. When nonparents complain about having to pay school-related taxes, they are saying, in effect, that they were entitled to a free K-12 education without ever having to pay for one. <br> The proposal takes too many people off the tax rolls each year, increasing the public's appetite for more government spending. Workers move across income classes over time, which is why static tax distribution tables are often misleading. Given this dynamism, we should not be concerned with some workers falling off the tax rolls in a particular year, based on where they are in their life cycle. Parents will pay higher taxes when their kids grow up and parents with more after-tax income are less likely to demand government services. <br> For years, supply-siders and progressives have talked past each other. Our proposal lets both sides get their way. By using generous family-related credits and a reduced top marginal rate that kicks in at lower income levels, the tax code would become substantially more progressive. The rich would pay more but, with a lower top marginal tax rate, have better incentives to work harder and invest more. The middle class and those below would pay less and have their tax burden shifted away from the years when they need it the most, when they are raising children. By Cesar Conda and Robert Stein 
 This column was written by the editors of The Nation.<br>The sharp escalation of the power struggle between Hamas and Fatah, ending with Fatah's sudden collapse and the seizure of power in Gaza by Hamas, is a tragic turn of events for the Palestinian national movement but it's also bad news for Israel, even though some Israeli strategists mistakenly thought it was a good idea to foment civil strife. <br> Although the conflict was abetted by Israel and the United States, neither should be happy with the results, which will vastly complicate the already dismal chances for a peaceful resolution of the wider conflict. The recent events are a shocking demonstration of the failure of Bush administration policy in the region. <br> This disaster has many fathers. The steady growth of the Islamist movement cannot be understood apart from the long-term U.S. and Israeli strategy of undermining the secular Palestinian leadership. In 1993 PLO leader Yasir Arafat promised his people that the Oslo peace process would result in a Palestinian state. Instead, Israeli settlements rapidly expanded during the Oslo period, even as the Israeli closure policy which began in 1993 and has never let up shut off Palestinian workers from the Israeli labor market and limited freedom of movement inside the territories, resulting in severe economic depression. Popular disillusionment with the failures of Oslo helped bring about the second intifada in the fall of 2000. <br> During that uprising, the Israeli government, blaming Arafat and the Palestinian Authority for violence, did everything it could to weaken the PA leadership. It continued that policy when Mahmoud Abbas was elected president after Arafat's death. Further undermining secular Palestinian leadership was its corruption and misrule. The gold-plated palaces of potentates like Muhammad Dahlan were a standing insult to a Gaza population mired in desperate poverty. <br> The more direct cause of the Gaza mini-war lies in the Bush administration's cynical manipulation of "democracy promotion." This scheme has its origins in the attempts, five years ago, to push Arafat aside in favor of more pliable leaders, hence the steady calls from the administration for "reform" and elections. The Israeli government, with U.S. approval, imprisoned Arafat in Ramallah and then all but ignored Abbas, never pursuing serious negotiations or releasing prisoners, even as it continued construction of the separation wall and expansion of settlements in the West Bank. This further weakened Abbas and the secular leadership in the eyes of Palestinians. <br> Ariel Sharon's disengagement from Gaza was carried out without any consultation with Abbas's government, which allowed Hamas to claim that Islamist resistance had forced the pullout. When elections were finally held early last year, Palestinians rejected the discredited Fatah slate in favor of Hamas, whose victory had far more to do with the Islamist movement's lack of corruption and record as a provider of social services and its image of uncompromising resistance to occupation than popular support for its ideology. <br> Although the polling was remarkably open and democratic, the White House and the Israelis immediately set out to undermine the Hamas government through economic boycott and military subversion, funneling arms to Fatah militias. (According to recently retired UN special envoy Alvaro de Soto, the U.S. special envoy said earlier this year, "I like this violence," referring to increased fighting between Hamas and Fatah, because "it means that other Palestinians are resisting Hamas.") Many observers were surprised at the quick collapse of Fatah, assuming its superior numbers and weaponry would be decisive, but no amount of arms or numbers of men in uniform can make up for discredited leadership and lack of motivation among the rank and file. The plain fact is that more and more Palestinians have begun to see the clique around Abbas and Dahlan as sellouts, all too eager to accommodate U.S. and Israeli wishes. But the bloodshed has infuriated the population, and many are now disgusted with both Fatah and Hamas. <br> What to do? First, it's high time to cast aside illusions. We cannot accept Hamas's ideology, and we reject the idea that "Islam is the solution" to political problems (the common formulation of Hamas and other Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated movements). But the United States and Israel must finally acknowledge that Hamas is a popular movement with deep roots in Palestinian society, and for that reason should be engaged rather than ignored. A key function of diplomacy, after all, is to negotiate with one's enemies; there would be little need for it if all nations and political groups were on friendly terms. It is commonly argued that negotiations are impossible because Hamas will not recognize Israel and is bent on its destruction. But Hamas leaders have repeatedly stated that they can live with a two-state settlement, or at the very least a long-term hudna (truce). Both Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and his political adviser, Ahmed Yousef, have made this point in op-eds in the past month. <br> Yet Washington has quickly accepted Abbas's constitutionally illegitimate formation of a new emergency government. Further, it has promised to release massive amounts of aid and is reportedly pushing Israel to dismantle checkpoints on the West Bank and release prisoners, in this way hoping to facilitate a successful "Fatahland" on the West Bank that the Palestinians will compare favorably with a quarantined and boycotted "Hamastan" in Gaza. Israel should certainly ease pressure on Palestinians and turn over tax revenue owed them, and foreign aid is desperately needed. But any scheme to promote a more permanent division between the West Bank and Gaza, or to perpetuate Hamas's diplomatic isolation, is bound to increase tensions. And it can hardly bring about a viable peace agreement; arbitrary exclusion of a major, democratically elected Palestinian constituency in favor of malleable figures with little popular backing is doomed to fail. <br> A more realistic policy, for Israel as well as the United States, would start with the assumption that only negotiations with a unified, more or less representative Palestinian leadership can lead to long-term resolution of the conflict. And there is a framework for such a settlement: the Arab League peace proposal, which offers full peace for full Israeli withdrawal from the territories. The promise to ease conditions in the West Bank should be matched with urgently needed aid to Gaza and an end to closure of the commercial exits there. Dismantling checkpoints, transferring tax revenues and releasing prisoners should be accompanied not by attempting to sow divisions among Palestinians but by encouraging a unified new leadership. Without such a leadership, negotiations are impossible. And with no hope for negotiations and an end to occupation, the misery and rage in the territories will only continue to fester. <br> It has been said in recent years that the rise of Hamas would make Israel and the United States rue the day they dismissed Arafat. Let's hope further disintegration doesn't make them rue the day they dismissed Hamas. By the editors of The NationReprinted with permission from the The Nation 
 This column was written by Matthew Continetti.<br><br>Don't let the gimmicky name fool you. The "12 Commitments to the American People" that former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani unveiled in a June 12 speech in Bedford, N.H., are more than political slogans. <br> The pledges serve two purposes. The first is policy-oriented. So far this year, no other GOP candidate for president has laid out as comprehensive an agenda as Giuliani's. Which is saying something, because the 12 commitments are pretty sketchy in places. For example, the word "Iraq" does not appear in any of them. <br> The second purpose the 12 commitments serve is political. By making specific pledges to voters months before any voting occurs, Giuliani is attempting to shape the debate. By outlining goals and pledging concrete results, Giuliani is able to highlight his successes in reforming New York City during his two terms as mayor. The Giuliani campaign wants to reinforce the idea that the mayor is ready to be president right now, not just on January 20, 2009. Another aim is to draw sharp contrasts between Giuliani's record and agenda and those of his opponents, both Republicans and Democrats. "The two people in Rudy's sights now are Fred Thompson and Hillary Clinton," says Fred Siegel, author of "The Prince of the City," a history of Giuliani's mayoralty. <br> So, what are the 12 commitments? Giuliani says he'll keep America "on offense" in the war on terror, end illegal immigration, cut spending, cut taxes, make government accountable, push America toward energy independence, introduce free-market health care reforms, increase adoptions and decrease abortions, reform tort law and appoint strict constructionist judges, prepare "every community in America" for a terrorist attack or natural disaster, introduce a school-choice plan, and promote free trade and globalization. It's an outsized agenda for an outsized political personality. <br> The list of commitments is flexible, with one exception. To Giuliani, nothing is more important than his pledge to keep America "on offense" against her enemies. Other commitments will rise or fall in importance at different times in the campaign. For instance, last week Giuliani said the sixth commitment, energy independence, eventually may rise to number two, since the issue relates to national security. And some new commitments may show up as well. "Could be, over a period of time, we'll add several commitments as we talk to people and listen to them more," Giuliani said in Bedford. <br> The 12 commitments have been in the works for some time, says an unpaid Giuliani adviser, but the campaign "moved ahead fairly quickly." One reason the mayor may have decided to unveil his pledges so early in the campaign is the looming presence of former senator Fred Thompson, who plans to announce his presidential candidacy sometime this summer. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, Thompson placed second among GOP voters nationwide. Giuliani is first. <br> A senior Giuliani aide disputes that the rollout was in any way rushed. "That's just not accurate," says the aide. That Giuliani would outline the 12 commitments last week had been planned for a while, according to the senior aide. Even the choice of the word "commitment" was the subject of consideration. It's intended to convey Giuliani's dedication and willingness to be held accountable. <br> "This was an attempt to be goal-oriented," the senior aide says of the 12 commitments. Giuliani, the aide continues, is "someone who likes measurement." An example of this is Giuliani's pledge to increase the number of adoptions and reduce the number of abortions. It's a practical goal that skirts the normative, values-based questions typically associated with the abortion issue. 
 This commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer.<hr width="50%">I've just been called a neo-Mugwump and I don't like it one bit. <br> Actually, I haven't been called a neo-Mugwump to my face (I guess I don't move in the right circles). But people of my ilk have been. <br> Neo-Mugwump is the term Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol used in her terrific 2003 book, "Diminished Democracy," to describe those who are always trying to "reform" politics to make it cleaner and more professional. Neo-Mugwumps like campaign and lobbying reform and they don't like PACs, fundraisers, fat cats and special interest groups. <br> I've been a classic neo-Mugwump for my whole life. But I'm ready to throw in the towel and give it all up. I think. I'm pretty sure. Maybe. In any case, it's all because of Professor Skocpol. <br> I was in high school during Watergate and started reporting on politics in Washington ten years later. I always believed that any political reform short of public financing of campaigns would be imperfect, messy but still worthwhile. I spent a lot time reporting on abuses of the campaign finance system; there was a lot to report. Same with lobbying. <br> I certainly believed in the idea of reforming the system, even if I was skeptical, even cynical, about the efficacy of reform. I had seen unintended consequences turn several high-minded reforms into deforms. I had observed that the lobbyists and political evil-doers were wilier, better financed and more plentiful than the Hill staffers who wrote the laws and the agency workers who try, I guess, to enforce them. <br> Still, I thought having less money, not more, floating around campaigns and lobbying couldn't do anything but help. I've not been at all persuaded by the Supreme Court's argument in the most important campaign finance case, Buckley v. Valeo, that money is equivalent to speech in politics and so should be regulated only with great reluctance. Cleaner is better. <br> Professor Skocpol thinks this attitude "treats politics as if it were something dirty and implicitly hold up the ideal of an educated elite safely above and outside of politics." She named people who think this way after the Mugwumps, high-minded Republicans who refused to support the GOP candidate in the election of 1884, James G. Blaine ("Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, continental liar from the state of Maine.") <br> The main theme of "Diminishing Democracy" is to show how large, national chapter organizations groups that tended to be made up of active volunteers from all classes have been replaced by "professionally managed advocacy groups without chapters or members." <br> You know who they are - the groups that stuff your mailbox and call during supper. Skocpol believes these groups have reduced participation in civic life, limited opportunities for people from different class and communities to work together on important things and generally diminished our democracy. <br> One of her ideas to improve things is let non-profits back into politics and elections. The tax laws intentionally make it very hard for non-profits and membership groups to get involved in campaigns and elections. In the spirit of neo-Mugwumpism, it was decided that non-profits shouldn't be "partisan" or give directly to candidates and campaigns. <br> Skocpol says this is the opposite of what we need, that "the United States should repeal or modify all kinds of rules designed to create firewalls between partisan and nonpartisan activities." <br> Instead of firewalls, she argues, allow organized groups to campaign and contribute in elections. Stop trying to insulate one world from the other. Let people who are civic-minded get involved in politics through the groups they are active in, if that's what they want to do. It is also possible that in doing this, the business world would actually have more and better competition for political influence. <br> More broadly speaking, perhaps a cure for today's unimpressive political situation is not less politics, but more politics. The sanitary view of politics is snobbish and wrongheaded. <br> Having broken my share of stories about mini-campaign finance scandals, I now think they are not nearly as big a threat to effective government as I used to think. The bigger problem is personnel. So many aspects of politics today, especially the fundraising, are so unpleasant and so undignified, that lots of fine people wouldn't ever consider running for office. <br> Letting non-profits be partisan and political could bring great people into the process. Letting them spend money freely could even make fundraising less onerous. In the same spirit, we should probably let individuals give a lot more than they can now. <br> This is reformer sacrilege, I know. But maybe the way to repair failed regulation and reform isn't with more regulation and reform, but less. Perhaps the political marketplace should be more open. The current closed system is losing trust and legitimacy steadily and has been since the 1970s. <br> So that makes me a reformed neo-Mugwump. I think. <br> By Dick Meyer 
 This column was written by Kay Hymowitz W. Bradford Wilcox.<br>Here we are at debate No. 3, but has anyone heard a Republican besides Mitt Romney utter their one-time favorite word "family?" In fact, most of the top Republican presidential nominees are studiously avoiding the biggest social problem of our time, namely, family breakdown. There's a good reason for this, of course; aside from Romney, the leading candidates, whether committed to running or only flirting, are divorced, and at least one of them has a marital history that verges on the baroque. It's understandable that a presidential contender would want to avoid reminding voters about a messy personal history. <br> Understandable, but in the end, misguided. There is simply no way to advance the principles that have made for past Republican successes without supporting strong families. Let us count the reasons: <br> Reason No. 1: Limited Government. Personal liberty and limited government have always been Republican first principles. Despite the current administration's dubious service to these principles, they remain important to most Republicans. The problem for the Republican divorced candidates is that the foundation of limited government lies in strong, self-governing families. You only have to consider the last half century of social-welfare trends: just as divorce and nonmarital childbearing expanded, so too did the government programs and tax dollars needed to support them. <br> Welfare, still a budget drag even 11 years after welfare reform, is only the most obvious example. Isabel Sawhill at the Brookings Institution estimates that between 1970 and 1996, the growth of single-parent families increased federal welfare and food stamps expenditures by $229 billion. Today, the federal government spends more than $200 billion annually on Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and Medicaid spending, and much of this spending is driven by family breakdown. Moreover, marital failure necessarily invites the government to meddle in personal relationships. This year, for instance, federal and state governments will spend more than $5 billion in efforts to identify, hunt down, and collect money from millions of nonresidential fathers across the nation and 17 million families. <br> Reason No. 2: Law and Order. Daniel Patrick Moynihan was an outlier when he observed over 40 years ago that crime is a marriage and fatherhood issue. Today, the idea that marriage plays a key role in turning boys into law-abiding young men has become the new social scientific consensus. One recent Princeton study found that boys who grew up with their married fathers were half as likely to spend time in jail as boys who grew up in fatherless homes. Another study by Harvard sociologist Robert Sampson agreed that family breakdown was one of the strongest predictors of "urban violence across cities in the United States." With crime rates rising again in many cities, the subject of family breakdown seems like a no-brainer. <br> Reason No. 3: The American Dream. Republicans have long seen themselves as guardians of the American dream, working to insure that individuals and businesses can prosper in a free society. It's clear by now that prosperity depends on strong families. At the simplest level, married couples earn more money than singles. A large body of research shows married men earning between 10 and 40 percent more than men with similar levels of education and job experience, largely because they work longer, smarter, and more responsibly than their unmarried peers. Marriage is also an important source of wealth generation. On the eve of retirement, the typical married couple has accumulated about $410,000, compared to approximately $167,000 for the never-married, and about $154,000 for the divorced. <br> Marriage does all this by fostering a common orientation towards the future and a sense of duty among adults, qualities that are also tremendously advantageous to their children. It's no coincidence that children of married couples, including low-income couples, are more likely to graduate high school, to go to college, and to go on to earn higher incomes than kids of single parents. To put it a little differently, marriage provides the breeding ground for children's future upward mobility. <br> Finally, Reason No. 4: The Vote. If Republican candidates don't find principle enough of a reason to put marriage policy at the top of their agenda, they might want to consider self-interest. Married Americans vote and vote Republican at significantly higher rates than do unmarrieds. In the last presidential race, for instance, hitched Americans were more than 50 percent more likely to vote than their singleton fellow citizens, and when they did, they voted for George Bush by a 15-point margin (57 to 42 percent). This is probably because the married have tended to view the party at least they used to before Republicans became tongue-tied on all things family as more supportive of a family-centered way of life. <br> In other words, Republicans have every reason self-interest, party loyalty, and the American future to transcend the idea that your personal history has to limit your political beliefs, and to talk about policies that would strengthen and expand the ranks of the married. <br> Yes, accusations of hypocrisy may fill the airwaves. But chances are Americans, almost all of whom have been touched by the family unraveling of the past 40 years, would be in a forgiving mood. At any rate, they know that while hypocrisy is bad, moral cowardice is worse. <br> By Kay Hymowitz W. Bradford Wilcox Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by the editors of The New Republic.<br>Imagine for a moment you were a car salesman and that you drew most of your income from commissions sell a few more minivans, get a bigger paycheck, and so on. Now imagine the IRS said you didn't have to pay full income taxes on those commissions that you would be taxed at half the normal rate. It'd be a pretty sweet deal for you. But everybody else would complain. And rightly so: Why do car dealers deserve special treatment? Well, swap "hedge-fund managers" for "car dealers," and you've just become acquainted with the latest skirmish in what the right calls "class warfare" but the rest of us call restoring sanity to the federal tax code. <br> For many years now, the managers of hedge funds large investment funds run exclusively for wealthy individuals have taken their compensation in so-called two-and-twenty arrangements. The two refers to 2 percent of fund value, which the managers get as an annual management fee; the twenty refers to 20 percent of returns, which they take home annually as sort of a commission. These funds are enormous, and the good ones do quite well. So you might not be surprised to hear that the fund managers make some extraordinary incomes, sometimes in excess of $1 billion (yes, billion) a year. <br> And, hey, that's fine. This is America, and there's nothing wrong with getting rich. But we do expect all Americans, even those with the most money, to pay income tax like everybody else. And here's the surprise: These fund managers don't. Under current law, that 20 percent is considered a form of capital gains. So, even though fund managers can take the bulk of their earnings this way, they will pay taxes on it at the reduced rate for capital gains which is 15 percent, or less than half what they would pay for other forms of income. Among those taken aback by this arrangement is Senator Max Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, who has convened meetings on the subject with an eye toward closing the loophole. <br> The investment community has responded, predictably, by dispatching lobbyists. The Wall Street Journal editorial page has responded, just as predictably, by throwing a tantrum. "There's no good rationale for this," say the high priests of conservative economics, "beyond the fact that Congress wants money and private equity funds have lots of it" which, in more sensible circles, is known as trying to finance the essential operations of government in the fairest way possible. The Journal also argues that reform will hamper the economy, since the current tax break "aligns" the interests of managers and investors as if a fund manager making only three-quarters of a billion dollars might be tempted to screw his investors, while a fund manager making the full billion wouldn't. <br> Of course, the best argument for repealing this break is that it distorts the economy in this case, by encouraging people to become fund managers rather than, say, entrepreneurs. But this is just a reminder of a larger problem: the fact that we favor capital gains in the first place. It's the wealthy who earn most of their money from investments; why should they get a tax break when people who make money by hauling concrete, answering phones, or performing surgery don't? And, quite apart from distributional justice, the break on capital gains interferes with the free market by encouraging investments that people might not otherwise undertake. Indeed, there is a whole business devoted to reclassifying normal income as capital gains to take advantage of the reduced tax rate more proof of the artificial distinction between investment income and labor income. <br> You would think that conservatives, who fancy themselves guardians of the free market, might see this logic. And, while Republicans notoriously overlook this, the tax favor for hedge-fund managers is so egregious that it irks even some of their stalwarts. Senator Charles Grassley, of the Finance Committee, was actually the first to raise this issue. That's an important signal: It may actually be possible to do something about this small, though significant, flaw in the tax code, even if the much larger fight over capital gains must wait for another day. <br> By the editors of The New Republic If you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion and analysis 
 This column was written by Fred Barnes.<br>Don't listen to Teddy Kennedy. If you belong to the small band of conservative brothers inclined to support immigration reform, the Massachusetts senator is on your side. But what he says is likely to make you anxious, vexed, or even crazed. At times, Kennedy makes the compromise immigration bill sound like the latest loopy liberal legislation to provide welfare to the world. <br> It's not. Indeed, much of the organized left opposes it. The AFL-CIO is especially upset about the provision to bring foreign workers here temporarily. But when you hear Kennedy on the subject, you have to wonder what they're so worried about. <br> The temps, Kennedy insisted last week, are "going to get the prevailing wage, they are going to be protected by OSHA, if they get hurt on the job they are going to get workmen's compensation. They are going to get worker protections. If they are working on a construction site, they are going to be covered by Davis-Bacon." <br> Kennedy contrasted this pampering with the fate of those poor illegal immigrants who work here now. Absent the new program, Kennedy said, they'll continue to be exploited, their rights "trampled on." They'll be injured by "sharp hooks, knives, exhausting assembly line speeds." In Massachusetts, illegal workers are "fired for going to the bathroom, denied overtime pay, docked 15 minutes' pay for every minute they were late . . . fired for talking while on the clock, forced to ration toilet paper." <br> As Senate floor manager of the immigration bill, Kennedy gets emotionally wound up. He exaggerates. He raises his voice. He berates Democratic and Republican senators alike. He intimidates, or tries to anyway. He is a throwback to an older oratorical style. He is a bellower, a bully, something of a blowhard. He is enormously fun to watch. <br> But what's important about Kennedy is that he's the ally of pro-immigrant Republicans in the Senate debate on the bipartisan immigration bill. And Kennedy is effective. The Republicans gave up a lot to get Kennedy, particularly in agreeing to "Z" visas that would allow the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants already in the United States to stay as legal residents and eventually seek citizenship. <br> Led by conservative Jon Kyl of Arizona, the Republicans gained Kennedy's support for three significant provisions. The first is a buildup of border security that must be completed before Z visas can be issued and other reforms implemented. The second is a temporary worker program in which the workers must return to their home country. In this bill, Kyl says, "temporary means temporary." And the third is the end of "chain migration," the practice that has allowed legal immigrants to bring their endless extended families here. If the compromise becomes law, only the immigrant, spouse, and minor children will be allowed in. <br> Should any of these provisions be stripped from the bill, the compromise will fall apart and immigration reform will die, for the foreseeable future anyway. And Kennedy may be the only person who can stop liberal Democrats from stripping and thus killing the bill. He's succeeded so far, and it now appears the bill will pass the Senate when debate resumes in June. The House, where there's no Kennedy counterpart, is another matter. <br> Kennedy single-handedly turned back an effort by Democratic senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota to wipe out or limit the temp program. Dorgan initially proposed to strike the program entirely. Kennedy's response was ferocious. He referred to Dorgan as the "senator from North Carolina." He said, contrary to what Dorgan had argued, that illegal immigrants, not legal temps, drive down wages. <br> "I would like the chicken-pluckers to pay $10 or $15 an hour," he said. Today, when they hire illegal immigrants, "they do not do it." He roared at Dorgan, "Who are you trying to kid? Who is the senator . . . trying to fool?" <br> Dorgan later proposed to end the program after five years, another compromise-killer. This would alienate the business lobby, which supports the bill largely because of the temp program. Dorgan had the votes to win, 49-48, until Kennedy intervened at the last moment. He persuaded Democrat Daniel Akaka of Hawaii to change his vote, and Dorgan lost, 49-48. And the bill was saved. <br> Kennedy and Kyl easily rebuffed an amendment by Republican senator David Vitter of Louisiana to prohibit Z visas still another compromise-destroying amendment. Kennedy also scolded Republican Jeff Sessions of Alabama for seeking to bar newly legalized immigrants from qualifying for the earned income tax credit. "This amendment would hurt children," Kennedy shouted. "We need to help children, not hurt them. They should not have to pay for the sins of their parents." <br> The bipartisan group of 12 senators who negotiated the compromise met daily last week (several times in Kennedy's office) to decide which amendments they would accept and which they would oppose as poison pills like Dorgan's that shatter the compromise and kill the bill. <br> The four Democratic senators running for president Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd were not part of these talks, and it showed. Clinton and Biden, supposedly backers of immigration reform, voted with Dorgan (and the AFL-CIO) to eliminate the temporary workers program and blow up the compromise. Obama and Dodd were absent. All four voted with Dorgan on the five-year limit, also a deal-breaker. <br> On the touchy issue of whether illegal immigrants should pay back taxes to get Z visas, Kennedy proved to be tolerant. He and Kyl had arranged a tradeoff whereby the collection of back taxes was scratched in exchange for Z visa holders not being credited for Social Security taxes they paid while working here illegally. <br> But when an amendment by Republican senator John McCain mandating payment of back taxes was introduced, Kennedy let it pass by voice vote. He and Kyl figured it was better not to oppose such a popular measure. <br> In the Senate, there's one more serious obstacle to passage. That's the plan by liberal Democrats Obama is one to restore legal immigration based largely on family ties chain migration rather than education, job skills, and other measures of merit. Again, if the liberals succeed, it means immigration reform is dead. Kyl and Republicans will bail out. <br> After the bipartisan compromise was announced, Senator Lindsey Graham returned to South Carolina, spoke to the state Republican convention, and was booed when he mentioned Kennedy. "Kennedy is in an I-want-to-legislate mode," Graham said. "When you catch him in the I-want-to-legislate mode, you can do some business." True, but Graham was wise not to bring Kennedy with him to emphasize the point. <br> By Fred Barnes 
 This column was written by Weekly Standard's Duncan Currie</i><br>"You say that you're a full-scale Ronald Reagan Republican, and yet, as you mentioned, you opposed the troop surge and you support comprehensive immigration reform. Are those the stands that Ronald Reagan would take?" Thus did Fox News debate moderator Chris Wallace put Senator Sam Brownback on the spot last Tuesday night in South Carolina. Brownback quickly dodged the Iraq question before noting that Reagan himself endorsed a de facto "amnesty" for illegal immigrants in 1986. <br> As Fareed Zakaria points out, the Gipper had earlier commented, in a 1977 radio broadcast, on the dearth of apple pickers in New England. "It makes one wonder about the illegal-alien fuss," Reagan said. "Are great numbers of our unemployed really victims of the illegal-alien invasion, or are those illegal tourists actually doing work our own people won't do?" Of one thing he expressed certainty: "No regulation or law should be allowed if it results in crops rotting in the fields for lack of harvesters." <br> So one could plausibly argue that Reagan would have favored the Senate immigration deal announced last week. Or one could argue that the context has changed since 1986, and that he would have eschewed a second "amnesty" bill. <br> This gets to a broader irony: Though "Reaganism" has taken on an outsized role in the GOP presidential campaign, it's tricky to define just what the phrase "Reagan Republican" actually means in 2007. Reagan won election at a time when the most pressing foreign policy dilemmas included U.S. hostages in Iran, Soviet adventurism, and creeping Communist expansion in Central America. With the partial exception of Iran partial because the mullahs are still in power and still holding American captives those concerns are now obsolete. So are the problems of double-digit inflation and gas lines. <br> On the most important issue of the day, the war in Iraq, we can only guess at what the 40th president would have thought. <br> But the nifty thing about Reagan's legacy is that every segment of the GOP coalition can claim a piece of it. Libertarians can cite his small-government rhetoric. Supply-siders can emphasize his tax cuts. Defense hawks can highlight his arms buildup, his willingness to use military force (in Grenada and Libya), and his "evil empire" talk. Social conservatives can point to his 1983 pro-life tract, "Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation," and his promulgation of the so-called Mexico City Policy (which bans U.S. funding of foreign NGOs that promote or perform abortions). Moderate Republicans can stress his sunny disposition and big-tent philosophy. All these groups can celebrate his anti-Communism. <br> As the first two GOP presidential debates have shown, Reagan remains emblematic of American conservatism. By one count, the candidates invoked his name 19 times during their debate at the Reagan Library. Conscious of their vulnerability on the right, Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Mitt Romney have all made bids for the Reagan mantle. Their fallback question seems to be: "What would Reagan do?" <br> Of course, Reagan's White House record was far more varied than many conservatives now care to admit. An artificial "Reagan reverence" may make for good primary politics, but it also threatens to constrict Republicans. As David Brooks writes, "Conservatives have allowed a simplistic view of Ronald Reagan to define the sacred parameters of thought. Reagan himself was flexible, unorthodox, and creative. But conservatives have created a mythical, rigid Reagan, and any deviation from that is considered unholy." 
 This column was written by Jonathan Cohn.<br>Last month the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) issued an ultimatum to the Democrats running for president: Issue detailed plans for universal health care by August 1. Or else. <br> OK, it wasn't quite that dramatic. There was no threat of specific reprisals against candidates who fail to meet the deadline. Nor was there a precise definition as to what would qualify as "detailed." Given that the SEIU's president, Andy Stern, has been willing to embrace companies like Wal-Mart for making the vaguest of commitments to universal health care, it's safe to assume Democratic candidates could satisfy the union's demands without getting too specific. <br> But that doesn't mean vague is good. Indeed, with health care atop the domestic political agenda, the Democratic candidates need to flesh out their visions for how they will make health care affordable for everybody even though it means facing some potential political hazards. <br> Getting specific isn't such a problem for Senator John Edwards, who earlier this year unveiled an ambitious framework for universal coverage. But it does present a quandary for the two frontrunners, Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. While both have promised that they would pursue universal health care as president, neither has said much about how they would achieve this. <br> This reticence doesn't reflect lack of interest. Both candidates have histories of working on the issue Clinton, most famously, when she ran the task force that developed her husband's ill-fated universal coverage proposal in 1993. And both candidates seem sincere in their desire to overhaul American health care so that citizens here finally share the kind of financial and health security that citizens in the rest of the developed world have long enjoyed. <br> No, the reason Clinton and Obama are acting so cautiously is that they fear getting specific on health care will expose them to political attacks the kind that could doom their candidacies and the prospects for universal coverage simultaneously. It's a powerful argument that goes something like this: As soon as a candidate explains exactly what he wants to do about health care, he becomes a piata for his rivals and eventually special interests, who can be counted on to seize on the provisions that are most unappealing politically, even if it means twisting what they mean. <br> The case study in this was the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000, when then-Senator Bill Bradley put forth an ambitious proposal that would have brought coverage to about half the uninsured population. Then-Vice President Al Gore tore it apart claiming, among other things, that Bradley's plan would leave the poor worse off than now. Nobody following the debate seriously, or familiar with Bradley's record in office, believed that would actually happen. But Gore's attacks were instrumental in blunting Bradley's initial momentum and, eventually, depriving him of victory in the New Hampshire primary. <br> Howard Dean had a similar experience in 2004. He put forth what was arguably the most fiscally realistic plan for expanding insurance coverage to nearly all Americans, offering to pay for the proposal by rolling back Bush's tax breaks. But he rarely got credit for it. Most pundits, unfamiliar with the details, ended up parroting the talking points of rival camps. A few actually called Dean's plan fiscally irresponsible. <br> And all of that was just in the primaries. Any plan to give all Americans health insurance is going to involve more government (since only government can subsidize the poor and provide coverage to people whose medical conditions make them uninsurable in the private market). And it's also going to involve higher taxes (since the government can't do these things without more money). Democratic primary voters tend to be tolerant of such things. But swing voters? Not so much. A candidate committing himself to these propositions would seem to be inviting a lot of hostility from the voters who determine election outcomes. <br> Today, virtually any Democratic candidate proposing universal coverage can expect such treatment. But Clinton and Obama come into the contest with additional liabilities. As Clinton herself says, she has the scars from the fight to create universal coverage in 1994. (Whether she deserves those scars is another story.) 
 This column was written by the editors of National Review Online</i>.Six months ago Johnny Hallyday, the "French Elvis," announced that he was taking up Swiss citizenship to escape France's high tax rates, which absorbed about two-thirds of his income. Because Hallyday was known to be a supporter of then-candidate Nicolas Sarkozy, a political row immediately burst out. Showing some political courage, Sarkozy did not disavow Hallyday; instead he declared that the singer was quite justified. If he won the election, said Sarkozy, he would cut tax rates to entice France's high earners back home. <br> That promise was important to many more people than Johnny Hallyday. Something like half a million young French people are estimated to be living in southern England. The Kent Corridor from London to Dover is known, ironically, as "France's Silicon Valley." And for every Parisian exile, 10 actual Parisians still seethe under high taxes and think about emigration. That sums up why Sarkozy won Sunday's election. <br> Indeed, he did more than simply win an election. By any normal standard Sarkozy has established a clear mandate for sweeping conservative reform in France. He won the presidency by six points in an election that attracted a massive 85 percent turnout. He owed nothing of his victory to other parties or candidates both the centrist Franois Bayrou and the ultra-rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen refused to support him. He made no secret of the character and extent of his reform program indeed, as the Hallyday incident demonstrates, he rammed them home with enthusiasm. And it seems likely that he will be granted a friendly National Assembly with a large conservative majority in the forthcoming parliamentary elections. <br> So, if representative democracy works as it is supposed to do, Sarkozy will push through the market reforms that France has needed for at least two decades. He will deregulate its labor market, slim down the public-sector payroll, abandon the symbolic 35-hour work week, reduce public spending from its current 52 percent of GDP, and reform the French welfare state. Friends and admirers of France will hope that he succeeds. Americans will be especially supportive since he has said that with his election the U.S. has a "friend" presumably he will end the anti-Americanism that has shaped French foreign policy under Jacques Chirac, his old patron and recent bitter rival. But will Sarkozy be able to push through such an ambitious and contentious program against opposition in the streets as well as in the corridors of power? 
 This column was written by Ari Melber</i>.<hr width="75%">"To clarify, Rep. Tauscher is not a blue dog." The emphatic one-line e-mail, dashed off by a spokesman for California Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher, is one of the first signs that a new coalition of unions and Internet activists has gotten the Democratic Party's attention. Tauscher has long been a pro-business voice and outspoken member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition. Yet recently her conservatism from supporting the GOP bankruptcy bill to airing her concern that liberals might run Congressional leaders "over the left cliff" has put her in the cross hairs of an effort to reform the Democratic Party from the bottom up. She was branded a "top offender" on the Web site of Working For Us, a new political action committee pressing Democratic incumbents to support "economic security," a "living wage for all workers" and a "progressive political agenda." Breaking sharply with the posture of most progressive organizations, the group will not simply criticize Democrats who fail that test. It will try to end their careers. <br> Working For Us was founded by, among others, veteran labor strategist Steve Rosenthal, and it's backed by unions, such as the Teamsters, Steelworkers and SEIU, that traditionally cultivate close relationships with Democratic politicians. But Working For Us is following the confrontational approach of top liberal bloggers, promising primaries to depose disloyal incumbents. Rosenthal says the group is a "marriage of the grassroots and the netroots," uniting door-to-door organizers, unions and bloggers in an effort to "change the tenor of politics." <br> The strategy is set by two boards made up of traditional labor leaders like SEIU secretary-treasurer Anna Burger and pioneers from the Internet left like MoveOn.org heads and Markos Moulitsas, founder of the top Democratic blog Daily Kos. Moulitsas has spent years fanning grassroots opposition to Democratic incumbents once considered untouchable. He rallied national support for Ciro Rodriguez's 2006 primary challenge to Henry Cuellar, a Texas Congressman who supports estate tax repeal, free trade and George W. Bush, whom he endorsed in 2000. (Cuellar squeaked through the primary with 53 percent and went on to re-election.) <br> Moulitsas often hammers on three faults of conservative Democrats: economic conservatism, disloyalty to the party and desertion of their home districts' priorities. In a recent blog entry making the case against Tauscher, for example, he highlighted that she "consistently undermined the Democratic Party," led the charge for the Republican bankruptcy bill, and "acts like she represents Utah while serving in a 59 percent Kerry district." <br> The district's presidential voting history may sound more like political trivia than cause for revolt, but it's actually a crucial prerequisite for netroots primary challenges. None of the incumbents targeted by the blogosphere in the last cycle hail from vulnerable districts or red states; they are all Democrats who are disloyal to the caucus and vote more conservatively than their constituents. Working For Us is adopting the same strategic standard to select its targets. <br> The group says it will challenge only those Democrats who are out of touch with constituents, not antilabor incumbents in antilabor areas. "How do you put some backbone into Democrats so they begin to act the right way?" asks Rosenthal. By confronting them with the reality that their constituents prefer strong economic populists over meek incumbents, he argues. Rosenthal says he will "stir the pot" in more than fifteen districts next year, coordinating outreach, media and blog campaigns, and officially challenge two or three Democratic incumbents. While the group says it is too early to finalize its targets, Moulitsas told The Nation he wants to unseat Al Wynn, a Maryland Democrat who has backed Republican legislation on bankruptcy, oil drilling, flag burning, Terri Schiavo and the estate tax, along with Representatives Tauscher and Cuellar. Rosenthal argues that they do not have to win any races to be effective. "The primary is not the victory; the victory is getting Democrats to act like Democrats," he says. <br> Win or lose, the effort has already drawn sharp criticism from party strategists and activists, including some labor leaders. AFSCME president Gerald McEntee recently attacked Working For Us at a Congressional retreat, declaring, "In blue America, there's no room for PACs to chase vulnerable members they have differences with." The trial lawyers association, another powerful Democratic-leaning interest group, withdrew from the Working For Us coalition once its focus on primaries became clear. Rosenthal says he has fielded complaints from House majority leader Steny Hoyer on down to local union leaders. "Let's go after weak Republicans, not weak Democrats," said one Democratic consultant, who requested anonymity to avoid antagonizing bloggers. Another common criticism is that the strategy will push the Democratic majority "too far left" off that cliff Tauscher warned about. Channeling the conventional wisdom in Washington, Time columnist Joe Klein recently derided Working For Us as a "suicidal waste of time" for left-wing "extremist" bloggers. <br> Yet the group's populist primary challenges do not fit into the left-right paradigm. The current revival of economic populism encompasses old-school liberals like New York's Charlie Rangel and Southern conservatives like Virginia's Jim Webb. As Moulitsas argued in a phone interview, "Economic issues are the one thing that unites the Democratic Party, from its most liberal wing to its most conservative wing." <br> Most important, if Working For Us sticks to the preferences of local constituents, the program will advance the democratic process more than a single ideology. Nowadays competitive Congressional races are a rarity in most of the country because both parties squash primaries and gerrymander districts. Members of Congress are almost always re-elected even with high voter turnout, the "closely contested" 2004 election still sent 98 percent of incumbents back to the House. By backing primary candidates who would not otherwise be viable, Working For Us promises a little more democracy in a few handpicked districts not exactly an extremist proposition. Once those campaigns are off the ground, of course, unions and bloggers cannot control the results. In a rare twist for modern Congressional campaigns, the outcome will actually depend on voters.By Ari MelberReprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by Mona Charen</i>. <hr width="75">Oregon's governor, Theodore Kulongoski, called a gaggle of his closest friends to a photo op Tuesday that few could pass up. As part of his "Food Stamp Challenge" week, the governor is attempting to live on a food budget of $21 per week, which is about the average benefit for an Oregon food stamp recipient, according to the governor's press release. <br> Associated Press photos showed the governor pushing a shopping cart and ostentatiously relinquishing a noodle cup and two bananas at the checkout counter when his total topped $21. "Could you feed yourself for $3 a day?" demanded headline in the next morning's Oregonian. <br> Let us stipulate that in a country as wealthy as ours, the idea that anyone should go hungry is unacceptable. <br> But is that what's really happening? Why is it that whenever you listen to a Democrat you feel that the year is 1966? They seem to live in a time warp in which no progress has been made on race relations, poverty, childhood malnutrition, and on and on. <br> Let's start with some numbers. If you go the state of Oregon's Web site and calculate your eligibility for food stamps, you will find that a family of four with no income (and 70 percent of food stamp recipients do not work at all) is entitled to $518 monthly or about $32 weekly for each person. This is a very rough estimate because all sorts of factors are taken into account in calculating eligibility, including number of dependents, housing costs, expenses, and other income. Perhaps the governor's office is correct that the average food stamp allotment in the state is $21. But that means some get more and some less. Eligibility is based on need. <br> Now even $32 seems like a very small amount of money per person, but that is only a small part of the largesse provided by the U.S. government, which spent $522 billion on low-income assistance programs in 2002. It doesn't count hot breakfasts and lunches at school (which push high-calorie, high-fat diets on kids). It doesn't count the Earned Income Tax Credit by which the working poor get cash back from the federal government ($41.4 billion went to 22.2 million recipients last year, according to the Los Angeles Times). It doesn't include housing subsidies, Medicaid, or the Supplemental Security Income program, which can free up funds for food. Nor does it count the WIC program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. <br> The WIC program provides highly caloric packages of juice, cereal, eggs, and other food to pregnant women, nursing mothers and children up to the age of 4. WIC also provides baby formula, thus discouraging the poor from breast-feeding their babies. About 50 percent of the formula sold in the U.S. goes to families using WIC. Formula-fed babies are more likely to be overweight, suffer ear infections, have allergies, and, if you believe some of the data, have lower IQs than breast-fed infants. <br> Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute notes that while he can recall visiting rural Mississippi in the 1960s and seeing severe cases of malnutrition, the problem among the poor today is more likely to be obesity. Today, 70 percent of low-income Americans are overweight, compared with 60 percent of the non-poor. The mean intake of poor children aged 6-11 was 2,000 calories a day in 1994 compared with 1,969 calories for non-poor children of the same age. President Bill Clinton's secretary of agriculture, Dan Glickman, acknowledged that "The simple fact is that more people die in the United States of too much food than of too little, and the habits that lead to this epidemic [obesity] become ingrained at an early age." <br> We are pushing food at the poor as if hunger and malnutrition still crouched at the door when the bigger threat these days is saturated fat and excess sugar. The Food Stamp program arguably needs a massive reform, offering cash grants instead of vouchers or credit cards, which encourage over-consumption. Is it too much to ask that politicians and journalists (that photo of Gov. Kulongoski showed up everywhere) address today's problems and not those of 40 years ago?By Mona CharenReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Michelle Cottle.<br><br>Presidential obsession du jour for anxious GOPers: Does Fred Thompson's announcement that he's in remission from lymphoma mean that America's favorite lawyer-turned-lobbyist-turned-movie-actor-turned-senator-turned-TV-actor is more likely or less likely to join the 2008 hordes? I'm betting on Option A, especially since early reaction to Thompson's revelation ranged from the blas to the encouraging. And, while I obviously am hoping that Republicans are nutty enough to nominate someone in 2008 who'll prove utterly unelectable in the generals like Kansas Senator Sam Brownback or, better still, Newt Gingrich I wouldn't mind seeing Thompson jump in and shake things up a bit. <br> It's not that I find Thompson's politics any more appealing than say, John McCain's or Rudy Giuliani's. (As for Mitt Romney, God only knows what his politics are or how many times they'll change between now and Iowa.) He consistently voted for guns, against gays, for tax cuts, and against abortion rights. But Thompson has one thing to recommend him that his Republican opponents don't: a long-standing reputation for lacking any passion, zeal, or vision for governing. Plus, he's said to be just the teensiest bit lazy. This was the rap on him over a decade ago, when I began cataloging his many charms for a Washington Monthly piece predicting that he'd make a helluva POTUS candidate if he could just find himself a good wife (something he has since done). It remains the rap on him today, and it is by far my most favoritest thing about good ol' Fred. Seriously. I get a little nervous when confronted by any presidential aspirant itching to transform society as we know it. (Just look what Team Bush has wrought trying to democratize Iraq.) So my idea of a top-notch standard-bearer for a party whose views I find increasingly unpalatable is one too lazy and too apathetic to cause much trouble should he actually win. <br> Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm familiar with all the breathless posts at political sites like RedState.com about how Fred is the true conservative hope of this race. I read Bob Novak's mash note to Thompson, in which he weirdly acknowledged that the former lawmaker's chief asset is, in fact, his eight-year tenure as district attorney Arthur Branch on NBC's "Law Order." Then, of course, there was Bill Kristol's offhand and totally unexplained assertion that Thompson is the "most manifestly Reaganite" of the 2008 bunch. At this point, conservatives are so desperate that even Thompson's laziness is being spun as an asset and compared to the Gipper's famous refusal (or inability) to work hard. <br> But a major difference is that Reagan, while not exactly a type-A hard-charger, clearly cared about and believed deeply in certain issues, most notably national defense. What does Thompson care deeply about? Hard to say. His political schooling took place at the knee of mentor Senator Howard Baker, who, as godfather of the more liberal branch of Tennessee's GOP, was not exactly beloved by state conservatives. And, during Thompson's own Senate stint, the issues about which he was most energetic were in the area of government reforms most notably his strong support for McCain-Feingold-style campaign finance reform. Somehow, this doesn't strike me as an issue likely to thrill the base. (Nor does the fact that Thompson was, as recently as 1995, openly pro-choice.) <br> As proof of their champion's conservative soul, Thompson fans vigorously point to his career rating of 86 percent by the American Conservative Union. Not to be a wet blanket, but I feel compelled to point out that McCain the GOPer the base loves to hate has a career rating of 82 percent. Four points lower than Thompson. Wow. Talk about your yawning ideological chasms. (And, while we're on the subject of McCain, please recall that Thompson served as Senator Straight Talk's national co-chair in 2000. Given a choice between George W. Bush and McCain, Thompson went with the candidate who made his name running around the country sticking his finger in the eye of his party's base.) <br> This isn't to suggest that Senator Thompson wasn't a loyal Republican foot soldier. Indeed, back in 1996, he was one of a handful of GOP senators atop Project Vote Smart's list of members to most consistently vote along party lines. But voting with your party as a legislator is one thing. Setting its priorities as president is quite another. <br> And here is where Thompson's lack of vision and storied laziness comforts me. For starters, my guess is that, if he ran into very many tough days on the campaign trail, he'd take his toys and amble on back to NBC before most "Law Order" fans noticed he had been gone. (Hell, he might even get his own spinoff out of an aborted run.) But even assuming he made it to the Oval Office, my guess is that a Thompson administration's aims would be modest or at least manageable. Unlike Bush, Thompson doesn't appear to have any burning Oedipal issues to address or, worse yet, any grand delusions of having been hand-picked by Jesus to shepherd this nation. (In fact, Focus on the Family founder-turned-unofficial-Gingrich-shill James Dobson has already decreed that Thompson is not a Christian.) <br> Just as importantly, there is every reason to believe that Thompson would be facing one or both houses of Congress controlled by Democrats. This means that, to get anything substantive accomplished, President Thompson would have to get in there and mix it up with the opposition a messy, mud-slinging business even on a good day. A naturally combative leader (think Rudy) might seek out these sorts of fights as a way to keep his blood pumping. An ideologically passionate one (think Gingrich) might do it to keep the cause alive. But a kinda lazy guy who doesn't really believe in much of anything? Well, he'd probably be happier just tinkering around the edges and watching reruns of himself on DVD. <br> Now that is my kind of Republican. <br> By Michelle Cottle <br> If you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion, and analysis 
 This column was written by Katrina Vanden Heuvel</i>.Justice Louis Brandeis once said, "It is one of the happy accidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country." The Maryland General Assembly has taken advantage of this "happy accident" to pass a National Popular Vote bill, and is expected to pass a Living Wage bill today as well. <br> Maryland State Senator and Nation contributor Jamie Raskin told me, "We passed the National Popular Vote bill in the General Assembly by mobilizing the essential democratic principles: the person with the most votes for president should win the office and every citizen's vote should count equally regardless of geography or time zone. And with the Living Wage bill, we have said that the state government should not be a neutral umpire in the economy but an active instrument for lifting people out of grinding poverty into at least the modestly secure working class. The gap between the minimum wage and the actual living wage is an index of shame, which we are about to close in Maryland." <br> The National Popular Vote bill calls for awarding Maryland's 10 electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote instead of the winner of the state vote. It only takes effect when states representing a majority of votes in the Electoral College agree to join a binding National Popular Vote compact. The movement is being led by the National Popular Vote campaign and it has over 300 sponsoring legislators in 47 states. Other organizations involved in the effort include: FairVote, Progressive States Network, Asian American Action Fund, National Black Caucus of State Legislators, National Latino Congreso, Common Cause, and such former Members of Congress as Republicans Tom Campbell and Jake Garn, independent John Anderson, and Democrat Birch Bayh. <br> According to Rob Richie and Ryan O'Donnell of FairVote, "Under the Constitution, states have exclusive power indeed have responsibility to award their electors to reflect the interests of their people." Like Maryland, Hawaii also passed its National Popular Vote bill and so have single chambers in Arkansas and Colorado. Last year, California passed its own version but it was vetoed by The Terminator. Richie reports that establishing a national popular vote is supported by 70 percent of the public according to polls. "This should be no surprise," Richie and O'Donnell write. "The current system makes most Americans irrelevant in electing their most powerful elected office." <br> "[Maryland], like the two-thirds of all states consigned to the safe red or blue column, has been reduced to 'spectator' status in presidential elections," Raskin said. " I believe that Maryland and now Hawaii can kick off an insurrection of the spectator states to demand a truly national presidential campaign instead of this debased division and polarization of red and blue states, a process which depresses turnout and participation." <br> Richie points out that in 2004, voter turnout was 8 percent higher in battleground states than non-battlegrounds and "fully 17 percent higher among young adults a division only to grow in future elections with presidential campaign activity limited to battlegrounds" And Richie and O'Donnell note, "The presidential campaigns and their allies spent more money on ads in Florida in the final month of the campaign than their combined spending in 46 other states." Raskin adds, "In the last two [presidential] elections, 99 percent of campaign dollars and candidate visits were spent in 16 battleground states and two-thirds of the money and appearances in just five key ones like Ohio and Florida." <br> "By strengthening the voting power of all Americans and treating all voters equally," Richie says, "the National Popular Vote plan is based on two of the key pillars of lasting reform: equality and universality." <br> Maryland's Living Wage Bill will have a lasting impact as well. "It's going to lift tens of thousands of Marylanders out of poverty," Delegate Tom Hucker told The Washington Post. "It makes Maryland a leader in ensuring that our tax dollars are helping build the middle class rather than perpetuating poverty." <br> And it's not just Democrats who are doing the work of small-d democrats. Florida's Republican Governor, Charlie Crist, has fulfilled his campaign promise to work towards restoring voting rights for convicted felons in his state despite the fact that it will add "tens of thousands of Democratic voters to the rolls possibly pushing a House seat or two into the blue column" and helping any Democratic presidential nominee. (Maryland's General Assembly has also acted to secure voting rights for more people with felony convictions, and Gov. Martin O'Malley is leaning towards signing the bill. Richie says that O'Malley the only challenger to defeat an incumbent governor in last year's elections has been instrumental in spurring progressive change by promising to sign such legislation as this.) <br> These actions by the Maryland General Assembly and the action of a Republican Governor serve as reminders that what Nation article John Nichols wrote in a 2003 still holds true: "some of the most important fights for affordable health care, education, environmental protection and clean politics are taking place beyond the Beltway. Often there is far more space for debate on these issues, and more opportunities for victory, in statehouses. Thus, while it is essential to battle Bush and his minions in Washington, it is equally essential to understand that the road to renewal may well run through the states." <br> By Katrina Vanden HeuvelReprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by Byron York</i>. When George W. Bush visited the U.S. Border Patrol's Yuma Station Headquarters in Arizona on Monday for the second time in a year his message on illegal immigration sounded a bit tougher than in the past. "Illegal immigration is a serious problem you know it better than anybody," he told a group of border agents. "It puts pressure on the public schools and the hospitals, not only here in our border states, but states around the country. It drains the state and local budgets Incarceration of criminals who are here illegally strains the Arizona budget. But there's a lot of other ways it strains the local and state budgets. It brings crime to our communities." <br> The president touted his get-tough-on-the-border policies, enacted under pressure from the then-Republican Congress, and singled out Operation Jump Start, under which National Guard troops assist border agents. But he also stressed the need for "comprehensive" reform and when he did, his message sounded like the George W. Bush of old. "Past efforts at reform failed to address the underlying economic reasons behind illegal immigration," the president said. "People are coming here to put food on the table, and they're doing jobs Americans are not doing." <br> With those words, the president was revisiting the great question in the debate over illegal immigration: Is the presence of illegal immigrants, mostly from Mexico, a boon to the U.S. economy, or a drag? It's a question that has long divided Bush supporters; the Wall Street Journal editorial page tells us that a lenient immigration policy is absolutely vital for American prosperity, while enforcement-first advocates tell us a strict policy is the only thing that will ensure continued economic health. <br> Both have plenty of statistics to cite to make their case. But now a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, Robert Rector, has found a new and revealing way to get at the answer. <br> Rector has just published a study, "The Fiscal Cost of Low-Skill Households to the U.S. Taxpayer," that is ostensibly not about immigration at all. He takes the most detailed look yet at the economics of the 17.7 million American households made up of people without a high-school degree. With numbers from the Census Bureau, the Congressional Research Service, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other government agencies, Rector found what they make, what they spend, and how much they receive in government services. <br> The reason Rector chose to look at low-skilled workers is that it is estimated that nearly two-thirds of illegal immigrants fall into that category. (By way of comparison, slightly less than 10 percent of native-born Americans are in that group.) By focusing on those workers, Rector was able to make use of information on them that is more detailed and precise than information on immigrants as a whole. And any conclusions he reached would be applicable to a large majority of illegal immigrants who are already in this country as well as those who would come here under various immigration reform proposals. <br> Rector began by calculating the dollar value of the benefits those low-skill workers receive from the government. There are direct benefits, like Medicare and Social Security, and means-tested benefits, like food, housing and medical benefits specifically for low-income people. Then there is public education, along with population-based services like police and fire protection, parks, and roads. (Those services benefit everyone, and their cost usually increases as the population increases.) After that, there is interest on the public debts, a burden spread throughout all income groups, and the cost of what Rector calls "pure public goods" national defense, scientific research, and a few other areas which benefit everyone but do not necessarily rise in cost as the population rises. <br> Rector found that in 2004, the most recent year for which figures are available, low-skill households received an average of $32,138 per household the great majority in the form of means-tested aid and direct benefits. (Rector excluded from that figure the cost of public goods and interest; with those included, he says, each low-skill household receives an average of $43,084.) Against that, Rector found that low-skill households paid an average of $9,689 in taxes. (The biggest chunk of that was the Social Security tax $2,509 followed by state and local taxes, consumption taxes, property taxes, and federal income taxes, but Rector counted everything, including highway levies and lottery purchases.) In the final calculation, he found, the average low-skill household received $22,449 more in benefits than it paid in taxes the $32,138 in benefits, excluding public goods, minus the $9,689 in taxes. <br> Taking that $22,449, and multiplying it by the 17.7 million low-skill households, Rector found that the total deficit for such households was $397 billion in 2004. "Over the next ten years the total cost of low-skill households to the taxpayer (immediate benefits minus taxes paid) is likely to be at least $3.9 trillion," Rector writes. "This number would go up significantly if changes in immigration policy lead to substantial increases in the number of low-skill immigrants entering the country and receiving services." <br> From a purely money perspective, it's a powerful argument. At a cost of $22,449 per household per year well, multiply that by an adult lifespan of 50 years and you have an average lifetime cost to the taxpayer of $1.1 million per unskilled worker. Increase that population with a wave of unskilled immigrants, and you're talking a lot of money. <br> There's probably room for argument on Rector's exact numbers. Jeffrey Passell, a senior research associate at the Pew Hispanic Center, questions whether some of Rector's cost estimates might be too high. For example, the arrival of new illegal immigrations will likely not raise the cost of defending the country, he says, so perhaps future immigrants will not be quite as expensive as Rector claims. (Rector tried to address that issue by excluding the cost of pure public goods in the $22,449 figure.) Still, Passell does not question the basic premise of Rector's report. "One of the purposes of our government is to provide support for people on the low end," says Passell. "Of course there is a bit more spending on households on the lower end than on the high end, and of course the low-income households don't pay as much as the high-income households. That's not surprising." <br> The bigger argument over Rector's approach is whether illegal immigrants bring economic benefits that outweigh their undisputed costs. Tamar Jacoby, an advocate of comprehensive reform who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, points to a study done recently of immigrants in North Carolina which estimated that in the past 10 years, Hispanic immigrants had cost the state $61 million in benefits while being responsible for more than $9 billion in economic growth. "Yes, the individual might cost more in services," says Jacoby, "but they are growing the pie so significantly that that cost pales in comparison." <br> Not so, says Rector. "The problem is, the growth to the pie that they make, they eat," he explains. The economic growth reflected in the numbers, he says, is what the immigrant workers are making. "To the extent that they make the pie grow any bit more than what they take out of the pie in wages, it is very subtle, and it would be a tiny fraction of the gross domestic product growth," Rector says. <br> And that means something for the immigration debate, and for George W. Bush's proposals. "Every one of these [reform] bills envisions bringing in millions and millions of additional low-skill immigrants with the right to access welfare and become citizens," says Rector. "Within 10 years, you would have four million of these individuals, each of whom can bring family. You'd be looking at a cost of $80 billion per year." Perhaps Congress and the president will decide to do that. But if Robert Rector is correct, no one should underestimate the cost. <br> By Byron York Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Larry Kudlow.<br><br>Another impressive jobs report was released by the U.S. Department of Labor last Friday, but you didn't hear anything about it from the big three Republican candidates for president. They claim to support President Bush's supply-side tax cuts and say they will fight repeal should they be elected to the Oval Office. Yet neither Sen. McCain, nor former-Gov. Romney, nor former-Mayor Giuliani talks about the continued economic benefits of the sweeping tax cuts of 2003. <br> This is puzzling. It's easy to understand why the leading Democratic candidates are silent on the matter. Sen. Clinton., Sen. Obama, and former-Sen. Edwards intend to overturn President Bush's supply-side program, and would do so with the usual liberal mantra of taxing the rich. But Republican silence is baffling in the real-world laboratory where evidence shows the tax cuts have worked. In particular, taxing capital less has unlocked new investment and unleashed record liquidity to fund business and the stock market, even in the face of money-tightening actions by the Federal Reserve. <br> Just look at the evidence. Wall Street economist Michael Darda points out that real wages from increased job creation have climbed at twice the speed during this business cycle than in the first 66 months of the previous cycle. Boosted by service-sector job creation, non-farm payrolls grew by 97,000 in February, with a net upward revision of 55,000 for the December and January reports. The median length, or duration, of unemployment fell 8 percentage points in the last year, while non-management wages increased 4.1 percent, almost twice the inflation rate. <br> The U.S. job-creating machine is firing on all cylinders. Significant GDP-slowing inventory corrections in housing and manufacturing couldn't stop it, nor could unusually bad February weather. Get this: According to Wall Streeter Joe LaVorgna, 505,000 people couldn't get to work because of bad weather last month, the highest number in 10 years and twice the normal seasonal weather effect of the past five Februarys. Yet jobs still rose substantially, and next month's report will likely include another positive payback revision. <br> It's also a quality jobs boom: Americans with a high-school diploma registered a 4.3 percent unemployment rate (slightly less than the national average), those with some college education had a 3.6 rate, and those with a bachelor's degree or higher had a rock-bottom 1.9 percent rate. <br> The biggest dilemma in the jobs stats is the 7.1 percent unemployment rate for people with less than a high-school diploma. But taxing the rich will not solve this. Education reform, such as parental school choice and merit pay for teachers, will. <br> But why the silence from McCain, Romney, and Giuliani on all the good news? Despite the headwinds of war and recession six years ago, the Reagan-Bush tax-cut model has again spurred a long-lasting, job-creating economic expansion. Even Bill Richardson, the Democratic governor of New Mexico who is a card-carrying member of the nearly extinct tax-cutting school launched by JFK, has been silent on all this. <br> If these presidential contenders truly believe in the tax-cutting model, they should be saying so. The positives are simply too positive to go unspoken. U.S. employment is now a record 146 million, and 9.5 million higher since the expansion started in December 2001, according to Bear Stearns economist David Malpass. The Federal Reserve reports a record $55.6 trillion in household net worth (up 7.4 percent from a year ago) and a record $1.7 trillion in corporate profits (up 20 percent). All this should be shouted from the mountaintops. <br> And then there's the just-released Forbes list of worldwide billionaires. This list registered a staggering $3.5 trillion in wealth and a record 946 members, up 150 from last year for a 35 percent gain. Almost half the list is comprised of Americans, with significant representation from emerging countries like China, Hong Kong, Mexico, Russia, and Spain. <br> "This is the richest year in human history," said editor in chief Steve Forbes. The list "is a mere reflection of a dynamic global economy. More people are better off on this earth than ever before." <br> What's going on here is plain to see: It's the global spread of free-market capitalism. The American model of "cowboy capitalism" of low tax rates, deregulation, contained inflation, and free trade is producing unheard of wealth that is turning the have-nots into haves. <br> Many years ago, British diplomat and political philosopher Isaiah Berlin taught us that while the fox knows many small things, the hedgehog knows one big thing and that it's the one big thing that always wins the race. Today, the successful worldwide spread of free-market capitalism is the one big idea that puts me solidly in the hedgehog camp. But are there any hedgehogs running for president? <br> By Larry Kudlow Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Jeremy Kahn</i>. In the latest James Bond thriller, "Casino Royale," 007's mission is to stop an amoral money man for international terrorist organizations from winning a high-stakes poker game. Bond is assisted in this effort by a dashing British agent, Vesper Lynd, played by the beguiling Eva Green. And, in a modern twist on the old Ian Fleming formula, Lynd does not work for Her Majesty's Secret Service, but rather for the Chancellor of the Exchequer she's a Treasury agent. <br> John B. Taylor, the Stanford economist who served as Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs throughout President Bush's first term, wants everyone to know that U.S. Treasury officials play just as important and sometimes just as daring a role as Lynd in the real-life war against terrorism. Taylor has a new book out, "Global Financial Warriors: The Untold Story of International Finance in the Post-9/11 World," that seems intended to ensure that Treasury's or, perhaps more accurately, Taylor's contribution to America's current war effort is not overlooked. <br> To drive home the point, Taylor placed an op-ed in last week's New York Times defending Treasury against California Representative Henry Waxman, who, in a hearing last month, criticized the Bush administration's decision to fly large shipments of cash into Iraq immediately after the invasion. "Who in their right mind would send 360 tons of cash into a war zone?" Waxman demanded. Taylor didn't see anything wrong with his mind; he called the cash transfers "one of the most successful and carefully planned operations of the war." <br> Taylor is right that Iraq really needed that cash after the invasion and also that the conversion from old Iraqi dinars to a new currency, which he also lauded in the op-ed, went off without a hitch. But Taylor's narrative overstates the success of Treasury's efforts in Iraq, ignores Waxman's basic point which was about oversight in the reconstruction effort and, through omission, seeks to whitewash the Treasury's culpability in many of the policy failures that have hampered U.S. efforts in Iraq since 2003. <br> The story of Treasury's cash shipments is one I know well. In May 2003, Fortune magazine sent me to Iraq to chronicle efforts to get the economy back on track. I traveled in convoys that moved millions in Iraqi dinars crammed into burlap sacks and placed in armored personnel carriers around Baghdad. I watched vast quantities of U.S. dollars much of it newly minted and flown from the Federal Reserve banks of Atlanta and New York in plastic-wrapped bricks being airlifted to Kirkuk and Mosul to pay the salaries of Iraqi government employees. (I even stood on a stack of $23 million at the airport.) And I spent a good amount of time hanging out with the civilians and soldiers who were responsible for reopening Iraq's banks and figuring out how to stave off economic collapse. <br> April and May 2003 were chaotic months in Iraq. Most banks were shuttered; some had been looted. Saddam's son Qusay had stolen $1 billion from Iraq's Central Bank just before U.S. troops arrived. Many government ministries had also been looted and, in Iraq's socialized economy, large segments of the population were not showing up for work except on payday. At the same time, there was a legitimate fear of civil unrest if government workers and pensioners were not paid. So flying money in from the United States was a sensible stopgap. Besides, as Taylor points out, most of the money initially sent to Iraq belonged to the Iraqis in the first place it had been frozen in U.S. banks since Saddam's invasion of Kuwait. Later, when U.S. troops recovered most of the money Qusay had stolen, this, too, was used in reconstruction efforts. <br> Taylor argues that these shipments of cash had been carefully planned. (He cites a presentation then-Treasury Secretary John Snow made to President Bush and the National Security Council in March 2003.) But, while the concept may have been, the mechanics certainly were not. Like much of the postwar planning, administration officials assumed the pieces would magically fall into place once Baghdad was liberated. From what I saw and from interviews with Treasury staff the actual movement of money around the country was a completely ad hoc operation. The troops, armored cars, and helicopters needed to protect cash as it was shuttled from place to place were pressed into service at the last minute. It was just lucky that officials unearthed servicemen with accounting backgrounds to assist in the operation none had been assigned in advance of the invasion. Meanwhile, many Treasury experts with highly technical skills in economic planning and budgeting were forced to become glorified Brinks employees spending much of their time merely moving cash around the country. <br> Taylor claims that "Treasury officials who watched over the payment process in Baghdad in those first few weeks reported a culture of good record keeping." I watched salaries being disbursed to Iraqis on a number of occasions from banks, at a ministry building, and, at least once, from the back of a truck. While Iraqis needed certain papers to get paid and salaries were usually handed out by ministry supervisors (who, presumably, knew who their own employees were), in practice the payment system was often disorderly, and Taylor overstates the extent to which harried Treasury advisers were able to police the process. 
 This column was written by Isaac Chotiner</i>. "It's just like they have become one giant whining windbag," Frank Luntz says to me when I ask his opinion of Republican leaders in Washington. Luntz may be the GOP's most recognizable and famous pollster, but he is none too happy with the current state of his party. "They are adrift and they are leaderless," he exclaims, his voice rising. "When they came into the House they held a press conference and I was just sickened. It was all complaints about process." His tone shifts to a higher pitch as he mimics a generic Republican lawmaker: "'We're not being allowed to offer amendments; we're not being allowed our time on the floor.' It was the worst sort of partisan whining." <br> Many in Washington might agree with this analysis, but Luntz is more than just any member of the establishment. In 1994, he not only helped write Republican House member Newt Gingrich's Contract with America; he was also responsible for its presentation to the public. Four years later, he advised Republicans trying to impeach Bill Clinton. And, over the last decade, his memos and ideas have been more influential and widely circulated than those of any other message guru. And yet, like other GOP stalwarts who helped usher in an era of conservative dominance, Luntz isn't happy with the results. From Gingrich to former Representative Dick Armey, it seems that, the closer you were to the Republican Revolution, the more despondent you are about what that revolution has become. For his part, Luntz is going farther than other GOP critics literally. He recently bought a condominium in sunny Santa Monica, California, and he's intent on dispensing with the capital city altogether. But, in his anger and disappointment with the politics and culture of Washington, he is forgetting one thing: He, as much as anyone else, is responsible for the very mess he desperately wants to escape. <br> Luntz came to Washington fresh from an education at the University of Pennsylvania and Oxford in 1987. His quick mind and ability to easily explain complex polling data led to a succession of plum jobs: First, as Pat Buchanan's pollster in his insurgent 1992 challenge to George H.W. Bush; then, on Ross Perot's independent general election campaign. Not particularly ideological or partisan, Luntz focused on disaffected and disgruntled voters the type that both Buchanan and Perot appealed to. The following year, he polled for then-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and it was during this time that he caught the eye of Gingrich. The Georgia conservative knew that any chance his party had of taking over the House depended on appealing to the very voters Luntz had spent so much time researching. "Frank was the first person to understand the scale of radicalism in the middle class," Gingrich would say. "He understands the citizen populist reaction against government in a way that is very helpful." <br> By 1994, Luntz was flying around the country with Gingrich and shaping the speaker-to-be's message. When Luntz talks about this era, his tone is nothing short of wistful. "I miss the old days," he tells me. "I had one year of my life that was better than every other. It began with a retreat in Salisbury in 1994, and it ended with Republicans on January 3 taking control of the House. I was dressed in my usual sneakers and some sort of polo shirt. They picked me up off the ground and carried me on the floor of the House so I could be there." After aiding other Republican candidates and advising the GOP as it successfully impeached Clinton, Luntz appeared frequently as a guest on national television shows and wrote a couple of books. In short, he became a member of the Washington scene. <br> To this day, Luntz talks about Gingrich with a reverence that feels unusual coming from the wonkish mind of a pollster. "He is brilliant an intellectual genius and someone who genuinely wanted to spark a nationwide debate involving every American about the future of the country," Luntz says, before excoriating those who tried to attack Gingrich over ethics violations (the House ethics committee eventually fined the former speaker $300,000 for misusing tax-exempt funds to support a college course he taught). In Luntz's telling, what was once a visionary movement of bold ideas has been consumed by the nasty and anti-intellectual culture that dominates Washington. "I read these blogs," he says, his voice downbeat. "They are so bitter. So bitter and so angry. ... It's not my style." And later: "I think Washington, D.C., is intellectually tired." <br> It's hard to argue with Luntz's take on the state of intellectual debate in Washington. But Luntz's career has been about nothing so much as cheapening language and obscuring honest discussion. During the debate over tort reform in 2005, a memo written by Luntz, which eventually leaked to the press, classily counseled Republicans with the following: "It is tempting to counter-attack using facts and figures. Resist the temptation. ... The President's language works because it speaks to a series of individual proposals that common sense suggests will lead to job creation." When House Republicans wanted to gut Medicare in 1995, Luntz advised them to be, well, blatantly dishonest about what they were doing: If the cuts would be perceived as long-term savings, he said, then the public would go along with benefit cuts. "We want a solution that preserves and protects Medicare," Gingrich said at the time, echoing Luntz's advice. Luntz's most notorious memo may be the one he sent out in 2003 about the threat of global warming: "Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue" even though no such "lack of scientific certainty" exists. <br> And, yet, if you ask Luntz about his role in Washington over the last decade, he has no regrets. "I wouldn't change anything," he says. Pushed on whether his snappy and often misleading slogans hurt political debate, he is circumspect, saying only that sloganeering has been going on for 150 years. As for partisanship, which he lists as one of his main reasons for wanting to escape the Beltway, he is equally remorseless. But didn't the Clinton impeachment, which he helped bring about, play a crucial role in creating the climate he so detests? "He should have resigned," Luntz says curtly of Clinton, although he does later admit that Republicans were too angry during this time. Talking to him, it's hard not to get the sense that what he really doesn't like about Washington is that Republicans simply are not winning as much. In short, message discipline can't mask what most Americans see as a failed administration and a corrupt party. And, for this message shaper, nothing could be more frustrating. <br> Part of his problem may be that Republicans are not listening to him as much anymore. According to Luntz, he warned Republicans more than a year before the 2006 elections that they were going to lose badly, but his advice on how to rectify the situation was ignored. It's no secret, however, that Luntz and House Minority Leader John Boehner share a long-standing dislike of each other, and there have been whispers that it was Boehner who kept Luntz from speaking at a Republican retreat last year. According to Roll Call, Luntz responded by making an unsuccessful attempt to get on the event's schedule anyway. <br> It's hard not to sympathize with Luntz's desire to get away from Washington and spend some time at the beach. When the subject of his new condominium comes up, he first mentions his home in the Washington suburb of McLean, Virginia."You've probably heard about my house," he exclaims. "It's got a great collection of historic memorabilia: baseballs, Hollywood, but, more importantly, the first Life magazine, the first Sports Illustrated, the first TV Guide." (Luntz once said of his home that "People like to call [it] the Smithsonian West. It isn't. It's a house where people come to play and learn.") And yet, he's willing to give it all up: "I gotta tell you something about L.A.," he says. "I can turn my brain off." No kidding. Luntz may find the inner peace he craves by escaping, but the city he leaves behind will still have plenty of Republicans who share his disgust with what the GOP has become. They just won't have the author of their misery. <br> By Isaac Chotiner If you like this article, go to www.tnr.com, which breaks down today's top stories and offers nearly 100 years of news, opinion, and analysis 
 President Bush will deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday night to a nation that's strongly opposed to his plan for increasing troops in Iraq and deeply unhappy with his performance as president, according to a CBS News poll. <br> Mr. Bush's overall approval rating has fallen to just 28 percent, a new low, while more than twice as many (64 percent) disapprove of the way he's handling his job. <br> Two-thirds of Americans remain opposed to the president's plan for sending more than 20,000 additional U.S. troops to Iraq roughly the same number as after Mr. Bush announced the plan. And 72 percent believe he should seek congressional approval for the troop increase. <br> However, the poll finds more Americans might back the president's plan if they were convinced it would assure U.S. success in Iraq. <br> SHOULD U.S. SEND 20,000 MORE TROOPS TO IRAQ? <br> Favor <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="58" height="10">29%<b> Oppose<br>66% <br> if it increased U.S.' chances for success? <br> Favor <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="106" height="10">53%<b> Oppose<br>38% <br> However, Americans aren't convinced the U.S. needs a troop increase to achieve its goals in Iraq. Just 26 percent think that's needed, about the same number that think those goals can be reached without sending in more troops. <br> Forty-one percent think the U.S. can't achieve its goals regardless of troop levels. <br> There's still more troubling news for the president: By a more than 2-to-1 margin, Americans think Mr. Bush does not share their priorities. Just 28 percent think he does, while 69 percent think he does not. <br> More than two-thirds of Americans also think the country has gotten off on the wrong track, while just 26 percent think it is headed in the right direction. <br> DOES BUSH SHARE YOUR PRIORITIES? <br> Yes <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="56" height="10">28%<b> No<br>69% <br> Mr. Bush's approval rating is much lower than it was one year ago, when 42 percent of Americans approved, and far lower than the ratings he received in polls prior to his previous State of the Union addresses. Those ratings have fallen steadily since a high of 82 percent in January 2002, shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. <br> His job approval is also far below those of other modern two-term presidents at this point in their second terms. <br> In January 1999, for example, just after his impeachment by the House of Representatives, President Bill Clinton's job approval rating was 65 percent. In January 1987, President Ronald Reagan's was 52 percent. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson received a 47 percent approval rating, even as debate about the Vietnam War raged. <br> The war in Iraq remains the most important problem facing the country, cited by 33 percent of Americans, far more than mentioned the next top issues, the economy and jobs (8 percent) and health care (7 percent). <br> Only one in four believes the war is going even somewhat well, while three-quarters say it's going badly something the president himself acknowledged earlier this month and the highest number since the war began. <br> MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM <br> War in Iraq<br>33%<b>Economy and jobs		<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="16" height="10">8%<b>Health care		<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="14" height="10">7% <br> Americans are split on whether Congress, now under Democratic control, should offer a non-binding resolution against the troop increase: 42 percent say yes and 42 percent say no. But more than half of Americans including most Democrats want Congress to cut off the money for the troop buildup, including a small number who want to cut funds for the entire war. <br> Mr. Bush is expected to talk mostly about domestic concerns in Tuesday's address and that is what most Americans want to hear; just one in four wants to hear mostly about foreign policy and Iraq. Thomas Mann, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution says, "He's already invested in a national speech on the subject, which was not well received in the country or in the Congress. My guess is he will talk more about the War on Terrorism, and link Iraq to that broader initiative." <br> On the domestic front, Americans think the economy is in good shape, but a majority says the Social Security system needs to be fixed now. <br> The public is split on whether the 2001 tax cuts should be made permanent. More than half think the issue of illegal immigration is very serious, but are divided on whether Congress will actually pass immigration reform. <br> Americans continue to see global warming as a serious problem. Seven in 10 say it is a problem that is having a serious impact right now. A quarter disagrees. <br> This poll was conducted among a random sample of 1,168 adults nationwide, interviewed by telephone January 18-21, 2007. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups is higher. An oversample of African-Americans was also conducted for this poll, for a total of 221 interviews among this group. The results were then weighted in proportion to the racial composition of the adult population in the U.S. Census. The margin of error for African-Americans is plus or minus seven points.<br> 
 This column was written by Fred Barnes</i>You can't govern from Capitol Hill. Newt Gingrich, as Republican House speaker, tried after the landslide of 1994 and failed. Yet Democrats, with their "100 hours" agenda in the House and 10 legislative "priorities" in the Senate, act as if they can run Washington. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Harry Reid are promising to take the country in a "new direction." Good luck. <br> What stands in their way? Three rather large impediments. One, the Democratic majority in the Senate is fragile (51-49), and it's hardly overwhelming in the House (233-202). Second, Democrats are fractured on many issues--not just Iraq but even on whether to pursue a moderate strategy of moving slowly and carefully or one of going for broke to roll back the conservative advances of the Bush years. And third, there's Bush and his weapons. <br> The president has quite an arsenal: veto, filibuster by Senate Republicans, bully pulpit, a potential alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats on selected issues, recess appointments, discretion to act on foreign policy without congressional approval. In a political fight, Congress can't match a president's tools. <br> And Bush is prepared to use them. His strategy is to join with Democrats on issues on which they agree--extension of No Child Left Behind, comprehensive immigration reform, and stepped-up funding for alternative energy--and strongly oppose everything else that Democrats are proposing. This amounts to limited bipartisanship--very limited. <br> Bush, according to aides, feels "liberated" to insist on fiscal restraint. He was more or less obligated--or at least felt he was--to sign spending bills passed by a Republican Congress. But with a Democratic Congress, "he can be bolder than he otherwise might have been," an aide says. That means a willingness--perhaps an eagerness--to use the veto. In his first six years as president, Bush often threatened vetoes but vetoed only a single measure. <br> To the delight of the White House, Democrats have endorsed the same fiscal goal as the president: a balanced budget by 2012. But Bush and Democrats are sure to disagree on how to achieve it. The White House wants to hold down spending but not raise taxes. Bush advisers assume Democrats will prefer higher spending plus tax increases. And they're convinced the politics of the two plans favors Republicans. "I want the Democrats saying higher taxes," an aide says. <br> This approach is a bit of a gamble. Democrats believe raising taxes on the well-to-do to pay for, say, expanded health care benefits for children is a political winner. It might be. But when Bush adviser Karl Rove spoke to Grover Norquist's weekly gathering of conservatives last week in Washington, he offered to bet anyone in the room $5 that the president would finish his two terms without having signed a single tax hike. Rove had only one taker. <br> If Rove is right--and I believe he is--Social Security reform is off the table in Bush's final two years. Democrats look kindly on a fiscal fix for Social Security that involves raising the ceiling on income subject to payroll taxation. But they won't offer Bush what he might want--personal investment accounts--in exchange for swallowing a tax increase. "He's not going to raise taxes for nothing," an adviser says. 
 Americans are generally optimistic about the new Democratic-controlled Congress that convened on Thursday, according to a CBS News poll. But half the public doubts that President Bush and the Democrats will be able to work together to get things done including dealing with the situation in Iraq. <br> Sixty-eight percent of those polled said they had optimistic feelings about the 110th Congress, which will be led by Democrats for the first time in 12 years. Just 25 percent said they were pessimistic. <br> Nearly half expect that this Congress will accomplish more than usual over the next two years. <br> FEELINGS ABOUT NEW CONGRESS <br> Optimistic <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="136" height="10">68%<b> Pessimistic <br>25% <br> But when asked if Democrats and President Bush can cooperate in general and on Iraq, which is overwhelmingly Americans' top priority half those polled were doubtful. <br> WILL PRESIDENT BUSH AND THE DEMOCRATS WORK TOGETHER ON IRAQ? <br> Yes <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="82" height="10">41%<b> No <br>51% <br> Iraq was far and way the No. 1 issue Americans want the new Congress to address, easily outpacing other concerns like the economy/jobs, health care and immigration. <br> More than 70 percent expect Democrats in Congress will try to start bringing at least some U.S. troops home from Iraq something a majority of Americans hope will happen. <br> WANT NEW CONGRESS TO CONCENTRATE ON: <br> War in Iraq <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="90" height="10">45%<b> Economy/jobs <br>7%<b> Health care <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="14" height="10">7%<b> Immigration <br>6% <br> Still, there is little confidence that either the Democrats or President Bush have a clear plan for Iraq. Less than one in 10 say the Democrats have a plan, while just one in five say Mr. Bush has one. <br> Starting off 2007, Mr. Bush's overall approval rating remains low at just 30 percent, his worst number ever in a CBS News poll, while his approval rating for handling Iraq is even lower at 23 percent even after the execution of Saddam Hussein. <br> DO DEMOCRATS HAVE A CLEAR PLAN FOR IRAQ? <br> Yes <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="16" height="10">8%<b> No <br>82% <br> DOES PRESIDENT BUSH HAVE A CLEAR PLAN FOR IRAQ? <br> Yes <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="40" height="10">20%<b> No <br>76% <br> Americans don't think the execution of the former Iraqi president will improve the situation in Iraq. In fact, 40 percent believe Saddam's execution will make things worse and result in more attacks on U.S. troops. Just 5 percent think it will lead to fewer attacks against U.S. troops. <br> Mr. Bush did get a bump from last month in his handling of the economy, with 41 percent now saying they approve of the job he's doing his highest rating on this measure since July 2005. Six in 10 Americans now rate the economy as being in good shape. <br> BUSH'S JOB APPROVAL RATING <br> Approve <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="60" height="10">30%<b> Disapprove<br>63% <br> BUSH'S JOB HANDLING IRAQ <br> Approve <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="46" height="10">23%<b> Disapprove<br>72% <br> Turning to how the new Congress will handle domestic issues, the poll found two-thirds of Americans expect a raise in the minimum wage, while 39 percent expect a tax increase. <br> Americans were split, 42 percent to 42 percent, on whether immigration reform would be passed. <br> The poll also found Americans have positive feelings about former President Gerald R. Ford, who passed away on Dec. 26. Sixty-nine percent approved of the way Ford handled his job as president, while just 4 percent disapproved. <br> This poll was conducted among a random sample of 993 adults nationwide, interviewed by telephone January 1-3, 2007.

 This column was written by the editors of National Review Online</i>As the 110th Congress convenes, National Review Online asked a group of congressional experts to give the new minority some advice: How can the GOP show some constructive leadership during the Democrats' first 100 legislative hours? Here's their counsel. <br> Vronique de Rugy<br>The GOP could show constructive leadership by reforming the supplemental spending process. Though supplemental spending was kept under control throughout 1990s, the trend since 1998 has been a sharp increase in the amount of discretionary supplemental appropriations and a precipitous decline in offsetting rescissions. In 1998, supplemental spending amounted to $7 billion, while in 2005, it was $143 billion (in inflation-adjusted dollars). And in FY2006, over 17 percent of all new discretionary spending was spent through the supplemental process. <br> The increased reliance on supplemental spending is problematic because the lack of detail in supplemental budget requests combined with their expedited approval process leaves little room for congressional oversight. In addition, the reduced budget discipline for supplemental bills attracts earmarks and other projects that wouldn't be funded on their own merits. <br> Further, supplemental appropriations designated as emergencies do not count against the annual budget limits set by Congress, and since the expiration of certain budget constraints in 2002, supplemental appropriations that exceed the limits no longer trigger automatic cuts. Consequently, supplemental bills, and emergency supplementals in particular, have become the tool of choice to evade annual budget limits and increase spending across the board. Funding the military even predictable, non-emergency needs through supplementals hides skyrocketing defense costs and allows Congress to boost regular appropriations for both defense and nondefense programs. Addressing the supplemental-spending shell game that Capitol Hill and the White House have been playing for years would save taxpayers roughly $100 billion per year. Some simple reforms such as clearly defining what constitute an emergency would achieve that goal. That would make it easier for the GOP to try to make their tax cuts permanent. <br> Veronique de Rugy is a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. <br> David McIntosh<br>Republicans can play a constructive role in the 110th Congress. First we must make it clear to the American people that Republicans heard their message in the last election and we are returning to our core principles of limited government. Republicans should embrace those parts of the Democratic majority's agenda that support limited government such as proposals to limit spending and balanced the budget. At the same time, we should boldly propose ideas to further reduce taxes and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful government spending. Third, Republicans be ready to vigorously oppose proposals that increase the size and scope of the federal government. Several ideas have surfaced like new Superfund taxes, price controls on medicines, and regulating the Internet that take away freedom from American citizens and undermine our free-market economy. Republicans should be prepared to stand tall in opposing these bad ideas and offering constructive, free-market alternatives. <br> Our leaders should make the Republican party once again "the party of ideas," based on conservative principles. Those of us not in government must do our part to support the leadership when they take such action. By acting boldly and standing by our principles, it will show that Republicans are once again ready to lead Congress. <br> David M. McIntosh, a former Republican congressman from Indiana, is a partner at Mayer, Brown, Rowe Maw LLP, in Washington, D.C. <br> Grover Norquist<br>For the next two years, conservatives will not be able to pass any useful legislation through the House of Representatives. Memorize that sentence. Place it on your PC screensaver. Use it as your message on your answering machine. A discreet but easily accessed tattoo would be helpful. <br> All temptations to actually pass something lead to a conversation where the hard left of the Democrat party the old bulls who are the Democrat leadership and committee chairmen has a veto over anything. You can label the bottle. They will fill it. <br> Republicans in Congress need to use the first 100 days and the next two years to lose. Propose House rules that keep the present GOP requirement for a 3/5 vote to raise taxes. And lose. Propose House rules that term limit committee chairmen the old GOP rule only applied to Republicans. And lose. Propose a tax cut. And lose. Heck, get denied an actual vote. Have a procedural vote. And lose. Propose an end to earmarks. And lose. Write welfare reform part three. And lose. <br> In November 2006 not enough voters saw a Republican congressional leadership they wanted to vote for and too few saw Democrat party leadership that scared them. The next two years is about changing both of those perceptions. <br> Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform. <br> John J. Pitney Jr.<br>House Republicans aren't going to do much legislating. As the Washington Post has reported, Democrats are reneging on their promise to let the minority party play a full role in floor deliberations. The broken pledge should surprise no one: Democrats are merely picking up where they left off 12 years ago. <br> So what can the Republicans do? To the limited extent that they can offer amendments and alternatives, they should force the Democrats to show whether they are as "moderate" as the conventional wisdom has depicted them. A hike in the minimum wage will hurt small businesses, so see if they are willing to moderate their approach by buffering the impact with tax relief. "Pay-as-you-go" schemes invite evasion or tax increases, so propose tough spending restraint. Republicans might not be able to enact such measures, but they can bring the Democrats' true positions into the sunlight that Speaker Pelosi likes to talk about. <br> John J. Pitney Jr. is a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, in Claremont, Calif. <br> Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Victor Davis Hanson</i><br>These are strange times. <br> Perennially beleaguered Israel, for instance, was hit all summer long with rockets from Lebanon and Gaza, as the world watched and kept score in an absurd new game of proportionality: Israel was to be blamed because its hundreds of air strikes against combatants were lethal, while Hezbollah was to be excused for shooting off thousands of rockets aimed at civilians because of its relative incompetence. <br> This week Iran hosted an international conference on Holocaust denial. The gathering was as bizarre as a bar out of Star Wars, a collection of every crackpot anti-Semite the world over, all there for a scripted, tightly controlled hatefest advertised as a "free" exchange of ideas unknown in Europe. <br> Jimmy Carter, silent about Iran's latest promotion for its planned holocaust, is hawking his latest book in typical fashion, sorta, kinda alleging that the Israelis are like the South Africans in perpetuating an apartheid state, that they are cruel to many Christians, and, as occupiers, are understandably the targets of suicide bombers and other terrorist killers. Sadly, all that shields this wrinkled-browed, lip-biting moralist from complete infamy is sympathy for a man bewildered in his dotage. <br> Meanwhile, some members of the Iraqi Study Group apparently think that since Israel's neocon surrogates got us into Iraq, their puppet master must pay the price for getting us out. Thus, Israel must give up the Golan Heights, or perhaps the West Bank, since that would make the Islamic nations so collectively happy that they would join us in ridding Iraq of the terrorists whom many of these nations have subsidized, trained, and sheltered. <br> The surprise is no longer that the cretin Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calls for the destruction of Israel, but only that his serial threats have still not become banal. In any language, there can be only so many synonyms and idioms for "wipe-out" and "vanish," yet Ahmadinejad always finds some fresh way to express his fundamental desire. <br> In Washington, realists are back, and they have a point: Israel really does remain at the heart of the furor of the Middle East just not in the way they suppose. <br> It is not "stolen" land, or "Zionist" killings, or Jewish "aggression" that gnaws at the Arab Street. And the solution is therefore not to be found in short-term Israeli land-concessions, but only in the now caricatured and apparently waning policy of supporting democratic reform inside the Middle East. <br> The real problem is that Israeli success, and the resulting sense of failure in the surrounding Arab world, fuels much of the rabid hatred. Many of us have been writing exactly that for years and have been dubbed novices and worse who don't understand the complex undercurrents of the Middle East. In January 2004, for example, I suggested in passing the following on these pages: <br> Instead, [Israel] stoked the fury arising from Arabs' sense of weakness and self-contempt. In the world of the Palestinian lobster bucket, Israel's great sin is not bellicosity or aggression, but succeeding beyond the wildest dreams of its neighbors. How humiliating it must be to be incapable of even muttering the word "Israel" (hence the need for "Zionist entity"), but nevertheless preferring an Israeli to a Palestinian ID card. 
 This column was written by Larry Kudlow</i><br>Media mogul Oprah Winfrey anointed him presidential heir-apparent on "Larry King Live." Three-thousand adoring fans clung to his every word in New Hampshire. His new book sits atop The New York Times' bestseller list. Over on "Monday Night Football," he announced that, after "a good deal of soul-searching," that he is ready (wink-wink) ... "for the Bears to go all the way!" (How's that for free advertising?) <br> Barack Obama is on a big-time roll. <br> In a Washington minute, the Democratic senator from Illinois has the media saying, "Hillary Clinton who?" But every honeymoon must come to an end, and I can think of a few reasons why Wall Street might want these nuptials annulled fast. <br> Last Sunday, while stumping er, speaking in New Hampshire, the young senator delivered an interesting line. Attempting to explain his sudden rock-star ascendancy to the pantheon of presidential hopefuls, Obama said voters wanted a new vision: "It's a spirit that says we are looking for something different we want something new." <br> Trouble is, there's nothing "new" or "different" about Barack Obama. Behind that charm and charisma a media-entrancing appeal worthy of Bill Clinton is an extremely liberal-left politician. <br> Just look at his record. <br> Obama voted against the Bush tax cuts on capital gains and dividends, justifying his anti-growth stance with the old class-warfare saw about tax cuts for the rich. Of course, these are the very same tax cuts that spurred economic expansion, created record job growth, and reduced the deficit as revenues flooded the Treasury. <br> The young senator also voted against repealing the death tax. He dismissed it as a "Paris Hilton tax break" that would give "billions of dollars to billionaire heirs and heiresses." Try telling that to the owners of farms, ranches, and small businesses who are forced to sell their legacies because of this tax. <br> He swings a nice protectionist bat, too. He has voted against free trade (CAFTA) and U.S. energy independence (drilling in ANWR), and has opposed lifting a $0.54 per gallon tariff on Brazilian ethanol. "Ethanol imports are neither necessary nor a practical response to current gasoline prices," he claimed. Nonsense. <br> He's also strongly opposed to personal retirement accounts for Social Security reform, and prefers instead that the government stewards your money. As Amanda Carpenter wrote in Human Events, "When speaking out against various tax cuts, Obama has likened the 'Ownership Society' which entails such things as personalized Social Security accounts, health savings accounts and school choice to 'social Darwinism.'" <br> The George W. Bush way has been to work toward ending the multiple-taxation of savings and investment to lower taxes and put the people's money back in the people's wallets. It's all about capital. Simply put, the economy can't grow without capital to fertilize the soil of new technologies, jobs, and businesses. But Obama scoffs at such notions. <br> The senator is liberal to the core. He voted against Supreme Court judges Sam Alito and John Roberts. (Even liberal senators Russ Feingold and Pat Leahy voted for Roberts.) He said no to Patriot Act wiretap extensions, despite their proven effectiveness on halting terrorist attacks over the past five years. He collaborated in blocking John Bolton's appointment to the United Nations. He earned a perfect 100 percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America. He voted against a ban on partial-birth abortions twice as a state senator. He opposed the Defense of Marriage Act and stood against the Federal Marriage Amendment, despite acknowledging his belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. <br> Let's remember that Democrats won their congressional majority by doing their best impersonation of Republicans. In securing their November sweep, the Democrats captured a huge margin of independent Ross Perot voters fiscal conservatives who favor balanced budgets, an end to deficit spending, and strong national security. Obama fails these independents on each account. <br> Do Democrats really want Obama to take them on a U-turn back to the left? <br> If the Democrats really want to embrace a rising star, they need look no further than Harold Ford, the young African-American congressman from Tennessee who nearly captured a Senate seat last month. Ford appreciates free markets and capitalism. He has boldly crossed party lines to vote to extend the investor tax cuts and expand tax-free savings accounts. He avoids class-warfare platitudes and embraces the Ownership Society. He's optimistic Reaganesque. And his pro-growth vision stands in stark contrast to Obama's nanny-state predilection. <br> The good news for Obama is that there are about 700 days until Election Day 2008. If he decides to seek the Democratic nomination, he has time to change his message perhaps after a few chats with Harold Ford. <br> By Larry Kudlow Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by John Tamny</i><br>A fall campaign pledge of the Democrats was to "make our economy fairer." And if by "fair" they intend to make us marginally less productive, but more "equal" in terms of lower economic opportunity, their plan is eminently workable. <br> At the heart of the Democrats' fairness program is the desire to reduce the wealth gap between the rich and poor. According to a front-page story in last Tuesday's Wall Street Journal, "the gap between winners and losers in the American economy has widened over the last 20 years." But this might seem odd given the events of the latest campaign season. <br> The 10 biggest fortunes in the U.S. are public fortunes in the sense that they are due to the rise of public-company stock owned by the 10 richest people in the country. What's odd is that given the chance to reform Social Security and give Americans the option to direct their FICA dollars into private accounts that would include public-company stocks, the Democrats passed, instead using their opposition to bludgeon reformist Republicans at the ballot box. <br> It's mostly lost on Democrats that access to the stock market is the best and fairest equalizer of wealth. They also don't get the fact that other than Warren Buffett, none of the 10 richest members of the 2006 Forbes 400 could claim that distinction when the magazine first began tracking the rich in 1982. "Rich" is thankfully a fluid adjective in the U.S., and so long as it is, hand wringing over gaps in wealth is foolhardy and counterproductive. <br> First up on the Democrats' equality agenda is a hike in the minimum wage. The Democrats implicitly acknowledge a relationship between job losses and artificial wage increases in only pushing for a 38 percent increment in the minimum wage to $7.15 an hour. Indeed, if they really believe their own rhetoric about the innocuous nature of forced wage hikes, why not raise the wage to $10 or $15 an hour? <br> In truth, the Democrats apparently know what we all instinctively understand about economic activity occurring on the margin. A 38 percent wage hike wouldn't kill too many jobs precisely because most workers already make more than the minimum wage. Unfortunately, for an agenda that is bent on helping the less fortunate, any wage floor means that the marginal, least-qualified worker will be left behind by legislation that raises the cost of labor. 
 This column was written by Katrina Vanden Heuvel</i>.<br>A week after the election, let me challenge some of the mainstream pundits, the conventional wisdom, political analysis or, rather, blather that's been forming. Let me separate fact from spin. <br> Spin No. 1: "This election was a victory for centrists." <br> That's way too simplistic and overlooks the fact that 100 or more candidates ran aggressively on populist economic issues against unregulated free trade, offshoring of U.S. jobs, against special interests and corporate excesses. Sure, a few winning democrats offered conservative views on guns and abortion. But virtually all ran as "pocketbook populists." The so-called Blue Dog Caucus may have expanded but the progressive caucus did, too. And it remains the larger in fact, it will be the largest and most diverse group in house at 71 members. <br> Also significant, at least 10 progressive caucus members will chair house committees, including stalwarts like John Conyers and George Miller. And some 35 will become subcommittee chairs. New members like John Hall of New York, Bruce Braley in Iowa, Carol Shea-Porter and Paul Hodes in New Hampshire, Keith Ellison in Minnesota all ran on platforms to bring troops home, promote economic fairness, make elections more honest and government more ethical and promote energy independence. <br> Spin No. 2: "Democrats have mandate for bipartisanship not change." <br> Enough with bipartisanship! It's too bad that partisanship has become associated with cable show food fights. These are times when principled partisanship is needed as we confront some real and substantive differences from economic vision (here we're going to have to really challenge the Wall Street wing of Democratic Party too). <br> But already we see the breakdown of bipartisanship on Bush's renomination of six extremist judges for the federal appeals court; on Medicare reform; on the White House's efforts to push John Bolton back into the United Nations; on attempts to push passage of illegal spying on Americans. <br> Is Bush going to sign a federal minimum wage increase and an effective prescription drug benefit under Medicare? If so, as one commentator put it, "then we can all sing bipartisan kumbaya." <br> Spin No. 3: "Congressional hearings designed to restore oversight and accountability are obstructionist, petty, partisan and a waste of time." <br> For six years, Congress's oversight function has been corroded and atrophied in a one-party Republican Congress. A vigorous examination of the administration's misconduct is not only necessary to restore checks and balances and our Constitutional system, but it is the politically necessary response to voters' overwhelming rejection of the current Congress's failure to assert itself in this area. <br> Hearings whether into war profiteering, oil industry influence, excessive CEO compensation, expanding health coverage, the plight of Iraqi vets, or executive branch misconduct are vital, not only for oversight, but to bring attention to ideas long missing in our national debate, and to lay the ground for more far-reaching legislation. <br> If designed strategically, they will also help change our national conversation over the next two years. And oversight should not be a Republican or Democratic issue; it is for members of the Constitutionalist party those true patriots who support the rule of law. 
 This column was written by William Greider</i><hr width="85%">The Democratic Party was not really ready for this. Democrats have been in the wilderness so long since Ronald Reagan launched the conservative era 25 years ago that older liberals began to think it was a life sentence. Bill Clinton was the party's rock star; he made people feel good (and occasionally cringe), but he governed in idiosyncratic ways that accommodated the right and favored small gestures over big ideas. The party adopted his risk-averse style. Its substantive meaning and political strength deteriorated further. <br> Then George W. Bush came along as the ultimate nightmare even more destructive of government and utterly oblivious to the consequences. The 2006 election closed out the conservative era with the voters' blast of rejection. Democrats are liberated again to become what? Something new and presumably better, maybe even a coherent party. <br> This is the political watershed everyone senses. The conservative order has ended, basically because it didn't work did not produce general well-being. People saw that conservatives had no serious intention of creating smaller government. They were too busy delivering boodle and redistributing income and wealth from the many to the few. Plus, Republicans got the country into a bad war, as liberals had decades before. <br> On the morning after, my 6-year-old grandson was watching TV as he got ready for school. He saw one of those national electoral maps in which blue states wiped away red states. "Water takes fire," he said. Water nourishes, fire destroys. How astute is that? It could be the theme for our new politics. <br> With Democrats in charge of the House and the Senate, we can now return to a reality-based politics that nourishes rather than destroys. The party's preoccupation with "message" should take a back seat to "substance" addressing the huge backlog of disorders and injuries produced by conservative governance. This changeover will be long and arduous. But at least it can now begin. <br> Republicans lost, but their ideological assumptions are deeply embedded in government, the economy and the social order. Many Democrats have internalized those assumptions, others are afraid to challenge them. It will take years, under the best circumstances, for Democrats to recover nerve and principle and imagination if they do. <br> But this is a promising new landscape. Citizens said they want change. Getting out of Iraq comes first, but economic reform is close behind: the deteriorating middle class, globalization and its damaging impact on jobs and wages, corporate excesses and social abuses, the corruption of politics. Democrats ran on these issues, and voters chose them. <br> The killer question: Do Democrats stick with comfortable Washington routines or make a new alliance with the people who just elected them? Progressives can play an influential role as ankle-biting enforcers. They then have to get up close and personal with Democrats. Explain that evasive, empty gestures won't cut it anymore. Remind the party that it is vulnerable to similar retribution from voters as long as most Americans don't have a clue about what Democrats stand for. <br> The first order of business is taking down Bush. The second front is the fight within the Democratic Party over its soul and sense of direction. These are obviously intertwined, but let's start with Bush and how Democrats can contain his ebbing powers. This is not a philosophical discussion. Events are already moving rapidly. 
 This column was written by Peter Ferrara</i><br>The political focus now shifts from the Republican defeat on Tuesday to the even more critical and historic election of 2008. And the Republicans can turn things around quick if they focus on bringing about meaningful and substantive reforms just as their forbears did during the Reagan revolution. <br> The height of the Reagan economic recovery occurred in 1986. And what a recovery it was. Prior to Reaganomics, the American economy was collapsing: Inflation rose 25 percent between 1979 and 1980. The prime rate hit 21 percent. Unemployment was headed toward double digits. Family income had started declining. Poverty had been increasing for years. And by 1981, every major economic indicator was headed in the wrong direction. <br> In the 19821983 period, however, every major indicator quite literally turned around. Inflation started a long decline, as did unemployment and interest rates. Family income started rising. Poverty started declining. Over the next eight years, the economy created over 20 million new jobs, with soaring growth adding the equivalent of the entire economy of West Germany to U.S. GDP. <br> The foreign-policy turnaround was even more dramatic. In the 19791980 period, the Soviet empire was on the march, and seemingly unstoppable. Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan in 1979, and the communist advance spread into Africa, South America, and even Central America, looking north. The Soviets also were deploying new nuclear missiles aimed at Europe. <br> But by 1986, Reagan's policy of quietly starving the Soviets of their chief sources of financing was well on its way, with the resulting collapse of the Soviet empire to occur just four years later. U.S.-funded counterrevolutionaries in Afghanistan and Nicaragua had stopped the Soviets cold. New Pershing II missiles were deployed in Europe to counter the Soviet threat. Reagan had started developing SDI the Strategic Defense Initiative which the cold-eyed Soviets knew they couldn't match. As Margaret Thatcher famously said, "Reagan won the Cold War without firing a shot." <br> Yet, in the 1986 elections, Reagan's second midterm, the Republicans lost 8 Senate seats and Senate control shifted to the Democrats 5345. The Democrat House majority climbed to 258-177, on its way to a 100-vote margin achieved in the 1992 elections. <br> By 1994, however, the Newt Gingrich-led revolution had produced a Republican takeover of both houses of Congress. How did this happen? <br> The Republican turnaround was achieved through a focus on substance and meaningful new ideas. After 1994, the Republican Congress not only cut taxes, but spending as well. The tax cuts focused on capital investment, and produced the economic boom of the 1990s. The revenues from that boom, along with restrained spending, turned years of historic deficits into historic surpluses. 
 This column was written by Matthew Continetti.<hr width="85%">On November 9, less than 48 hours after Democrats captured the House and a few hours before Sen. George Allen conceded defeat to James Webb, giving Democrats control of the Senate, President Bush had lunch at the White House with Democratic representatives Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer. In the brief photo opportunity following their meal, Bush played the gracious host. He twice thanked Pelosi and Hoyer for making the trip down Pennsylvania Avenue. He twice said the lunchtime conversation had been "constructive." And he twice congratulated Pelosi on her anticipated elevation to speaker of the House. <br> Pelosi, beaming, said she had offered Bush "the hand of friendship" and that the meeting had been "productive." She said she would work with the White House "in a confidence-building way" that "gets results." The two parties would debate the issues, she went on, but would also try to solve problems in a bipartisan manner. "We've made history," Pelosi said. "Now we have to make progress." <br> It was a fine sentiment, consonant with the view that last week's Democratic victory was essentially a rejection of the status quo in Washington and the conduct of American policy in Iraq. The electorate had voted to upend the balance of power and force change upon the capital. Whether the Democratic Congress will be able to bring change in a way that also broadens the party's appeal and bolsters its recent gains, no one knows. What seems plain, though, is that the greatest obstacle to future Democratic success is the Democrats themselves. <br> Over the next two years, there will be two Democratic parties. The congressional Democratic party will investigate the Bush administration and pass as much center-left legislation as possible. The presidential Democratic party, meanwhile comprising aspirants to the executive office: Sens. Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Russ Feingold, and Barack Obama; former Sen. John Edwards; Govs. Bill Richardson and Tom Vilsack; perhaps Al Gore will travel the country, raising money, holding debates, and laying the groundwork for a national campaign that might put one of them in the White House and (they hope) result in an era of unified Democratic control of government. <br> The great fear of some Democratic strategists is that the congressional party will behave in ways that alienate the independents who brought it to power, thus threatening the presidential party's chances for victory in 2008. "Will the presidential candidates in 2008 have to run away from the Democratic Congress, or will they be able to work together?" one think tank scholar asked last week. He thought the former more likely. And the congressional party's power structure and the nature of the incoming Democratic majority lend some support to his claim. 
 This column was written by Fred Barnes</i>When Republicans won the House and Senate in 1994, President Clinton was badly shaken. At a White House press conference, a reporter suggested Clinton might no longer be "relevant" as a leader. It took weeks for Clinton to recover his composure. It turned out, of course, that he was as relevant as ever as a national leader. Presidents always are. <br> If President Bush was shaken, he didn't show it. He waited only hours after Democrats had captured Congress last week to assert himself. And he instantly changed the media story from an Election Day repudiation of his presidency to his removal of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. He followed that with a press conference at which he listed the issues where compromise might be reached with congressional Democrats. This was before he'd met with either Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid. <br> Bush is a lame duck, but only technically (he won't run again). He intends to be a very live duck in his final two years in the White House. When he talked to Henry Paulson, then the CEO of Goldman Sachs, last spring about becoming treasury secretary, he promised to push hard for a serious agenda no matter what the outcome of the midterm election. The result was bad for Bush, but he plans to keep his promise. <br> Is Bush suffering from delusions of grandeur? Not really. True, he'll have to make concessions, probably painful ones, on legislative initiatives. And his prospects for getting conservative judicial nominees through the Senate are slim. But as we learned from the Gingrich years, you can't govern from Capitol Hill. The president, even weakened as Bush is, remains the central figure in Washington. <br> Bush has an unmatched set of political tools. With strong Republican minorities in both houses, he has veto power. He never used it to cancel Republican bills, but he'll be less reluctant to kill Democratic bills. Bush is in charge of foreign policy, as we'll be visibly reminded next week when he travels to Vietnam and the following week when he goes to Latvia for the NATO summit. And he is the man with the megaphone. He can always command a national audience. Pelosi and Reid can't. <br> With Rumsfeld's resignation, Bush demonstrated his willingness to make major concessions. Rather than change the strategy in Iraq, he changed the strategist. This is not the first step in a disguised retreat from Iraq, Bush aides insist, nor does it represent a turnover of national security policy to the "realists," as opposed to an idealist like Bush, who ran foreign affairs under Bush's father. The president told Rumsfeld's successor, Bob Gates, the goal is still to create a stable democratic Iraq that can defend itself in other words, victory. <br> Congressional Republicans wish Rumsfeld's departure had occurred three months earlier, and some Bush advisers agree it should have. Whether that would have reduced Republican losses is unknowable. What is clear, though, is that Bush recognized an unpopular war, without victory in sight, cannot be sustained for long. The election underscored that. Something had to give, and it was Rumsfeld. 
 This column was written by the editors of the National Review Online.<hr width="75%">House Republicans have not lost this many seats since 1974, and Senate Republicans have probably had their worst election since 1986. Republicans lost six governorships. It was a comprehensive rout. No Democratic incumbents lost. Liberal and conservative Republicans both went down. The ballot-initiative picture was a little more mixed Michigan banned racial preferences, and several states banned same-sex marriage but even there, the results tilted left. <br> This defeat had a thousand fathers. There will be a temptation simply to blame President Bush for it, given the liberal interest in continuing to weaken him and the congressional-Republican interest in avoiding blame. We'll get to Bush's share of responsibility in a moment. But let's not forget how many wounds the congressional GOP inflicted on itself. <br> Republicans lost roughly 29 seats in the House. If party leaders had forced Don Sherwood, Bob Ney, and Mark Foley out in 2005 or early 2006, they would have cut that total by three and been able to spend more resources turning narrow defeats into narrow victories. Tom DeLay and Curt Weldon should have left earlier, too. In the Senate, Conrad Burns should have been forced out. Had Ohio governor Bob Taft been pressured to resign early, a number of races there might have turned out differently. <br> It is congressional Republicans, more than the president, who are responsible for the loss of the party's reformist credentials. Republicans were perceived not just as the party in government, but as the party of government. That perception, deadly for the relatively conservative party in our politics, was accurate. When it came to earmarks, or Social Security reform, or the Foley scandal, or lobbying reform, the Republican Congress seemed more interested in preserving its own power or sticking with dysfunctional Hill traditions than in the public good. The Senate inexplicably dropped the issue of judges. There will, and should, be changes in the Republican leadership now, starting with Denny Hastert's departure. <br> Iraq policy was obviously President Bush's major contribution to the debacle. It may very well be that even under the best of circumstances, the war would have gone badly and that one of its less-important consequences would have been to hurt Republicans. But we cannot say that we have done everything possible to win it. If the short-term political pain of sending more troops to Iraq, or expanding the Army, had made a difference in Iraq, it would have been worth doing and it would have led to long-term political gains. Nor can it be said that the president has performed one of his principal wartime tasks the maintenance of domestic will to win the war as well as he could have. He kept to the "stay the course" mantra for far too long, and his manner of signaling American resolve was hard to distinguish from mulish stubbornness. Bush has a justified reputation for not listening to critics either inside or outside his party. When you don't listen to your critics, you can't engage them and you lose your ability to affect the conversation. <br> These election results should cause Republicans to rethink a strategy in which the president and the congressional leadership joined. The congressional leadership did everything possible to avoid losing operational control of the floor: not letting mostly Democratic bills through, for example, or even Democratic amendments. The president, meanwhile, refused to veto almost anything so as not to fight the Republicans in Congress. <br> Each set of decisions may have made sense as way to build the party machine. But the combination, given the tightness of Republican control of the House, made Republicans the party of the status quo. Even when he was president and had a Republican Senate, Ronald Reagan was seen as the people's ambassador in Washington, not least by conservatives. If Bush had vetoed a few spending bills, even to be overridden, more conservatives would have been rooting for his team this year. A less-partisan strategy may also have made it possible to build an ideological majority, including some Democrats. <br> We trust that there will now be no shortage of Bush vetoes. Democratic control of the House, and the Senate, mean, however, that he will mostly be vetoing bills that the Democrats have designed to be politically costly to reject. Bush will have to find some areas in which he can cooperate with some Democrats. We hope that a pro-family tax reform is one such area. <br> The Democrats face some tough choices themselves. One reason that they won was that they ran more conservative candidates, and especially cultural conservatives, than they have run in many years. If those Democrats are neatly folded into a Pelosi party, they won't hold their seats. <br> The Democrats' free ride on Iraq has ended. When bills to fund our operations in Iraq come up, they will have either to fund them, to refuse funding, or to attach conditions to funding. Whatever they decide, they will have shared responsibility for Iraq policy going forward. They will not be able to paper over their divisions. <br> While voters had understandable reasons for favoring the Democrats, we regret their decision. They may very well have given both houses of Congress to the party of racial preferences, abortion on demand, higher taxes, lawless judging and retreat from the war on terrorism both abroad and at home. <br> We will not pretend to have any detailed plan for conservatives to move forward just now. But it may be worthwhile to state the obvious, since Republicans in Washington have been quite accomplished in ignoring it. President Bush will have to figure out a way to salvage a failing Iraq policy, and congressional Republicans will have to come up with a reason for holding office beyond the perks they will no longer enjoy. <br> Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Mona Charen</i>.I can understand why Democrats are jazzed about November's election. The polls combined with the fawning media ("Oh, please, Sen. Obama, let us kiss the hem of your garment!") are giving them goose bumps such as they have not experienced since "An Inconvenient Truth" debuted in theaters. <br> What I don't understand is the seeming tepidness of so many Republicans. Yes, the war in Iraq is a long, hard slog. The world is not Topeka, Kansas (would that it were). A journalist pointed out to President Bush at his most recent press conference that the Iraq war has now been going on as long as World War II did for the United States. Well, yes, but we lost 407,316 men in World War II. On Iwo Jima alone, we lost 6,800. This is not to say that the deaths of our people in Iraq should be trivialized. But comparisons with World War II in terms of sacrifice and terrible price paid are ridiculous. <br> Republicans have abundant reasons to reserve a spot at their polling places on Election Day: <br> 1)The economy. More than 6.6 million new jobs have been created since August 2003. Our 4.1 annual growth rate is superior to all other major industrialized nations. The Dow has set record highs multiple times in the past several weeks. Productivity is up, and the deficit is down. Real, after-tax income has grown by 15 percent since 2001. Inflation has remained low. As Vice President Cheney summed it up at a recent meeting with journalists, "What more do you want?" The tax cuts proposed by President Bush and passed by a Republican Congress can take a bow. <br> 2)The Patriot Act. Democrats and liberals mourn this law as a gross infringement upon civil liberties. Yet the much-discussed abuses simply haven't materialized. The law has, on the other hand, permitted the CIA and FBI to cooperate and share information about terrorist threats at least so long as the New York Times isn't publishing the details of our counterterrorism efforts on the front page. <br> 3)The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, to which liberals clung with passionate intensity, has been cancelled, permitting us to work on missile defense. In the age of Kim Jong Il and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is anyone (except Nancy Pelosi) sorry? <br> 4)Immigration. Republicans in Congress insisted upon and got the first serious immigration restriction in decades. On Oct. 26, the president signed a law that will build a 700-mile fence along our southern border and, what is more important, does not offer amnesty. <br> 5)There has not been another terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. Who would have predicted that on 9/12? <br> 6)Libya has surrendered its nuclear program. <br> 7)A. Q. Khan's nuclear smuggling network has been rolled up. <br> 8)John Roberts and Samuel Alito sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. <br> 9)Those Democrats who do not want to close Guantanamo Bay altogether want to give all of its inmates the full panoply of rights Americans enjoy in criminal procedures. <br> 10)Democrats believe in immediate withdrawal from Iraq. If they succeed in forcing us to leave under these circumstances, the United States will suffer a stinging defeat in the war on terror. The terrorists already believe that they drove the Russians from Afghanistan and Israel from Lebanon and Gaza. They are convinced they chased us out of Lebanon in 1983 and from Somalia in 1993. According to Osama bin Laden and those who share his views, we are militarily strong but psychologically and spiritually weak. Like it or not and no one likes it we cannot leave Iraq now without utterly and decisively validating this analysis. We might as well run a white flag up the flagpole at the Capitol. <br> 11)Democrats would like to eliminate the terrorist surveillance program. <br> 12)If Democrats achieve a majority in the House, Barney Frank will chair the Financial Services Committee, Henry Waxman will head the Government Reform Committee, and Alcee Hastings will chair the Intelligence Committee. <br> 13)Democrats believe that the proper response to Kim Jong Il's nuclear test is "face to face talks." That's what the Clinton administration did for years. It worked out well, didn't it? <br> By Mona Charen Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column was written by Deroy Murdock</i>.If the election were held today, surveys suggest that Democrats would win the U.S. House and possibly even the Senate. Luckily for Republicans, Election Day is not today, but just under two weeks from now. Nonetheless, glum Republicans are so busy shopping for caskets that they cannot feel their own beating hearts. President Bush should energize Republican candidates and activists so they will stop the post-Mark Foley moping and go on offense. <br> Bush should change the subject, as only presidents can do. He needs to supersede the endless speculation about the size of Rep. Nancy Pelosi's "incoming Democratic majority." Such talk demoralizes the already dejected Republican base, which is why it has become a liberal incantation. Bush should electrify GOP politicians, volunteers, and voters alike by unveiling a cause around which to rally: expanded GOP House and Senate majorities that would adopt a pro-freedom agenda. <br> Bush immediately should invite every Republican Congressional incumbent and challenger to a White House pep talk. As cameras transmit his message, here's what he should say: <br> My fellow Republicans: <br> On November 7, our fellow Americans will decide who controls Congress through 2008. As they weigh their choices, they should hear none of us wallow in defeatism. Instead, they should hear our confident message: America needs more Republicans on Capitol Hill. <br> For weeks, Americans have been appropriately shocked by the Mark Foley scandal. Well, he's gone. Investigations are underway. And anyone who covered Foley's tracks will be gone, too, whoever that may be. <br> We now must look ahead and self-assuredly lead the American public. <br> We should be proud of an economy that booms because of our growth-oriented tax policies: <br> The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades above 12,000. Wall Street is bullish on America. The burgeoning Investor Class, the 53 percent of Americans who own stocks, is enjoying higher returns on mutual funds, IRAs, and 401Ks. <br> Unemployment is just 4.6 percent, a five-year low. Republican incentives have helped create 7 million new jobs since January 2001. <br> At 2.1 percent, 12-month inflation is tame. <br> Average gasoline prices hit $3.04 per gallon last summer. They now average $2.23, and are falling. <br> Fiscal Year 2006's deficit fell to $248 billion. When we pledged to halve FY 2004's $521 billion deficit by FY 2009, Democrats laughed. But, as we promised, tax cuts stimulated the economy, and revenues flooded the Treasury. We bisected the deficit three years early. <br> On security policy, confronting terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq, harnessing the Patriot Act and Terrorist Surveillance Program, and interrogating captured Islamofascists all have kept America free from terrorist attacks since September 11. <br> Nevertheless, my fellow Republicans, we have work to do: <br> We must win the War on Terror. While too many Democrats scorn the Patriot Act, Guantanamo, interrogation, and surveillance, our firm hand will crush the terrorists. <br> We must win the Afghan and Iraqi fronts in this war. Yes, we are sacrificing precious blood and treasure there. But waving a white flag in Iraq will merit our enemies' scorn and amplify their hatred. <br> We also must keep Iran and North Korea nuke-free. <br> At home, we must make our temporary tax cuts permanent. <br> The Death Tax, which will resurrect itself from 0 percent in 2010 to 55 percent in 2011, instead must stay buried, for good. <br> Left unchecked, the Alternative Minimum Tax could ensnare 30 million Americans by 2010, the Tax Foundation estimates. It demands immediate reform or repeal. <br> Taxes should be reduced and further simplified, so Americans can retain more of their earnings, and the U.S. can keep leading the world's economy. We should offer Americans a totally optional flat tax. <br> A line-item veto will help me restrain Congress' more excessive spending impulses. <br> Americans deserve patient-centered health-care reform, such as Arizona Republican Rep. John Shadegg's proposal to let consumers purchase medical insurance across state lines. Let's broaden Health Savings Accounts and encourage new medical plans of every stripe. Let a thousand policies bloom! <br> After the Supreme Court's disastrous Kelo v. New London decision, Americans correctly worry that eminent domain could be abused to hand their property to private parties for private purposes. Barring federal dollars from such schemes would discourage such outrages. A clarifying constitutional amendment might be in order. <br> Social Security still needs modernization. As Republican senators Jim DeMint (S.C.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.) propose, investing the Social Security surplus in voluntary personal accounts will shield it from congressional appropriators without jeopardizing a dime owed to current or future retirees. <br> These positive, visionary ideas will enhance American security and prosperity. I need even more Republicans to enact even better pro-freedom legislation. We can bolster our achievements by electing even more Republicans who share our Reaganesque philosophy. <br> We still have 11 days. I need you to explain our solid record and our optimistic ideas to America's voters. I will campaign non-stop with as many of you as would like even challengers in long-shot races. We concede nothing to the Democrats. <br> If we widen our majorities, imagine what we can accomplish for the American people. If we maintain today's strength, we lose nothing. And if this bold strategy fails though I believe it will succeed we still will hold our heads high knowing we stood up and sang America a song about hope. That's what we do. After all, we're Republicans. <br> <b>Deroy Murdock is a New York-based columnist with the Scripps Howard News Service.<br>By Deroy MurdockReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-if-you-want-to-vote-them-all-out/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">What If You Want To Vote Them All Out?</span><i>Since I wrote this column, a new CBS News/New York Times poll shows approval for Congress at an extreme low. Will voters toss out Democratic incumbents as well as Republicans, or will they wave break for the Dems?<hr width="75%">Thanks for your comments about the national elections this year. In a very narrow and limiting sense, it is a correct observation. However, if there is any hope for our nation, we must wrest ourselves from the kind of morose pragmatism that underlies the logic you laid out. Essentially what you say is that, though things are awful right now, there is no hope that they can be made better. <br> Looking at this year's elections in the beginning of 2006, many Democrats pondered what the world would look like if George W. Bush and the Republicans continued to do so much strident damage to our country and the world that the people in charge of the national Democratic Party, by default, were placed into control of Congress. <br> What would change? <br> The answer, as your own reasoning aptly points out, is that very close to nothing would change. If the Democrats in Congress actually have had different ideas for how the direction of America, why were they not showing it? What is the Democratic platform, really? <br> I can tell you what I want to achieve as a Democratic state legislator in Connecticut, like health care for everyone, decent education for all and stopping the middle class and poor from taking the unfair weight of our regressive state tax system. But these are not just things to put on campaign advertisements and then, like the national Democrats do, give up Democratic principles in an effort to be "pragmatic" enough to "win the moderate vote." Democrats, like me, in the Connecticut legislature are actually working to get them done. <br> What is the sense of electing Democrats who will put a different face on much the same policies? That is what the primary in Connecticut was all about. Joe Lieberman was the Democrat who helped to defeat universal health care the last time we had a Democratic president, he is the most outspoken pro-war "Democrat" and, most important of all, he was a creator and leader of the Democratic Leadership Council the corporate-funded organization charged with making the Democratic party almost the same as the Republican Party. I note with interest that it was only after Joe Lieberman was put and risk of losing his own party's nomination in his own state that national Democrats have started to have the courage to stand up to George Bush on the war and occupation in Iraq. <br> There is a depth to the present political events in our country that simply does not lend itself to the kind of superficial analysis you have made. For real change to occur to America, for the Democratic Party to step beyond just being the "other party" when the Republicans are so clearly bad, Democrats of principle must stand up for what we believe in. And we must stand up to national Democratic political operatives whose own "be moderate to win" logic has cost us the last two presidential elections, control of Congress for a decade and a right-wing Supreme Court for a generation. <br> This is not just about having politics with a conscience. In the real world most people want a real alternative when they are going to vote. Contrary to the false reasoning that Democrats may either have our principles or win, we will only win if we work to make America better by sticking with what we believe. <br> TIM O'BRIEN, State Representative (D-New Britain/Newington, CT) <br> SURESH CHITNIS <br> HOWARD LOHMULLER <br> If Democrats were to gain control of the Senate, with supeona power, I do think that meaningful investigations into corrupt Bush actions would ensue and could significantly change a great many things (and perceptions) in this country. <br> JEFF DUNN

Not only are California landlords banned from using the state's Megan's Law database to decline renting their properties to sex offenders, they're not even allowed to warn other tenants that these paroled criminals are now their neighbors. If they do the first, they can be fined $25,000 for housing discrimination. But if they don't do the second, they can be sued for failing to protect tenants against a known danger. <br> Landlords are caught between a rock, a hard place and the California State Assembly's Public Safety Committee, which last April stalled a bill designed to fix the Catch-22... <br> And that, at least, is very good news. (Unless you're a sex offender, of course.) <br> The Nov. 7 ballot initiative (dubbed Jessica's Law, after a nine-year-old Florida girl raped and killed last year by a convicted sex offender) prohibits released sex felons from living within 2,000 feet of schools and parks, and also mandates all registered sex offenders be electronically tracked for life. The bills Gov. Schwarzenegger signed have similar restrictions, while also increasing penalties for child rape, possession of child pornography, and Internet luring. <br> But the Megan's Law housing situation is so absurd I'm sometimes amazed that it even still stands. "It seems like a pretty clear First Amendment violation," UCLA law professor and First Amendment scholar Eugene Volokh told me when I asked for his opinion last year, "especially given Florida Star v. B.J.F. If it's unconstitutional to bar speakers from revealing the names of rape victims when those names were accidentally released by government officials into the public record, I'd think that it would be unconstitutional to bar speakers from revealing the names of rapists when those names were deliberately placed by government officials into the public record." <br> "But it seems that California weighs the privacy of public-record information about sex criminals more heavily than its law-abiding citizens' constitutionally protected free speech," added Eugene, who's also a fellow blogger and friend. <br> At least I had the pleasure of hearing KFI's drive-time talk-radio stars John and Ken spin one of their famous rants around my Wall Street Journal piece last year. <br> "And... and... and...it's the landlord that's in trouble! Not the sex offender!" they yelled when I tuned in. "The sex offender, nothing bad can happen!" <br> I'd explained in my piece that a reform measure meant to correct the Megan's Law housing glitch died last year because assembly members Mervyn Dymally (D., Compton), Jackie Goldberg (D., L.A.) and committee Mark Leno (D., San Francisco) all voted no. For representatives serving on a public-safety committee, these three seem oddly unconcerned with public safety. Goldberg and Leno in particular seem to have a tradition of positioning themselves against anyone trying to promote an orderly civic environment in this state. <br> "Assembly speaker Fabian Nunez is the godfather of the PERVERT CAUCUS!" yelled John (or maybe it was Ken.) "This trio of evil Dymally, Goldberg and Leno Fabian Nunez can't help it if these guys get elected, but you certainly don't put them on a public safety committee! What's wrong with him? What kind of creep is he?" <br> Thank you, John and Ken, for the outrage because it's so relaxing, when someone expresses all this for you in a high-decibel tone you'd never use yourself. Unlike talk-radio hosts, I am always easygoing and serene, and so can only experience this sort of satisfaction vicariously. <br> Anyway, Mark Leno last year was best known as the author of California's vetoed gay-marriage bill, but he still found time that summer to criticize Gov. Schwarzenegger's efforts to toughen sex offender laws. For one thing, he worried that since San Francisco is such a geographically small city, keeping released predators a mile-and-a-half away from schools would force them out of the area. <br> You might think that stratospheric San Francisco rents would also discourage anyone just released from prison. But I guess we should be thankful that, so far at least, Leno hasn't backed an affordable-housing-for-paroled rapists measure. <br> He did once call a San Francisco police sting against Internet sex predators "mean-spirited" and "a waste of tax-payers' money," which I guess brings up the question of what he'd consider a good use of taxpayers' money? Well, besides gay marriage, Leno's projects have included hosting self-esteem conferences for young men, making sure the transgendered aren't denied medical insurance, and fighting anti-porn filters in public libraries. <br> Leno did have some reasonable complaints about the California version of Megan's Law when we talked last year. He told me, for instance, that California is the only state that has no drop-off period meaning that even someone guilty of only one, low-risk offence decades ago (Leno mentioned a 55-year-old man who, at 17, had inappropriately touched a 13-year-old cousin) is still on the registry. <br> Still, you'd think these snafus could be addressed without insisting on keeping paroled sex offenders a protected class landlords can't discriminate against. And preventing property owners from at least warning tenants about them is just ridiculous. <br> Then there's Jackie Goldberg, who as it happens used to live a few doors up the street from me in the 1990s, when she was still an L.A. City Council member. I always found her an amiable neighbor, although never an especially safety-minded one. When he got his license, her teenaged son began a frightening habit of racing his car up our cul-de-sac pausing only to yell out his car window at a dog that used to bark at him when he was a pedestrian trudging home from the bus stop. <br> "You can talk to him yourself, you know," Jackie suggested, when I asked her to please tell the boy to slow down and drive more carefully. To her credit, she did back down when I pointed out it was rather hard to have such a conversation with someone zipping past at over 40-miles-per-hour. Other neighbors were angry when Jackie's own unleashed large dog killed their pet rabbit, and also attacked another neighbor's small dog. <br> I love dogs, but don't think they should be allowed to run loose. Sex offenders should be kept on an even tighter leash. <br> <b>Catherine Seipp is a writer in California who publishes the weblog Cathy's World.

Starting in 2010, voters would need to pay for a government-issued proof of citizenship a virtual poll tax. This shameful legislation was passed just months after the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when President Bush declared "the right of ordinary men and women to determine their own political future." <br> "If the (House) Bill passed the Senate and became law, the electorate would likely become more middle-aged, whiter and richer and, its sponsors are anticipating, more Republican," the New York Times wrote in a recent editorial <br> Demos, a national public policy organization, reports that the legislation would disproportionately impact people of color, individuals with disabilities, rural voters, people living on reservations, the homeless, and low-income people all of whom studies show are less likely to carry a photo ID and more often have to change photo ID information. <br> Senate Democrats have asked that Majority Leader Bill Frist not bring the bill to the floor. In a letter to Frist, Senators Reid, Kennedy, Dodd and Obama wrote: "The burdensome and costly requirements of obtaining (citizenship) documents not only could prevent many eligible voters from participating, but Worst of all, this bill recalls a dark era in our nation when individuals were required to pay a poll tax to cast their ballot and has been termed a 21st century poll tax." Frist's next move remains to be seen. <br> States, too, are getting into the voter suppression act. Georgia, Missouri and Indiana have passed similar ID requirements. The laws were overturned by the courts in Georgia and Missouri while in Indiana, the law was upheld by district court and is now under appeal. The right-wing pins hopes on appealing all the way to the Supreme Court where decisions by Scalia and the Supremes seem to fall in their "1 Man, 1 Vote sort of" favor. <br> "This is the most sinister scheme I've ever seen," said former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, "and it's going on nationwide." <br> "Voter suppression doesn't happen with intimidation on Election Day," said Michael Waldman, executive director of The Brennan Center for Justice, "but rather through silent and sometimes secret government actions in the weeks leading up to an election." <br> If the Republicans are truly concerned about "the integrity of our voting process," as Rep. John Boehner claims, they should take a look at flawed voting machines that, according to the Washington Post, "scientists have shown they could manipulate to report a vote total that differed from the actual total cast by voters." <br> Or they could address the fact that the Diebold machines tested in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, rendered a paper trail "nearly 10 percent of (which was) destroyed, blank, illegible, or otherwise compromised." Or they could explain why a Princeton professor was able to hack into a voting machine as an experiment. Or they could reform the administering of elections, so that partisan secretaries of state with lofty political ambitions such as Katherine Harris and Ken Blackwell are no longer running the show. Or they could try to stop the purges of valid voters from the voter rolls <br> The blueprint for what to do is out there. Robert Pastor, director of a commission on electoral reform organized by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, told the Washington Post, "The Carter-Baker commission identified 87 steps that need to be undertaken. Regrettably, almost none of them are being done right now. I would start by establishing statewide, nonpartisan election administration." <br> And Americans can start by voting Democrat this November, and then pressing a new Congress to give us common sense reforms that create a truly democratic, transparent and legitimate electoral system. <br> Just hope your vote is counted correctly.By Katrina Vanden Heuvel Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by Jerry Bowyer and John Agatston.<hr width="75%">On August 17, 2006, the day President George W. Bush signed his pension-reform bill, Rep. Charlie Rangel called it a "Trojan horse that brought the end of the defined benefit pension system." <br> We beg to differ with the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means, but his comment seems to be the exact opposite of the truth. This pension-reform legislation might turn out to be just the action that saves pension plans from extinction. <br> Traditional pension plans have been heading the way of the Dodo, plunging from 112,000 such plans in 1985 to 30,000 in 2004. It's not that Americans have stopped preparing for retirement; it's that there has been a migration of assets from traditional plans (which promise a certain fixed monthly benefit, no matter what) to 401(k)-type plans in which assets go up and down with the markets. The first type of plan is heavily regulated, sometimes irrationally so. The second type of plan has some basic safeguards, but is mostly focused on self-government and individual responsibility. There has been a long march of capital from the heavily regulated pension world to the less-regulated 401(k) world. There always is. <br> That's why simplifying the system provides the best chance for it to survive. As things stood before, there were severe limits on making tax-qualified contributions to plans during the good years. That meant that when the bad years came around (and they always do), markets tanked and companies found their plans underfunded. That's precisely the worst time for companies to have to find cash to bail-out their plans. The new system allows companies the flexibility and freedom to store up the grain during the "seven" fat years, so that there's something there during the inevitable "seven" lean years. (See the "Book of Genesis," chapter 41). <br> Up until now, employers frequently avoided creating new pension plans, and terminated existing plans because of their obsolete regulatory requirements. They were afraid that being in the traditional pension business, at all, trapped them in a regulatory and legal morass. While regulators worked to achieve their social-justice ends, they unintentionally caused employers to flee traditional pensions. <br> But the president's signature has changed all that. First of all, pension reform lets the little guy in on the system. Although airline lobbyists did the heavy lifting on Capitol Hill, entrepreneurs will probably end up benefiting most from the legislation. K Street sets the table, but the little guy ends up catching what falls from it. <br> A valuable element of reform for entrepreneurs is that it decreases risk and increases reward at the same time. For instance, under the prior arrangement, businesses were punished for putting more assets into the pension system than they had promised. Now they can fund pension plans to a greater level, then wait to see how investments work out before putting themselves on the hook with a large legal liability. They can give from their abundance, rather from their paucity. <br> Pensions have been in decline for two decades at least, having been plagued by a mindset that played management off against labor. Pension reform rejects this approach and places the emphasis on creating an environment friendly to wealth accumulation. Driving businesses out of the pension market, or out of business entirely, does no more good for workers than it does for owners. The fact that the industries most helped by the president's plan (such as airlines and primary metals) are heavily unionized, and therefore heavily Democratic, doesn't seem to have gotten a lot of attention this past Labor Day. <br> <b> Jerry Bowyer is an economic advisor to Blue Vase Capital Management and the author of "The Bush Boom."

 This column was written by Maggie Mahar.<hr width="75%">While some progressives applaud efforts to force employers like Wal-Mart to take on greater responsibility for health care, others argue that our employer-based health care system is a failing relic of the past and that such gambits are actually counterproductive. Rather than trying to shore up our employer-based system, they say, we should seek to capitalize on that system's mounting woes to build support for replacing it with national health insurance. Call it the Leninist road to universal health care -- things have to get worse before they get better. <br> Chicago's recent decision to pass a "living wage" ordinance that would require big-box retailers to pay $3 an hour in benefits has revived that debate. Last week, the Prospect's own Ezra Klein offered quotes from labor leader Andy Stern to buttress his own argument against efforts like Chicago's. Rather than continuing to try to build on what Stern describes as "a very unstable" employer-based foundation, Klein argued that we need wholesale reform -- that is, national health insurance. "Progressives are, or at least should be, engaged in a longer-term project of creating a better, more just society for everyone, regardless of employment status." <br> Labor lawyer and blogger Nathan Newman wasn't impressed: <br> There is a strain of liberal advocacy for national health care that hopes for the system to get worse, in the assumption that only then can serious reform happen. . . . [A]ccording to Ezra, progressives should "view a slightly better menu of options for Wal-Mart employees as delaying the ultimate, more important victory." <br> So the worse the lives of low-wage workers, the better for certain liberal social engineers trying to enact national health insurance. Then, we can eliminate employer responsibility for health care with a completely government-financed system. <br> He goes on to argue that "currently, federal and state governments cover just 39 percent of funding for $1.75 trillion in U.S. health care spending annually. So for the government to take over the rest of health care financing would require roughly a $1 trillion annual increase in general revenue taxes." (His emphasis.) <br> While making it clear that, over the long run, he favors moving toward national health insurance, Newman suggests that, at present, there is no way to hike taxes enough to replace the hundreds of billions contributed by private sector employers to health care: "Some believe that the worse the health care system gets [as employers back away from offering health benefits], the better, since that will open up the possibility of national health care reform," he observes. "But it's actually the opposite -- the more we shore up the employer side of health care responsibility, the more likely we can afford to bring the rest of the population into a reformed system." <br> This sounds like a reasonable case for incremental reform. But on closer inspection, Newman's argument doesn't hold up. <br> Begin with the contention that at present, federal and state government cover just 39 percent of the nation's health care bill. The numbers Newman uses show only the government's direct contributions to healthcare. The question that needs to be asked is how much of the total bill is subsidized -- directly or indirectly -- by taxpayers. <br> When you put the question that way, it turns out that taxpayers bankroll 51 percent of the nation's $2 trillion health care bill: this includes paying for private insurance for public employees (accounting for 6 percent of total health care spending), Medicare (17 percent of the total), Medicaid and SCHIP (16 percent), and other public health services including veterans' programs, public hospitals, and school programs (12 percent). (These figures come from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.) And as the number of people on Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP climbs, the taxpayers' share of the bill is rising. By contrast, private insurers pick up just 30 percent of the tab -- and the money they lay out comes from the premiums paid by employees as well as employers. In other words, private sector employers pay less than 30 percent of the total. The remaining 19 percent of the $2 trillion total is covered by patients themselves (14 percent) and by the nonprofit philanthropy sector (5 percent). <br> But even those numbers don't do justice to how much of total health care spending is subsidized by taxpayers. In 2004, when employers laid out roughly $443 billion for health benefits for their employees and retirees, employers deducted that $443 billion from their taxable income as part of the cost of doing business -- just like wages. But while employees pay taxes on their wages, neither current employees nor retirees are required to declare their health benefits as part of their income. As a result, a recent study published in Health Affairs calculates that in 2004 the government lost $108.5 billion in tax revenues and another $66.4 billion in payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. <br> Other taxpayers, not fortunate enough to work for an employer who offers health benefits, must cough up income and payroll taxes to make up for that $174.9 billion in lost revenue. Add that amount to the $950 billion that taxpayers spent in 2004 to fund both government programs and private insurance for government workers -- plus the money they spent out of pocket -- and their contributions to the health care system ultimately equal roughly 74 percent of the nation's total bill. Some "private" health care system. <br> Moreover, contra Newman, reformers who talk about replacing employer-based healthcare with national health insurance are not suggesting that we simply bid farewell to the employers' contribution. Rather, they propose that, instead of paying premiums to private insurers, both employers and employees pay taxes into a common fund that would finance health care for all. <br> Physicians for National Health Insurance points out that for large employers, "a payroll tax in the 7 percent range would mean that they would be shelling out less than they currently do (about 8.5 percent)." As for small employers, the physicians' group argues that with everyone contributing to the pool, small businesses would find healthcare insurance far more affordable -- especially since the government would be negotiating prices with drug-makers, device-makers, and health care providers with an eye to insuring that taxpayers are getting value for their health care dollars. <br> Today, our profit-driven health care system is bloated with waste. Studies published in journals like the Annals of Internal Medicine and Health Affairs reveal that roughly half of our health care dollars are squandered, each year, on unnecessary or redundant tests, ineffective, sometimes unproven treatments, and over-priced new drugs and devices that are no better -- and sometimes worse -- than the products that they replaced. <br> Meanwhile, a fee-for-service system encourages over-treatment. Last week, when The New York Times asked its readers, "Have you ever suspected that a physician had financial incentives for recommending a medical treatment to you?," the paper received 237 replies in just one day. <br> In virtually every other developed country in the world, the government takes responsibility for trying to check health care inflation. This is why patients in other countries pay so much less for both drugs and medical devices. In nationalized systems, governments are the health care industry's biggest customer, and they use their clout to negotiate lower prices. By contrast, in our fragmented employer-based system, individual employers are left to attempt to negotiate lower premiums with insurers who, in turn, are fighting their own price wars with drug-makers, device-makers, and health care providers. <br> When employers find they cannot afford to fight the battle, they retire from the field. Over the past five years, the share of employers who offer health benefits has fallen from 70 percent to 60 percent. As for insurers, if they cannot persuade a drug-maker to offer the drug at a discount, they simply pass the higher costs on in the form of higher premiums -- one reason why premiums have jumped by more than 75 percent over the past six years. Little wonder that a recent poll by the Commonwealth Fund shows that 23 percent of families earning $75,000 or more report they have trouble paying for health insurance <br> This is where "heightening the contradictions" -- or letting things get worse so they can get better -- comes into play. The fact that not only the middle-class but many in the upper-middle-class are beginning to panic over whether they can afford healthcare suggests that national health insurance is becoming a political possibility. Indeed, a 2005 Pew Poll shows that 65 percent of Americans want universal insurance -- "even if it means paying higher taxes." Even more surprising, a 2003 study by the University of Indiana shows that nearly half of all physicians favor national health insurance. <br> But if support for universal healthcare is swelling, does Washington really have the will to fight the lobbyists who defend the health care system's hazardous waste? On this point, recent history is discouraging. The 2003 Medicare reform infamously prohibits the government from negotiating with drug-makers for lower prices. And earlier this year, when Medicare announced that it was planning to cut reimbursements for some of the most over-priced medical devices and procedures, lobbyists representing companies like Boston Scientific marshaled their forces, Congressmen wrote lettersand Medicare capitulated. Describing the incident on his blog, Brown University medical professor Dr. Roy Poses quoted Piper Jaffrey securities analyst Thomas Gunderson: "[T]hey didn't even back off -- they folded." <br> Poses does an outstanding job of tracking the conflicts of interest that fuel healthcare inflation; and his blog also documents how the opposition to collusion and corruption in our system is mounting. As more and more Americans worry that neither they, nor their employers, can afford to keep up with spiraling health care costs, both patients and doctors are beginning to call for government intervention. In the end it seems inconceivable that Americans will be willing to continue supporting a health care system that is funded largely by the public but run largely by lobbyists. <br> Winston Churchill famously said that "You can always count on Americans to do the right thing -- after they've tried everything else." When it comes to healthcare, haven't we tried everything else long enough? By Maggie Mahar Reprinted with permission from The American Prospect, 5 Broad Street, Boston, MA 02109.

 This column was written by Jonathan V. Last.<hr width="75%">A year ago, before the Supreme Court issued its decision in Kelo v. New London, the abuse of eminent domain was practically invisible. Today it's a hot-button issue in nearly every state in the Union not least in Ohio, where the state supreme court last month unanimously blocked the city of Norwood's attempt to clear out a middle-class residential neighborhood to make way for a private developer to build condominiums, offices, and retail space. <br> It's worth revisiting the oral argument in City of Norwood v. Joseph P. Horney et al, which took place before Ohio's high court on January 11. One exchange in particular captures the passions stirred by the controversy over eminent domain. <br> Attorney Timothy Burke, arguing for the city, explained that the neighborhood could be taken and handed over to the developer because it was deteriorating owing to a "diversity of ownership" that is, lots of people owned their own homes. Asked by one of the justices why the city government alone should be allowed to control property ownership, Burke replied, "These are the folks who live there. They've lived there all their lives, they've walked those neighborhoods, they've seen how it has changed. They've made a decision." Another justice interjected, "Counselor, couldn't the same argument be made for the homeowners?" <br> The packed courtroom erupted in laughter. And then applause. After the arguments were concluded, one of the justices could be heard over an open mike asking his colleagues, "Is this as big a crowd as we've ever had?" <br> In the Kelo case in June 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court held, 5-4, that it was permissible for the government to seize property by eminent domain not just for "public use," as the Constitution specifies, but for "public purpose," including potential economic gain. Kelo, that is, legitimized the government-imposed transfer of property from one private party to another, so long as the new owner claimed he need not guarantee or provide any third-party evidence in support of this claim that he could generate more tax revenue than the current owner. The Kelo decision attracted much attention and prompted state governments to rebuild protections the Supreme Court had obliterated. <br> Since Kelo, 25 states have enacted legislation attempting to reform the use of eminent domain, some with more success than others. (Five state legislatures have not been in session.) <br> Florida, Georgia, South Dakota, and South Carolina passed the strongest reforms, although each took a different approach. In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush signed a bill mandating that property seized via eminent domain cannot be transferred to another private owner for ten years. Georgia's reform, signed by Gov. Sonny Perdue, stipulated that economic development was not a "public use" and that for a property to be considered "blighted" it must be a danger to the public's health or safety. <br> South Dakota's new law went even further, outlawing the use of eminent domain "for transfer to any private person, nongovernmental entity, or other public-private business entity." South Carolina's legislature passed an amendment to the state constitution that if endorsed by the voters this November, as expected will outlaw economically motivated takings. The Institute for Justice, which has led the fight against eminent domain abuse, counts 14 states as having passed serious property-rights protections. <br> Other states have adopted weaker reforms. A new law in Iowa, for instance enacted over the veto of Gov. Tom Vilsack limited the conditions in which blight could be declared and put the onus of justifying the designation on the government. The Ohio senate passed a bill that put a moratorium on the taking of non-blighted property for the purpose of economic development through the end of 2006 and established a legislative task force to look at the state's eminent domain laws. Kentucky has redefined "public use," but also expanded the definition of "blight" making its reform something of a wash. 
 This column was written by Ezra Klein.<hr width="75%">It was like a Jet Li movie in Congress last week as the two parties one-upped each other with bits of political jujitsu. Most everyone now knows about the GOP's last-minute gambit to hold a minimum wage hike as ransom for repeal of the estate tax. (The measure passed the House on Friday and faces an uncertain future this week in the Senate.) What's been nearly forgotten is that the GOP's move was instigated in the first place by a similarly elegant play by Democrats, who had tried to force a vote to raise the minimum wage by tying it to congressional pay increases. The disparity between the fate of congressional salaries (up by $31,000 since 1997) and that of the minimum wage over the last decade had presented the Dems with an almost too-good-to-be-true opportunity for high-polling populism. Too bad the Republicans out-gamed them in the end through sheer majority force and re-focused discussion on their brazen estate tax ploy. <br> At any rate, the jockeying offers an occasion to explore the perennially vexing issue of congressional pay. There's no disputing that the minimum wage's 54-year low against the average wage is an embarrassment. But the average pay of congressmen and women $165,200 a year is, in fact, also a problem. It may indeed be true that Congress shouldn't get a raise till America does, but both are overdue for a pretty sharp salary hike. <br> That, of course, isn't a terrifically popular proposition, particularly during the current moment of GOP domination, congressional corruption and general government worthlessness. The Medicare prescription drug bill, the energy bill, the Iraq war these are hardly the sort of achievements that merit a raise. But sometimes you have to survey your workforce and realize that you need a better caliber of applicant and fewer incentives to stray. The question here isn't one of performance or rewards, but how to extract the best legislative outcomes from an underperforming institution. And a pay hike if used as the carrot for a set of severe ethical and campaign finance reforms wouldn't be a bad first step. <br> The question here is why congress folk become so corrupt. Intrinsic proclivity towards screwing over the republic? Maybe. But I'd guess the mechanism is a bit less dramatic than that. Washington, D.C., is the fifth-most expensive American city in which to live. Newly elected members of Congress arrive and find that the costs of living here plus retaining a residence and often, family in their home district are a bit imposing. Two mortgages, two furnished homes, and all the rest. <br> Even worse is the human instinct to match your peers. As the Brookings Institution's congressional expert Thomas Mann told me, "One of the problems we've seen is that as their former colleagues move into lucrative jobs and their former staffers do the same, they come to believe they ought to have the same lifestyle and look for ways to achieve it outside of their own salaries." <br> Congressmen and women, in other words, enter a world populated by the rich and the wealthy their friends are lobbyists, lawyers, and former congressmen and staffers who've left the public dime for massively lucrative jobs on K Street. It's fine to say this sphere shouldn't influence their tastes, but it inevitably does, leaving them accustomed to a standard of living their salaries can't come anywhere near supporting. But the lobbyists excuse me, their friends can take them out for fine dinners, or subsidize a "fact-finding mission" to a posh destination, or offer large loans at heavily subsidized rates, or otherwise augment their lifestyles through any number of shady, unstated quid pro quos. <br> None of this excuses corruption, but it does explain why it's essentially inevitable. And the question for all of us must be: Do we continue to hope geneticists will breed a crop of ascetic congresscritters, or do we start reworking the incentives and restructuring conditions in order to better prevent corruption on the public dime? Serious campaign finance reform, for instance, would cut down on quite a bit of corporate influence. And a new raft of ethics reforms may well eliminate certain avenues for untoward vote-buying. But it's nevertheless true that the full man eats less, and elected representatives with luxurious salaries and fewer monetary concerns would, assumedly, be tougher to buy they'd lack the personal incentives for corruption. (James Carville and Paul Begala unveiled a reform proposal based on this line of logic earlier in the year.) <br> Beyond the corruption concerns, the drop in esteem for public service is worrisome. Currently, Congress is one of the least-respected institutions in the country, just barely beating "Big Business" and "HMOs" in the public mind. Their salaries, which are at a historic low, are merely part of that trend. But with public disgust at such historic levels, is it any wonder so few good people enter the system? And with fundraising as grueling and unseemly a process as it currently is, can it be a surprise that so few of them succeed? <br> That may be fine for conservatives, who see their ideology confirmed every time a good man grows corrupt in office. But for liberals who believe in the nobility of public service and the possibility of the government to do and be good, restoring trust and faith in our shared institutions should be a priority. A true overhaul of campaign finance, coupled with ethics reforms and salaries commensurate with national preeminence, may not be a bad way to start. A new compact between the American people and their leaders one in which we both expect their excellence and promise to reward it may break this dispiriting cycle of mediocrity and disappointment. And even if that meant paying each representative in gold bullion, it would be a bargain. <br> By Ezra Klein Reprinted with permission from The American Prospect, 5 Broad Street, Boston, MA 02109.

 This article was written by Greg Anrig.</i><br>The New America Foundation's Robert Wright made a compelling case in Sunday's New York Times for a foreign policy paradigm that he labeled "progressive realism." The approach he outlined entailed actively leveraging a more robust system of international institutions, adaptable to both new threats and economic opportunities, in pursuit of U.S. national self-interest through intrusive weapons inspections, enforcement of new environmental and labor standards, humanitarian efforts, and so on. <br> Wright might have added another virtue of the "progressive realism" label: The terminology is helpful in defining a politically and substantively attractive approach to domestic policy as well. Captured by definition one of "realism" in Webster's dictionary "concern for fact or reality and rejection of the impractical and visionary" the thrust of the paradigm on the home front is the pursuit of initiatives that have a proven track record of success and aggressive efforts to eliminate or overhaul ineffective, wasteful policies. A hard-headed focus on producing concrete results would help to attract voters drawn to liberal values but who retain skepticism about government. It also would lead to better government, producing a virtuous cycle of support for progressivism realism. <br> In stark contrast to the Bush administration's multitude of failures, all of which invariably have squandered taxpayer dollars, the single most appealing trait of the Clinton era domestically was its success in getting more bang for the government buck. His biggest accomplishments literally paid off for taxpayers: Clinton's economic policies helped to produce widely shared income growth and budget surpluses; welfare reform reduced rolls while low-income women gained jobs and had fewer out-of-wedlock babies; the expanded earned income tax credit strengthened economic security for low- and middle-income households in a way widely perceived to be fair and efficient; and Al Gore's efforts at reinventing government made the bureaucracy more responsive while reducing 377,000 federal jobs nearly a fifth of the government work force. <br> Particularly now in contrast to the wastefulness and failures of the Bush administration, those successes of the Clinton period can serve as reference points for clarifying that progressive realism means producing measurable results in pursuit of widely supported goals. It also means, in part, getting rid of tax breaks and, to the extent possible, programs that benefit only narrow constituencies but serve no proven public purpose. An important part of the idea would be to establish transparent new ways of evaluating whether laws, programs, regulations, and tax incentives are accomplishing what they were intended to do. That's anything but the norm now. A 2005 Government Accountability Office report, for example, led with the headline, "Substantial Funds Are Used for Training, but Little is Known Nationally About Training Outcomes." Progressive realists would no longer accept that lack of accountability as a matter of course. <br> Progressive realism's watchword is results. No more chasing woolly-headed ideological dreams like those that conservatives have pursued lately or liberals did long ago in ways that alienated the public. The idea is simply to make actual progress toward many of the same quantifiable goals that the right has claimed to support: reducing vulnerability to terrorism and natural catastrophe, raising incomes, improving economic security, reducing poverty, cutting deficits, strengthening Social Security, slowing medical inflation, broadening health insurance coverage, upgrading schools, and implementing genuinely "smart regulation" of the environment and public hazards. But instead of sticking with ideas hatched at conservative and libertarian think tanks that have demonstrably failed on every single one of those fronts, progressive realists would build on initiatives that have worked before at the national or state level or in other countries. That includes increases in the minimum wage, adjustments to Social Security consistent with the enormously successful 1983 reforms, and a renewed push toward universal health insurance which any number of other countries have demonstrated is a far more efficient way to protect the public than our crazy-quilt system. Legislation would be written to include impact assessments and sunset provisions, which require a re-evaluation after a specified period to publicly review whether the policy produced the intended results. 
 This column was written by G. Terry Madonna and Michael Young.<hr width="75%">The celebration of Independence Day confronts us with a persistent anomaly: Americans may be among the most patriotic people in the world, but polls and other historical evidence reveal that majorities of patriotic Americans regularly reject many fundamental values usually associated with the country. <br> For example, portions of the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and some other constitutionally guaranteed rights have all failed to gain majority support in various polls and surveys. <br> Nor do Americans know a great deal about the country they love. Multiple studies have revealed surprising public ignorance of the basic forms and processes of American government. It seems clear that the curiosity of most Americans about their government is easily satisfied. <br> Instances of low knowledge levels and contradictory opinions about government and politics are neither isolated nor rare. What Americans know about their country is often incomplete, nebulous, or inchoate; and what they believe about their country is not always consistent, coherent, or rational. Indeed, it can be argued that discrepant and antagonistic beliefs and attitudes pervade public opinion about American government and politics. They are part and parcel of the American temperament that characteristic mode of thinking, feeling, and behaving in political life singular to the American people. As we observe Independence Day, it is worth reflecting on five prominent examples of the mismatch between what Americans know and what they believe about their country, their government, and their politics. <br> 1. Symbolic Conservatives and Operational Liberals. Americans believe they want less government, lower taxes, and reduced spending yet they reject or resist most specific proposals to reduce government or entitlement programs. In the phrase of one writer, Americans are "symbolic conservatives and operational liberals." They respond to the general proposition that government is too big and taxes are too high; yet oppose strong policies that would end popular entitlement programs. One consequence of this ideological schizophrenia is divided government, which, at its deepest levels, reflects Americans' inconsistent views about the purpose of government. <br> 2. Love-Hate Relationship with Government. Public confidence in American representative institutions is often weak or vacillating; legislative bodies, courts, and other governmental institutions rate low on trust and on job performance. Yet individual members of these institutions typically enjoy high support and approval. Congress is certainly the best exemplar of this contradiction. As an institution, it regularly draws forth the wrath and venom of large majorities of Americans. But the dislike of the institution does not extend to its members. On the contrary, individual members often enjoy great personal popularity and support support that is dramatically expressed in incumbent re-election rates exceeding 95 percent. This dissonance between Congress, the institution, and its members illustrates the deep ambivalence Americans often exhibit about their government and what it does. <br> 3. Public Opinion versus Public Policy. Public opinion polls get more attention in America than in any other country in the world; however, public opinion matters only marginally and inconsistently in terms of its influence on public policy. The near-obsession with collecting and studying public opinion obscures the almost equally strong aversion to actually acting on it. Americans seem to want to know more and more about what they think, but to do less and less about it. Several contemporary public policy issues demonstrate the truth of this point, including gun control, congressional term limits, tax reform, the balanced budget amendment, and prayer in public schools. All of these policies and others are supported lopsidedly by public opinion, but consistently have failed or are minimally addressed in many legislatures and in Congress. <br> 4. Ideas without Ideology. Ideas today continue to have a profound effect on contemporary politics, and ideas have mattered enormously throughout American political history. Indeed, the nation was founded on an idea, and ideas and conflict over them have occurred throughout American history. Yet ideology itself, understood as a consistent dogma of political beliefs and values, matters little to most Americans and ideological consciousness is weak and erratic within the electorate. Most Americans eschew any consistent ideological thinking at all. The disjunction between ideas and ideology has produced a uniquely American blend of political schizophrenia, with its politics and public policy being driven by ideas but devoid of ideology. <br> 5. A Group of Individuals. Americans revere individualism above all other political ideals, and individualism rather than collectivism is arguably the preeminent value in the American political culture; in fact, the nation was founded in part on a deep commitment to individualism and its pursuit. But individuals have little real power in the American polity. Instead, it is interest groups and not individuals that are the elemental forces in American politics. It is groups collectively not individuals who are organized to advocate policy. It is groups collectively not individuals that coalesce around policy consensus. And it is groups collectively not individuals that arbitrate public policy conflicts. When Americans pursue the value of individualism they must do it mainly in groups. <br> What do these apparent contradictions and inconsistencies tell us about ourselves as we toast the country's birthday? At one level, this pattern of ignorance about how government works suggests a serious disconnect between the governed and the government a polity seriously out of touch with its own ideals and values. And there is much to consider in this view of the world. But a more sanguine interpretation is also possible. The enigmatic attitudes and ungrounded beliefs we observe among Americans can also serve to sharpen appreciation for the subtle genius of the American political temperament. Warts not withstanding, the country's political temperament has provided a labile framework to forge the necessary compromises that make American democracy unique. It isn't always consistent or always coherent or always pretty to watch. But it works most of the time not just in spite of its shortcomings. It also works because of them. <br> <b>Dr. G.

 This column was written by David Sirota.<hr width="75%"> It's not every day that God calls your cell phone. But that's exactly what happened to me on an overcast afternoon last November. "Is this David?" asked the deep, vaguely familiar voice on the other end. When I told him it was, he said, "This is Barack Obama." Thinking it was a good friend playing a joke, I said I didn't believe him. But no, the voice insisted with a laugh, it was Illinois Senator Barack Obama, otherwise known in cult-of-personality political circles as a deity, a rising Democratic star or, as George W. Bush recently called him, "the pope." <br> Obama was calling because he was bothered that I had written a few blog posts questioning positions he'd taken that appeared to belie his progressive image, most prominently his vote for a corporate-written "reform" of class-action lawsuits, his refusal to frontally challenge the Iraq War after running as an antiwar candidate and his vote to confirm Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State. One by one, Obama methodically answered each criticism. And when the call ended with his telling me he was committed to working with progressives, I was perplexed. Obama certainly talks a great game but then, so have many false prophets over the years. I requested a formal interview, and to my surprise, Obama readily agreed. By the end of a day in Washington with him, I had the answers to two key questions: What can progressives expect from Barack Obama, and what does he really aspire to be? <br> I first met the Illinois senator in his Capitol Hill office, where he introduced me to his staff, all of whom seemed totally at ease with him. Unlike in many Congressional offices, there was no overuse of the words "senator" or "yes, sir." In separate conversations I had with many staffers, he was referred to as just "Barack." I was given a packet documenting Obama's accomplishments since his 2004 election, and it was hard not to be simultaneously impressed and underwhelmed. Given that he's one of the most junior members of the Senate, his successful efforts to secure additional funding for veterans' medical care and energy development in Illinois are no small feats. But considering that he's one of the most famous politicians in America, the accomplishments are fairly mundane. <br> "That's the constraints of being in the minority," Obama said, when asked why he hadn't used his media megaphone to push for more systemic changes. Then he adopted a signature Obama move: downplaying expectations. "What has probably been strategic was in the first year, my thinking was not to do a lot of message bills, in part because I've got a lot of colleagues here who do message bills," he said. "A lot of what I think is interpreted as caution is just a function of my institutional role as a freshman in the minority party and the limits that places on me in terms of being able to move legislation out of committee." <br> In a speech later that day, this theme came out again as he told the audience, "Remember, I've got a lot of clout I went from 99th to 98th in seniority this year." His sarcastic point has some merit but only some. After all, legislation is just one measure of success. Another is how big an impact a politician has on the public debate. Most members of Congress have to scratch and claw to get attention even on pressing issues. Obama, by contrast, can put whatever's on his mind on the front page of major newspapers. Does he want a public image as a low-key legislative technocrat with a nice packet of accomplishments? Or does he want to be someone who uses the Senate platform to move the national political debate? 
 This column was written by Ari Berman.<hr width="75%">If the toothless lobbying "reform" bill approved by the House and Senate is any indication, we haven't seen the last of the likes of Jack Abramoff or Tom DeLay. <br> DeLay exits Congress June 9, but his influence lives on. <br> His former deputy, Dennis Hastert, remains Speaker of the House. His key liaison to lobbyists on K Street, Roy Blunt, is majority whip. Even John Boehner, a rival from the Gingrich years, retained three DeLay staffers when he became majority leader. More important, the Hammer left many nails behind among the lower tier of House GOP leadership members, committee chairmen, party spokesmen and fundraisers he propelled to power. These are the people who will shape the GOP's agenda for years to come. Here are five disciples who are carrying on DeLay's legacy. <br> Eric Cantor (age 43). A fast-rising third-term Congressman, Cantor distinguished himself as DeLay's "chief defender," according to Roll Call. He was appointed chief deputy majority whip the fourth-most powerful position in the House at the ripe age of 39. Cantor became the youngest member of the House leadership after a DeLay staffer recommended he be named Blunt's deputy over a host of older and more qualified candidates. Thus, when DeLay's ethical problems piled up in 2004 and '05, the Virginian held countless press conferences and strategy sessions with conservative activists to protect his leader. <br> As the only Jewish Republican in the House, Cantor provides a crucial link between pro-Israel donors and Christian conservatives. Through his seat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax law and Social Security, Cantor raised more money for his colleagues than any other House Republican in the last election cycle. Like DeLay, Cantor is also tied to Abramoff, having accepted $13,000 from the disgraced lobbyist's Indian clients, written letters on behalf of tribes and held eight events at Abramoff's restaurant, Signatures. Cantor even had a sandwich named after him at Abramoff's deli, Stacks: the Eric Cantor, a "tuna-based stacker," changed by Cantor to roast beef on challah. <br> Jack Kingston (age 51). As vice chairman of the Republican Conference Committee and the number-six House Republican, Georgia's Kingston sculpts the GOP's message, producing talking points for fellow members and sound bites for conservative media. National Journal rated him the most conservative Congressman in 2004. But unlike DeLay, Kingston is an affable, smooth Southerner who jokes with Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher. Kingston's relentless defense of DeLay at times merited its own comedy show. When the TV series Law Order referred to DeLay negatively in one episode, Kingston accused the show of associating his boss with a "racist, anti-Semitic judge killer." After Representative Chris Bell filed an ethics complaint against DeLay resulting in an unprecedented three rebukes, Kingston called it a "non-story." When DeLay received two indictments in Texas on money-laundering charges, Kingston circulated a glossy brochure titled "The 'Hammer' Has a Big Heart," boasting of DeLay's "affections for his bichons friss, Baily and Taylor, and his miniature dachshund, Scooter," reported the Washington Post. Describing how DeLay maintained his resilience, Kingston said, "he knows Jesus personally." <br> Patrick McHenry (age 30). The youngest member of the 109th Congress, McHenry is the "it" boy of the GOP establishment. DeLay recently named McHenry one of his potential successors, an endorsement the freshman accepted enthusiastically. "I'm blown away," McHenry told the Washington Times. "I'm so excited that Tom DeLay would say that about me" a fitting compliment to a pupil who's earned a reputation as the party's "attack-dog-in-training." DeLay was the first Washington pol to contact McHenry after he won the Republican primary in North Carolina's rural 10th Congressional district, promptly sending his campaign $10,000. Upon election, DeLay shepherded McHenry through Washington, with cushy seats on the Budget and Financial Services committees, a communications position within the GOP's fundraising arm and a role in Blunt's whip operation. McHenry returned the favors by attacking House minority leader Nancy Pelosi for alleged travel violations and by voting, along with just nineteen other Republicans, to rewrite House ethics rules permanently to insulate DeLay. McHenry's clearly a quick learner: He's hired Grover Norquist's press secretary and dated a former assistant of Karl Rove. <br> Richard Pombo (age 45). With his cowboy hats and ostrich-skin boots, Pombo fancies himself a "Capitol Cowboy." To government watchdogs, he's "Dirty Dick," a militant anti-environmentalist and Abramoff crony. The California rancher has raised hundreds of thousands from big business for fellow Republicans and enjoyed close ties with recently indicted DeLay staffer Tony Rudy. Pombo and fellow DeLay protg John Doolittle (himself a top Republican under investigation for assisting Abramoff) helped kill a government investigation into a Houston-based DeLay donor responsible for a $1.6 billion savings-and-loan scandal in Texas. At the same time Pombo's staff was cultivating ties to Abramoff, DeLay helped Pombo leapfrog ahead of six more-senior Republicans to become chairman of the House Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over Indian gaming. At age 42, Pombo was the youngest chairman in the House. "This is the guy DeLay wanted," former House Ethics Committee chair Joel Hefley remarked. Pombo has used the position to try to destroy the Endangered Species Act, reward big-donor polluters, ignore calls for an investigation into Abramoff's tribal clients, give his chief of staff two salaries and pay his wife and brother $357,000 over the past four years for "consulting" work. More recently, Pombo has come under fire for renting an RV for a family vacation and sticking taxpayers with the bill. <br> Tom Reynolds (age 55). As head of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), Reynolds breakfasts with Karl Rove and lunches with Dick Cheney. When Reynolds inherited the upstate New York seat of DeLay ally Bill Paxon (now a top K Street lobbyist), DeLay said he "made sure [Reynolds] had every opportunity presented to him to exploit his abilities." Reynolds became the only freshman to become a deputy on DeLay's whip team and only the second newcomer ever named to the House Rules Committee, which controls House debate. In 2001 DeLay personally persuaded New York Republicans to draw Reynolds a more Republican district. With DeLay's backing, Reynolds became a player on the Ways and Means Committee, cultivating a plum fundraising base, and chair of the NRCC, helping to expand the GOP majority in 2004. He emulated DeLay's fundraising prowess coming up with $1 million for House Republicans in the last election and replicated his lavish lifestyle. In the past three years, Reynolds has taken more lobbyist-funded trips than return visits to his district. Small wonder that Reynolds calls DeLay "a darn good mentor of mine." He's frequently mentioned as a possible future Speaker of the House. <br> Of course, recent polls indicate that the House DeLay built might yet collapse. If Republicans lose their majority in November, or a significant number of seats, a major shake-up could derail the careers of quite a few DeLay disciples. The guilt is only likely to accumulate. Two of DeLay's top aides have already been indicted in the Abramoff investigation. Reports suggest that DeLay's key spiritual adviser and lobbyist, Ed Buckham, along with another former protg, Ohio Representative Bob Ney, are in the cross-hairs of the law. And ABC News claims that Dennis Hastert is "in the mix." DeLay himself faces trial in Texas and remains a target in the Abramoff probe. As his disciples are learning, it's no longer a good day to be a comrade of DeLay. <br> <b>Ari Berman is a contributing writer for The Nation, a contributor to The Notion and a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute. <br> By Ari Berman Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by Fred Barnes.<hr width="75%">If only his last name were Smith. He'd not only attract national attention as the popular and successful governor of a difficult-to-govern state. He'd be viewed sympathetically as a leader who had dealt with family issues his wife's aversion to politics, his daughter's bouts with drug addiction without losing his grip on the governorship. And he'd be the prohibitive front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. <br> But his last name is Bush. So Jeb Bush, nearing the end of his eight years as governor of Florida, has to settle for being the best governor in America. Not proclaimed the best governor by the media and the political community. But recognized as the best by a smaller group: governors who served with him and experts and think-tank and conservative policy wonks who regard state government as something other than a machine for taxing and spending. <br> Why is Jeb Bush the best? It's very simple: His record is the best. No other governor, Republican or Democrat, comes close. Donna Arduin, perhaps the most respected state budget expert in the country, has worked for four big-state Republican governors John Engler of Michigan, George Pataki of New York, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and Bush. Even while she worked for Schwarzenegger, she told me Bush is "absolutely" the nation's premier governor. "He's principled, brilliant, willing to ignore his pollsters, and say no to his friends," she says. <br> Engler, now head of the National Association of Manufacturers, knows Jeb Bush well and has watched the course of his governorship. He says flatly: "Jeb Bush is the finest governor in the country." Jim Gilmore, the ex-governor of Virginia, declines to rank governors. But he says Bush, as governor of a big state, "had a big challenge and he met it." <br> In a state with a surging population, Bush has presided over a booming economy with the highest rate of job creation in the country and an unemployment rate of 3.0 percent (the national average is 4.6 percent). <br> Florida has no state income tax, but Bush has nonetheless found a way to cut taxes every year of the eight he's been in office. Meanwhile, he's trimmed the state employment rolls by 11,000. <br> "Politics is a game for risk-takers," says Mike Murphy, a political strategist for Bush and other governors, including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Schwarzenegger. And Bush is an extraordinary risk taker and innovator. He's made Florida, in the jargon of bipartisan experts, a "laboratory of democracy." He's mined state and local think tanks for ideas that might streamline state government and make it more effective. <br> He's the first governor to impose stringent testing and accountability on Florida elementary and secondary schools, along with three voucher programs, the most ambitious of which was struck down this year by the (liberal and majority Democratic) state supreme court. This achievement went beyond the No Child Left Behind program of his brother, President Bush, who dropped vouchers in a compromise with Democrats in 2001. <br> On health care, no governor has attacked Medicaid, whose costs are swamping state budgets, more boldly than Bush. He wangled a breathtakingly broad waiver from the federal Department of Health and Human Services to privatize Medicaid in two populous counties, Duval (Jacksonville) and Broward (Fort Lauderdale). The new program, affecting more than 200,000 Medicaid recipients, goes into effect July 1. <br> Two more things. Bush, after handling eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 14 months in 2004 and 2005, has become the undisputed national leader in emergency management. Imagine if he had been governor of Louisiana when Katrina hit last summer. Does anyone doubt that the recovery would have gone far, far better with Bush in charge? <br> A key to success as a governor is forceful political leadership. Bush, in fact, has been the dominant figure in the Republican party in Florida since 1994, when he lost his first bid for governor to Democrat Lawton Chiles. That allowed his brother George, who won an upset victory for governor of Texas the same year, to get a leg up on Jeb in pursuit of the presidency. <br> But Jeb Bush has turned out to be the superior governor of the two. He's the most powerful chief executive in Florida in modern times and has had a positive impact on the state in almost every conceivable way economically, fiscally, educationally, politically, and the list could go on and on. Bush says Florida is a "purple" state, a mixture of Republican red and Democratic blue. But when he departs Tallahassee for his hometown of Miami next January 1, he will leave Republicans in a vastly stronger position than they dreamed possible when he took office in 1999. <br> Democrats in Florida oppose many of Bush's policies, but they recognize his clout. "In this state, he is the guy," House Democratic leader Dan Gelber told Wil S. Hylton of GQ magazine. "Everybody else is not even in the ballpark. He's a rock star." <br> His popularity, too, has remained at an impressive level. In a Quinnipiac survey last month in Florida, his job approval was 55 percent, while President Bush's was in the mid-30s. "How can a governor in his eighth year in a competitive state have an approval rating of 55 percent?" asks Quinnipiac analyst Peter Brown. "It's pretty remarkable. Jeb dominates Florida politics even in his eighth year." <br> Jeb Bush, however, will not be a candidate for president in 2008. For months now, he's made that plain to everyone who asks, including me. Plus, "he's not making any moves" to run, strategist Murphy says. "It isn't the time or the year or the environment." <br> Nor is Bush likely to accept an offer to be the vice presidential running mate of the Republican presidential nominee, though he'd be a smart choice. After Senator John McCain, the Republican frontrunner in 2008, visited Bush here this spring, rumors of a deal spread: Bush would back McCain for the nomination in exchange for being his vice presidential pick. As far as I can tell, that's not true. <br> Bush, though, had extremely kind words for McCain when I talked to him a few weeks after his session with the Arizona senator. "I like McCain," he said. "I like the fact that he doesn't like pork. I'm upset with Washington and this passionate defense of overspending, as though there's a clamoring in the land to do this." <br> Bush had one piece of advice for McCain. It went like this: "Really try to relate to the [Republican] base. Our base is really the heartbeat of America. Make an effort to understand what their aspirations are and to show respect to them . . . Those are people of faith, middle-class people, small business owners. I think sometimes the people in Washington just kind of forget who gets them elected." 
 This column was written by Ed Morales.<hr width="75%">At first, after the March 25 protests, it may have seemed that 1960s Chicano activist Moctesuma Esparza's HBO docudrama "Walkout" had inspired all Los Angeles to run into the streets and demand justice. Or that life was imitating the 2004 black comedy "A Day Without a Mexican," in which every Latino disappeared from California. The sudden emergence of the immigrants' rights issue has surprised many Anglophones, but for consumers of Spanish-language radio, TV and newspapers, it was the crescendo of a media message that was a long time evolving. <br> It is widely acknowledged that an unlikely band of ribald, prankster disc jockeys in LA played a crucial role in generating the massive turnout. In what may go down as a historic meeting of the mouths, four rival morning DJs KSCA's El Pioln (Eduardo Sotelo), KLAX's El Cucuy (Renn Almendrez Coello), KBUE's El Mandril (Ricardo Snchez) and KHJ's Humberto Luna held a joint news conference announcing their support for the March 25 rally. Sotelo, whose show on Univision-owned KSCA is the highest-rated radio program in LA, called the meeting and became the most recognized for his passionate support of the rally. "It was fascinating, to say the least," said LA march organizer Javier Rodrguez. "Here were [El Pioln and El Cucuy] the two top [morning show] DJs, competitors, coming forth and saying, We're going to march with you, we're going to get everybody together." Rodrguez laid much of the groundwork for the DJ dtente by organizing a breakfast March 14 that not only resulted in massive local news coverage but also prompted an invitation from El Mandril to appear on his show. Two days later, El Mandril called his rival El Pioln on the air, and the DJ movement was on. <br> "Radio, unlike TV, focuses on how to effectively speak to the common man and woman and thus has been able to generate a great deal of enthusiasm," said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, one of the march organizers. "Many of the disc jockeys are themselves immigrants and can relate to the struggle that their listeners face and motivate them to be active." <br> The role of the radio personality as advocate for immigrants is nothing new. According to USC journalism professor Felix Gutirrez, in the 1920s and '30s Pedro Gonzlez, once Pancho Villa's telegraph operator, pioneered Spanish-language radio in LA, protesting the deportation of half a million Mexicans, many of them U.S. citizens mistaken for illegals. But by the 1960s and '70s, music formats dominated Spanish-language radio. Ever since Humberto Luna brought back personality-driven radio in the late '80s, DJs have increasingly assumed an advocacy role. Javier Rodrguez notes that they took part in the resistance to Proposition 187 in 1994, as well as the protests against Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2003 effort to repeal the law that allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. Radio talk shows have also allowed the voiceless to express their personal anxieties about their tenuous existence in El Norte. "People call in to talk about 'My mother's dying in Mexico but I can't go be with her because I don't know if I can get back across the border'; 'My kids are born here but I'm facing deportation,'" Gutirrez says. "Or someone is retiring and realizing she had no Social Security even though it had been taken out of her paycheck for years." <br> The LA DJs have gotten most of the credit for the massive turnouts, but other sectors of the Spanish-language media, and other cities, also played significant roles. Print media, which act as a basic survival guide for immigrants in a hostile world, create the background noise that radio and TV pick up on. By devoting pages to legal issues, fraud scams, tax-filing information and healthcare issues, newspapers give the undocumented an understanding of the rights that this year's Congressional action threatened to strip away. In Chicago, next door to anti-immigrant-bill sponsor James Sensenbrenner's home state of Wisconsin, the weekly La Raza has been central to a well-organized, vibrant immigrants' rights movement in a state that pioneered the use of Mexico's matricula consular as valid identification for the undocumented. A former La Raza reporter, Jorge Mjica, left the paper to become one of the main organizers of the movement there. The current editor in chief, Jorge Mederos, says the paper's front page has been devoted to the issue for several weeks. Last July a rally was held in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood to protest the breaking up of families by deportation of undocumented immigrants. Another central figure in that march was Chicago DJ El Pistolero (Rafael Pulido). According to PR people at the Univision station, back then El Pistolero was already encouraging marchers to wear white and be peaceful, messages echoed in LA. <br> That two Univision DJs are at the heart of this feel-good story about a movement coming of age is somewhat ironic. Univision, after all, is owned by Republican backer Jerrold Perenchio, who once donated $400,000 to anti-immigrant California Gov. Pete Wilson. In a merger approved almost three years ago, Univision acquired all of its 63 radio stations from HBC, which was 26 percent owned by Clear Channel, home to Rush Limbaugh. In 2005-06 Univision donated 72 percent of its total $88,450 campaign contributions to the GOP. But given George W. Bush's relatively moderate stance on immigration reform (the Lou Dobbs hard right equates Bush's guest-worker program with "amnesty") as well as big business's need for immigrants both as low-wage employees and consumers, maybe it's not so odd. <br> The corporate Latino media have been as uncritical of the Iraq War as their mainstream counterparts. And Univision promoted the candidacy of Latino conservative judge Miguel Estrada, a Bush fave. But unassimilated immigrants are Perenchio's and big Spanish-language media's bread and butter. This is a case of marketing imperatives trumping conservative values. And although Perenchio and most of Univision's head honchos are not Latinos, his staff and the staff of the Spanish-language media in general is. "Almost everyone in our newsroom are either immigrants, children or grandchildren of immigrants or are somehow related to immigrants," said Alberto Vourvoulias, executive editor of New York's El Diario-La Prensa, which belongs to the same conglomerate as La Raza. "It's part of the fabric of our lives." El Diario, like La Raza, accentuates its outreach to non-Latino immigrant groups as well. <br> As we approach May 1, a day of protest designated A Day Without an Immigrant, the Spanish-language media continue to push the idea that although the Sensenbrenner bill has stalled, the fight is far from over. Like some moderate politicians and labor groups, radio DJs have been discouraging children and workers from walking out of school or their jobs and stop short of endorsing a boycott.

 This column was written by John O'Sullivan.<hr width="75%">Wherever you look today in Western Europe today, the political diagnosis is the same: paralysis. <br> For Italy, the popular vote percentages in last week's elections say it all: Silvio Berlusconi's outgoing conservative coalition won 49.7 percent of the total vote and the incoming center-Left coalition led by former "Eurocrat" Romano Prodi gained a victorious 49.8 percent! Italy is divided right down the middle politically. <br> Under the rules of the Italian constitution which give the winning party additional seats Prodi will be handed a secure parliamentary majority. But that will not in fact remedy the stagnation of the popular vote. <br> Prodi's coalition is so divided between former Christian Democrats, former Communists, and still-faithful Communist true believers that it cannot unite around any reform program that is seriously contentious. It opposed Berlusconi's modest labor market reform temporary contracts for younger workers to reduce youth unemployment in the election campaign. So there is little or no prospect of Prodi adopting the wider labor market flexibility, pension reform, or tax cuts that Italy badly needs. <br> Result: paralysis. <br> Almost the same is true of Angela Merkel's "Grand Coalition" of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats in Germany. Ms. Merkel is winning golden opinions for her deft handling of foreign policy which, among other achievements, has restored good relations between Berlin and Washington. <br> That is because Merkel, as Chancellor, enjoys a relatively free hand on diplomacy. On domestic economic reforms, however, she will need to win the support of both her socialist ministers and a parliament that has a left-wing majority. Many observers forget that the center-right actually lost ground in last year's German elections when the combined parties of the Left the social democrats, the Greens, and the Left gained an extra forty seats. <br> Merkel became Chancellor only because of a recent political tradition that the party with the single largest number of seats should head the government. She therefore presides over a schizophrenic administration that is dubious about an economic reform program which probably could not win a parliamentary vote even if all her socialist colleagues were enthusiastically in favor of it. Unless early elections grant her a real center-right majority, Merkel must accept "reforms" that make no real difference. <br> Result: paralysis again. <br> In France's undeclared constitution, riots compete with elections as the means of determining government policy. Last week the center-right government headed by President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin withdrew a reform bill that would have allowed French employers to fire young workers without going through expensive legal procedures. <br> That bill had been originally passed because young men, mainly unemployed and mainly of North African extraction the so-called "beurs" had rioted and burned cars and buildings in cities throughout France. The beurs rioted, de Villepin argued, because they had been excluded from the world of work by laws that made it risky and expensive to hire workers who could not then be fired. Youth unemployment in France is 28 percent. The first step to integrating these underprivileged young people, therefore, was to deregulate employment at least for those under twenty-six. They would have a better chance of getting a first job if it wasn't a job guaranteed for life. <br> Once the law was passed, however, French middle-class students rioted in favor of its repeal. After all, they were getting jobs for life. Employers who could not fire workers naturally hired those whom they knew or who looked safe, respectable, and French. Students who fitted this description could look forward to the privilege of secure lifetime employment. And they marched, rioted, threw stones, and attacked police in defense of this privilege and against the new law.

The last, I would argue. <br> The characteristics are not inconsistent. No large nation no leading world power could ever resemble theocracies like John Calvin's Geneva, Puritan Massachusetts or early Mormon Utah. These were all small polities produced by unusual migrations of true believers. <br> As a great power, a large heterogeneous nation like the United States goes about as far in a theocratic direction as it can when it meets the unfortunate criteria on display in George W. Bush's Washington: an elected leader who believes himself in some way to be speaking for God; a ruling party that represents religious true believers and seeks to mobilize the nation's churches; the conviction of many rank-and-file Republicans that government should be guided by religion and religious leaders; and White House implementation of domestic and international political agendas that seem to be driven by religious motivations and biblical worldviews. <br> As several chapters in "American Theocracy" make clear, this kind of religious excess has been a problem indeed, a repeating Achilles' heel of leading powers from late-stage Rome (historian Gibbon thus explained Roman decline and fall) to the militant Catholicism of Habsburg Spain and most recently the evangelical and moral imperialist Britain that saw 1914 as something of an Armageddon against the German Kaiser's Antichrist and wound up in 1917-18 crusading in the Middle East to liberate Jerusalem. But although this facet of historical decline constitutes a major caution regarding the future of the United States, this essay will concentrate on the domestic political aspects the theocratic tendencies in the GOP and the notable "religification" of American politics across a spectrum from life and death to science and medicine to climate change and biblical creationism. <br> The Growth of Theocratic Sentiment <br> The essential US conditions for a theocratic trend fell into place in the late 1980s and '90s with the growing mass of evangelical, fundamentalist and Pentecostal Christianity, expressed politically by the religious right; and the rise of the Republican Party as a powerful vehicle for religious policy-making and eventual erosion of the accepted degree of separation between church and state. This transformation was most vivid at the state level, where fifteen to twenty state Republican parties came under the control of the religious right, and party conventions in the South and West endorsed so-called "Christian nation" platforms. As yet nationally uncatalogued a shortfall that cries out for a serious research project these platforms set out in varying degrees the radical political theology of the Christian Reconstructionist movement, ranging from the Bible as the basis for domestic law to an emphasis on religious schools and women's subordination to men. The 2004 platform of the Texas Republican Party is a case in point. <br> So are the political careers of Pat Robertson and John Ashcroft, two presidential aspirants whose careers were milestones in the theocratization of the Republican Party. Robertson's 1988 presidential bid brought huge numbers of Pentecostals into the Republican Party. Missouri Senator Ashcroft, who explored a presidential race in 1997-98, got much of his funding from Robertson and other evangelicals. Picked as Attorney General by Bush after the 2000 election, Ashcroft was the choice of the religious right. Earlier in his career Ashcroft had decried the wall between church and state as "a wall of religious oppression," and his memoir describes each of his many electoral defeats as a crucifixion and every important political victory as a resurrection, and recounts scenes in which he had friends and family anoint him with oil in the manner "of the ancient kings of Israel." 
 This column was written by Jonathan V. Last.<hr width="75%">"ENTITLEMENT REFORM." Few words in the English language make readers turn the page faster. <br> So let's begin this way: How would you like it if, after you turned 21, the federal government cut you a check for $10,000, every year, for the rest of your life? <br> If that sounds intriguing, then Charles Murray has gotten your attention. <br> Entitlements Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, agriculture subsidies, corporate welfare, and the rest eat up $1.38 trillion of the federal budget today. That's bad enough, but it's getting worse. Because of our rapidly aging population, by 2020, entitlements will cost roughly $2.6 trillion. It is an unsustainable situation. Either these entitlements will be gutted or taxes will rise so steeply that they strangle the economy. Something has to give. <br> Murray, an American Enterprise Institute scholar, has a solution. <br> In his new book, "In Our Hands," Murray offers what he calls "the Plan": Halt all government entitlement programs and redistribute tax money directly to citizens. The Plan is elegantly simple. When you turn 21, you begin receiving monthly income from the federal government deposited directly into your bank account that totals $10,000 a year. This grant keeps coming, month after month, until the day you die. <br> Not everyone gets to keep the full $10,000. Once your salaried income hits $25,000, the size of your grant diminishes gradually until those making above $50,000 get only $5,000 a year. The only condition is that you not be in jail once you're out of the pokey, you get the money. <br> Murray's main objective is to provide better retirement benefits for less money. On this count, his Plan is attractive. Consider a low-wage worker making $20,000 a year. By investing $2,000 of her grant every year in a conservative index fund, and assuming a 4 percent return on her investment (the lowest rate of return ever recorded over a 45-year period is 4.3 percent; the average is about 7 percent), our worker would have a $253,000 nest egg when she retires. The income from that investment, plus the continuing $10,000 grant, would give our worker a post-retirement, yearly income of at least $30,500. Under the current regime, a similar worker would get about $11,000 a year in Social Security benefits. <br> Another goal of Murray's Plan is to expand medical insurance while controlling costs. To do this, he proposes some radical reforms of the health-care system, with the result that people pay for their own health insurance, which becomes, like auto insurance, mandatory. Murray's conservative assumptions peg insurance costs for an individual at $3,000 per year, which could be automatically deducted from people's bank accounts. <br> The Plan is simple, but not without complications. Implementation would require a constitutional amendment and what would amount to a national ID card. Altering the health-care system might be easy compared with the logistical difficulties of disassembling the welfare state all those government workers would have to get jobs elsewhere. <br> And then there's the matter of unintended consequences. Who knows what ripples might result? For instance, if government student-loan programs are done away with, college costs should fall as the price structure loses elasticity. That's a good thing. <br> Even better is that the Plan could encourage family formation, particularly at lower socioeconomic levels, where it is desperately needed. However, the Plan also gives two-income families incentives to keep both parents in the workforce which some of us find disconcerting. And it might well discourage having children. As Murray notes, "Under the Plan, having a baby is pure economic loss." American fertility rates are already dangerously low. <br> But the math is seductive. If we were to implement Murray's Plan tomorrow, it would be slightly more expensive than the current entitlement system $355 billion more expensive. But the beauty of the Plan is that it is essentially a steady-state model. By 2011, our current entitlement system will cost just as much as Murray's Plan. By 2020, it will cost $549 billion more. <br> Before you dismiss the Plan as an academic exercise, know this: In 1984, Murray wrote the book "Losing Ground," which advocated a massive overhaul of the American welfare system. Those ideas became a reality just 12 years later. <br> "Losing Ground" was the first major work to postulate that the welfare system institutionalized poverty instead of ameliorating it, as was its intent. Murray argued that this was a logical outcome of the system itself and that, to combat poverty, welfare would have to be redesigned to build in incentives to work. Thanks to the Clinton administration and the GOP Congress, that indeed happened. Eventually the American entitlement system will change, too. Murray's Plan deserves serious scrutiny and is, at the very least, an excellent place to begin the conversation. <br> <b>Jonathan V.

 This column was written by Bob Moser.<hr width="75%">Ralph Reed is going to own this room. Granted, it's only a standard-issue campus auditorium at Emory University, half-filled at best for the annual Georgia College Republicans convention. But to the former boy wonder of evangelical politics, it looks like heavenly shelter on this drizzly February morning. The Christian Coalition co-founder's first campaign for public office lieutenant governor of Georgia, a position Reed and his fans envision as a stepping stone to bigger things has turned into a waking nightmare. <br> Every week brings a new revelation about the millions in dirty money Reed earned by duping his fellow evangelicals into putting their political muscle behind "Casino Jack" Abramoff's gambling clients. Reed's huge leads in both popularity polls and fundraising have almost disappeared. Instead of making his triumphant debut as a politician, the man Time magazine called "The Right Hand of God" is fast becoming the new poster boy for Christian-right corruption. <br> But here, Reed expects a hero's welcome. As an undergraduate dynamo at the University of Georgia in the late 1970s and early '80s, Reed turned the Georgia CRs into a political machine that helped elect the state's first Republican U.S. senator since Reconstruction. "Tricky Ralph," as he was known on campus, went on to make a similar splash with the national CRs, teaming with the equally tricky pair of Abramoff, who was national CR chairman in the early 1980s, and Grover Norquist, whose Americans for Tax Reform is also caught up in the scandal. <br> Those associations go unmentioned in the introductory roll call of achievements that Reed listens to, beaming, before he bounds up to the podium, spreading wide his Howdy Doody grin. "It's great to be back home," he chirps, fondly recalling how in 1980 he ran a mock campus election in which Ronald Reagan surprisingly beat President Jimmy Carter, Georgia's native son and timed the results perfectly for maximum impact. "Right before Ronald Reagan walked out on stage for his one and only debate against President Carter," he says, "they distributed a news release announcing Reagan's victory in Georgia!" <br> This is vintage Reed, the incorrigibly boastful, smooth-talking operator who long dazzled and blinded evangelical Christians, big-money Republicans and mainstream journalists. Now 44, he still looks like a million bucks, his elfin face perma-tanned to a brick red, his pencil-thin body subtly bulked out by a well-tailored suit. Only one thing is missing: applause. Maybe some CRs know the real history of that 1980 mock election from Nina Easton's book Gang of Five, in which Reed's first big political triumph is revealed to have been rigged his first notable act of mass deception. Maybe they're just waiting for Reed to finally offer a satisfying explanation of his star turn in the Abramoff scandal. But his mea culpa smacks more of false piety than genuine gut-spilling. <br> "I was approached in 1999 by a friend that I met in the College Republicans," says Reed. "He said, 'There's an effort to bring five new casino-style operations to Alabama. Would you be willing to help us stop them?' And I said, 'Yes, I would. I'm opposed to casino gambling expansion, but I can only do it if I won't be paid with revenues from other casinos.'" Before the kids get a chance to chew on that, Reed quickly offers a Nixonian apology before sliding into spin mode. "If I had known then what I know now, I would have turned that work down. But I will tell you that the work that I did either prevented from opening, or closed, eight gambling casinos, and we will never know how many marriages and lives were saved by the work that I did." <br> The Georgia CRs finally give Reed a polite hand for his creative stab at self-redemption. A few awkward minutes later, Reed is climbing the steps toward the exit, wearing an iron-willed smile while making an elaborate show of "gripping and grinning," even though only a few hands reach out to him. It's one more sign of his mounting desperation to project the air of a winner a desperation that led to embarrassment in January, when Reed's campaign offered $20 and a free hotel stay to supporters who would attend the Georgia Christian Coalition's annual convention and cheer for the man who invented the coalition. <br> When he announced his candidacy last spring, Reed figured that his biggest challenge would be winning over moderate, "party regular" Republicans who worried he might be too far right to win a general election. But the Abramoff scandal has forced him to fight for votes he should have been able to take for granted especially those of Christian conservatives. Reed's struggle to hold on to their loyalty has given this lieutenant governor's race a rare national significance. Judgment day in Georgia, July 18, when Republicans cast their primary votes, is shaping up as a crucial test of how Christian conservatives will respond to their leaders' entanglement in the ugliest corruption scandal since Teapot Dome. In the words of Georgia native Ed Kilgore, vice president for policy at the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), Reed has become "the Abramoff mine canary." <br> It's easy to see why. As executive director of the Christian Coalition from its founding in 1989 until his departure in 1997, Reed got and took the lion's share of credit for transforming the politically unsophisticated evangelical right into a disciplined Republican Party machine. "Ralph Reed symbolizes the rise of the Christian right to political power," says Frederick Clarkson, author of "Eternal Hostility: The Struggle Between Theocracy and Democracy." "He became the story of the movement the face and voice for those millions of conservative Christians in the mainstream press. Now he's becoming a symbol of what's gone awry." <br> Last June Georgia's former GOP House minority leader Bob Irvin blasted Reed in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed. "His M.O. is to tell evangelical Christians that his cause of the moment, for which he has been hired, is their religious duty," Irvin fumed. "As an evangelical myself, I resent Christianity being used simply to help Reed's business." <br> Irvin's dart went straight to the heart of the matter. While grassroots organizing has been the key to lifting evangelicals to power in the GOP, the movement's political model has mostly mirrored the traditional hierarchy of churches, with trusted leaders setting the tone and issuing marching orders to their foot soldiers. What if the generals the Reeds and James Dobsons are proven to care more about power and money than stamping out abortion or homosexuality? The damage to evangelical politics would clearly be immense. So would the damage to the Republican Party, which cannot carry a national election without the full enthusiasm and participation of the evangelical troops. <br> "Think what will happen on Election Day when 2 to 3 percent of the previously most passionate Republicans stay home," Joseph Farah, editor and publisher of the right-wing WorldNetDaily, warned in January. "Think of what it will mean when 20 to 30 percent of the grassroots activists Republicans have counted on to work for them don't show up." <br> Other evangelical leaders and allies are taking their hits in L'Affaire Abramoff former House majority leader Tom DeLay, in particular, along with antigay crusader Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition and right-wing Rabbi Daniel Lapin of Toward Tradition, both of whom allegedly took money from Abramoff client eLottery to help defeat a federal ban on Internet gambling. But Reed's involvement runs the deepest and broadest by far. And the particulars of his cloak-and-dagger activities strike the evangelical political movement straight in the gut. <br> From 1999 to 2002 Reed's Georgia-based consulting firm, Century Strategies, set up "anti-gambling" coalitions in Alabama, Louisiana and Texas to oppose proposed new casinos (and in one case to shut down an existing one). Reed convinced dozens of influential pastors in those states, along with some of the biggest national names on the evangelical right Dobson, Phyllis Schlafly, Gary Bauer, Donald Wildmon, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson to mobilize their flocks in a series of successful anti-casino campaigns. The front groups Reed established, with upright names like Citizens Against Legalized Gambling, organized religious rallies, sent out mass mailings decrying the evils of wagering and flooded legislators and state officials with thousands of calls from concerned Christians. 
 This column was written by Larry Kudlow.<hr width="75%">For nearly a fortnight, French students repeatedly have taken to the streets in protest of a modest labor reform proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin. It seems that Villepin had the audacity to suggest that companies hiring workers under the age of 26 have the ability to fire those workers in the first two years of employment. Villepin's far-from-draconian reform is a reaction to the country's government-planned entitlement state, overregulated labor laws, and sky-high jobless rate. <br> But French students apparently prefer their little worker's paradise just the way it is. The overall jobless rate in France hovers around 10 percent, so-called "youth unemployment" is 23 percent, and in some of the Muslim-heavy suburbs, joblessness is nearly 50 percent. Some paradise. <br> In France, you see, companies don't grow because it's too costly to hire while it's against the law to fire. Hence, since they rarely add jobs, French businesses under-perform, under-produce, and under-employ. Think of it: It's awfully tough to increase output without a growing workforce to produce it. <br> The Villepin reform, of course, would make it a lot easier for firms to hire since they would no longer have to lock-in high wages and benefit costs without first confirming worker productivity, at least for two years. But in response to this mild capitalist reform, a reported 500,000 students have emerged in angry protest. There's now even a threat of a general strike, with government unions, trade unions, and student unions possibly teaming together to shut down the entire French economy (or what's left of it). <br> Of course, it wasn't all that long ago that young Muslims rioted and vandalized urban centers across France. Their beef was cultural in nature, but it was also rooted in the fact that France is anti-opportunity, anti-wealth, anti-jobs, anti-markets, anti-work and anti-capitalism. <br> Indeed, at the heart of the French problem is a statist-run socialist economy that is massively overtaxed and overregulated. France's public government sector, for instance, accounts for more than 50 percent of GDP. In other words, private business in France is in the minority. <br> Added to this, France's top personal tax rate is 48 percent, with a VAT tax of nearly 20 percent. So that means French laborers face a combined 68 percent tax rate on consumption and investment. No wonder France has created less than 3 million jobs over the past 20 years, compared to 31 million in the United States. Economic growth in "cowboy capitalist" America has exceeded that of France's worker paradise by nearly 50 percent. <br> In a dramatic speech to the European Parliament last summer, British Prime Minister Tony Blair hit the mark when he criticized all Western European economies for their inability to compete on an acceptable global level. Asked Blair, "What type of social model is it that has 20 million unemployed in Europe? Productivity rates falling behind those of the USA? That, on any relative index of a modern economy skills, RD, patents, information technology is going down, not up?" <br> Financial Times international editor Olaf Gersemann blames French and European unemployment on high minimum-wage requirements and overly strict employment-protection laws. Gersemann, who scathingly criticized Western Europe in his book "Cowboy Capitalism," says these labor-market regulations have created millions of involuntary unemployed throughout Europe, affecting immigrants in particular. He writes, "Most French, German, and Italian voters simply refuse to accept the necessity of a Thatcher-Reagan style economic revolution." He notes that per capita income in the U.S. now exceeds that of France by close to 40 percent, with Germany and Italy lagging even further behind. <br> All of this is reminiscent of the British disease of the 1960s and '70s. Back then, striking labor unions closed down the English economy again and again, and it took until the early 1980s for Margaret Thatcher to put an end to it. At one point, the Iron Lady actually called in tanks and troops to stop the print unions from shutting down Fleet Street. (This is what turned media-magnate Rupert Murdoch into a pro-capitalist Thatcherite.) <br> Is there a Thatcher that can save Gaul? Perhaps. French Interior Minister Nick Sarkozy is a strong law-and-order man. He's the one who ended the Muslim riots. More, he is reputed to be pro-market and pro-American. The question is, can Sarkozy wake up this nation of economic sleepwalkers and bring them into the 21st century? He ought to take a big paddle to the collective French fanny.

 This column was written by Michael F. Cannon.<hr width="75%">Many on the right argue that market forces will fix America's health-care sector. The Left wants government to play a larger role in medical care. Obvious success stories on either side of that divide have been rare, but that is why the transformation of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) makes such an interesting case. <br> Fifteen years ago, the VHA consisted mainly of run-down, poorly managed hospitals. Doctors were inexperienced, layers of bureaucracy crippled the system, and patient satisfaction was low. After a major overhaul in the mid-1990s, much of that changed. The VHA as a whole was restructured to focus on outpatient care, rather than costly hospital stays. Nearly empty hospitals were shuttered, and smaller clinics were opened to focus on the chronic-care needs of aging veterans. <br> The reengineering seems to have worked. As Philip Longman detailed in the January 2005 Washington Monthly, the VHA now minimizes medical errors, coordinates care, and maintains patient records with some of the most sophisticated technology available. Doctors and nurses no longer waste time chasing down patient charts and test results; computerized records help them deliver the right care to the right patient at the right time. <br> A New England Journal of Medicine study found that the VHA beat Medicare on 11 measures of quality. An Annals of Internal Medicine study concluded that the VHA provided better care for diabetes patients than private managed-care systems. And veterans seem to like it too. Understandably, prominent columnist Paul Krugman now points to the VHA as a model for reforming the entire health-care sector, arguing that federal management has improved quality and has been "highly successful in containing costs." <br> Its recent makeover notwithstanding, persistent problems at the VHA suggest it might make a poor model for reform. First, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported this month that spending on the VHA "has increased substantially in recent years," and that the agency "does not have a reliable basis" for claims that it has saved or will save taxpayer dollars through management efficiencies. Second, as the GAO report suggests, programs like the VHA allow politicians to play politics with people's health. When politicians choke off resources, as they sometimes do, the VHA copes by freezing enrollment, increasing waiting times, and rationing access to the latest prescription drugs. A recent study by Prof. Frank Lichtenberg of Columbia University estimated that "increased use of older drugs" has reduced the average lifespan of veterans under VHA care by two months. Finally, the fact that VHA's successes haven't been replicated in the private sector is actually evidence of how badly government has mismanaged the private sector. <br> Those successes could easily be replicated by private insurers and hospitals. The problem is that few have the financial incentive to do so, because federal tax law makes employers rather than individual patients the real customers. Knowing that most patients skip from plan to plan as they go from job to job, insurers have little incentive to provide certain services such as preventive care or electronic medical records that provide long-term benefits to patients. <br> Were Congress to remove barriers that prevent consumers from obtaining portable coverage that stays with them over the long term, private insurers would take more of a long-term interest in their customers' health. Were Congress to allow consumers to control all their health-care dollars, private insurers would have to compete more aggressively on the basis of quality and convenience. <br> No one had to mandate electronic financial records or online banking: Banks offered those services to cultivate long-term relationships with customers intent on obtaining value for their money. <br> With the incentives properly aligned, insurers might offer long-term health insurance. Knowing that their customers will be around for 10 or more years, insurers would be more likely to offer electronic medical records, preventive care, disease management, and other services for which the VHA is hailed. <br> That the VHA outperforms the private sector in some areas makes it tempting to conclude that government could manage health care more efficiently. But to reach that conclusion, one would have to ignore how badly government has mismanaged the private sector. So before we turn the whole enchilada over to 536 politicians, perhaps we should first try letting workers control the health-care dollars that employers now control. It may even hasten the day that we get to check our medical records online. <br> <b>Michael F.

 This column was written by the editors of The Nation.<hr width="75%">The budget is an annual statement of national priorities and in even-numbered years also serves as a campaign platform for the party in power. This President's new spending priorities are grotesque a cruel distortion of what matters to Americans and riddled with deceptions. For the campaign, however, Bush's slogan is surprisingly frank: "Cut the butter, give us more guns." Terror is his theme, as usual. But instead of pretending, as he has in the past, that the war will be painless on the home front, Bush now asks people to choose between their fears and their hopes. That's a far riskier gamble, and one he just might lose. <br> Bush's budget is littered with phony claims and fanciful projections, but it does clearly frame a potentially decisive debate: Do Americans acquiesce to the "long war" envisioned by Pentagon planners? Or will Congress at last choke on the folly and open-ended costs of this new cold war? Bush is determined to convert America into a permanent war economy. If we reject his priorities we can perhaps turn back a national disaster before it's too late. <br> While Bush slashes or freezes domestic programs like healthcare and education, his Pentagon budget increases by 7 percent, to $439 billion, 45 percent greater than when he took office five years ago. And the $439 billion is only part of the increased largesse for the military-security complex; another $33 billion goes to the ill-managed homeland security agencies. That still doesn't count the war itself another $70 billion or more. <br> Meanwhile, belt-tightening applies only at home 141 domestic programs either killed or cut. Education loses $2.1 billion, from student loans to vocational training. Healthcare takes a substantial hit, which means hospitals and nursing homes lose Medicare financing or communities lose disease prevention. Agriculture gets less for conservation. Federal home-heating aid ignores rising oil prices. The number of hungry Americans, rising at about 10 percent a year, is now 38 million, but Bush takes a whack at food assistance too. <br> These cuts are cynically proffered to allow the Administration to claim it tried to be fiscally prudent, since it knows Congress will not impose such severe pain Bush proposes, for example, to eliminate the $225 death benefit widows and orphans receive under Social Security. At the same time, the budget counts new revenue from regressive tax "reforms" Bush hasn't had the nerve to propose. It cuts Medicare while proposing new tax-free medical savings accounts that in effect benefit only the affluent much like the rejected "reform" of Social Security. (The budget actually pretends that Social Security reform remains a live proposal.) <br> The question citizens joined by courageous politicians should examine is this: Why does the Pentagon need so much money, now that the Iraq War is supposedly winding down? The answer is that more such encounters are ahead, as part of the "irregular warfare" against terrorism involving super-sophisticated techniques that Field Marshal Rumsfeld says will be unfolding "for a generation to follow." But why, then, is so much money proposed for weapons originally designed for the last cold war? The Quadrennial Defense Review explains they're needed as a "hedge" against a future challenger read China to U.S. dominance. China, meanwhile, is where U.S. multinationals enthusiastically locate their new production and high-tech research laboratories. This would be merely absurd if it weren't so dangerous. <br> The prime threat to our national security is a run-amok militarism that invites conflicts around the world and risks further national shame. Citizens have a chance this season to force a real debate on that threat, as well as to demand a budget that puts people's hopes before their fears. Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by Brad Riedl.<hr width="75%">Pork-barrel spending, whether it's for therapeutic horseback riding, the Grammy Foundation, or combating teen 'goth' culture in Blue Springs, Mo., regularly leaves taxpayers cringing. But the recent indictment of Washington super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff has spotlighted pork's larger dangers: More than merely a waste, pork invites corruption, encourages big government, distracts lawmakers from vigorous oversight, and surrenders lawmaker independence. <br> First, a definition. Originally, lawmakers would fund government grant programs and then let federal and state agencies select individual grant recipients through a competitive application process or according to some formula. Now, Congress actually determines, within the legislation, who will receive government grants, by "earmarking" money for specific recipients. Earmarks are also known as 'pork projects' because they bring the bacon home to districts. <br> Since 1996, the number of pork projects each year in appropriations bills has skyrocketed from 958 to 13,999 at an annual cost of $27 billion. Additionally, the pork count in the six-year highway bills surged from 10 in 1982, to 6,371 in last year's bill (including the infamous "Bridge to Nowhere"). While many of these grants are obviously wasteful and unnecessary, even the productive grants raise the question of why the U.S. Congress should micromanage local decisions (such as where to build a traffic light in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y). <br> In addition, the practice of allowing lawmakers to decide individually who receives federal grants invites corruption. Congressional e-mail messages made public show that, on certain bills, each lawmaker is given his or her own individual pot of tax dollars (based on the lawmaker's rank, but often more than $20 million) to distribute as he or she wishes. While explicit trades of campaign donations for pork are difficult to prove, the link between the two is no secret. Not surprisingly, much of this money goes to the highest bidder. These are your tax dollars being auctioned for campaign donations. <br> Lobbyists serve as well-paid middlemen bringing businesses, organizations, and local governments to the lawmakers who can provide them with earmarks. So confident are these lobbyists of their access and power that some have reportedly gone to local governments and virtually guaranteed that, for a large fee, they can steer federal grants their way. From 2000 through 2004, the number of appropriations lobbyists understandably surged from 1,865 to 3,523, and lobbying became the easiest way in Washington to become a millionaire. <br> The task of selecting a share of the 14,000 annual pork projects has become an all-encompassing endeavor for many congressional offices. Gathering earmark requests, meeting with lobbyists, and working to secure a coveted seat on the pork-writing Appropriations Committee leaves little time for the traditional congressional duties of overseeing government and reforming outdated programs. Thus, in recent years, layers of government waste have gone virtually ignored, and bloated agencies have failed to deliver basic services. <br> Pork also leads to bigger government. Lawmakers who come to Washington to scale back government quickly get hooked on pork by their senior colleagues, who assert that reelection can be won only through the massive campaign contributions and "bringing home the bacon" press releases that pork provides. Votes need to be bought: rural votes with, say, an expensive farm bill, and senior votes perhaps with a Medicare drug benefit. <br> Even pork-seeking lawmakers who otherwise retain their commitment to fiscal responsibility surrender the independence necessary to vote against runaway spending. Bill writers often incorporate only the pork projects of lawmakers who commit to voting for the entire spending bill (which makes pork a key way for senior lawmakers to control the votes of their junior colleagues.) Consequently, lawmakers vote for massive, wasteful $700-billion spending bills simply to guarantee $1 million for a bridge in their district, and the House passes a notorious, pork-laden highway bill with the "Bridge to Nowhere" by an overwhelming 412 to 8 margin. Only a handful of lawmakers resist earmarks. <br> What's the solution? Lawmakers assert that they, rather than federal bureaucrats and state governments, are qualified to distribute government grants in their districts. If so, why not dissolve the federal bureaucracy and relevant state agencies? Lobbying reform would also be helpful, but as long as lawmakers continue to distribute government grants, organizations will find a way to influence them. <br> A better idea would be a one-year pork moratorium, during which time Congress enact a permanent prohibition against legislation specifying which businesses, organizations, or locations will receive federal grants. Then, grant-seekers will actually have to justify their projects to federal and state agencies, and lawmakers will be free to oversee and rein in runaway government. <br> <b>Brian Riedl is Grover M.

First, sticking to hard line positions seems to be the immediate reaction by almost everyone who has an interest in the outcome. <br> For its part, Hamas seems unwilling to compromise or move away from its unwillingness to recognize the legitimacy of Israel. Israel, now in the midst of its own political turmoil, says it won't deal with a Palestinian government led by Hamas until the organization changes its policies on recognizing the Jewish state and renouncing its terrorist-related activities. <br> President George W. Bush, not surprisingly, has taken a very hard line against the group, which Washington considers a terrorist organization. In his State of the Union speech Mr. Bush said "the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism and work for lasting peace." The acting Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, couldn't have put it better himself. European leaders have taken positions similar to those of Mr. Bush. <br> As analysts have pointed out, Hamas scored its landslide victory even after several key events took place which should have led to what most political observers expected -- a victory by the Fatah faction of the Palestinian Authority. With Yasir Arafat no longer on the scene and his successor, Fatah's Abu Mazen elected President of the PA and with the Israelis now no longer in Gaza, Hamas was expected to do well, but not this well. <br> Martin Indyk, a former U.S. Ambassador to Israel and now head of the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution, in an interview with CBS News, said "the attitude of the Palestinian people is similar to the attitude of many people when faced with failing government. They want to kick the bums out so Hamas got double its natural vote as a protest against Fatah's performance." <br> "The events of last week constitute a democratic coup against the institutions of peacemaking," said Rob Satloff of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Satloff isn't the only analyst in Washington saying the results were an especially bad omen for any peace prospects between Israelis and Palestinians. Indyk is even blunter: "An election process has actually brought the terrorists into power and in the process killed the peace process and left us with a big mess." <br> The irony of the situation is also a cause of concern and debate. Asked if the Bush administration's push for democratic reform in the Middle East had its downside, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CBS Radio in an interview just after the election, "I certainly wouldn't think we would be fearful of democracy. What is the alternative? To say that we prefer tyranny?" Rice claims the political history of most of the Middle East in the last half century has left what she likes to call a "freedom deficit." 
 This column was written by Deroy Murdock.<hr width="75%">Republicans at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue last year tied their own shoelaces together while tackling big ideas. Despite President Bush's valiant efforts, his attempt to modernize Social Security stalled amid Democratic intransigence and GOP cowardice. Meanwhile, greater presidential boldness might have yielded a dramatic reform of the tax code. Instead, a blue-ribbon panel offered an uninspiring mish-mash that quickly lulled the nation to sleep. And in Congress, wholesale attempts to reign in runaway spending floundered as the Republican appetite for pork proved strong enough to ignite a thousand barbecue pits. <br> While America still needs personal retirement accounts, a low-rate flat tax, and massive reductions in federal outlays, perhaps Republicans this year should pass measures that would be slight in size but significant in restoring the party's shattered image as the purveyors of limited government and free markets. <br> Here are four proposals that should help the GOP get its groove back. <br> First, Congress should adopt a rule requiring constitutional justification for all the legislation it considers. Every bill should begin, "Pursuant to U.S. Constitution Article X Clause, Y, Congress hereby enacts . . ." Senators and House members may fall back upon the "General Welfare" clause, but at least doing so would remind legislators that America still has a constitution that is supposed to guide and restrain federal action. As Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, likes to say: "The Constitution isn't perfect, but it's better than what we have now." <br> Second, before the next mid-term election, Congress should approve grants to states to finance free photo identification cards for poor voters who otherwise lack ID. In exchange, states should require citizens to show photo IDs in federal elections. <br> The 11th U.S. Circuit Court last October blocked a Georgia law that required photo ID at polling stations, saying the card's $35 cost was just too much to ask of the poor and elderly. So why not let low-income and older people cash checks and board 747s without photo ID? If mandating picture ID at every precinct on November 7 requires Washington to reimburse states for giving free IDs to the handful of voters who lack them and cannot afford them, Republicans should propose that tradeoff. <br> Elections free of phantom and repeat voters should be expected in the world's leading democratic republic. Such an anti-vote-fraud measure likely would benefit the GOP, which too often suffers at the hands of union-controlled, big-city political machines. If congressional Democrats balk at such a deal, make them stand up and explain why they oppose free photo IDs for voters who need them. <br> Third, the Senate and House should adopt a rule barring federal funding for new projects that bear the names of living and, even worse, sitting politicians. One must die before appearing on a U.S. postage stamp. Why, then, does California boast the Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport, named after America's still-breathing Transportation Secretary? One of Alaska's notorious "bridges to nowhere" would be dubbed "Don Young's Way" after the GOP House Transportation chairman who champions it. Naming public works after politicians who are alive and even in office reeks of Pyongyang. <br> This shady practice gives incumbents an unfair advantage over their challengers. While his potential opponents for the U.S. Senate struggle to boost their name identification, former Klansman Robert C. Byrd (D., W. V.) enjoys taxpayer-funded advertising every time voters see the Robert C. Byrd Federal Courthouse or travel the Robert C. Byrd Expressway. These monuments to vanity are unbecoming and deserve no further federal support. If GOP legislators can gather a pound of principle among themselves, they should apply the postage-stamp rules to bridges and highways. <br> Fourth, Congress should bar federal business and farm subsidies to any American who earns more than $1 million. "No welfare for millionaires" is an idea that will help Republicans show some sorely needed fiscal restraint. If Democrats disagree, let them explain why rich people deserve free stuff. <br> If Washington Republicans can steady themselves, they should think big. Barring that, it might help them in this election year to think wisely, but also to think small. <br> <i>Deroy Murdock is a New York-based columnist with the Scripps Howard News Service and a senior fellow with the Atlas Economic Research Foundation in Arlington, Va.<br>By Deroy MurdockReprinted with permission from National Review Online

And by the way, this is not a blog.<span class="link">Reagan Revolution Plus 25</span> <br> An animated but articulate critical mass has so strongly objected to the final sentence of my last column on the conservative Republican era that I am forced to admit it was a bit of a mess. Here's the sentence: "What can be said is that at this point, the conservative Republican era doesn't have much to show for itself." <br> Read the letters that follow and you'll see the objections. No, I do not think the American Republican Party deserves credit for the fall of European communism as many readers do. But I did say earlier in the piece that, "The entire ideological spectrum of the country has taken five giant steps to the right since the Reagan cabinet was formed." This baldly contradicts my final thought and it was my blunder. Shifting the ideological superstructure of politics is indeed something to show. <br> Still, as I argued, most of the essential goals of the conservativism of this era have not been achieved despite a long reign, and some of them never got more than campaign lip service. Was this true at the end of the New Deal-Great Society era? I think not. The programs of the New Deal and the civil rights laws of the Great Society were permanent governmental legacies that matched the political philosophy of their founding fathers. The conservative Republican era has not hit that mark yet. But I was too dismissive. <br> Frank S. Wagner <br> What's conservative about self-described fundamentalists proclaiming Christianity is under attack as they try to force their version of Jesus into every aspect of governance? <br> What's conservative about arrogant neocons starting a war of aggression in Iraq when commitments in Afghanistan were not met, then defending dissembling and torture as legitimate tools of US states craft? <br> What's conservative about Republicans whipping contentious, reactionary minorities into a frenzy in order to get elected, then cutting taxes in a manner that provides for the consolidation of wealth into the hands of those who already have the most, pumping up federal spending such that the largess lands in the coffers of those "favorably" connected, and sticking the US taxpayers with the resulting massive accumulation of debt? <br> What's conservative about right-wing radio "entertainers" fomenting ignorance, fear, prejudice, hatred, and violence over publicly licensed airwaves? <br> You may call the last 25 years a Republican era if you wish, but it hasn't been conservative. <br> Knox Demmond Atlanta, GA <br> People would have given you great odds that the Berlin Wall would still be standing on 1/1/90 if you had taken the bet on 12/1/80 that the Wall would be DOWN on that date. <br> As someone who served his country in the early 1970s I'm proud that I did my very, very small part to make that happen. That helped usher in the boom of the 1990s (remember the peace dividend?) which helped save the Clinton presidency from total disrepute. <br> Martin Mares <br> Did the entire ideological spectrum "take five giant steps to the right" or does the Republican era "not have very much to show for itself?" Clearly the latter is the correct proposition, when only conservative ideals (victims' rights, work, national defense, etc.) are verboten, and liberal ideals (criminals' rights, welfare, support of terrorists, etc.) are the ideological currency of the day. <br> Timothy S.

 This column was written by Robert Gordon and Josh Lynn.<hr width="75%">Progressive critics of the budget reconciliation bills now being melded together by a joint House-Senate conference committee usually attack the measures as tax breaks for the wealthy, paid for with budget cuts for the poor. <br> That's true, as far as it goes. Many of the cuts now being considered reductions in Medicaid, Food Stamps, and child support enforcement, together with increases in interest rates on student loans wouldn't even finance one-seventh of the recent tax breaks for Americans making over $380,000. <br> But progressives might get more traction by arguing a slightly different point: that conservatives are pushing to eliminate incentives for the work of poor Americans as a way to reduce taxes on the accumulated wealth of the most fortunate. In tax policy, many progressives already complain and rightly so that President Bush is shifting the tax burden away from capital and onto labor. But the argument equally applies to cuts in programs that provide work incentives by offering the working poor benefits like health care and child care. <br> Conservative cuts in these benefits are a perverse tribute to changes that conservatives promoted a decade ago in the name of work. Before 1996, when conservatives paid for a tax cut by slashing welfare, they claimed to be doing poor people a favor by saving them from dependency. But with the 1996 welfare reform, conservatives claimed victory in the battle against aid to the "undeserving poor." The new federal program, aptly named Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, suspended welfare payments after five years and mandated that able individuals receiving help be working, looking for work, or training for work at least 30 hours a week. <br> At the same time, thanks mostly to Bill Clinton, annual spending on supports for the working poor roughly doubled from 1992 to 1999. Because of the expansions in the Earned Income Tax Credit, child care subsidies, and health care programs, poor families who worked hard and played by the rules had a better shot at a decent life. Not that they were rich, but, according to estimates by economists Rebecca Blank and David Ellwood, an average working single mother with two children saw her disposable income rise by $2,500 above inflation in this period. The families were better off and America was too: Studies by economist John Karl Scholz and others have shown that these initiatives actually increased labor participation among low-income families. <br> It is precisely such work supports that congressional conservatives would now slice away. For example, some parents who have left the welfare rolls and taken jobs can now continue receiving Food Stamps while their income rises above the poverty line. In the real world, these folks still struggle to put food on the table: We are talking about a single mother working full-time for less than $9 an hour, then paying so much for child care that her disposable income falls below the poverty line. Working families like hers will lose Food Stamps altogether under the House budget. <br> It's the same story for health care. Today, Medicaid provides coverage for children in low-income families just above the poverty line. Their parents may work full-time and earn the minimum wage, but the House bill promises billions from new charges imposed on such families. A family making about $1300 per month could now pay nearly $70 of that income just for health care. The bill also cuts off guaranteed coverage for services children desperately need, like eyeglasses to see blackboards just because their parents are "too rich." <br> Then there is child care. If we are serious about encouraging work for single parents, as we should be, then we must be equally serious about ensuring working parents can afford child care. Otherwise work won't be ennobling for families; it will just be lousy for their children. Yet according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the House bill would eliminate child-care assistance for 330,000 children by 2010. <br> Finally, consider child support enforcement. Here's a policy that lifts poor children out of poverty by requiring that their parents, usually fathers, do right by their kids, usually by going to work. Under the House bill, a staggering $24 billion in child support would go uncollected. <br> Conservatives like to present themselves as pro-growth, but these cuts make little economic sense. With demographers now projecting zero growth in our native workforce over the next 20 years, America will need to expand its labor force and ensure that those who can work do. Conservatives once emphasized how the welfare state could affect work incentives, for better or worse. Parents who lose health care, child care, and Food Stamps when they work "too much" are going to work less. <br> The grim truth is that encouraging work isn't conservatives' priority. Just as budget cuts are undermining incentives for labor, tax breaks are increasing incentives for passive investment. The 2003 tax cut reduced the top rate on capital gains by 25 percent and the top rate on dividends by nearly 60 percent. These tax breaks allow wealthy investors to pay a lower rate on their income than the people who drive their cars. Yet these are the tax breaks financed by reductions in work incentives. <br> Liberals are right to point out that conservative budget policies take from the poor and give to the rich. But what is more striking, and ultimately more saddening, is that they betray the deepest commitment conservatives claim to honor: hard work. <br> <b>Robert Gordon is senior vice president for economic policy, and Josh Lynn is a research associate, at the Center for American Progress.

 This column was written by Robert Scheer.</i>Call it Tonto's revenge: The outrageous rip-off of Native American tribes by a top Republican lobbyist is leading inexorably to a reckoning for the allegedly morally superior religious and political right. <br> "I don't think we have had something of this scope, arrogance and sheer venality in our lifetimes," Norman J. Ornstein, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote in Roll Call. "It is building to an explosion, one that could create immense collateral damage within Congress and in coming elections." <br> Selling firewater to the natives or in this case charging them $82 million for government breaks on slot machine and other gaming licenses is not exactly what the high-minded prophets of the Republican revolution promised. And to see behind the scenes as Christian right superstar Ralph Reed, bought off by top Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, dupes his grassroots "pro-family" followers into unwittingly supporting casino-rich Indian tribes under the guise of anti-gambling initiatives, is to glimpse moral corruption of biblical proportions. <br> Reed, now a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in Georgia, at first denied knowing the $4 million he acknowledges receiving from Abramoff and his closet associate, public-relations expert Michael Scanlon, to run the pseudo anti-gambling campaigns in the South came from tribes hoping to retain local monopolies for themselves. Once the investigation picked up steam this past summer, however, he changed his mind and said he was assured that the tribal money didn't come directly from casino proceeds a hair-splitting attempt at face-saving ethics, indeed, since the goal of the payments was so clearly to benefit the casinos. <br> Furthermore, the release of a treasure trove of documentation on the Abramoff investigation to the Internet by Senator John McCain, chair of the Senate's Indian Affairs Committee, makes it clear that Abramoff and his colleagues had no interest in the finer points of morality when they were transferring huge sums of cash from the tribes to the accounts of such allegedly high-minded heavyweight pro-Republican outfits as Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform. <br> "This town has become very corrupt, there's no doubt about it," McCain said Sunday on Meet the Press, adding that he expects "lots" of indictments and that there is "strong evidence" of "significant wrongdoing" by some legislators. <br> Reading the documents, in fact, is a horrifying look at democracy for sale. For example, an Abramoff e-mail to Reed about a conversation the lobbyist had with Nell Rogers, a Choctaw representative: "Spoke with Nell. They have a budget issue. They want to know if we can get through to October on $1 million. Can we? If not, let me know." <br> In response, Reed lays out what it costs, in very precise amounts, to kill legislation on Capitol Hill to favor of a wealthy entity: "I believe [$1 million will be enough]. If we can kill it in the House[,] definitely. If it goes to the Senate, the worst case scenario is what the pro-family groups spent to defeat video poker and the lottery each about $1.3 million.... We will be doing all we can to raise money from national anti-gambling groups, Christian CEOs and national pro-family groups." <br> Overall, both Reed, once the religious right's boy savior, and Abramoff, the former head of the College Republicans, a "pioneer"-grade fundraiser for President Bush, and a stalwart friend of Texas Representative Tom DeLay, come off as morally degenerate political savants in the Senate committee's files. Reed seems possessed by the gods of greed as he exults, "I need to start humping in corporate accounts!" <br> But Abramoffgate goes much higher than these two political pimps. In those e-mails between Abramoff and Scanlon, it is clear that they trafficked in their ties to DeLay and others in the Republican leadership. As the Washington Post reported, Abramoff "cultivated a reputation as the best-connected Republican lobbyist in Washington," and it was not a false claim. DeLay, who referred to Abramoff as "one of my closest and dearest friends," received no fewer than three free golf trips to Scotland from Abramoff, among other payoffs. <br> Both DeLay and Abramoff are under indictment for charges in other cases but not, as of yet, this one. Scanlon has already pleaded guilty to conspiring with Abramoff to defraud various Indian tribes and bribe government officials. Former White House official David Safavian has been indicted for lying about his ties to Abramoff. The bet now is that Abramoff will also cop a plea bargain instead of spending many years in jail and paying even larger fines than the $19.7 million Scanlon has accepted. <br> If so, more depressing tales of corruption may be detailed publicly. But what is already clear is that the Republicans' reputation for moral superiority is as dead as the Lone Ranger.By Robert ScheerReprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This column was written by Deroy Murdock.<hr width="75%">Tuesday's elections left Republicans little to cheer beside New York mayor Mike Bloomberg's reelection. Less elephant than RINO (Republican in Name Only), Bloomberg entombed veteran Democrat Fernando Ferrer beneath a 10-1 spending advantage and a record 20-point victory margin. GOP gubernatorial nominees, alas, sank in New Jersey and Virginia, while California GOP governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's four ballot initiatives were torched like a Malibu hillside. One week earlier, Coloradoans approved a "time-out" from their Taxpayer Bill of Rights. This supposedly temporary measure surely guarantees years of higher state spending. <br> GOP candidates and conservative causes across America surely were not buoyed by a national Republican party that appears adrift, inept, and corrupt except when it actually is adrift, inept, and corrupt. <br> If they care about the party's long-term fortunes, President Bush and top Republicans desperately need to stop behaving like Brooks Brothers Democrats. Bush and congressional leaders must clean house and rededicate themselves to the Reaganite principles that fueled electoral landslides and major, pro-market policy reforms. The alternative is more of the bland, statist pudding that gagged voters Tuesday. <br> For starters, President Bush must address his biggest strategic problem: his and his administration's stunning wholesale inability to communicate. <br> Why, for example, has President Bush been unable to deliver clear, detailed, and coherent speeches to explain that Guantanamo is not his personal torture chamber, but a vital facility to isolate and interrogate suspected Islamo-fascists mass murderers? He should pick ten major thugs at Gitmo. Use Power Point to present their mug shots. Clarify how they fell into U.S. custody. Specify intelligence data that interrogators have extracted from them, including any attacks such data have foiled. Some twelve detainees released from Guantanamo have resumed terrorist operations, including shooting at American GIs. Tell us more. <br> White House Press Secretary Scott McMilquetoast, I mean McClellan, exudes timidity. His briefings instill neither confidence nor inspiration. The president should name McClellan ambassador to a nice, non-controversial Caribbean island. <br> The president needs advisors who can bring him bad news and, despite his immense powers, make him watch discomforting newscasts. Newsweek's Evan Thomas reported that as Hurricane Katrina drowned New Orleans, Bush's aides in Crawford, Tex., fretted among themselves over which of them would tell the president how bad things were on the ground. Not until he flew to the Gulf Coast as that horrid week ended did staffers show Bush a DVD of disturbing news footage from the crippled Crescent City. 
 This column was written by Allison R. Hayward.<hr width="75%">On Wednesday, the Online Freedom of Speech Act (HR 1606) failed to pass on suspension with the necessary two-thirds vote. While supporters, pleased with their clear majority (225-182), vow to bring it back as a bill in the ordinary course, this is an unfortunate development in the debate over how the Internet will be affected by campaign-finance laws. <br> The bill itself was reasonable and modest in scope. It would have codified existing regulations which are currently the law under which we labor exempting the Internet from special rules that apply to "public communications." These rules have the most impact for political parties (especially state and local parties), and groups like some PACs that "allocate" that is, use money raised outside the federal rules for some general expenses. They also affect which messages require disclaimers the little "Paid for by" tag you see on direct mail and TV ads. <br> While the technical reach of the bill was modest, the impact of its defeat may not be. The Federal Election Commission is currently rewriting the existing Internet rule under a court order. It may be that the FEC's approach will be modest say, to require disclaimers on paid advertisements and spam on the Internet. But it is also possible that regulators will look at the bill's failure as some endorsement of the need for greater regulation, because the FEC has also opened the question of whether Internet journalists are exempt from regulation as "press" an issue not addressed by the legislation but one of great significance to bloggers. Certainly, the bill's passage would have preempted the legal necessity for the FEC to involve itself in Internet rulemaking. <br> The FEC is presently considering an advisory opinion request from an openly political website called Fired Up, which is seeking confirmation that they are protected under the law's so-called press exemption. The bill's failure may signal to the FEC that Congress isn't interested in protecting the Internet, at a time when these questions are before it. <br> Currently there are four seats on the commission awaiting new members or reappointments, and it is hard to know how new commissioners who have not been direct participants in the debate will rewrite the regulations or treat Fired Up; passage of the Online Freedom of Speech Act would have clarified this increasingly cloudy situation. 
 This column was written by Fred Barnes.</i>Why have so many conservatives suddenly revolted against President Bush, nearly five years into his presidency? I think their split with Bush is ill advised, counterproductive, and in some ways childish. But there's no doubt it's happening and it's serious. And there's more to it than disappointment with his nomination of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court. So why exactly has this revolt broken out now? I've come up with six reasons, and there may be more. <br> One, a revolt was inevitable, sooner or later, simply because Bush is not a conventional conservative. He deviates on the role of the federal government, on domestic spending, on education, on the Medicare prescription-drug benefit, and on immigration. Given this kindling, it took only the spark of the Miers nomination to ignite a conservative backlash. <br> Bush, of course, is a conservative, but a different kind of conservative. His tax cuts, support for social issues, hawkish position on national security and terrorism, and rejection of the Kyoto protocols make him so. He's also killed the ABM and Comprehensive Test Ban treaties, kept the United States out of the international criminal court, defied the United Nations, and advocated a shift in power from Washington to individuals through an "ownership society." On some issues partial privatization of Social Security is the best example he is a bolder conservative than Ronald Reagan, the epitome of a conventional conservative. <br> Two, Bush has not courted leaders of the conservative movement. He's left that to his adviser Karl Rove, who did an excellent job until he was distracted by the investigation of the CIA leak case. Movement conservatives feel Bush doesn't respect them. They may be right. <br> Three, the White House has grown a bit arrogant and self-centered. That's what naturally occurs after a president is reelected. The White House thinks its interests are more significant than those of members of Congress. In fact, their interests (winning a war, for instance) usually are. But senators and House members who are running for reelection, while Bush won't have to face the electorate again, regard this White House attitude with resentment. They may be small-minded, but it's understandable. <br> Four, Bush is down. His job approval is at an all-time low. He is under fire, unfairly, for his handling of the Katrina rescue and recovery. His bid this year for Social Security reform failed. All of which has provoked the classic Washington response to the plight of a political foe in trouble: kick 'em while they're down. Many conservatives, who rarely complained when Bush was riding high, have joined in the kicking. <br> Five, the press is happy to abet the revolt. For the media, the situation is the best of all worlds. Not only is a conservative president in trouble, but the media can concentrate on covering conservatives who are bashing one of their own. Two days ago, reporters covering a press conference by Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer abandoned him when Republican Senator Sam Brownback walked by. They rushed to Brownback, a skeptic on the Miers nomination, in hopes he would bash Bush or Miers or both. <br> Six, the Miers nomination didn't just trigger the revolt. It provoked deep anger toward Bush as well. The feeling of conservative critics was that Bush had trivialized an enormously important Supreme Court nomination by choosing his legal counsel. Despite Bush's assurances, they are doubtful Miers will turn out to be a judicial conservative. <br> Can the broken relationship between Bush and conservatives be repaired? Certainly. It's probably just a political phase anyway. And if Miers makes a strong case for herself as a judicial conservative during her confirmation hearings, the conservative anger will begin to fade. But there's bound to be a residue of ill will, which means the rapport between Bush and many conservatives will never be quite the same again. <br> <b>Fred Barnes is executive editor of The Weekly Standard. <br> By Fred Barnes. 
 This column was written by Joseph Vranich.<hr width="75%">According to U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, our nation is on an unsustainable financial path. To drive home his point, he recently said: "A Category 6 hurricane is threatening our shores it's the federal budget deficit." Solutions, he warned, will require more than cutting pork-barrel-spending projects. He urged a new debate about how we want to spend and raise money. <br> A huge flaw in government is that its spending tends to enrich special interests while heaping debt on taxpayers. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being committed to fund new federal programs hurricane relief and medical benefits get the most headlines and to prop up congressional pet projects. <br> This year, Wall Street Journal columnist George Melloan wrote: "Congress knows it has a spending problem, just as alcoholics are aware that they have a drinking problem. The late Democratic Senator Pat Moynihan once said to Journal editors, 'It doesn't do any good for you to yell at us we just can't help it.'" <br> Washington is deaf to more than yelling. It also ignores logical arguments against financing boondoggles. Let's examine just one program, Amtrak. Evidence that Amtrak is utterly dysfunctional can be found in 30 reports issued since 1997 by the Government Accountability Office, the Amtrak Reform Council, and others. <br> The railroad has already hemorrhaged $29 billion in federal funds and loses more money per customer than any other form of transportation. Nonetheless, senators Trent Lott (R., Miss.) and Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.) gloss over Amtrak's failures and want to double subsidies to nearly $11.4 billion over the next six years. <br> Such generosity is absurd. <br> Consider: In the 1990s, Congress ordered the Internal Revenue Service to give Amtrak a $2.2 billion income-tax "refund" even though Amtrak never paid a penny in income taxes. Supporting the deceitful congressional action, Amtrak promised the bailout would improve its bottom line. But the reverse happened, leading critics to equate the business practices of the nearly bankrupt Amtrak with those of Enron and WorldCom. <br> Legislators handed liabilities to future taxpayers when in the 1980s they failed to demand reforms after Amtrak defaulted on government-backed loans. Taxpayers will be paying off a billion dollars in Amtrak-related notes until they mature on Nov. 1, 2082. This century's children will be paying most of their lives for money Amtrak burned through in the last century. 
 This column was written by David Weigel.</i><br>On Monday morning, West Virginia Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito dashed five years of Republican hopes and announced she would not run against Senator Robert Byrd. <br> The formerly rock-solid Democratic state (52 percent for Michael Dukakis) gave President Bush a 13-point landslide last year, and Republicans had considered a Thune v. Daschle-style upset of the 87-year-old Byrd a top 2006 goal. <br> In July, the National Republican Senatorial Committee charged in with the cycle's first negative ad $53,000 of airtime for a TV spot attacking the senator. But it couldn't get Capito in the race. <br> Coming only four days after North Dakota Gov. John Hoeven's decision not to challenge Senator Kent Conrad, Capito's bluff should wave a matador-sized red flag about Republican chances for 2006. In these crucial few months when candidates are entering races, raising money and recruiting staffs, Republican hopefuls are quietly keeping their hats out of the ring. <br> While GOP leaders have located some strong candidates in open seats like Minnesota and Maryland, they can't find strong candidates to challenge Democratic incumbents in red or swing states. <br> This is a marked change from the last two cycles, when Karl Rove used the power of the White House to cajole first-tier candidates into dozens of races. <br> In 2002, the White House encouraged Saxby Chambliss (Georgia), Norm Coleman (Minnesota), Jim Talent (Missouri), and John Thune (South Dakota) to run against incumbent Democrats, even though Coleman and Thune had originally wanted to run for governor. <br> In 2004, when southern Democratic retirements created open seats that favored the GOP, Rove greased the wheels for superior candidates like Mel Martinez (Florida) and Richard Burr (North Carolina). <br> But this year, Rove isn't getting what he wants. In Michigan, Rep. Candice Miller passed on challenging Sen. Debbie Stabenow despite polls that showed them neck and neck. <br> In Florida, Rep. Katherine Harris has refused to drop her Senate campaign even though she badly trails Sen. Bill Nelson. And in Rhode Island, conservative Cranston Mayor Stephen Laffey brushed aside months of high-up pressure to challenge liberal Sen. Lincoln Chafee in the Republican primary even though polls show Chafee could retain the seat but Laffey would lose it to Democrats. <br> There's one obvious reason why Republican candidates aren't listening to the White House and the national party: For the first time, Mr. Bush is an unpopular president. <br> In Virginia, which is holding state elections next month, Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore has notably failed to call in the president to stump for him. One reason might be a Washington Post poll released in September that put Bush's popularity at 47 percent in this state he'd easily won 10 months ago. Startlingly, 45 percent of the polled said that Bush's endorsement would make them "less likely" to vote for the Republican candidate, compared with 28 percent who'd be more likely. <br> This makes a stark change from 2002, when Bush may have been the most popular president ever facing a midterm election. The national exit poll put his popularity at 66 percent, with 71 percent of voters approving of his handling of terrorism and 58 percent supporting him on the then-foundering economy. <br> But now, according to the national polling outfit Survey USA, Bush's approval ratings outweigh his disapproval ratings in only 12 states, all in the Deep South and Mountain States. In Florida, Michigan, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont all states with potentially hot Senate races his approval is mired in the 30s. 
 This column was written by Jonathan Wilcox.</i> Sacramento is a place of surreal scenes: A major sports arena in the middle of nowhere, a midtown-street corner with opposing coffee shops, two separate freeways both known as "The 80." <br> Still, none compare for weirdness to the recent spectacle of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger entering into a week-long discussion with his Democrat tormentors to negotiate the cancellation of a statewide special election he alone made possible. <br> That the eleventh-hour talks ultimately failed was no shock. That the governor even attempted this one-way appearance of bipartisanship left many puzzled. It may also upend any chance he has to change California's chaotic government and dysfunctional politics. <br> Remember Arnold Schwarzenegger? The movie star who swept into Sacramento with more money and momentum than had ever been seen before? The irresistible political force whose approval ratings tickled stratospheric heights and whose candor and independence seemed just what voters were looking for? <br> So much for the early box-office reviews. Today, Arnold is portrayed as a spent political force accused of shilling for campaign dollars, shady deal-making with supermarket tabloids, and singling out innocent teachers and nurses for a manufactured "phenomenon of anger." <br> Okay, that's just the Los Angeles Times, but you get the point. <br> Along with the negative mainstream media blitz, Schwarzenegger has been shelled by millions of dollars of television ads accusing him of wanting to steal from schools, deny benefits to the families of fallen firefighters, and cancel the health care of house-bound invalids. <br> Predictably, his poll ratings have tumbled, and with them much of the non-stick coating that allowed him to achieve political success through unconventional means. <br> During his first year in office, sporadic accusations of hardheartedness tended to slide right off of Arnold. Today, he's more like the Velcro Man, unable to avoid contact with practically every controversy attached to California's government.

 This column was written by William Greider</i>The catastrophe, as many seem to grasp, is one of those big moments that jolt public consciousness and alter the course of national history. I would go further and describe it as an exclamation point that marks a dramatic breakdown for the reigning right-wing orthodoxy, the beginning of its retreat and eventual demise. This by no means insures the restoration of progressive alternatives, but events have at least reopened the argument conservatives thought they had won. <br> A profound political question is suddenly on the table: Must the country continue to give precedence to private financial gain and market determinism over human lives and broad public values? Or shall we now undertake a radical restoration on behalf of society and people? New Orleans, strange exception though it seems, is actually an extreme microcosm of the nation's general afflictions and social inequities. It's the place where reform politics can launch its long-deferred counteroffensive. <br> The conservative mindset is flummoxed by these tragic new circumstances. Republican ideologues acquired governing power by promising to liberate Americans from the government's intrusive powers, but they succeeded all too well. If "market forces" are allowed to design the recovery program, much of New Orleans and environs will be plowed up (think no-bid contracts for Halliburton and Bechtel) and reduced to a theme park for hot jazz, good restaurants and grubby jobs. <br> Newt Gingrich, always a reliable bellwether for the right-wing zeitgeist, is preaching that the right must change its tune "quickly" or face big losses. The old politics -- provoking culture wars about "moral values" -- will no longer suffice, he explained in a memo circulated among Republicans and the press. The new politics is about "performance," in which GOP government has to deliver. But while Gingrich's rhetoric is different, his ideas are the same old, same old. He urges George W. Bush to create a huge tax-free zone along the Gulf Coast where business enterprise will be subsidized and the oil industry relieved of meddlesome environmental regulation. The President's first noble gesture after the flood was to cut wages for construction workers on public projects. <br> More encouraging evidence of changed politics comes from the left. Some bold Democrats are doing what they haven't dared to do for many years, even decades: They are invoking their New Deal legacy and applying its liberal operating assumptions to the present crisis. In the totality of the Gulf Coast destruction, the economy and the society have been collapsed. As New Dealers understood, you cannot fix one without fixing the other. And only the federal government has the resources and authority to lead such a complex undertaking.

That information -- combined with his refusing to roll into his speech without introducing his wife and daughter-in-law -- makes clear that Romney knows the way it is. He doesn't need to get the scoop from John "Neanderthal" Roberts. <br> Introduced as a "compassionate conservative" by former Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith, Romney presented himself today as a practical problem-solver who got a deficit-ridden commonwealth to show a surplus -- without raising taxes, cutting education, or cutting funds for the homeless. What Romney did instead was slash inefficiency in government. <br> In broad strokes, Romney then addressed the war on terror -- saying that "I do not believe that we should cut and run" in Iraq. He talked about the need to focus more resources on preventative homeland-security and intelligence reform. The governor -- also a businessman who at one point was part of a Domino's Pizza company purchase from its founder Tom Monaghan -- also talked about the economic war with China. <br> He hit on old standbys -- the tax structure is "burdensome," the tort system is "confiscatory." He emphasized personal responsibility, pointing out the difference between Massachusetts' helping someone who has been "knocked down" in Louisiana get back up vs. handouts to residents of his own state. In the latter case, he said, a "we'll take care of you [for] the rest of your life" mentality on the part of government is "deadening to [recipients], their children, and society." <br> And speaking of children and society: His "family" talk was there but light, his battles over marriage and culture-of-life issues understated on this lunch menu -- likely because he knew his audience. Rudy zone. 
 This column was written by John S. Irons and Robert Gordon.<hr width="75%">As early as next month, some Democrats seem ready to go along with most Republicans and implement a permanent repeal to the estate tax, a change that would reward the wealthy and drag down the economy by increasing the deficit. But it doesn't have to be this way. <br> The estate tax represents a profoundly American idea: Although parents should be able to pass on wealth to their children, great concentrations of personal wealth should not grow unchecked from generation to generation. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt put it, "Inherited economic power is as inconsistent with the ideals of this generation as inherited political power was inconsistent with the ideals of the generation which established our government." <br> Today, only about the wealthiest 1 percent of those who die in a given year pay the estate tax. With estate planning, married couples can leave at least $3 million to their children completely tax-free. <br> In 2001, President Bush's first tax bill phased out the estate tax by 2010, but because the tax changes expire after that year, the tax returns in 2011. Now, the president, Senator Jon Kyl, and other members of Congress are pushing to make the phaseout permanent. That would eventually cost about $75 billion per year, and another $23 billion a year in interest expenses. <br> Many advocates for eliminating the estate tax use deceptive data. A prime example is the American Family Business Institute (AFBI), which, according to its Web site, is "devoted to the singular goal of the permanent repeal of the Federal Estate Tax." The AFBI recently ran an ad in Montana stating, "When you die, the IRS can bury your family in crippling tax bills," and claims, "It can cost them everything." But the average estate-tax rate for the handful of people actually paying in 1999 and 2000 (when the tax was higher) was just 13 percent. By 2009, only 25 people would have to pay the estate tax each year in Montana. The ad mentioned none of that. <br> Many Washington political pundits say the estate tax is a losing issue with voters, especially in red states with lots of farmers. <br> But the truth is that Americans support reforming the estate tax, not repealing it. When given the choice between reform and repeal, a majority chooses reform by 59 percent to 29 percent, according to a July poll by Penn, Schoen Berland Associates. And that margin holds even though many middle-income families believe, thanks to misleading ads, that they'll pay the estate tax when they die. When the costs of repeal are made clear -- budget cuts, higher taxes for everyone else, or bigger deficits -- and the benefits of reform are emphasized, support for repeal drops to 22 percent. Even among farm and business owners, support for repeal is less than a third. <br> Most Senate Democrats and some Republicans have balked at full repeal. And so, aiming for a compromise, a working group of Democratic senators and their staffs have been looking at reform options from a practical perspective. <br> Meanwhile, Senator Kyl has suggested a "compromise" setting the estate-tax rate equal to the capital-gains rate, which (thanks to President Bush's 2003 tax cut) is currently just 15 percent. Some proposals would set the tax-free exemption to $8 million, or at best $3.5 million. Either way, the cost of this "reform" is enormous -- a $3.5 million, 15-percent reform would spend about 80 percent as much as full repeal. That's nearly $60 billion a year in tax cuts for multimillionaires. 
 This column was written by Paul J. Gessing.<hr width="75%">Despite heavy traffic levels during this summer's tourist season, the airline industry is expected to lose at least $2 billion in 2005 alone. Such a performance may not surprise most stock analysts, who consider the commercial aviation sector to be "cyclical" in nature, but the "cycle" for most airlines all too often seems to run from bad to worse. <br> Although business earnings reports might not seem like an immediate matter of concern for taxpayers, the recent decision by United Airlines to drop $9.8 billion in obligations onto the government-backed Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. is only one reason why reforming federal policy toward the airlines should be a top priority for taxpayers and airline passengers alike. <br> For most Americans, the era prior to airline deregulation in 1978 is either a distant memory or something they may have only seen portrayed in movies like "The Aviator." Unfortunately, although deregulation did democratize air travel (in turn saving air travelers an estimated $20 billion annually), the federal government regulates the industry with what can only be described as a very heavy and clumsy hand. <br> Since 9/11, Washington has provided no less than $9.5 billion to the airline industry in the guise of grants, loan guarantees, and tax waivers. Although one could argue over the fairness of such actions, given what occurred on 9/11 and the ensuing fallout, the reality is that industry experts cite excess capacity as one of the biggest problems of the air carriers. Worse, when airlines act to reduce overcapacity and save costs, federal regulators often stand in their way. <br> The pre-9/11 proposed merger between United and US Airways is just one example. At the time the two companies were forced to call off their planned merger when the U.S. Justice Department threatened to block the deal. The latest merger effort involves US Airways and America West. This deal will also face federal scrutiny that could once again bully the industry into retaining an unhealthy oversupply of capacity. <br> Yet another area in desperate need of reform within the aviation marketplace is air traffic control. According to Russell Chew, chief operating officer of the Air Traffic Organization within FAA, air traffic control is facing an $8.2 billion funding gap over the next five years. This shortfall mainly is the result of inefficiencies inherent in the unionized, government-operated system, combined with the ongoing decrease in ticket prices. The latter effect means that revenue from the 7.5 percent tax on airline tickets continues to dry up despite surging traffic. 
 This column was written by Bill Whalen</i>. There was a time when political winds flowed west to east across America. But this summer in California, the breeze blows the opposite way, with politicians here playing by East Coast rules. <br> In Sacramento, as in the nation's capital, Democrats seek to undermine Republican rule by talking ethics and conspiracies. Only, California Democrats are smarter than their beltway cousins. They're not wasting their time with personal attacks against presidential personnel. Instead, the target is the man at the top, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br> At present, two controversies envelop Sacramento, neither to be confused with a serious policy debate. <br> The first is a stink over a disclosure that the Governator was earning a minimum of $1 million a year in outside income -- as much as $13 million over five years -- as an editorial consultant to a pair of bodybuilding magazines, Flex and Muscle Fitness. The magazines rely on advertising from dietary supplements makers. Last year, Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that would have cracked down on the supplements industry. It didn't take long for Democrats to play connect the dots and suggest that the governor was on the take. <br> Although Schwarzenegger soon ended the deal (without returning the money he'd already received), it didn't stop the Democrats from filing a complaint with the state's Fair Political Practices Commission, accusing the Governator of accepting illegal gifts and violating conflict-of-interest rules. Also filing a complaint: the parents of a 24-year-old who three years ago committed suicide after taking steroids. They think there's a link between steroids and dietary supplements, and have threatened to sue Schwarzenegger if he doesn't return his magazine proceeds. <br> The second controversy doesn't pertain to what Schwarzenegger did. Rather, it's what he wants to do: pass Proposition 77. If approved this November, the bill would make California's redistricting process non-legislative -- not a popular idea within the predominately Democratic legislature -- by turning over control to a panel of retired judges. <br> First, State Attorney General Bill Lockyer went to court to get the initiative removed from the November special ballot. Lockyer's contention: The version of Prop 77 that he reviewed wasn't the same as the one used for public signature-gathering. Technically, Lockyer has a point. He's also splitting hairs, as the 11 discrepancies in question are picayune at best. For example, the petition that voters signed gives lawmakers five days to pick a judicial panel; Lockyer's version said six days. There doesn't appear to be an effort to deliberately mislead voters.

From his perch at Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), his weekly Wednesday meetings with conservative activists and his ruthlessly successful K Street Project, Norquist has created a new Republican political establishment. A Nation profile of Norquist in 2001 dubbed him "the managing director of the hard-core right in Washington." Norquist has been the go-to-guy on virtually every right-wing priority, from tax cuts to Social Security privatization, holding the GOP's big business and Christian conservative constituencies together. <br> Now, the man who once bragged of wanting to "cut government in half" and "drown it in the bathtub" is up to his neck in hot water because of ties to uberlobbyist Jack Abramoff. Newly released emails from the Senate Indian Affairs Committee confirm Norquist's role in helping Abramoff milk millions from Indian tribes, in one of the most extravagant corruption scandals to reach the Capitol in decades. 
 This column was written by Jared Bernstein</i>. This may seem like a weird time for progressives to feel optimistic, but a confluence of recent events suggests the faintest breeze of hope in the air. <br> Granted, the winds of corruption and shortsightedness still dominate. More so than at any time in recent memory, high-level officials are indistinguishable from right-wing lobbyists, gutting government's ability to regulate corporate power. The Justice Department is throwing the fight against the tobacco companies; the White House is busy editing the science out of regulations that might restrain polluters. <br> Meanwhile, the administration and its congressional allies continue the fiscal recklessness that has been their hallmark since they got here. If they continue to have their way -- and they recently added a new slew of regressive tax cuts to their 2006 budget -- it will eventually be impossible for government to fulfill essential functions, from safety nets to investment in future technologies. (I know, that's the point: Starve the beast.) <br> Given this gale force of business as usual, where's this hopeful little breeze coming from? In fact, from a number of places: 
 This column was written by William Kristol.<hr width="75%">Tax cuts -- especially the supply-side tax cuts of May 2003 -- were the controversial center of the Bush administration's first-term economic policy. Most Democrats opposed most of the tax rate reductions. John Kerry promised to repeal many of them if elected president. The president, and Republicans running for the Senate and House, promised to make them permanent. (For reasons having to do with artificial out-year budget calculations, most of the Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire over the next few years.) <br> Bush won and Kerry lost. Republicans increased their margins in Congress. So a bill to make the tax cuts permanent should be moving through Congress as we speak, no? No. The president occasionally refers to his wish that this be done, but tax-cutting has taken a back seat -- way at the back of the bus -- to his top priority for the second term, Social Security reform. <br> But Social Security reform is going nowhere. Whatever the merits of the president's ideas, they're not going to become law this year or next. There's no dishonor in trying and failing to enact a major public policy reform. But it's going to be time, soon, to throw in the towel. A sense of dignity and propriety argue against too sudden an abandonment of this effort, so we'll spend a couple of months reading about good-faith efforts at jump-starting reform. But surely Social Security reform will be allowed to die with dignity by, say, Labor Day -- perhaps little noticed in the excitement of a Supreme Court fight. The president can take credit for laying the foundation for future efforts, and the caravan can move on. <br> There has, of course, been a political cost to the emphasis on Social Security reform. Part of it is an opportunity cost. If the president talks about Social Security, he doesn't talk about tax cuts. But it's a little worse than that. The message the president has been delivering on Social Security is one of doom and gloom -- the horrible burdens overhanging us in the future if we don't start eating our spinach with benefit cuts, and squirreling away our nuts in private accounts. As a political drumbeat, this message has drowned out any talk of economic opportunity and optimism. In fact, in recent attempts to sell Social Security reform, the president with all his talk of "economic security" has almost begun sounding like our statist friends across the Atlantic, Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schrder. 
 This commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer.<hr width="75%"><br>"I don't worry about anythinghere in Washington, D.C." <br> - President George W. Bush,the Rose Garden, May 31, 2005 <br> Houston, we have a problem. <br> The President of the United States does not worry about anything in Washington, D.C. <br> That would be fine and even healthy coming from 99.9 percent of the American population. It would be understandable coming from a political consultant. But in a president, it's lame. <br> Perhaps as in lame duck? <br> You can interpret the president's words in three ways. <br> He does care about Washington very much and he was just lying. Or, perhaps he really doesn't care about Washington, but does care about the people and country and just spoke naively about the job of a real-life president hired to tend to the people and the country.

Sort of a post-modern thing. <br> It's just that the trickiest landmine of President Bush's second term could get stepped on next week if Chief Justice William Rehnquist retires. The president knows that; he learned it from his pop. 
 Although George W. Bush continues his campaign for Social Security reform, Americans have other domestic issues on their minds. They recognize problems with the current Social Security system, but support only a limited set of solutions. <br> As for themselves, while most say they won't rely on Social Security for their retirement income, many admit they aren't saving very much on their own to pay for retirement. <br> HOW BIG A PROBLEM? <br> Americans admit Social Security is in trouble, but few think the program is in crisis. 17% describe Social Security as being in a crisis today; 38% say the program is in serious trouble financially. Another 37% think the program is in some trouble, and 5% say Social Security is not in any trouble. <br> SOCIAL SECURITY'S FINANCIAL SITUATION: <br> In crisis17%					 			Serious trouble38			Some trouble37					Not in trouble5			 <br> In crisis15%Serious trouble46	Some trouble46	Not in trouble46	 <br> Those aged 65 and over are the least likely age group to say Social Security is in crisis. <br> Given a list of five domestic priorities, Americans place Social Security at the bottom. Health care is ranked first, with 28% choosing it. It is followed by education (22%) and jobs (20%). The budget deficit and Social Security are tied at 14% each. <br> WHICH ONE IS MOST IMPORTANT? <br> Health care28%	Education22Jobs20	Budget deficit14	Social Security14	 <br> Still, 57% of Americans do think Social Security's problems need to be addressed right now instead of in the future. 36% say the problems are serious but do not need to be fixed for another 10 to 15 years. Hardly any say they are not very serious. <br> PROBLEMS WITH SOCIAL SECURITY ARE: <br> So serious need to be fixed now57%	 Serious, but can be fixed in 10-15 years36Not serious4		 <br> On a personal level, two-thirds say the future of Social Security matters a lot to them.

By a 20-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans say the future of Social Security matters to them a lot. <br> When it comes to the future, and the prediction that in 2041 the system will only be able to pay three-fourths of the benefits now promised to Americans, 48% are very concerned about this and an additional 32% are somewhat concerned. <br> One reason for their concern is that most continue to doubt as they have for many years that the Social Security system will have the money available to provide the benefits they expect for retirement. <br> SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE A DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE ELDERLY? <br> Yes80%		No16	 <br> HOW CAN IT BE FIXED? <br> In this poll, the public was asked about a number of options for addressing the solvency of Social Security. Their reactions to those options have much to do with their own self-interest: options that would adversely affect higher-income people receive the most support. <br> 63% favor raising the $90,000 limit on income subject to Social Security tax withholding if it is necessary to keep the Social Security program paying benefits as it does now. <br> In addition, 59% of Americans find it acceptable for future Social Security benefits to grow more slowly than they do now for middle- and high-income people, with benefits growing as scheduled for low income people. But more than a third find this unacceptable. <br> When asked specifically about people with incomes of $100,000 or more, 66% favor letting that group's future benefits grow more slowly. However, when asked about slowing the growth rate of benefits for people earning incomes of over $20,000, a figure specifically referenced by the President, more than six in ten oppose it. <br> Other ideas garner little support. 54% oppose increasing the percentage of income withheld for Social Security, while41% favor that idea.

 This column was written by Fred Barnes</i>.<hr width="75%"> To understand why President Bush is relatively unpopular, one only has to look to the case of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. After his election in November 2003, Schwarzenegger experienced a political honeymoon. He governed mostly by compromise and without pushing for sweeping change. And his popularity, measured by how people feel about his performance as governor, soared. That lasted for more than a year. Now Schwarzenegger has gotten serious. He's called for a special election to limit government spending permanently, curb teacher tenure, and take redistricting out of the hands of the legislature, which is controlled by Democrats. His popularity has plummeted. <br> Bush's popularity dropped in 2003 after the terrorist insurgency spread in Iraq. And except for a blip or two, it hasn't risen significantly since, even after his effective campaigning last fall, his reelection, and his dazzling inaugural address. Instead, his job performance rating in the Gallup Poll has dipped further -- from 52 percent in January to 47 percent now. <br> Bush doesn't have the second-term blues, his administration hasn't lost its zeal, and he hasn't been troubled by scandal or the lack of a clear policy agenda. Nor is he suffering solely from his single-minded pursuit of Social Security reform. Like Schwarzenegger, the president has taken on a string of big issues -- Iraq, a drastic foreign-policy overhaul, judges, plus Social Security -- with predictable results. These are issues that generate political conflict. They upset settled practice, rile various institutions, stir strong opposition, and keep poll ratings low. For an activist president, lack of popularity is part of the package. <br> It's sad but true that our political system, assuming the economy is not in the tank, rewards presidents (and sometimes governors) for doing little. President Clinton benefited from this. His second term was largely unproductive. He balked at Social Security or Medicare reform. The war he fought in the Balkans consisted of bombs dropped from such high altitudes that American warplanes faced minimal risk. He refused to consider sending ground troops. The result: no American casualties. He did nothing to ease the stock-market bubble or deal with the looming recession. He got along with France. 
 President George W. Bush's overall job approval rating has hovered just below 50 percent since the beginning of the year, and now most Americans think he is out of touch with their priorities. <br> The public continues to have doubts about Bush's key foreign and domestic initiatives: as they have been for months, Americans are divided on whether Social Security investment accounts are a good idea and whether going to war in Iraq was the right thing to do. <br> While much recent news has been focused on President Bush's judicial nominees and the filibuster in the Senate, Americans see the country's most important priorities as the economy and jobs and the war in Iraq. <br> THE PRESIDENT<br>Six in 10 Americans don't think the President shares their priorities for the country; just 34 percent say he does. These are the lowest marks Bush has received on this question since the eve of his first inauguration, when CBS News started asking it. An even larger majority -- 68 percent -- says Congress does not share their priorities. <br> DOES BUSH SHARE YOUR PRIORITIES FOR THE COUNTRY? <br> Yes<br>Now<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="68" height="10"> 34%10/2004*<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="98" height="10"> 49%9/2003<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="82" height="10"> 41%1/2001<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="88" height="10"> 44% <br> No<br>Now<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="122" height="10">61%10/2004*<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="96" height="10"> 48%9/2003<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width='116"' height="10"> 56%1/2001<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="92" height="10"> 46% <br> *asked of registered voters <br> DOES CONGRESS SHARE YOUR PRIORITIES FOR THE COUNTRY?<br>(May 20-23, 2005) <br> Yes	20%		No 68%		 <br> The President fares slightly better in the public's overall evaluation of him, though Americans continue to be divided. 46percent now approve of the job Bush is doing as president, while 48 percent disapprove.

 This commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer. A longer version appeared in The Washington Post.</i> <br> The Radical Centrists who narrowly averted the Senate Missile Crisis and made the Capitol safe for democracy again deserve a massive Standing O. They proved compromise is possible even when tempers, rhetoric and common sense have boiled over. They bucked their party leaders and plucked power from their PAC-stained mitts. They stiffed the interest groups on the sanctimonious left and righteous right. They did what they voters wanted them to do grow up. <br> But and I'm sorry to have to say this the statecraft shown tonight is unlikely to apply to other pending legislation to bills becoming laws. <br> Nominations are different: different politics, different vote counting, different parliamentary procedures. The filibuster non-buster deal was all about NOT getting 50 votes; it was about ensuring there could not be the votes needed for both filibusters of judicial nominees and for a change of the Senate rules. Passing bills is about getting more than 50 votes. That's a different story. <br> The reason tonight's truly commendable accomplishment will not soon lead to a new spirit of pragmatism on real issues Medicare or tax reform, for example is the same reason the Senate got into such a partisan pickle over judges and filibusters: a long degradation of the culture of the U.S. Senate. <br> The change has left the Senate less able to produce legislation on major issues, less able to compromise, less reflective of public opinion (ironically, since these people are obsessed with polls), and less able to produce leaders for both the institution itself and the whole nation. The filibuster fiasco displays a Senate preoccupied with issues that are simply not high priorities for voters but that are important to interests on the left and right. <br> One casualty of the Senate's post-1989 cantankerous culture was Republican Sen. Trent Lott, who was ousted from his job as majority leader in 2002 for making a crack that implied sympathy for the segregation in the old South. "The club is dead," Lott said, a year after his fall. "I'm not sure when it died, but the club is dead." <br> There are plenty of reasons not to mourn the passing of that club. A white male bastion, it tolerated segregation for far too long, was enamored of its pork barrel, and let its entrenched members linger well into undignified dotage. But the club had its merits. It facilitated compromise, character, competence and the occasional act of conscience, thus presenting a serious counterweight to White House power. <br> If I had to etch a date on the tombstone of The Senate Club it would be March 9, 1989, the day the Senate rejected, with a 53-47 vote, former four-term Texas senator John Tower to be secretary of defense under the first President Bush. This was only the ninth time in history that a Cabinet-level nominee had been rejected. <br> The Senate's clubby comity had already been strained by the bitter battle over Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court and by the Iran-contra affair. But the long debate over Tower's misadventures with women and defense contractors and, most of all, his drinking was, if you will, a tippling point. <br> In 1991, the Senate confirmation struggle over Clarence Thomas made the Battle of Bork seem like a "Mork and Mindy" rerun, though he was eventually, and bitterly, confirmed. Also that year, the Senate Ethics Committee held extraordinary, trial-like public hearings for five senators -- the Keating Five -- accused of violating ethics rules. Later came the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. Then last year, Majority Leader Bill Frist broke long tradition by going to South Dakota to campaign against Minority Leader Tom Daschle. <br> Is this all, in the grand sweep of history, merely a phase? Last summer, after Vice President Cheney told Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont what to do with himself in language unsuitable for a family Web site, a slew of stories decried the end of civility in politics. (I think I wrote some of them!) But just about every generation thinks it is witnessing a decline in civility and good manners. Certainly, the indignity Leahy suffered paled in comparison to the crippling caning Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner endured on the Senate floor in 1856 at the hands of an irate Southern congressman. Certainly, today's incivilities seem silly compared with the poisonous antics that got Joseph McCarthy condemned for "conduct unbecoming a senator." <br> The filibuster flap is emblematic of deeper and, sadly, more enduring and consequential cultural changes. Several trends both illustrate and explain this conduct unbecoming of the Senate. <br> Legislative Paralysis. Last May, when the Senate was tied up in its usual election-year inertia, Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia said to The Washington Post's Senate correspondent, "Have we lost the will to legislate?" Well, yes, sir, it seems that way. 
 This column was written by Matthew Yglesias.<hr width="75%">On Friday, Larry Lindsey broke new ground -- for someone associated with Bush administration economic policymaking -- in his testimony to a House panel on Social Security reform: He proposed something resembling a good idea. <br> Lindsey's basic pitch is that each worker should contribute 1.5 percent of his or her payroll taxes to a private retirement account. The first $150 per year would be matched by the federal government on a 4-to-1 basis, with a 1-to-1 match for contributions above that total. One could quibble with the details here. Rather than dropping from 4-to-1 to 1-to-1, there should probably be a 3-to-1 phase (and a 2-to-1 phase, in between) to make the plan more generous to the middle class. Total contributions -- to say nothing of federal matches -- should be capped at some fairly low number to prevent the plan from turning into too much of a subsidy for the already rich. In essence, however, this is a good idea. While exactly how good an idea it turns out to be depends on the details, the broad outlines are more important. <br> What's not such a good idea is that Lindsey wants to pay for all this by cutting Social Security benefits. I won't rehearse the long set of reasons why this is a bad idea. Instead, it's worth simply flagging the point that, while the current structure of public debate seems to presume that any new initiatives in the field of retirement must be paid for by Social Security cuts, this is a highly unusual way to think about things. The current issue of The Atlantic contains a large cover story by Robert D. Kaplan that, among other things, makes the case that we ought to invest more money in something called the littoral-combat ship (LCS) that "requires only a small crew, can operate in very shallow water, can travel very fast (up to forty knots), and will deploy Special Operations Forces (namely, Navy SEALS)." I'm not entirely sold on the idea, but readers understand -- as they generally do with such proposals -- that the merits of spending more money on the project are assessable independently of the merits of any offsetting cuts in defense spending. I think, as most liberals do, that the construction of a national missile defense (NMD) system is a waste of time and money. If we eliminated the project, that would free up more money to spend on other things. But these are separate issues. Even if the LCS is a bad idea, that doesn't make NMD a good one. Whether we should dramatically cut Social Security benefits is one question; whether we should build add-on savings devices onto whatever remains is an entirely different one. <br> I'm against Social Security cuts. It might prove necessary to implement some mild ones in the future, but steep cuts should be ruled out entirely, and there's genuinely no reason to be contemplating cuts of any sort at the moment. Add-on accounts, however, are a perfectly good idea -- one that liberals should be embracing. And not just embracing in a token way as a political tactic or a pale imitation of some Republican initiative; they should be an important element of a liberal vision for the future. 
 This column was written by Andrew Ferguson.<hr width="75%">Laura Bush delivered a lot of jokes during her now-famous stand-up routine at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, but one of them touched a real sore spot. Not the joke about milking the horse. This one: "I said to him the other day, 'George, if you really want to end tyranny in the world, you're going to have to stay up later.'" When the joke was replayed over and over again on TV, a cry rose up from every corner of this sweet and verdant land: "No, no, George, don't stay up later! You just go on to bed! You're doing too much already! Really!" <br> Or maybe that was just me. In any case, Mrs. Bush's joke points to something important in our present political moment, four very busy months into her husband's very busy second term. It even sheds light on those discouraging poll numbers that have lately troubled all the president's men and his publicists in the press. The president himself, of course, pays no attention to polls. <br> And a good thing, too, because Bush's job approval ratings are now at the lowest point of his time in office down to 47 percent in the latest Washington Post poll, 48 percent in USA Today's. In the Post poll, the number of people who "strongly approve" of his job performance, which for most of the last four years has roughly matched the percentage of people who "strongly disapprove," has fallen to 25 percent, while the strong disapprovers have surged to 38 percent. <br> A solid majority, 56 percent, approve of Bush's handling of the "U.S. campaign against terrorism." From there, the numbers head south. Only 42 percent approve the way Bush has conducted the Iraq war, and 54 percent now say they believe the war should never have been fought. Forty percent approve his handling of the economy. With gas prices high, approval of Bush's energy policy is low: 35 percent. Even lower, though, is the percentage approving Bush's signature domestic initiative: 31 percent approve, and 64 percent disapprove, of the president's handling of Social Security. <br> These gloomy data follow the Terri Schiavo affair, when very large majorities -- up to 70 percent in some polls -- expressed their distaste for the effort by Bush and congressional Republicans to encourage federal courts to take up her case. <br> Scanning the poll numbers, Dean David Broder of the Washington Post announced that Bush is the victim of "overreach." John Podhoretz, in theNew York Post, came up with a better tag and got closer to the nub. The public, he wrote, may be suffering from "Issue Fatigue" -- an overload of public policy proposals and the politicking that goes with them. "While [Bush] refused to allow himself to rest after the 2004 election," Podhoretz wrote, "the American people seem to have desperately wanted a break." Both Podhoretz and the Dean are on to something, but what if they don't go far enough? Bush's problem may be more elemental. Overreach, and the resulting fatigue of the public, may be the inevitable consequences of the way Bush approaches his job -- it might, in other words, be built into his governing philosophy. <br> That philosophy has become known, with appropriate clumsiness, as "big government conservatism," and its intricacies, such as they are, have been laid out with customary self-congratulation by one White House triumphalist after another, most recently by Karl Rove in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference. "We are seizing the mantle of idealism," Rove said. A lot of this idealism is vague and cottony in the Clinton manner, with empty, harmless vows to "foster" a "culture of service" in a "new generation," and so on.

While politicians do each other in, little else gets done. <br> In the modern era, this began in 1989. In June, petty pilfery forced the Democratic Speaker of the House, Jim Wright to resign with words of melodramatic sacrifice, "Let me give you back this job you gave to me as a propitiation for all of this season of bad will that has grown among us." <br> Well, there ain't been no propitiating going on at the Capitol in the 16 years since and there's been a Texas torrent of bad will. <br> Two weeks before Wright resigned in a huff, his whip, Tony Coelho, quit in a cloud of his own scandal. The next whip, William Gray, resigned two years later. <br> In 1998, Republican Newton Leroy <br> Maybe. Maybe the pols of this turn of the century are worse than their Congressional ancestors. But I doubt that today's PAC-addicts quite compare to the rogues of Tammany Hall and Cook County from times past. <br> Maybe it's just that today's partisans find it too often in their short-term interests to practice Congressional cannibalism and they can't stop. They keep eating their own. In public. <br> Admittedly, the media is a ferocious enabler and the main vehicle for the destruction of an officeholder. But American journalism has always loved scandal; the pamphleteers of the early republic make even today's tabloids look like tepid porridge. In the end, it's the pols who sign the death certificates. Still, there's no denying that the press, and especially the explosion of media outlets from cable to blogs, is a huge factor; there are probably other factors I also ignore.

 This column was written by Fred Barnes.<hr width="75%"> President Bush needs an exit strategy on Social Security. With luck, he may never have to use it. There's still a chance a sweeping reform bill will pass this year. But despite Bush's valiant efforts to sell Congress and the nation on the idea of modernizing Social Security, the prospects are dim. History will surely vindicate Bush for trying to solve a serious national problem before it becomes a staggering mess. What's required now, however, is that he be ready to accept defeat in a manner that saves Republicans from losses in the 2006 election and allows him to pursue the rest of his agenda effectively. <br> The president has campaigned for reform with little help from congressional Republicans and in the face of demagogic hostility from Democrats. He raised public awareness of the financial abyss Social Security is falling into and the promise of personal retirement accounts. But that hasn't been enough to stir strong national support -- quite the contrary. As Bush himself wrote in his 1999 campaign book, A Charge To Keep, "It's hard to win votes for massive reform unless there is a crisis." With Social Security, the crisis arrives in 2017 when the system goes into the red. That's at least two presidencies away. <br> With only one of the 44 Democratic senators willing to cooperate on Social Security, it's hard to see how a reform measure can pass. This is particularly true since none of the Democrats faces pressure at home to work with the president on the issue. Instead, Democrats have been able to oppose Bush's reform drive, offer no alternative, and do so with impunity. Many congressional Republicans are understandably leery of embracing the issue this year. <br> Meanwhile, Bush's focus on Social Security reform has exacted a political cost. The president's foreign policy has become stunningly successful and the economy is strong and growing despite soaring gas prices and a shaky stock market. Yet his job performance rating in nearly every poll is 50 percent or less. What's the reason? It's certainly not Bush's limited involvement in the Terri Schiavo case. And gas prices have been stuck at about $2.00 a gallon for only a few weeks. No, it must be Social Security.If Bush is forced to accept defeat on Social Security, it's important he do it the right way. If he's petulant, it will only make things worse. And if he says the fight isn't over yet and he's going to try again in the next Congress to push through a reform measure, it will only make life easier for Democrats. They've become completely reactionary and have nothing to campaign on in 2006. Keeping Social Security reform alive would give them an issue to run on -- or rather against. 
 This column was written by Byron York.<hr width="75%">Although Democrats often maintain that their unprecedented outside-the-party campaign against President Bush last year, led by the so-called 527 groups, was a broad-based, grassroots effort, it was, in fact dependent in substantial part on just five donors: financier George Soros, Progressive Insurance chairman Peter Lewis, Hollywood mogul Stephen Bing, and the California investors Herbert and Marion Sandler. Together, they spent about $78 million in the effort to defeat the president -- more than the $75 million in federal funds that each presidential candidate received to conduct his entire general election campaign. (It was also more than twice what the late-starting top five Republican 527 donors spent on their side.) <br> The rise of the 527s, and the diversion of money and power away from the political parties to outside groups like America Coming Together, was the direct result of the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance law. After supporting campaign-finance reform, ostensibly for the purpose of "reducing the influence of big money in politics," in 2004 Democratic groups got the jump on Republicans in the 527 race. Anti-Bush 527s spent about $230 million in the effort to defeat the president -- nearly two and a half times the amount spent by Republicans to reelect Bush. <br> Now, more reform is about to send all that money in another direction. <br> Next week the Senate Rules Committee is expected to consider the "527 Reform Act of 2005," sponsored by Republican Sen. John McCain, which would impose on 527s the same contribution limits that now apply to other political-action committees. No longer would the groups be able to accept seven- and eight-figure, Soros-style contributions. And that will be the end of the 527s, at least as they existed during the 2004 campaign. "There is less and less enthusiasm for organizing 527s, since Congress is signaling that it is inclined to legislate them out of existence," says election-law expert Jan Baran. 
 This column was written by Matthew Yglesias.<hr width="75%">Washington is abuzz with talk that the Senate Republicans will deploy the so-called "nuclear option" -- in essence, violating the rules of the Senate to eliminate the possibility of mounting a filibuster against a presidential nominee -- in order to obtain the confirmation of a handful of President George W. Bush's appointments to the federal judiciary. <br> Senate Democrats, naturally enough, are plotting a second strike: Through various manipulations of the Senate rules, they will bring the entire legislative process to a grinding halt. And rightly so. There's no particular reason why filibusters should be banned just for nomination votes, and there's certainly no justification for doing so in a way that violates the Senate's rules. The politics of the fight that would ensue are uncertain but probably winnable for the Democrats. The substantive outcome -- no passage of any bills of any sort -- is the best liberals can hope for, given the current correlation of political forces inside the Beltway. <br> There is, however, a better way. Democrats should counter loose talk of going nuclear with a proposal of their own: The Senate as a whole could vote, through proper procedures, to end filibusters on votes of all kinds, allowing passage of any bill (or nominee) that can secure a majority vote. Republicans may reject the offer, of course. But if they do so, that will only strengthen the Democrats' hand politically in combating the nuclear option -- by demonstrating a fair-minded commitment to principle over short-term partisan advantage. <br> Alternatively, the GOP might agree. In the short term, this would produce bad results: confirmation for some bad judges. In the long run, however, eliminating the filibuster will be good for liberals, and Republicans will rue the day they decided to sacrifice a major prop of conservatism in order to put a handful of under-qualified nominees on the bench. <br> There is a basic asymmetry between the two big ideological forces in the United States. As the old saw goes, Americans are ideologically conservative but operationally liberal. They're suspicious, in other words, of new "big government" schemes; but once such schemes are put into place, they prove quite popular. Despite dismal electoral performance over the past 25 (or, if you prefer, 40) years, liberals do a very good job defending the gains of the past. The key liberal achievements of the past -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, civil rights, environmental regulation, federal funding for education -- have all withstood repeated attack. Indeed, smart conservative politicians either avoid attacking them or, as with the Bush prescription drug and No Child Left Behind bills, embrace them. In their not-so-smart moments, conservatives launch frontal assaults (as during Newt Gingrich's attempted 1995 Medicare cuts or the current effort to privatize Social Security) and watch their public approval ratings plummet. 
 This column was written by Jude Blanchette.<hr width="75%"> If there's one voice conspicuously absent in the debate over replacing Social Security with private accounts," writes Ben Hubbard, campus director at the "progressive" Center for American Progress, "it is young people -- the ones with the most to lose." As one of the young people Hubbard speaks of (I'm nearing my 25th birthday), I would like to reflect for a moment on exactly what he thinks we have to gain and lose from keeping the current system as is. <br> The first thing we gain is a legal dependent -- our grandparents. Of course, it's not called dependency; rather, Social Security represents a "social contract between the ages." Like most social contracts, however, it's neither social (government coercion rarely is), nor is it a contract (I don't remember signing it). Instead, Social Security is little more than glorified income redistribution. The young pay the old and hope that someday there are enough youngsters to do the same for them. Ethical, it's not. What is just about one human being coerced to subsidize another, I don't know, but certainly there is something even more unsettling about the younger (and therefore relatively poorer) subsidizing the older (richer) to take Carnival cruises. (According to "Washington Post" columnist Robert Samuelson, 20 percent of senior citizens do.) <br> On this point, the hypocrisy coming from Washington is palpable. In the same breath that a Democratic senator will decry the "mortgaging of our children's future" with tax cuts to the "ultra-rich," he will accuse you of war crimes (as Samuelson put it) if you broach the idea of a) cutting benefits, b) raising the retirement age, or c) allowing for personal retirement accounts. Furthermore, Democrats seem willing to stuff this problem under the bed and wait for a meltdown before they propose any type of reform. For a political party that does everything in the name of the children, this is odd behavior. <br> Young Americans also gain a large tax bill. Currently, those of us earning under $90,000 pay 12.4 percent of our wages to the government in the form of Social Security taxes. For an individual making $30,000, this amounts to $3,720 -- a sizable chunk of change. What is truly perverse about this system is that it is precisely at my age that I attempt to plan, dream, and create a life for myself. Maybe I want to travel Europe, write a book, or start a small business. Perhaps I want to take my dream job in Manhattan or go on to graduate school. All of these require money. Yet by taking over 12 percent of my income in Social Security taxes alone, the government limits my ability to pursue these and countless other ambitions. Many argue that exactly because we are off doing, the young don't adequately plan for retirement. While it is true that our time preference is higher, a government-enforced savings plan defies all logic if it denies you the opportunity to create a life that allows you to retire independently. <br> What, then, do we gain under the current system? This is slightly more confusing, and all the more tragic. <br> The president was recently quoted as saying, "If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future." This is a nice sentiment and I'm glad to hear a shift away from the social-contract malarkey. Let me, however, go one step further: Anything less than this is the very negation of what it means to be young. <br> The reader may argue that this is a stretch; certainly, participation in Social Security doesn't spell the end to youth. With almost any other government program, I would tend to agree. Yet, two things must be kept in mind: 1) Social Security is routinely described as the 20th century's most important program, and 2) it is by far the largest program in the United States. This is not Bill Clinton's midnight basketball we're talking about. Social Security has turned us from rugged and intrepid adventurers to a weak and feeble voting bloc, cowering at the feet of the New York Stock Exchange. We want to change the world, but lo, give us a few thousand dollars of our own money to invest and we become financial invalids. <br> Consider the following article by Traci E. Carpenter, senior at Michigan State University who interviewed several students on campus for a piece that appeared on" Newsweek's" website: "However, [Megan Connor, 21,] is concerned that our generation isn't prepared for what Bush has proposed. For those of us not financially savvy, and clueless when it comes to investing, 'it's going to be guesswork,' she says. <br> "Andrew Bell, 21, share the same anxiety. 'People have a pretty short-term outlook,' he said, adding he would be willing to pay more now to keep the current system because it would be 'one less thing I have to worry about.'" <br> If this outlook is common amongst my age demographic (and based upon my experience, it is), then today's youth have broken radically with the historic conception of self-reliance. To have twenty-somethings complaining that planning for their own retirement might be too confusing is a sad departure from the rugged idealism we once celebrated. Be it James Dean, Holden Caulfield, Tom Sawyer, or Frodo Baggins, the artistic and literary conception of "youth" meant to struggle with self and uncertainty in order to find identity. We were once Joseph Campbell's "hero with a thousand faces," setting out to explore the world. <br> Yet in today's world "risk" is something avoided at all costs. As one recent "New York Times" story informed us, "Private Accounts Are Risky, Many Young Workers Say." Well, of course they're risky! What in life that has ever brought reward had no risks? Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio patronizes us one better: "The stock market is risky business. Investing in the stock market can pay a higher return, but it's not a sure thing. That's why people are willing to forgo the potential to score big in the stock market in return for knowing that their hard-earned savings are safe." Even if Rep. Ryan's characterization of the president's plan were true (which it's not), what upsets me even more is the willingness of young people to accept it. <br> Even if we assume for the moment that there is no financial crisis in Social Security and that its future is rosy, I maintain that a moral crisis looms even larger. In the name of financial "security," we're increasingly willing to trade in our principles of self-governance, self-reliance, and economic freedom. What could be more "risky" than this? <br> <b>Jude Blanchette is a Henry Hazlitt Research Fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education. <br> By Jude BlanchetteReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 Since beginning his second term in office in January, President Bush has promoted his proposal to change the current Social Security system to include personal investment accounts. The public's reaction has been lukewarm; while most feel that the current Social Security system may be unworkable for the next generation and needs to be changed, Americans do not describe the system as in crisis, and are dubious as to whether the President's personal investment accounts are the best solution. <br> In fact, a third of Americans think personal accounts would exacerbate the budget deficit -- which nine in 10 Americans say is a serious concern -- and just one in 5 thinks they would improve Social Security's solvency. More Americans favor raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxation and raising the amount of the tax than think personal investment accounts are a good idea. <br> THE PRESIDENT'S SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSAL<br>President Bush's campaign to reform the Social Security system has increased public attention to the issue in the past month. Seven in 10 Americans have now heard at least some about Bush's proposal to change Social Security (including one in five who have heard a lot), a jump of 31 points from 37 percent just a month ago. <br> HEARD ABOUT BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSAL<br>A lot<br>Now<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="42" height="10"> 21%1/2005<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="26" height="10"> 13% <br> Some<br>Now<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="94" height="10"> 47%1/2005<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="48" height="10"> 24% <br> Not much<br>Now<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="40" height="10">20%1/2005<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="64" height="10"> 32% <br> Nothing<br>Now<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="22" height="10"> 11%1/2005<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="38" height="10"> 19% <br> But support for Bush's plan to partially privatize the Social Security system remains low. 43 percent now think allowing individuals to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes themselves is a good idea, the lowest level of support for partial privatization since this poll began asking the question four years ago. 51 percent.% now say it is a bad idea. <br> ALLOWING PEOPLE TO INVEST THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES IS:<br>Good idea<br>Now 43%1/2005 45%1/2002 54%6/2001 48% <br> Bad idea<br>Now 51%1/2005 50%1/2002 39%6/2001 46% <br> Support for privatization drops even lower when people are asked to consider some possible consequences.

The most popular option, supported by 61 percent, would raise the $90,000 limit on income subject to Social Security tax withholding. 49 percent support raising the percentage of income that is withheld for Social Security, but nearly as many oppose that option. More people favor both of those options than think Bush's proposed personal investment accounts are a good idea. In addition, a majority opposes making Social Security a voluntary option, and 77 percent oppose raising the retirement age. <br> OPTIONS FOR CHANGING SOCIAL SECURITY<br>bRaising $90,00 income limitFavor 61%Oppose 31% <br> Raising percentage withheld<br>Favor 49%Oppose 46% <br> Making Social Security voluntary<br>Favor 37%Oppose 59% <br> Raising retirement age<br>Favor 19%Oppose 77% <br> Raising the retirement age was also given a thumbs-down in 1981, another time when Social Security was part of the national discussion, but it was more popular then than it is now; 39 percent were willing to raise the retirement age from 65 to 68. Making Social Security voluntary was also more popular in 1981 than it is now, and in fact a majority of 53 percent supported it, while 41 percent opposed it in 1981. Attitudes toward raising the percentage withheld were similar to current views; in 1983 49 percent favored that option, while 42 percent opposed it. <br> EVALUATING THE PRESIDENT'S VIEWS ON SOCIAL SECURITY'S SOLVENCY <br>President Bush has said that Social Security is facing a funding crisis and will be bankrupt by the year 2042 if changes are not made. Most Americans agree with this, and think Social Security will be bankrupt by 2042 unless changes are made. However, there is no agreement as to what "bankruptcy" means in this context. <br> 63b percent agree with the President that the Social Security system will be bankrupt by the year 2042. Just a quarter says it won't be. <br> WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE BANKRUPT BY 2042?<br>Will	<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="126" height="10"> 63%		Will not	<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="50" height="10"> 25%		 <br> These views transcend party lines. Seniors age 65 or older are the only age group in which a majority does not think the system will be bankrupt by 2042: 38 percent of seniors thinks it will be, but 34 percent say it won't. <br> When asked what they think Bush means when he talks about Social Security going bankrupt by 2042, 40 percent think the talk of bankruptcy means that Social Security will have to pay reduced benefits to retirees because it won't be collecting enough money to pay full benefits. But even more, 47 percent, think the President means the federal government will not be able to pay any Social Security benefits by then because it will have no money at all. <br> WHAT DOES BUSH MEAN WHEN HE SAYS SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT?<br>The government will have to reduce benefit payments	<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="80" height="10"> 40%The government will not be able to pay any benefits <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="94" height="10"> 47% <br> THE PUBLIC'S VIEWS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM <br>Americans say the Social Security system has worked well in the past, but there is concern about whether benefits will be there for them. Most believe a new system is needed for the next generation's retirees. While a majority thinks the problems with Social Security need to be addressed now, few say the system is in a financial crisis today. <br> As they have for many years, about half the public do not think Social Security will have enough money available to provide them with the benefits they expect for their retirement. <br> WILL SOCIAL SECURITY PROVIDE YOU WITH RETIREMENT BENEFITS?<br>Yes<br>Now 34%1/2002 34%3/1995 35%1/1983 27%6/1981 30% <br> No<br>Now 49%1/2002 46%3/1995 53%1/1983 58%6/1981 54% <br> Americans do think the system has worked successfully until now. 33 percent think the current Social Security program is a success and should be continued more or less as it exists now. 61 percent of Americans describe the Social Security system as a successful government program that has worked well up until now, but that a different system is necessary to meet the needs of the next generation. Just 3 percent say Social Security has been an unsuccessful program and should be ended. Those who worry that Social Security will not provide them with benefits are especially likely to think a new program will be needed for future generations. <br> OVERALL EVALUATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY:<br>Successful, should continue 33%			Successful, but need new program for future 61%Not successful, should be ended 3% <br> Change is less welcome among those living in households currently receiving Social Security (most of whom are 65 and over). 47 percent of this group says Social Security is a successful program that should continue in its current form, compared to 28 percent of those living in households that do not yet receive Social Security. <br> While Americans admit there are serious problems with Social Security, most do not think the program is currently in a financial crisis. Just 16 percent describe Social Security as being in a crisis today, and 46 percent think the program is now in serious trouble financially. Another 32 percent say Social Security is in some trouble, and 5 percent think the system is not in any trouble. <br> Looking ahead, 37 percent think the Social Security program will reach a crisis in 10 to 20 years. 45 percent think it will be in crisis forty years from now. <br> SOCIAL SECURITY'S FINANCIAL SITUATION:<br>In crisis<br>Now 15%In 10-20 years 37%In 40 years 45% <br> Serious trouble<br>Now 46%In 10-20 years 31%In 40 years 45% <br> Some trouble<br>Now 32%In 10-20 years 24%In 40 years 18% <br> Not in trouble<br>Now 5%In 10-20 years 4%In 40 years 4% <br> Americans do think Social Security's problems need to be addressed now. 55 percent say the problems with Social Security are so serious they need to be fixed now, while 35 percent say the problems are serious but do not need to be fixed for another 10 to 15 years.

Republicans are more likely than Democrats or Independents to say that the financial situation of Social Security is in serious trouble today -- 54 percent do -- compared to 40 percent of Democrats and 45 percent of Independents. However, few Americans of any party call it a "crisis": only 15 percent of Republicans, 17 percent of Democrats and 14 percent of Independents do so. <br> Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (65 percent) think personal accounts are generally a good idea, compared to just 31 percent of Democrats and 37 percent of Independents. 30 percent of Republicans think such personal accounts would improve Social Security's financial situation -- while that is still less than half, it is higher than the 17 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of Independents who think so. <br> THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE <br>Currently, the Social Security system takes some of the contributions made by higher income people and uses them to help pay benefits for poorer people. 43 percent of Americans think the program should pay its benefits this way, but a slightly higher number -- 47 percent -- think Social Security should pay out benefits based solely on the contributions made by retires while they were working. These views are similar to what they were back in 1981, when a national commission was created to reform Social Security. <br> SOCIAL SECURITY SHOULD PAY BENEFITS<br>Based only on contributions of retirees<br>Now 47%6/1981 47% <br> By taking some contributions of better-off people and giving them to poorer people<br>Now 43%6/1981 37% <br> Americans in higher income categories are more likely than those earning less to say Social Security payments should be based solely on the contributions of retirees. 59 percent of Republicans think Social Security payouts should be based only on the contributions of retirees, while 44 percent of Democrats think the same. <br> But most Americans think the government has a responsibility to provide a decent standard of living for the elderly in this country. 79 percent agree this should be a responsibility of the government; only 17 percent say it is not the government's job to do this. <br> SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE A DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE ELDERLY?<br>Yes <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="158" height="10"> 79%No <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="34" height="10"> 17% <br> Women are more likely than men to say the government has a responsibility to care for the elderly. 90% of liberals say the government should provide a decent standard of living for America's elderly, as do 66% of conservatives. <br> ATTITUDES BY AGE<br>The Problem<br>Majorities in all age groups feel that the Social Security system has worked well in the past, but that next generation will need a very different kind of program for their retirement. So do about 7 in ten of those for whom retirement is some years away. Only about one in four of those under age 45 see Social Security as a successful program that should continue as it is for the next generation.

 This column from The Weekly Standard was written by Stephen Moore.<hr width="75%">When President Bush hinted last week that he might be willing to raise the payroll tax cap to "pay for" Social Security reform, he opened the door to the largest federal tax increase endorsed by a Republican since George Bush Sr.'s "read my lips" debacle 15 years ago. <br> The 12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax is now levied only on the first $90,000 a worker makes each year. What President Bush said was that raising the cap (to perhaps $125,000 or even $200,000) was "on the table." This was a strategic blunder of the first order. Now even the strongest advocates of Social Security personal accounts are wondering what hefty price will have to be paid to enact them. And while this move was seen as a tactical device by the White House to keep the Social Security debate moving forward, in fact it is a serious setback. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and others in the Republican leadership in Congress have rightly declared that any tax hike to "pay for" Social Security reform is dead on arrival, especially in the more conservative House. <br> Bush may gain a few Democratic votes by agreeing to raise taxes, but it appears he would lose far more Republicans in the bargain. In other words, this proposal is a net subtraction of votes for personal accounts.Worse yet, by talking of higher taxes in exchange for Social Security reform, the White House is only reinforcing the concern among House Republicans in tough districts that this debate could become a Republican version of HillaryCare, with its subsequent decimation of Democrats in the 1994 midterm elections. Tinkering with Social Security is a tough enough vote for Republicans, let alone doing so while raising taxes at the same time. <br> A quick glance at George W. Bush's governing style during his first term reveals that whenever he reaches out to congressional Democrats, the result has been legislation that maims taxpayers and divides the Republican party down the middle. That is what happened with the ill-fated $1 trillion Medicare prescription drug fight of 2003. Conservatives split off from the president, and enough moderate Democrats gave Bush the margin for "victory." <br> The term "victory" is in quotation marks because it is now universally acknowledged that the prescription drug bill is a fiscal time bomb, with the costs already exploding in the 18 months since it was passed. <br> An even more ominous analogy is the No Child Left Behind education bill. This passed in 2001 with lots of Democratic votes, including support from Ted Kennedy. The education bill ended up massively expanding education spending, and it sanctified the federal presence in school policy. Worst of all, the one desired conservative feature, school choice, was excised in the process. <br> The danger now is that Bush, who wants a legacy "victory" on Social Security, will ultimately sign a Social Security bill that raises taxes and drops or guts personal accounts. On Social Security, Bush is arguing for less bureaucracy and more individual financial choice, and those are attractive concepts, particularly to young voters. Polls reveal consistently that the public understands that the Social Security system needs to be modernized (though they reject the term "crisis") and that those who argue for doing nothing (most of the Democratic party leadership) are the enemies of progress. Bush got a huge boost this week from Alan Greenspan, who acknowledged (1) that Social Security's finances are in desperately poor condition, and (2) that private accounts can be very beneficial to young workers. But Bush's talk of higher taxes stepped on that helpful headline. <br> Talk of raising taxes as part of a pro-freedom reform scrambles the underlying message and divides the natural allies of personal accounts. Self-employed workers are big winners under any private investment account system, because currently 12.6 percent of what they earn up to $90,000 is sliced right off the top of their take-home pay. That's roughly $11,000 a year if they make $90,000 or more. If the cap were raised, say, to $125,000, these same workers would be big losers, with their Social Security tax rising to some $15,500 a year (and this doesn't even count the $3,700 a year they pay in the Medicare payroll tax). <br> Raising the cap would have two effects. First, the payments of higher-income workers would be so out of proportion to any eventual benefits as to make a mockery of the long-held notion that Social Security is an insurance program and that the tax payments are individual "contributions" into a trust fund for one's own retirement. Ironically, it has been liberal Democrats, arguing against the creation of personal accounts, who have made this case most vociferously. <br> Raising the payroll cap would convert Social Security into an overt income redistribution program. Higher income people would pay an inordinate amount of payroll tax in order to subsidize the pensions of low income workers. If Social Security is to be made into a welfare program, then it should be done on an honest and much less economically destructive basis simply by cutting the benefits of wealthy seniors, rather than hiking marginal tax rates while they are still working, which destroy economic incentives to work and invest. <br> It may seem fair to raise payroll taxes on higher income workers. But in many high-cost states, an income of between $90,000 and $150,000 a year is anything but rich. In states like California and New York, many school teachers, computer technicians, construction contractors, and medical assistants earn more than $90,000 a year, especially if they log overtime. <br> The rich already do pay the lion's share of federal taxes through the personal income tax. The latest Tax Foundation data reveal that the wealthiest 10 percent of earners already pay almost two-thirds of the income tax. And because we have an Earned Income Tax Credit that essentially refunds to low-income families the money they pay in payroll taxes, even the payroll tax system is much more progressive than is commonly understood. <br> The suggested payroll tax hike is politically perverse, given that its principal impact would be to cancel out one of George W. Bush's primary policy victories in his first term, namely, the income tax cuts. Bush went to the mattresses to reduce income tax rates by about 5 percentage points on average. This, in combination with the capital gains and dividend tax cuts, helped spur growth, a stock market rally, and now a jobs boom. But for those in the upper middle income range, lifting the payroll tax would transform a 5 percentage point reduction in tax rates into a net 7 percent hike. <br> The strongest selling point of a personal account system for Social Security is that the current system is a rotten deal for young workers. For workers with incomes of more than $90,000 a year, the program already offers a poor return on the money they pay in to Social Security. The typical worker with earnings of more than $90,000 gets a rate of return from Social Security that is around 1 percent. Raising the payroll tax cap tells these workers that they would now get an even tinier rate of return, because they would be forced to pay more in for the same promised payout. Republicans should be arguing for a better deal for all workers. <br> George W. Bush is desperate to secure at least token Democratic party support for his historic Social Security modernization plan. He wants Social Security reform -- and especially the implementation of personal accounts -- to be the crown jewel of his domestic policy legacy. But any reform bill that raises taxes to win the support of Ted Kennedy or Nancy Pelosi likely will be much worse than no bill at all. <br> <b>Stephen Moore is president of the Free Enterprise Fund. <br> By Stephen Moore 
 This column from the American Prospect was written by Robert Gordon.<hr width="75%">During the second presidential debate last year, George W. Bush ventured that "the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it." Democrats mocked President Bush, but education has always been critical for a president who asks voters to "sense my heart." It is the only major issue on which he reached across the political aisle -- all the way to Senator Ted Kennedy -- to forge a broad consensus for reform. That's why it's sad now to see Bush eviscerating that consensus and empowering reform's critics. Monday's budget is the latest bad sign. <br> Bush's approach to education marks a striking shift for Republicans. In the 1990s, when then-House speaker Newt Gingrich tried to abolish the Education Department, the GOP had looked hard-hearted. Much as President Bill Clinton moderated a party's soft image by promoting welfare reform, President Bush sweetened a party's tough tone with a Clintonian new deal on education: The federal government would offer record support for schools, but it would demand record returns through high standards, tough tests and real remedies for schools that don't measure up. <br> In important ways, Bush's good politics made for good policy, too. The education reform law isn't perfect, but it codifies a national commitment extraordinary at any time but particularly from a Republican: Every child, regardless of race or poverty, will have the basic skills to participate in our economy and democracy. The law says that we will set high standards, and we will measure our success in meeting those standards. Liberals, like Ted Kennedy, stood with Bush for good reason. <br> During his first term, Bush honored at least some of the bargain. He didn't propose the funding authorized by the new law, but he did support sharp growth. Democrats like Senator John Kerry rightly complained that Bush wasn't living up to the deal -- but Bush had a ready response, as in that second debate: "Only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough." <br> The new budget abandons the pretense of funding education increases. Like Gingrich, Bush has now proposed to cut education in nominal dollars. His No Child Left Behind request now falls $12 billion short, fully one-third of the authorization level. Bush has flat-funded the charter schools that his own administration champions. He has flat-funded the after-school and preschool programs that troubled kids need. And he has eliminated promising reforms like breaking up big, weak schools. At the very moment when reform's demands have climbed -- when more schools must allow students to transfer, offer tutoring, or prepare to shut down -- the gap between funding envisioned and funding offered for reform has widened into a chasm. <br> There is one clear loser here: education reform. It's always been a tough sell. Critics on the right have never liked Washington's interference with local schools. Critics on the left have never liked the law's unyielding demands or its treatment of testing as the measure of all things. More schools are now looking up a hill they see little prospect of climbing. <br> Reform's best hope has always been simple: It just has to work. But underfunding fuels critics' worst fears. To take only one example: When states don't have money, they buy lousy off-the-shelf tests. Overburdened teachers boost their students' scores by structuring lessons around the tests instead of teaching more worthwhile material. And then parents fume about "teaching to the test." Much of this problem could be solved with better tests: tests that are connected to high standards; demand more sophisticated knowledge; and require longer answers and challenging essays -- not just penciling in bubbles. But better tests cost billions ($3 billion over five years, according to the Government Accountability Office) that fiscally strapped states don't have and that the president hasn't offered. This new budget means more parents will be angry about high standards when they should be angry about low funding. <br> The budget also undermines the political coalition for reform. Congressman Dick Gephardt captured many liberals' sentiments when he said he supported No Child Left Behind "because it was the only way to get money into public education under a Bush presidency." As the promise of more money evaporates, so too does support. <br> The president's defenders will say that federal dollars make a small contribution to school budgets and that local reform can and should continue even without the new resources. They're right, but that's not the point. Bush's budget makes successful reform that much tougher. The Bush administration found the money to pay off Armstrong Williams. They found the money to pay for the jobs act they really care about: tax cuts for multimillionaires. They should have found the money to pay for their education bill. What gets funded, and what doesn't, says far too much about what's in the president's heart. <br> <br>Robert Gordon is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and served as director of domestic policy for the Kerry-Edwards'04 campaign. <br> By Robert Gordon Reprinted with permission from The American Prospect, 5 Broad Street, Boston, MA 02109.

 This column from the National Review Online was written by Veronique de Rugy.<hr width="75%">As Ronald Reagan said in his 1986 State of the Union speech, "Keeping America strong is as vital to the national security as controlling federal spending is to our economic security." And that's what President George W. Bush says he would like to do with his Fisdal Year 2006 budget. <br> In his budget message he explains: "My Administration is pressing for reforms so that every program will achieve its intended results. And where circumstances warrant, the 2006 Budget recommends significant spending reductions or outright elimination of programs that are falling short." <br> The good news is that this new budget contains proposed cuts and spending restraints reforms that would save about $20 billion in fiscal 2006. The bad news is that the budget proposes to spend more than $2.5 trillion, and the White House never seems willing to stop Congress from adding even more money. <br> President Bush's previous budgets increased spending by a dramatic 33 percent in four years, defense spending increased by 44.7 percent while non-defense spending increased by 41.9 percent. The administration has been arguing that much of the increase in non-defense spending stemmed from higher homeland-security spending. However, the fact is that over half of all new spending in the past two years is from areas unrelated to defense and homeland security. <br> Ideally, the administration and Congress should find significant savings elsewhere in the budget if they want more security spending. Indeed, that's what the FY2006 budget will accomplish, mostly by virtually freezing of non-homeland non-defense spending in order to maintain national defense and cut the deficit in half by 2009. <br> But so much more could be achieved. The portion of the budget Bush wants to restrain, domestic discretionary, represents a ridiculously small portion $389 billion of the $2.5-trillion budget. In other words, the spending limits in the budget are rather meaningless. Until the administration is ready to significantly slash the mandatory side of the budget, its credibility will remain weak. <br> Moreover, planning to cut the deficit in half from to $427 billion in FY2005 to $223 billion by 2009 is a wrong measure of fiscal responsibility. For one thing, Congress and the White House should be focusing on reducing the size of government, not just the part financed by borrowing. Besides, once again this year, the administration has left out important items from its calculation, such as an additional supplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan, which could hit $80 billion. More importantly, the administration's numbers do not include any of the potential transition costs for restructuring Social Security. <br> Moreover, focusing on the deficit will make it harder to make needed policy changes. For instance, omitted from the budget once again this year is a fix for the alternative minimum tax. It also guaranties that the president will have to battle hard to makehis tax cuts permanent and to reform social security. Ironically, some Republicans have been the main opponents to President Bush tax-reform and spending-discipline agenda destroying their reputation as a tough-on-spending party. <br> Members of his own party make president's promises less credible. President Bush's fiscal responsibility relies on extraordinary spending restraint from Congress. This year again, the president assumes that Congress would resist adding spending on top of his budget plan. But the past four years tell us that this is unlikely. After all, this Congress is responsible for a FY2005 omnibus bill jammed with earmarked pork projects, such as $175,000 for Love Social Services in Fairbanks, Alaska, and $250,000 for a traffic-calming program in Windermere, Florida. It is also responsible for adding billions of dollars in spending to the President's proposed budget each single year up to $67 billion in FY2004. Finally, despite promises to control the growth in federal spending and to fix the budget process, the House Republican Conference rejected sensible measures to curb spending and reform the budget process earlier this year. <br> Congress is addicted to pork and to spending increases, and this is unlikely to be cured without a dramatic change in behavior by the White House. Even though it would be hard, it certainly could be done. In the 1980s, President Reagan signaled that things were about to change in Washington by asserting that "I am going to do a lot of vetoing. Any time there is an attempt to bust the budget, I will veto." And in November 1981 he fulfilled his promise with action and vetoed the congressional budget legislation for adding too much spending to his proposed budget. <br> Likewise, President Bush should veto any bill that spends too much money, something he has not done since taking office. The fact that the president failed to veto this year and last year's omnibus bills does not help his credibility as a fiscally responsible leader. And, of course, that makes it less plausible that he will fight for his proposed 150 program cuts, most of which are targeted at programs that are popular with Congress. <br> What also makes the president's 150 cuts less credible is a look at last year's proposed cuts. Recall that a year ago the White house targeted 65 programs such as Alcohol Abuse Reduction and Literacy Programs for Prisoners to save roughly $5 billion. But in the end, Congress terminated only five of them saving a total of $292 million. Yet President Bush did not even threaten to reach for the veto pen. To his credit though, he was not discouraged by his failure and this year even escalated by proposing up to $20 billion cuts in various areas of the budget including health, education, veterans' services, environmental protection, community development and even Amtrak subsidies. Sadly, House and Senate leaders have already told the White House that no more than two dozens of the 150 cuts are likely to be accepted. <br> Finally, the White House proposes that funding for the Pentagon be increased by 4.8 percent and homeland security spending by about 3 percent. These outlays are certainly justified because of external threats. However, we should not forget that these two areas are not impervious to wasteful spending. To the administration's credit, it plans to cut major defense programs along with some costly weapons programs. But shouldn't the administration also use that external threat to cut waste in the Pentagon more aggressively? <br> The good news is that in spite of all these criticisms, if the administration backs up this budget promises by firm actions, including vetoes, it could be the turning point toward much needed fiscal responsibility. <br> <b> Veronique de Rugy is a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. <br> 	 By Veronique de Rugy Reprinted with permission from National Review Online

 This column from the National Review Online was written by David Frum. <hr width="75%">Double or nothing: that was the theme of the president's dazzling speech. Bold, bold, bold -- bold on social security reform, bold on controlling the growth of government, bold on legal and tax reform, bold in daring to mention nuclear energy, bold on social issues including marriage, bold on judges, and bold on foreign policy and the war on terror. Minutes before the beginning of the speech, new National Security Adviser Steve Hadley announced that he had promoted Elliot Abrams as one of his deputies -- Abrams being one of the administration's strongest and most consistent advocates of American strength and the expansion of freedom worldwide. <br> The speech was long, but not wordy: Its power came not from poetic flourishes, but from the clarity of its message and the firmness of its purpose. And yet the speech was not uncompromising or harsh. Without trimming his conservative principles, the president reaffirmed his commitment to a compassionate approach to AIDS, poverty, and gang violence, and he affirmed a renewed national commitment to defendants in death penalty cases. <br> Like his first three states of the union, but unlike his fourth, this speech was superbly focused. It was not weighted down with secondary and tertiary initiatives, slipped in by adroit bureaucrats or by poll-minded politicos. There was no striving for effect, no purple passages. It's too often assumed that flowery rhetoric is powerful rhetoric. The reverse is more like it. A determined message delivered in clear, unmistakable words packs more punch than a namby-pamby message wrapped in fine phrases. <br> The president left no doubt that Social Security will be his supreme priority in this second term - and this is as it should be. Nothing this president can do at home will have longer and more profound consequences than the creation of ownership accounts. Tax changes come and go: The great tax reform of 1986 was undone in part in 1991 and then again in 1993 and was very nearly unraveled altogether by the year 2000. But the conversion of the unreliable promises of a state pension system into the solid reality of assets in your own hands, protected by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Bush directly challenged the Democrats' trust-fund myth - the idea that the system will be okay into the 2040s because the Congress has written a lot of IOUs to itself. And he framed the issue exactly correctly: as one of character and courage against self-delusion and cowardice. <br> Abroad, the president sent a strong message to the axis of evil and its cadet member, Syria. He expanded the issue with Iran from its weapons to its oppressive theocracy - and returned to the promise he made in 2002 to stand with the Iranian people against the unelected few who oppress them in the name of religion. <br> Gently and flatteringly, Bush served notice on Egypt and Saudi Arabia that they must move toward democracy - and to the Palestinians that they must move away from terrorism. He offered a cogent, credible and convincing account of the connection between tyranny and terror. <br> On Iraq, the president again underscored the grand difference between him and his Democratic critics: They want an exit strategy - he insisted on a victory strategy. "We are in Iraq to achieve a result: a country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned." And not before. <br> Ever since Ronald Reagan invented the tradition, every State of the Union has had its moments of emotion. All too often in the past, these moments were cynically manipulative or unworthy of the high importance of the event. Not tonight. The stories of Safia Taleb al-Suhail and Byron Norwood represented the outermost limits of human courage, suffering, and sacrifice in the public realm. <br> Michael Barone has aptly compared the Bush presidency to a pulsar: a star that goes dark for long periods and then bursts forth in a sudden spurt of activity. I'll confess: Bush sometimes worries me. There will be periods of weeks or even months when the gravity of government seems to pull him down, when the energy and imagination of the best hours of his government seems to have seeped away. And then there follows a moment like this speech, when this president surges back into action and his government regains its gravity-defying momentum. <br> It won't always be like this of course. But sometimes it is like this. And that's enough to justify all the rest. <br> <b>David Frum is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a contributing editor to National Review, a columnist for Canada's National Post newspaper, and a regular contributor to the Daily Telegraph in Great Britain and to National Public Radio in the United States. <br> By David FrumReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column from The Nation was written by David Corn.<hr width="75%">George W. Bush knows what to do with a bully pulpit. From the days of Thomas Jefferson to those of William Taft, the State of the Union was a written message delivered by presidents to Congress. Woodrow Wilson turned it into a speech. Subsequent presidents used the State of the Union as a high-profile opportunity to promote their political agendas. <br> Bush went beyond that this evening. He produced grand and effective political theater. In the middle of the address, he transformed the war in Iraq -- which even after the historic election there arguably <br> Exploiting the tradition of inviting symbolically significant guests to sit with the First Lady, Bush introduced the mother of a U.S. Marine killed in Fallujah and an Iraqi human rights advocate whose father had been assassinated by Saddam Hussein and who had voted in Sunday's election. With the House chamber awash with emotion, the two women hugged. Bush was near tears. Members of Congress -- perhaps including those legislators who had dyed their index fingers purple for the event -- were crying. <br> In a nutshell, here was Bush's story of sacrifice, liberty and freedom. Sentiment -- sincere sentiment -- was in full synch with spin. The not-too-hidden partisan message: Match that, you naysayers. This was a triumph of political communication. And it was a reminder that despite the apparent difficulties Bush faces in his top-priority effort to partially privatize Social Security, he should hardly be counted out. This man does what it takes. <br> Bush's approval ratings have been low, but in the aftermath of the Iraqi elections, he approached this speech as a conquering hero -- a vindicated hero. <br> There was, of course, no mention of Iraq's (nonexistent) weapons of mass destruction. No recognition that America's standing in the world has fallen to an all-time low. No acknowledgment that the administration had failed to plan adequately for the post-invasion period. Bush has not a bashful bone. For him, the Iraqi election was a signal (from God?): full steam ahead. <br> He did not shy away from the freedom-is-our-mission rhetoric of his inaugural speech, which was widely criticized for being cynically unrealistic. Bush declared, "America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world." And he named names, calling upon Saudi Arabia and Egypt, two autocracies long supported by Washington, to move toward democracy. Certainly, he -- or Condoleezza Rice -- might be on the phone tomorrow to Cairo and Riyadh, explaining that Bush does not expect immediate action. <br> Nevertheless, such words probably will provide encouragement to democracy activists in those countries and in others. These people, though, should keep in mind that Bush's father -- who clearly is no role model for his son -- egged on the Shiites in Iraq at the end of the Gulf War and then did not come to their rescue when they were slaughtered. <br> Bush also showed he has not lost his appetite for regime change and muscle-flexing. He warned Iran to abandon any pursuit of nuclear weapons, vowing that America will stand with Iranians who seek liberty. He placed Syria in the crosshairs. There was no reference to the "axis of evil," but Bush did move Syria ahead of North Korea in the you-better-worry-next category. <br> This president does not back down. Perhaps that's why he won in November. <br> He repeated his assertion that Iraq "is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq, so we don't have to face them here at home" U.S. forces in Iraq, according to the U.S. military, are mostly fighting Baathists who had no intention of attacking the United States "at home" prior to the invasion. But Bush sticks to his talking points. And he again pledged to stay in Iraq for as long as necessary, while maintaining "we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces." Without referring directly to his critics, he dismissed calls for establishing any exit plan with language that was noble: "We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: A country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned." <br> Bush did not denounce his opponents; he cut back on the references to God. But he invoked FDR and the power of the American dream, comparing his project in Iraq to the abolition of slavery, the liberation of Europe, and the defeat of imperial communism. He was riding high on the high road. <br> On domestic matters, the speech was mostly predictable. He praised his tax cuts and his record on job creation. (The United States has added 2.3 million new jobs in the past year, he said, without disclosing that the economy needs to create about 2 million jobs a year to keep up with population growth.) He claimed his forthcoming budget would lead to cutting the deficit in half by 2009 -- even though budget analysts have said he is relying upon phony numbers and false assumptions. <br> He said he would increase the size of Pell grants for college students. (He promised to do so last year and did not.) He assailed "junk lawsuits" and asserted that the nation's economic performance was being "held back" by asbestos lawsuits. (Asbestos lawsuits? Who knew that was the problem?) When he made a vague reference to medical savings accounts, Republicans in the chambers applauded more loudly than when he called for a community health center in every poor county. Bush vowed to revive his defeated energy program and called for tax reform -- without stating what changes he'd like to see in the tax code. <br> There were surprises. Throwing red meat to the red-staters, he made a rather big deal of gay marriage, noting he supports a constitutional amendment "to protect the institution of marriage" (note that he didn't say "to ban gay marriage") for "the good of... children." This was a political correction, for Bush had recently peeved social conservatives by saying there was no need to push the antigay amendment since there were not enough votes for the measure in the Senate. And while Bush referred to the "culture of life" and decried activist judges, he said nothing directly about abortion. Can we then presume then he believes gay marriage is a more urgent matter than a practice his supporters compare to mass murder? Bush also addressed the issue of capital punishment: not by calling for more executions but by advocating more extensive use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful convictions and proposing more funding to train defense attorneys who handle capital cases. (Too bad he didn't do that when he was governor of Texas.) He said that Laura Bush would head an initiative to keep young men out of gangs. There was no mention of the mission to Mars that Bush announced in his last State of the Union speech. <br> No doubt, the most anticipated part of his speech was his pitch for messing with Social Security. Bush has dramatically improved his rhetorical case for change. He made it appear he was open to many ideas, and he slyly referred to previous proposals for reform that had come from Democrats. He noted that using current payroll taxes for private retirement accounts for younger workers was not a fix for Social Security but an effort to give those under the age of 55 "a better deal." He did not use the word "crisis," but he did deploy his melodramatic and misleading argument for reform. This created the most interesting political moment of the night. As Bush remarked, "By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt," Democratic legislators shouted, "No, no...." (The Congressional Budget Office has said that come 2052 the Social Security system will only be able to pay about three-quarters of the scheduled benefits. This is a problem; it is not bankruptcy.) As Bush continued in this vein, the Democrats kept up the protest: "No, no, no...." It was reminiscent of question time in the British Parliament. <br> Bush, as could be expected, skated past the difficult questions: how he would pay $2 trillion to cover the shift to private accounts and how much benefits would be cut for workers under the age of 55. He cannot paper over the harsh realities of such a plan. But Democrats ought to be worried. Polling numbers and media coverage of the Social Security fight have given them reason to hope that Bush cannot pull this off. (The day before the speech, CNN's Lou Dobbs exclaimed, "How in the world do you rationalize private accounts, a $2 trillion addition in the ten-year projection across the federal government? None of it makes a lick of sense right now, let's just be honest. There's no crisis, there is no way in the world that this government responsibly could undertake $2 trillion in further debt, and seniors don't want anyone messing with their Social Security.") But Bush demonstrated he is still improving his Social Security shtick. <br> Bush's speech was a success -- for him, that is, not the Union. After all, the State of Bush is just fine. He clearly loves being a crusader for freedom. He has learned how to project passion and what might actually be conviction. (If he doesn't read the newspapers, maybe he doesn't know his Social Security numbers are off.) Sure, close to half of the voters out there are not going to be charmed or persuaded by Bush, however he performs. And much of his rhetoric can be punctured by facts. But he displayed few, if any, political vulnerabilities. Last Election Day offered plenty of reasons for Democrats to worry. This speech provides additional cause for them to fret. <br> Which brings us to the Democratic response. It was middling at best, perhaps awful. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, tried mightily hard to adopt the language of values. He took the folksy route, reminding viewers he had grown up in a small town in Nevada among hard-rock miners. He referred to a 10-year-old boy who recently told Reid that when he grows up he wants to be a senator. This, Reid noted, was evidence that no one has to tell the children of America to dream big dreams. Reid covered all the bases, critiquing Bush's economic policies and pointing out the flaws and dangers of partially privatizing Social Security. But he was not much of a match for a president riding the wave of self-proclaimed victory in Iraq. <br> Still, Reid fared better than House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. She proved that she can read a TelePrompTer without blinking or changing her facial expression. Reid went for the down-home approach. Pelosi was a Stepford Democrat. She expressed no emotion. She did not modulate her speech. She looked like she was reading words written by someone else, not sharing convictions that burn in her soul. Handling the national security portion of the Democratic response, she served up all the usual -- and correct -- criticisms of Bush. But she scored no points. In this arena, delivery counts as much as -- no, make that more than -- substance. On Iraq, she repeated the Kerry plan: accelerate training of Iraqi security forces, rev up the reconstruction, and intensify regional diplomacy. The goal, she said, is a "much smaller American presence" by the next election, which is scheduled for the end of the year. But it was hard to imagine her swaying anyone who wasn't already a Bush-basher. Pelosi looked like she had to be there. Bush looked like he was relishing the moment. Such a difference matters much. <br> Hours before Bush spoke, I received an email for the House Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative members of the House of Representatives. The headline: "House Conservatives React to State of the Union Address." Before Bush had uttered a single word, the conservatives were already praising his speech. "I was encouraged by the president's remarks regarding our need to decrease dependence on foreign sources of oil," declared Rep. Joe Barton of Texas. "As President Bush made clear tonight, freedom is a priceless right," Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida exclaimed. "Whether it is in the form of joyous new voters in Afghanistan and Iraq or in the form of financial freedom here at home through responsible Social Security reform and tax reform, freedom must be promoted and defended." Rep. Phil Gingrey of Georgia also had a boffo review of Bush's address: "President Bush really made the case for bipartisan support on a lot of these issues." Good thing these Republicans are independent thinkers. The email was embargoed until 9:01 EST, a minute after Bush was scheduled to start speaking. <br> <b>David Corn is The Nation's Washington editor and also the "Loyal Opposition" columnist for www.TomPaine.com and www.Alternet.org. <br> By David Corn Reprinted with permission from the The Nation 
 This column from the National Review Online was written by Robert Moran.<hr width="50%">There is a natural level of skepticism that surrounds any big legislative idea. Much of this is founded upon the bedrock of experience and the understanding that it is far easier to stop legislation than it is to finish it. So, it should come as no surprise that a number of people are saying that introducing personal Social Security accounts is not possible in this Congress. After surveying the landscape, I think they're wrong. In fact, I believe personal accounts, if not wholesale reform of the Social Security system, will be achieved in this Congress and quicker than most think. <br> There are six reasons for this: <br> Reason #1: America has changed. Americans are no longer afraid of stock and bonds. They are invested in them. Conservatives understand that this is a transformational time, economically and politically. The combination of employers breaking their social contract with American workers in the 80s and 90s and the popularity of individual investing has made Americans, especially those of a younger generation, see themselves as autonomous economic entities -- free agents, in other words. <br> These free agents and the investor class are well educated about stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. They are not apt to believe claims that personal accounts are tantamount to "gambling." <br> The Democrats think they can fight this battle on the public-opinion terrain of the early 1980s. They are mistaken. Most surveys on the topic have shown majority support for personal accounts. In fact, a recent Washington Post survey conducted shows 55 percent support for personal accounts. Americans, in other words, are already comfortable with the general idea. <br> Reason #2: The president's message on this issue is in line with the central organizing principle of our society -- choice. Republicans have the upper hand on this issue, because they are "pro-choice" in the sense that they want younger workers to have a choice in how they save for retirement. But it's only a choice. No one will force younger workers into a retirement scheme they don't want. They'll be given options. <br> 40 percent of private-account supporters, in a recent CATO survey on the subject, said their primary reason for supporting this policy is that it's their money and they should have a choice in how to save and invest it. Advocates of private accounts will be most successful when they demand that their opponents explain to 20-and 30-something workers why they shouldn't have a choice and why they can't be trusted with their own money. To paraphrase a tired liberal slogan, "my money, my choice." <br> On the other side, the Democrats will mount the "anti-choice" battle and, when not reprising their decades-old rhetoric on the issue, insult younger workers by telling them that they can't be trusted to make good choices for their families. <br> And then there are the political dynamics... <br> Reason #3: The president will mobilize his base on this idea, and the vast majority of Republicans in the House and Senate will vote for it out of fear they could be defeated in a primary if they vote nay. In many ways, the situation will mirror the impeachment debate of the late 1990s. Spineless Republican legislators will approach the issue cautiously, but as their primary voting base takes a firm position, they will cave. Why? Because these legislators will understand that in their gerrymandered districts the biggest threat to their careers isn't one bold vote used against them in the general election, but one errant vote used against them in the primary. <br> The media will again underestimate the campaign the president has launched on personal accounts. They will measure his campaign only by how many Democratic voters he can persuade and not by the far more important metric of how many base voters he will excite. <br> This president, loved as much as Reagan by the grassroots, will make voting against personal accounts as inconceivable on the Republican side as voting for tax increases. The CATO Institute has already found in its survey research that 74 percent of Republicans favor private accounts. Bush's State of the Union speech, his campaigning on this issue and talk radio will only cement this belief among Republicans. I expect this number will eventually climb to 90 percent among Republicans, inflating national support levels. <br> This rallying process is already beginning. As a result of their White Sulfur Springs retreat last weekend, Republican members of Congress are already coming Bush's way. And, the president seems determined to take his message on the road, with a special emphasis on vulnerable 2006 Senate Democrats. <br> Reason #4: Cautious Republican legislators will eventually come to their senses and realize that the downside risk of support for personal accounts is minimal. The vast majority will, upon reflection, realize that they are in safe seats. And those that are not in safe seats will have already walked themselves through Reason #3. <br> Reason #5: When moderate, red-state Democrats grasp that the GOP is united on this issue and that it is likely to pass, they will choose self-preservation over ideological purity and cave. Why, they will ask, should they get wiped out in 2006 over a vote their party is going to lose anyway? When these Democrats see that the GOP is hanging together, they'll plead with their leadership not to obstruct a vote and give their opponents a 2006 turnout tool. <br> Reason #6: Never underestimate the political allure of "being for what's gonna happen." Some ambitious Democrats will read the handwriting on the wall and decide that it is far better for their political careers to be maverick Democrats on the side of the investor class than doctrinaire liberals opposed to personal accounts. The calculus is simple. Democrats with their eyes on higher office will know that a future thatallows personal Social Security accounts is a future where roughly 30 percent to 40 percent of voters have personal Social Security accounts. They won't want to see their 2008, 2012, or 2016 political ambitions destroyed by attack ads criticizing them for opposing accounts that will be commonplace in the future. In fact, they will reason that the act of defiance they take by voting for personal accounts in 2004 may, like a vote for Gulf War I, be a legitimizing vote in a far off presidential election. <br> Summary: Skeptics are right to point out the difficulties of passing major legislation. But, the man and the moment appear to be aligned for personal accounts to become a reality. The president has a number of important factors in his favor and he'll leverage each of them to maximum benefit. <br> <b>Robert Moran is a vice president at Republican polling firm Fabrizio, McLaughlin Associates.

 This column from The American Prospect was written by Rob Garver.<hr width="75%">Republicans in the House and the Senate, led by President Bush, are making an all-out push to convince the American people that Social Security is in such a severe crisis that only drastic and immediate action can save it from financial oblivion. After the president finishes his State of the Union address on Wednesday, he's expected to go on the road, touting his Social Security reform agenda across the country. <br> He'll be doing this in part to drum up support among wavering Republican legislators, such as Oregon Senator Gordon Smith, who have been lukewarm in their public statements about the administration's plan to partially privatize Social Security. Hopefully when the president speaks to people across the country, he'll be a little more honest in his tactics than some of his fellow Republicans have been. <br> One of the loudest voices in support of the president has been Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum's. Santorum has been traveling around his home state with a PowerPoint-type slide show about the history and future of Social Security. The same presentation was, until recently, also available on Santorum's Senate Web site. <br> The slide show paints a grim picture of a system that is headed for collapse -- and is taking the U.S. economy with it. The Social Security Trust Fund, for instance, is not truly "solvent" because it is "filled with I.O.U.'s," the presentation warns. The fund "do(es) not hold resources to pay benefits," and faces a real problem in figuring out how to "translate I.O.U.'s into cash benefits." <br> Anyone watching Santorum present the slide show would likely think that he or she was seeing a product of the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA seal is prominently displayed above the image of a Social Security card, which also appears in several other places throughout the 46-page document. <br> Trouble is, the SSA had nothing to do with the presentation. <br> "This is not ours, and we did not provide it to them," said Social Security Administration spokesman Mark Hinkle, adding that he had not seen the presentation before it was forwarded to him by a reporter last week. "Some of the facts are from the Social Security Administration's Web site, or the Social Security trustees' report," he said, but added that the document's heavy dose of spin "reflects the view of Senator Santorum." <br> "Obviously, we would rather not have our logo on it," said Hinkle. "I think it is understood that using the logo gives it a different connotation than we would like. We wouldn't want any outside group using our logo, whether it be a congressman, a think tank, or other group." <br> Asked if the SSA had asked Santorum's staff to stop using its logo in Social Security presentations, Hinkle said, "I think they understand that. Yeah." "The slide show was compiled by Senator Santorum's staff, for the senator to utilize in educating Pennsylvanians on Social Security at town-hall meetings," said Santorum press secretary Christine Shott on January 28. "It was not a product of the Social Security Administration." <br> Regarding the appearance of the Social Security administration logo on the front page, Shott said, "When presenting it to individuals at town-hall meetings and for people to be viewing, it was used on the front of the slide show. It was not meant to say that this was a document of the Social Security Administration." <br> While the slide show may have confused some retirees in Altoona, it was immediately considered suspect by economists familiar with the facts of the Social Security debate. <br> "This is a political tract, and the Social Security Administration has a long tradition of some level of independence," said economist Len Burman, co-director of the joint Urban Institute/Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "Their analysis is considered to be very credible, and is based on staff analysis, not politics." <br> Others were more blunt. <br> "After a few slides I concluded very quickly that it was a crock," said Economic Policy Institute economist Max Sawicky, who first uncovered the Santorum presentation on his blog, MaxSpeak. "You wouldn't expect language that loose to come out of the Social Security system." <br> Both economists took particular exception to the characterization of the trust fund being "filled with I.O.U.'s." <br> Burman, a former Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration, said that characterizing the debt obligations of the federal government as "just an IOU" is misleading. "It is just wrong to say they are only slips of paper," Burman said, noting that the trust fund's holdings are U.S. Treasury bills -- the same sort of assets that provide a bedrock capital foundation for most U.S. banks and other financial institutions. <br> If Treasury bills are not actually worth the value the markets have placed on them, he said, we're all in big trouble. The attempt to use the "specter of political insolvency" to frighten people about the future of the system, Burman added. It's unlikely Congress will decide not to honor Treasury debt. In fact, as he said, it's "outside the realm of political reality." <br> After hearing from reporters last week, Santorum staffers shut down a link to the senator's presentation. But Sawicky has helpfully archived it here. <br> <b>Rob Garver is a writer who lives in Springfield, Virginia.

Bush, speaking to the nation in his second inaugural address, chose not to face directly the one topic which is so closely tied to his chances for success in a second term, not to mention his historical legacy. <br> Mr. Bush spoke about "the force of human freedom" and the great objective of ending tyranny." He spoke of "A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this causein the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacythe idealistic work of helping raise up free governments" He did note "Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that have honored their whole lives." <br> But the President did not mention Iraq by name. Neither did he refer to Afghanistan, another country that American troops invaded to overthrow the Taliban regime and where Americans lost lives. "Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon." What else besides Iraq and Afghanistan could he be referring to? <br> Lofty rhetoric in an inaugural address is fine and clearly has historical precedent. That does not mean, however, you can ignore the skunk in the room. And for all its pomp and ceremony this week's inauguration did have an unwanted distraction: the ongoing war in Iraq. <br> That simple fact was made all too plain earlier in the week when Condoleezza Rice, the president's nominee and a shoe-in to be the next Secretary of State, faced two days of squirm-in-your-seat questioning before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during her confirmation hearings. <br> Many Democrats and Republicans on the committee urged Rice to admit mistakes were made in what they saw as a faulty decision-making process during the run up to the Iraq war. The closest Rice came was acknowledging that among the many decisions the administration had to make, "some of them have been bad decisions, I'm sure." <br> This nation has many problems, foreign and domestic, which need to be addressed including some Mr. Bush has said he wants to take on, like Social Security and tax reform. But nothing needs fixing more than the mission in Iraq. <br> Upcoming elections scheduled for Jan. 30 hold a promise of positive movement toward establishing a democratic government there to replace the tyranny of Saddam Hussein's regime. However, this outcome is not at all assured and the insurgents who have caused so much death in their stubbornly fierce opposition to what they see as American occupation continue their daily attempt to derail the Bush administration's goal. <br> Mr. Bush said, "All the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel and we depend on your help." There are plenty of foreign officials one can almost hear muttering about their counsel going unheeded before the Iraq war, leading many major allies to withhold the help Mr. Bush now says he depends on. <br> "We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people," Mr. Bush said in his speech. Is that a message intended for Russia's Putin, or China's Hu or Cuba's Castro? <br> Today is a new start for the Bush administration and sometime next week, when Rice becomes Secretary of State Rice, she will find a long line of foreign leaders eagerly waiting to see what the president really meant. 
 This column from National Review Online was written by Jay Nordlinger.</i>From the perspective of 2005, the year 2000 seems very distant. We had a presidential campaign that year, the squeakingest in our history. The election took place on November 7, but was not resolved until December 12. Five weeks later, George W. Bush was sworn in as the 43rd president. <br> Mr. Bush -- the governor of Texas -- ran principally as a reform candidate. He was for reforming basically everything: education, the tax code, the military, health care, Social Security. This last was known as "the third rail of American politics." The governor's opponents -- and some of his friends -- warned that he would be fried on this rail. But the governor persisted, saying, "I'm runnin' for a reason." <br> Governor Bush also campaigned as a "compassionate conservative," a term that set many conservatives' teeth on edge. These conservatives took it as a slap. Sen. Phil Gramm, the governor's fellow Texas Republican, said memorably, "Freedom is compassionate!" President Bush likes to define "compassionate conservatism" as the belief that "government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives." <br> Throughout the 2000 campaign, the governor spoke repeatedly of a "humble" presidency, the need for "humility" in the world. He pointed to a quieter period. Events would have a mind of their own. <br> President Bush's first Inaugural Address provides interesting reading today -- interesting in light of what the president is trying to accomplish in what we know as the War on Terror. <br> America's "story," said President Bush on January 20, 2001, "is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slaveholding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer." <br> Some moments later, he said, "Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations." <br> Later on, "Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty, because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small." Ponder that! <br> And, "We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors." <br> On the domestic front, the president made a (characteristically) bold declaration: "We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent." Notice that this concept of "sparing" recurs. One does hard work now, allowing future generations to breathe a little easier. <br> In his first term, the president did pretty much what he wanted on education, and he cut taxes energetically, promising something more like structural reform in the second term. Medicare, he expanded, to the consternation of some in his party, but with an eye toward what he calls "the ownership society": New "health savings accounts," for example, would give people greater say in their own care. An attempt at Social Security reform, he saved for this second term. <br> In his convention speech last summer, he pressed his goal of an ownership society, linking it to "security, and dignity, and independence."But what of this War on Terror? Again, bluntness: "If America shows uncertainty and weakness... the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch." And, "We know that September 11 requires our country to think differently: We must -- and we will -- confront threats to America before it is too late." <br> Whatever the topic -- in the domestic or the foreign realm -- the theme was freedom. (John Dos Passos, the novelist who was once a Communist, then one of the greatest anti-Communists, published later in his life a collection called "The Theme Is Freedom.") Said the president, "The story of America"-- ah, the story again! -- "is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle, constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our nation's founding commitment is still our deepest commitment: In the world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom." <br> The president and his band like to refer to this presidency as a "transformational" one. Hence -- in the convention speech -- "I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom." <br> The present inauguration is one during wartime, although the War on Terror, to be sure, is a peculiar -- and peculiarly daunting -- kind of war. When we think of such inaugurations, which do we think of? Chiefly Lincoln's second (1865) and Franklin D. Roosevelt's fourth (1945). Lincoln's speech is well known, chiseled on walls, hearts, and minds. It is the one including the famous line, "With malice toward none, with charity for al..." <br> FDR's is less well known, but highly interesting, given our current situation. It was very brief, in part because it was that president's fourth.He began, "We Americans of today, together with our allies, are passing through a period of supreme test. It is a test of our courage -- of our resolve -- of our wisdom -- our essential democracy." <br> "We shall strive for perfection," said the president. "We shall not achieve it immediately -- but we still shall strive. We may make mistakes -- but they must never be mistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral principle." <br> And how about this? "We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other nations far away. We have learned that we must live as men, not as ostriches, nor as dogs in the manger." <br> FDR ended by invoking "the Almighty God," who "has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth." And "He has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world. So, we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way clearly -- to see the way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men -- to the achievement of His will, to peace on earth." <br> Roosevelt, as much as Lincoln, knew when to bend his knee. <br> You recall a statement purporting to be an old Chinese curse: "May you live in interesting times." Cursed or not, we live in interesting times, and the challenge is to make them less interesting and more secure -- more anchored to that blessed duo that Orwell identified as law and liberty. <br> <b>Jay Nordlinger is managing editor of National Review. <br> By Jay NordlingerReprinted with permission from National Review Online

 This Against the Grain commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer.<br><br>What a relief! The Iraqi WMD crisis is over. I feel safer. What about you? <br> This week we learned that the Iraq Survey Group, the outfit that was hunting for Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, quietly stopped looking sometime in January. They didn't find any. Crisis over. <br> Just as some hardcore inconvincibles believe that hundreds of thousands of stolen Democratic votes are hidden somewhere in Ohio, some will forever be sure that Iraqi bio-bombs are hidden in Syria. For the rest of us, for those whose minds haven't clamped shut like growling dogs, there's a simple reality. As Charles Duelfer's report to the CIA back in September found, there were no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons in Iraq. <br> The Bush administrations primary rationale for the invasion was wrong. "Fear of the nonexistent WMD brought us a war," The New York Times editorialized. <br> Yet fear remains a key weapon in this administration's political arsenal. <br> Fear of no Social Security. Fear of torts. Fear of homeland insecurity. <br> This was well illustrated by an observant piece in the Washington Post by Jim VandeHei that analyzed the president's promiscuous use of the word "crisis." <br> For Social Security, President Bush said in a Dec. 20 press conference, the "crisis is here." Senate Democrats, Mr. Bush often says, have created a "vacancy crisis" in the federal judiciary by not confirming his judges. <br> Medical lawsuits have created a "crisis in America" that needs to be repaired by tort reform. VandeHei counted the word "crisis" four times in a speech Mr. Bush made on Jan. 6. <br> This rhetorical and marketing tactic seemed to work in the president's first term. In a century, historians may or may not conclude that the Iraq War helped the planet. But the campaign to go to war will surely go into the disinformation hall of fame. <br> To a lesser degree, the president sold the No Child Left Behind Act as a response to a crisis in education. Tax cuts were a response to an economic crisis. The Patriot Act was a response to a homeland security crisis. <br> In 2002 and 2003, the administration, but especially Attorney General John Ashcroft, was explicitly and repeatedly attacked for manipulating the country's post-9/11 fears. Ashcroft rushed to the cameras with every bust, Tom Ridge told us to get duct tape and bottled water and the color codes of danger changed haphazardly. <br> The rhetoric of crisis is subtler as the second term approaches. <br> Is there a Social Security crisis? Mr. Bush says yes, the Democrats say no. They say the system as is can deliver the promised benefits until at least 2042. And they say minor revenue increases and benefits made soon can safeguard Social Security for much longer. They say the "crisis" is made up so the administration can start experimenting with private Social Security accounts. <br> And THAT, the Democrats say, is a crisis. They believe the administration's proposal to offer optional, voluntary private accounts would start an inexorable avalanche on the slippery slope of privatizing Social Security, of taking away government guaranteed payments to old people. They think it's an evil plot by evil-doers. A crisis. That's their crisis-mongering. <br> On the facts, the Democrats are right to say that Social Security doesn't pose an immediate crisis. But in defining the issues supporting an aging population so narrowly, the Democrats are every bit as disingenuous as the administration. When you put Social Security on top of Medicare, on top of rising medical costs and in the context of a shrinking workforce and expanding elderly population, you have something pretty close to a crisis. But it's not one either party is talking much about. <br> Is there a medical malpractice crisis? Mr. Bush says so. Democrats say that since costs associated with malpractice lawsuits total only about 2 percent of all medical costs, it's silly to scare people into thinking that lawsuits are the main reason why medical bills go up while the quality and convenience of care go down. But if you're a doctor or a patient looking for a doctor in an area where malpractice insurance rates really are skyrocketing, you might be forgiven if you think there's a crisis. <br> Is there a crisis in the federal judiciary? Well, crime rates are going down, and you don't see Mr. Bush sending up fresh nominees that he knows the Senate will instantly confirm, so I guess not. <br> Crisis-mongering and the rhetoric of fear are bipartisan and ancient. <br> But the quiet conclusion of the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq reminds us that this administration acquired its credibility problem the old-fashioned way, it earned it. For the next four years, when you hear that something is a crisis, hold on to your wallet and demand a reality check. <br> E-mail questions, comments, complaints, arguments and ideas to <a href="mailto:grain@cbsnews.com">Against the Grain.

 This column from The Weekly Standard was written by Irwin M. Stelzer.<hr width="75%">This was the year that was It opened with the world angry at America because of its willingness to use the strength of its military, and closes with the world angry at America for its willingness to tolerate the weakness of its currency. Thar's just no pleasin' these folks, as they say in Crawford. <br> This has been a year of reality checks. The Bush administration has been brought face-to-face with the reality of its massive deficits by financial markets that are scrambling to unload dollars, and by a Congress reluctant to tackle Social Security and tax reform until the federal deficit is brought under control. Bush has promised to do just that, but he is also intent on spending what it takes to win the war on terror, and on adding $2 trillion to $5 trillion to the deficit over the next several years in order to cover the transition to his proposed scheme for partial privatization of Social Security. <br> Several industries have also had annoying realities thrust upon them. The airlines now realize, or should, that the problems of the high-cost carriers, with their legacy of pension obligations and staggeringly generous union contracts, cannot be solved by selling more and more seats for less and less, or by bankruptcies that leave the industry with massive excess capacity. A major restructuring, leaving the dinosaurs in its wake, is now in the works. <br> The media is equally unhappy with the reality that hit in 2004. The liberal television networks have seen their market share dwindle as more balanced and more conservative voices attract audiences, and as bloggers provide instant corrections to the slanted stories that have long come from such as Dan Rather and CBS News. Like all fallen monopolists, the liberal networks are blaming everyone but themselves -- audiences are too dumb to appreciate network pundits, conservative cable channels pander to audiences, etc. But the fault lies in themselves; like the airlines, they will linger, but in a shrunken and transformed state. <br> As will America's auto manufacturers. Their reality, circa 2004, is that they simply cannot sell cars unless they discount prices so heavily that profits vary from wafer-thin to nonexistent. Whenever the auto companies tried to end discounting, the showrooms and lots overflowed with unsold inventory. Like the airlines, the auto makers will have to crawl from under the legacy costs of pensions and union contracts that require them to pay their workers whether they have useful work for them or not. <br> Add to the list big pharma. The pharmaceutical companies now confront the reality that their problem is not solely the making of avaricious and unscrupulous trial lawyers, but of their own emphasis on short-term profits, an emphasis which has led them to continue marketing products in the face of increasing signs that they might be dangerous to the users' health. <br> In facing that new reality pharmaceutical companies are not alone. New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer has dusted off some old state statutes, and added a bit of scary muscle to change the way executives in the financial services and insurance industries view their long-standing practices. Spitzer's extra-legal tactics, including insisting on changes in corporate management before proving that any law has been violated, may worry those wedded to the rule of law. But they are probably popular enough to propel him to the New York governor's chair, the seat of such early reformers of corporate America as trust-buster Teddy (Spitzer's personal hero) and regulator Franklin D. Roosevelt -- and you know where they ended up. <br> Nor, have the sports industries escaped the changing reality of 2004. In baseball the records of the stars of the most recent decades seem to have benefited from banned performance-enhancing drugs. This makes the players' union's refusal to allow testing an untenable relic of the day when the heroes of America's young and not-so-young relied on their natural endowments. Congress, its power stemming from its ability to repeal the law that exempts baseball from the antitrust laws -- which allows the teams' owners to reap monopoly profits -- has told the sport to clean up its act or face punitive legislation. <br> Finally, retailers recognized that their reality had changed in 2004. Thanks to Wal-Mart, price has come to matter, driving retailers that compete in that bracket to ever-greater efficiencies if they are to survive to see another Christmas. Some, like K-Mart and Sears, have merged in search of efficiencies, although how two misses can equal one hit is something of a mystery. Others, like Toys 'R' US, will have to quit the game unless they can bring their costs more in line with those of Wal-Mart. <br> Still other merchants are sharpening buying practices and improving inventory control. And many have finally found the formula for parlaying their success in bricks into success with clicks -- traditional retailers learned in 2004 how to use the Internet to their advantage. Or at least some did. <br> Perhaps the most amazing reality of the year now ending is the resilience of the American economy. Despite a recent history which includes a recession that started in the latter days of the Clinton administration, a lethal assault on the country and the attempted destruction of its financial center, a dot-com collapse and rocketing oil prices, 2004 was year in which the economy grew and more than two million new jobs were created. The American economy remains ten times the size of its emerging rival, China. And the mere growth in its wealth creation added as much to world GDP as did the entire booming economies of India and of Brazil. <br> Next week, the year that will be -- a look at 2005. <br> <b>Irwin M.

 This Against the Grain commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer.<hr width="75%">Here's how a perfect storm of bad policy could sink regular taxpayers if the Bush administration gets its way: <br> On the retirement front, the early, hard choices about Social Security and Medicare that could mitigate much harder, much more painful choices down the road are avoided. Instead the administration gets its trophy of limited private accounts and there are no benefits or funding changes now. <br> But those private accounts don't, over time, prove to be an entitlement panacea. In 10 or 20 years, as the actuaries predict, payroll taxes on wage earners go way up and benefits for retirees way down. <br> On the tax front, the administration ignores its stated goal of tax simplification, but attains its covert dream of eliminating taxation on investment income. It "pays" for this, in part, by adding new taxes on employer-paid health benefits and Social Security benefits. <br> These two fronts, in a decade or two, collide when Social Security and Medicare simultaneously start to crash. The only way to keep funding even modest retiree benefits (which are taxed, remember) will be to dramatically increase payroll taxes and income taxes on those poor schlubs who are still working, since corporate taxes and taxes on non-earned income would be long dead. <br> Likely? I don't know. Possible? It certainly is. <br> I would, in fact, argue that it's more likely this typhoon will hit than the one more commonly predicted, especially by Democrats - that Bush will privatize Social Security completely and it will then service only the well-off. <br> I don't think that can possibly happen because of four capital letters - AARP. There is a powerful, permanent lobby that protects Social Security and Medicare. The financing and benefits of the programs will change, but privatization, I think, is for Chicken Little. <br> As for the limited private Social Security accounts, I agree with The Wall Street Journal's veteran writer, David Wessel: "Private accounts alone will not destroy Social Security as we know it, despite claims from some. But private accounts alone won't save Social Security either, despite claims from others." <br> Taxes are different. There is no AARP for wage earners. There is no revolving door of Billy Tauzin's, John Beaux's and Thomas Scully's to lobby for couples making a combined $80,000 a year. The lobby of all lobbies, however, is the one that preserves and protects tax breaks, be they for mortgage deductions, capital gains or llama breeding. <br> The administration has not made it at all clear what it means by "tax reform." It intends to form one those blue-ribbon panels to ponder for a while and then announce a plan sometime in 2005. You probably don't need to worry about it until next Christmas. <br> Despite this president's talk about simplifying the code (they all talk about that), a senior official in a key agency told me he believes the administration's central goal in tax policy is to eliminate taxes on investment income for individuals - that is, dividends, interest and capital gains. <br> My view is buttressed by Jeffrey Birnbaum and Jonathan Weisman, who wrote in the Washington Post on November 18: "The Bush administration is eyeing an overhaul of the tax code that would drastically cut, if not eliminate, taxes on savings and investment, but it is unlikely to try to replace the existing tax code with a single flat income tax rate or a national sales tax, according to several sources familiar with ongoing tax deliberations." <br> The most likely tax reform, or deform, is that the 2001 tax cuts will be made permanent, new cuts for investments will be added, new taxes on health and retirement benefits will be heaped on, the alternative minimum tax will end and deductions for state and local taxes will be eliminated. Project that down the pike to around 2015, add in huge payroll tax hikes to keep Medicare and Social Security going, and there won't be much left in regular paychecks. <br> Sadly, when it comes to reform in the Bush regime, it's probably best to hope for gridlock. <br> E-mail questions, comments, complaints, arguments and ideas to <a href="mailto:grain@cbsnews.com">Against the Grain.

 This column from The American Prospect was written by Jared Bernstein.<hr width="75%">Don't despair, progressives. I bring a message of hope, and it comes from those renowned laboratories of democracy: the states. <br> I just returned from the annual meeting of the Economic Analysis and Research Network, or EARN, as we call it around here. EARN is a collaboration of progressive state-level organizations engaged in research and advocacy, and the message from this year's meeting was crystal clear: If anything good happens, it's going to happen in the states. The Economic Policy Institute helps to run the EARN network, and its director here at EPI is Michael Ettlinger. Michael was kind enough to grant me an interview for this story (translation: I mugged him at the water cooler). <br> Michael's case -- that the states are where the action is -- builds off the contention that the next four years promise to be especially tough here in Washington. Many of the resources of nationally oriented groups will be consumed by pushing back against really bad ideas like social-security privatization and making the tax cuts permanent. It's hard to imagine that we'll be playing much offense. <br> On the other hand, there are some very good ideas -- discussed below -- percolating in the states (and some very bad ones too, of course). Michael argues that these ideas have two potentially important payoffs. First, they can improve the economic fortunes of those they reach. Higher minimum wages, better education, access to health care -- if any public entity can deliver these over the next few years, it's highly unlikely to be the feds. Second, these actions set the stage for a counterattack on the notion that government is nothing but a negative force. (Remember President George W. Bush's assertion that John Kerry's health plan had to be bad news because it came from government? And remember Kerry's staunch -- and disingenuous -- denial that government had anything to do with it?) Mike's hope is that "policies that solve people's problems will be coming from the states." And maybe this can help restore faith in government solutions. <br> Even a brief survey of what's going on in the states is beyond my scope in this context, but here are a few choice examples: <br> Minimum Wages: We all know that Nevada and Florida, two red states, both overwhelmingly voted to raise their minimum wages, even though opponents outspent progressives by at least two to one, and Bush carried both states. And as if to send a message that EARN is on the right track, as I was writing this piece, an e-mail flashed across my screen with the news that the New York State legislature just overrode Governor George Pataki's veto of a higher state minimum; Washington, D.C., also followed suit, with a two-step increase up to $7. If that isn't enough, my 82-year-old Democratic-activist mother called last weekend to ask me if I thought Arizona was ripe for a minimum-wage fight (I couldn't see why not). <br> Health Insurance: On November 2, California came pretty close to passing a "pay or play" health insurance initiative that would have required employers to either provide health coverage for their workers or pay into a state fund to purchase private care for those without employer-provided coverage. The proposition lost 51 percent to 49 percent, as advocates were heavily outspent by business interests. But supporters of the plan are well aware of how close they came, and they will be back -- especially if the number of uninsured in the state continues to climb. <br> It's widely known that the California electorate bucked Bush Administration policy when it voted to invest public dollars in stem cell research. Less well known is that they approved an additional 1 percent tax on income over $1 million in order to fund mental health services for children, adults, and seniors who are either uncovered or whose insurance fails to cover mental health. Raising taxes to fund mental health is not exactly at the heart of Bush's second-term agenda. <br> Unemployment Insurance: Although long-term unemployment remains a significant problem, congressional Republicans have blocked recent efforts to extend UI benefits. At the state level, however, a movement is underway to reshape and update the program to conform to the realities of today's workforce. Twenty states have agreed to count recent earnings when determining eligibility for UI benefits, one of the best ways to increase access among low-wage workers and those with less labor market experience. <br> While Bush's Labor Department was busy reducing the right to overtime pay, more states agreed to provide UI benefits to part-time workers and to those who left their jobs to escape domestic violence. And regarding overtime, several states, led by Illinois, are decoupling from the federal wage and hour laws to preserve overtime rights for the employees who lose under the new federal rules. <br> Some other hot policy areas to watch are paid family and medical leave (the federal version comes without pay), initiatives in early childhood education, economic development, and the type of work supports associated with welfare reform (like subsidized child care). <br> That's the good news. <br> The bad news is that conservative activists are not content merely to control all the branches of the federal government. They're just as active at the state level. Part of their efforts are, of course, digging into deep pockets to fight against all of the above, but they're also proactive. One of their goals is to privatize publicly provided services (including education), but they've also been busy blocking the high road by passing preemption laws on minimum and living wages, identifying certain groups (e.g., temp workers) as ineligible for UI, and -- shudder -- promoting TABOR initiatives (the so-called "taxpayer bill of rights"). These measures typically restrict a state government's ability to raise revenues, regardless of need or circumstance. Colorado passed such a measure in 1992, limiting revenue growth to that of population growth plus inflation and requiring voter approval for any new tax or debt increase. TABOR was, as noted by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities: "...the main reason why...two detailed, 50-state studies in 1999 and 2001 ranked Colorado's finances as among the worst-managed in the country." The measure also left the state unable to enact necessary countercyclical policies to deal with the recent downturn. <br> So yes, in the coming years the states are going to be the laboratories for useful experiments with policies that might solve some of our economic and social problems -- problems likely to be exacerbated by what comes out of Washington. Of course, some labs are staffed by mad scientists, and we'll have to play defense at all levels of government. <br> But our backs won't always be against the wall, and why not use these coming years to figure out what works best? Those lessons can then inform a national progressive agenda that inspires our base and beyond. <br> <b>Jared Bernstein is a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.

 This column from The Weekly Standard was written by Irwin M. Stelzer</i>.President Bush's chances of keeping world financial markets calm while pushing through Social Security and tax reform took a dive last week. Remember: If the president is to succeed in privatizing a portion of the Social Security system, he will have to persuade financial markets that it is safe to run even larger budget deficits, at least for awhile, as between $2 trillion and $5 trillion are diverted from the government pot into private accounts over the next decade. And if he is to reform the tax system by closing loopholes so that overall rates can be reduced, he will have to persuade Congress to take the political risk of creating the inevitable losers. <br> That means the president needs an economic team every bit as powerful and weighty as his foreign policy team. It is not to be. Bush has chosen to reappoint John Snow to the Treasury. Snow has been a loyal foot soldier, willing to travel the world to repeat that America favors both a strong dollar and one set by market forces. Since market forces, such as they are in currency markets, are progressively weakening the dollar, it is unlikely that the secretary fails to see the contradiction in his statement. Such loyal parroting of the White House line has its obvious rewards, but it does not make for credibility of the sort that the administration will need in the coming months. <br> A credibility deficit is not the only problem. Ideas matter in crafting economic policy, and since the departure of Larry Lindsey, few seem to have come to Bush's attention from his economic team. Stephen Friedman, departing from his job as head of the National Economic Council, has been all but invisible. If he has left any major policy ideas behind, word of them has not leaked out. <br> Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, has been in exile since he offered the quite sensible opinion that outsourcing is a good thing, since it improves the competitiveness of American firms. This displeased Karl Rove, who was more concerned about carrying job-short Ohio than having the president's economist teach a course in the virtues of free trade. Mankiw, it will be recalled, has not only said that pension benefits must be cut if the books are to be balanced, but is the author of a leading textbook that teaches, "The most basic lesson about a budget deficit [is]: . . . When the government reduces national saving by running a budget deficit, the interest rate rises, and investment falls." Not the sort of stuff a criticism-averse White House wants to hear as it fights to have its tax cuts made permanent, and revenues siphoned from the Treasury into private retirement accounts. Mankiw will be relieved to return to Harvard, where criticism of the president is not only tolerated, but required for academic advancement. <br> Friedman and Mankiw's departure will be followed shortly by the retirement of Alan Greenspan when his term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board expires in just 13 months. That is both bad and good news, bad because it removes a seasoned hand from the monetary policy controls, good because Greenspan might feel free to abandon studied obscurity in favor of clarity of expression on economic policy matters. <br> The departure of all of these economists, save Snow, presents the president with an opportunity to staff up with people with real ideas -- a conservative free-marketeer who would argue against further expansion of the government might even be found. But a search for ideas does not seem to be the administration's top priority. The president's decision to exclude from tomorrow's White House conclave on economic policy anyone who might raise a dissenting voice, suggests that the meeting is intended more to provide Bush with photo ops than with new ideas on how to cope with the trade and budget deficits, the consequences of the falling dollar and rising interest rates, or continued dangerous reliance on imported oil. <br> Unfortunately, the administration appears to think that Karl Rove, the political genius whose knowledge of every district in Ohio contributed mightily to the president's reelection, can also craft a sensible economic program. The decision to run economic policy "out of Karl Rove's hip pocket," says the Wall Street Journal, "sufficed in the first term when tax cutting was the main policy focus, but it isn't likely to work for another four years Mr. Rove knows a lot, but we doubt he knows how to work out the next Long Term Capital Management failure, much less handle a dollar crisis." <br> But look on the bright side. Bush enters his second term with an economy that is growing at an annual rate of around 4 percent. Inflation is tame, and the dollar's downward movement has so far been more of a drift than a plunge. If past experience is any guide, a cheaper dollar might, just might, bring the trade deficit down to manageable levels. <br> The budget deficit also might be headed in the right direction. In the fiscal year that ended on September 30 the deficit came to $412 billion, the same percentage of GDP -- 3.5 percent -- as last year. That compares with forecasts that centered around $500 billion, or a 4.25 percent of GDP. Better still, reliable sources in the government assure me that on current trends the deficit will shrink to about half the current level as the economy grows. Assuming, of course, that Congress and the president finally meet a new expenditure they can do without. <br> So the president might do just fine without any talented economists to provide new policy initiatives, or any credible figure from the financial community to calm the waters when the inevitable crisis hits. But somehow one can't help wishing for the days when men of stature, rather than "spokespersons," were available to the president, especially one who of necessity must devote the great bulk of his time to foreign policy. <br> <b>Irwin M.

 This column from The American Prospect was written by Terence Samuel.<hr width="75%">As has been authoritatively reported, there is an unparalleled amount of angst coursing through Democratic veins these days, both in Washington and around the country, about what the party needs to do to reverse its recent string of defeats. <br> "Change" seems to be the consensus answer -- but that's where the consensus begins and ends. The increasingly heated debate over who should be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and how he or she should be chosen is only the most dramatic feature of the agonized self-examination. But Democrats are testifying everywhere, from Capitol Hill to Washington barstools to the op-ed pages of "The New York Times" and, heaven forfend, "The Wall Street Journal." <br> They are holding forums and asking questions, trenchant ones like: Is liberalism dead? Is Howard Dean crazy? Where can we find the next James Carville or Paul Begala (or, better still, the next Newt Gingrich or Karl Rove)? <br> There are calls for defiance in the face of defeat -- or concessions in the face of reality. <br> House Democrats this week got a lecture on how to frame the issues in the big privatization fight that's on deck. They intend to position themselves as protectors of Social Security and accuse the administration of trying to privatize the retirement program simply as a prelude to eliminating it. Their metaphor coach suggested that they talk about the deficit as the "baby tax," as it'll be up to today's kids to pay it off later. <br> One priority is this toning of the message, a nail here and a screw there. <br> But a consistent undercurrent in all the discussion is the assumption that what ails the party is not its ideas or its values but an inability to communicate those ideas effectively or to compete with the high-powered GOP message machine. And despite all the calls for change, it appears that the changes desired are small ones indeed, having to do more with style and strategy rather than with substance or ideas. Democrats talked about the need to communicate better, to talk more about values and faith, to convince more people that Democrats are tough on terrorists, and to be more aggressive. "It's not like we are going to change our core values," remarked one Hill Democrat. <br> That's both the good news and the bad. Steadfastness does have political currency, but it's a little suspect when you're on a losing streak. <br> The obvious advantage to that approach is that it may be based on a set of principled positions, inoculating Democrats from charges of flip-flopping. An equally obvious disadvantage, however, is that more than anything, Democrats need to dazzle voters with at least one new idea that will force them to reconsider, or maybe clarify, what it means to be a Democrat. <br> "A minority party can only become a majority party by surprising people enough to realize that it is better than they thought," says Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). "The last two campaigns have been short on such shock therapy. Next time we have to surprise people by becoming an insurgent reform party again, as we did in '92." <br> If that's happening, it'll come as a surprise to a lot of people. And while there has been relatively little finger-pointing and public recrimination among Democrats after the election-day debacle, there are still serious intraparty questions about whose party it is and who's to blame for the recent losses: <br> John Kerry? <br> Howard Dean? <br> George McGovern? <br> Dean's decision to seek the chairmanship of the DNC has set off another round of rancor about what kind of face the party needs. Reed, writing in "The Wall Street Journal" with DLC founder Al From, says Democrats "need to come to terms with the main reason we lost in the red states: Too many Americans doubt whether Democrats will be tough enough in the war on terror... We need to be the party of Harry Truman and John Kennedy, not Michael Moore." <br> And "The New Republic" which supported the war in Iraq and then recanted after things went south, has come out forcefully against Dean. <br> "The single greatest challenge facing the Democratic Party is its dire need to reestablish its credibility on national security," the magazine's editors believe. "Reestablishing this credibility does not mean embracing [George W.] Bush. It means forcefully elucidating alternatives. Dean has shown little interest in doing so, and, during the primary, his instincts led him to cater to the antiwar movement on the party's left." <br> As party bosses meet in Orlando, Florida, this weekend to begin the process of choosing a new party leader, the anxiety over the choice was already roiling many loyalists. Operative Howard Wolfson suggests that the party just throw open the process to Democrats everywhere, and not just members of the DNC. <br> He wrote in "The New York Times": "Fifty-seven million Americans voted for John Kerry last month and more than 2.7 million Democrats contributed to the party during this last campaign... Yet only a tiny fraction of Democrats will determine our party's new leader... My proposal is simple. Permit anyone who has voted in a Democratic primary or participated in a caucus and has contributed in some way to the party -- either financially or through volunteering -- to vote for the next leader via mail or Internet." <br> But more important than who the Democrats want to head their party is what they want that party to be about. And "change" is not enough of an answer. <br> <b>Terence Samuel is the chief congressional correspondent for "U.S. News World Report."

 This column from The Weekly Standard was written by Irwin M. Stelzer.<hr width="75%">There is little in the spate of economic statistics that was published this week to upset economy-watchers here in America. The economy is growing at an annual rate of 4 percent. The Institute of Supply Management reports that both the manufacturing and service sectors are expanding at an increasing rate. Share prices are showing strength, and the housing market remains buoyant. <br> Incomes are rising. Even usually glum farmers are finding reason to cheer: their incomes are up 25 percent on last year's levels. Oil prices are falling as high inventories and warm weather relieve supply worries, and as Iraq slowly but surely returns to world markets in a major way. <br> True, the job report for November disappointed, with the new jobs created coming in at 112,000, rather than the expected 200,000. But the economy has created over two million jobs in the past year, and the unemployment rate is a satisfactory 5.4 percent. The hiring of college graduates is up 20 percent over last year and the grads' pay offers are between 4 percent and 7 percent higher than last year according to the Collegiate Employment Research Institute. <br> It is now all-but-certain that by the time George W. Bush takes the oath of office late in January he will no longer have to contemplate going down in history as the first president since Herbert Hoover to witness a loss of jobs during a complete term in office. Instead, Bush will be able to claim that his tax cuts enabled the American economy to avoid a recession despite the fact that he inherited a declining economy from Bill Clinton, and then had to cope with the economic consequences of the trauma of September 11. <br> Add to this the so-far benign effect of the falling dollar. Exporters are starting to report increased sales as their goods become cheaper in overseas markets, and their foreign competitors' products become dearer here in America. There is some worry that the falling dollar might induce Asian and other holders of large amounts of dollars and dollar-denominate assets to begin dumping their holdings, which would drive up U.S. interest rates and slow the economy, but the administration is confident that such actions would hurt the holders of dollars too much for them to adopt such a policy. <br> Americans with non-refundable tickets to Europe may be in for a shock when they arrive in their destination of choice, but from the point of view of the American economy it is more important that overseas tourists are descending on America's shops and malls and shopping until they drop. And American consumers are crowding into high-end retail shops in record numbers. <br> That should help to make this Christmas a rather merry one for most of America's retailers. There was some concern when mighty Wal-Mart reported that sales on Thanksgiving Day+1, known as "Black Friday" because it is the day that retailers count on to turn red ink into black, were disappointing. But a sober second look at the data shows that Wal-Mart gambled that it would be able to keep its tills ringing -- or its swiping machines swiping credit cards -- without offering significant discounts. It lost its bet, as consumers concentrated purchases on stores offering deep discounts on digital cameras, cell phones, and flat-panel television sets. Still, Wal-Mart did manage an almost 9 percent increase in November sales, not bad by any standard other than that of the giant chain. <br> Of course, in the world of economy-watching, no life is perfect. It certainly seems to be the case that high gasoline prices have eaten into the spending power of the lower-income customers on whom Wal-Mart and other discounters depend. On the macro level, the Bush administration has yet to put in place its economic team, or to reveal its plans for tax reform and for reform of the Social Security system. Indeed, it may well be that tax reform is dead. Important congressmen are saying that unless the president pushes through major changes by 2005, he can forget about tax reform. The next year will see all of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate up for reelection, and the prospect of facing the voters does not increase their eagerness to end some of the special tax benefits so beloved of their constituents. <br> As for Social Security reform, unless the president can figure out how to partially privatize the system without driving up the budget deficit, his prospects for success are limited. Talk in Washington centers around various schemes to bring the system into long-run solvency by surreptitious reductions in benefits. But congressional Republicans have told the White House that they will not back the president unless he can get a substantial number of Democrats to go along with him. They simply do not want to face the electorate as the only party that voted to reduce retirees' benefits. <br> But these issues will have to wait until the strains of the music accompanying the last dance at January's inaugural ball die down. Right now, America's cities are aglow with Christmas decorations and happy shoppers. There is an increasing optimism that elections will be held as scheduled in Iraq, proving that those who died there did not die in vain. There is also a sigh of relief that the American elections did not result in a 2000-style standoff: the only sad faces are those of the tens of thousands of lawyers denied their fees when litigation proved to be minimal. <br> The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas summed it up well last week: "Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally paint a picture of continued economic growth from mid-October to mid-November, with a number of areas improving. Eleven Districts [all save Cleveland] reported expanding economic activity . . ." Not a bad situation for the economy to be in with the Christmas shopping season full upon us. <br> <b>Irwin M.

 This column from The Weekly Standard was written by Fred Barnes.<hr width="75%">A democratic senator who attended a special screening of the movie "Fahrenheit 9/11" was asked what he thought was the most revealing part about President Bush. The senator pondered a moment, then said it was the episode where Bush, in close-up, continues to talk to a grade-school class in Sarasota, Florida, for six or seven minutes after he's learned that planes had flown into the World Trade Center. What did it reveal? The senator couldn't say. <br> My impression, as Bush begins his second term in the White House, is that many in the political community, including the press, still haven't figured him out. One reason is the Bush presidency has emerged quite differently from what was expected. So here are five things about the president that help explain why he does what he does. They aren't the only five aspects of his presidency, but they're five important ones. <br> Bush believes, correctly, that the Washington press corps favored John Kerry in the election. "Ninety percent for Kerry" is what White House aides say. Coverage of Bush reflected this. The Center for Media and Public Affairs found that coverage of Kerry was the most favorable for any presidential candidate since it began examining campaigns in 1988, while Bush's was mostly negative. Reporters complain they get little information from the White House. Chances are they'll get even less in the second term. Bush's calculation is that spending more time with the press would be time poorly spent. <br> So where does all this leave us in understanding Bush? The first step is to abandon the original preconception of President Bush. He's different. The second step is to accept that he's attempting big things. And the third, as a result, is to get ready for a second presidential term like few we've seen. <br> <b>Fred Barnes is executive editor of The Weekly Standard. <br> By Fred Barnes 
 This column from The American Prospect was written by Terence Samuel.<hr width="75%">GOP congressional leaders are getting ready for the new session of Congress by spending a few days at the Tides Inn, a beautiful place at the mouth of the Rappahannock in the Northern Neck of Virginia. Meanwhile, House Democrats will convene next week in a windowless conference room in the basement of the Capitol to hammer out a strategy for dealing with the newly re-elected Republican president and his expanded majorities in Congress. Guess which event will be more fun. (Hint: Go with the golf course.) <br> Whether they're at Tides Inn or in the conference room, though, the attendees will have something in common: Each party will begin strategizing for a reordered political landscape that will be Washington in 2005, and each must confront its image and role as an opposition party. <br> Simply put: Democrats need to embrace it; Republicans need to get over it. One huge explanation for the gridlock in Washington over the last decade is the inability, or unwillingness, of each side to embrace its intended role. Everybody is off script. After 50 years in the minority, Republicans seemed unable to make the switch and become a party that governs. And even after 10 years in the majority, their image of revolutionaries and agitators persists. Democrats, on the other hand, have continued to act like a government in exile, even as their grasp on power continues to slip. They've always acted like they're going to be returned to the majority status any minute now, and GOP control is nothing more that a weird historical anomaly. <br> The result has been no real governing majority willing enough, or secure enough, to do the work of legislating -- cutting the deals and making the compromises, taking half a loaf when a whole one is not available, pushing the rock a little way up the hill until the next time you get to push it a little farther. At the same time, there was has been no loyal opposition forcefully making a case for a different way. Democrats, after all, nominated a presidential ticket with two guys who voted for the Iraq War to oppose a president who was most vulnerable for having started the war. In the end, John Kerry had to run against a war he voted for. And Democrats, clobbered once again at the polls, may finally have embraced the idea that they are the minority opposition party. And maybe for a while. <br> "They [Republicans] are the ones who control everything in Washington," says Harry Reid, the new Senate Democratic leader. "They are the ones with both oars in the water." <br> These days, the government seems to be composed of two opposition parties. Republicans, still opposed to the size and scope of the government, often have to spend a lot of time being against much of what they control. That's why there's no transportation bill. They were also forced to again bundle much of the appropriations legislation to fund the government for next year. And the landmark legislation intended as a key congressional response to September 11 is dead in the water because of Republican opposition to a bipartisan bill supported by the White House. The GOP leadership won't bring it to a vote because it doesn't want it to pass with Democratic help. That might hurt the image of Republican control and unity. But is this strategy a way of running the country or maintaining a political machine? <br> By definition, the GOP gathering at the Tides Inn has to be scored as a celebration. Victory makes everything sweeter. I bet the drinks are colder, the tee shots longer and straighter. Leaders of both chambers have been taking stock, figuring out how to take advantage of this moment when they control all the levers of power in Washington. And the White House involvement makes it even more festive. Among the attendees is none other than "the architect" himself, Karl Rove. There is, after all, all that political capital to spend. But before they get to that they might want to figure how to run the place better -- maybe how to pass a highway or energy bill, maybe get the appropriations done in time, and a little intelligence reform wouldn't hurt, either. <br> The Democrats, meanwhile, say their meeting is not another postmortem of the election. "It's more about the future," says one senior aide. <br> Just like wakes are about the living, not the dead. To their credit, Democrats understand that the White House intends to overhaul Social Security and reform the tax code, and they are pretty sure they're not going to like it. So they're getting ready to tweak their message and their message machine and maybe fight back. Among those scheduled to address the gathering is University of California, Berkeley professor George Lakoff, an expert on cognitive linguistics who believes that the key to better communication is the development of better metaphors. <br> But sticking with some old metaphors for the moment, Reid is setting up a "war room" and has hired some gunslingers -- Jim Manley, from Ted Kennedy's press staff, and Phil Singer, from Chuck Schumer's shop and just off the Kerry campaign -- to run it. Reid has given every indication that he doesn't expect relations to improve with the GOP, and he seems to be assembling some kind of public-relations militia in response. He's taking control of every piece of the message apparatus he can put his hands on -- the Democratic Policy Committee, the Democratic Steering Committee, and the Democratic Communications Committee. And he's told the Senate historians that he'll no longer give a brief history lesson every Tuesday before the Democratic caucus lunch. He's decided it's about the future. And that's not a metaphor. <br> <b>Terence Samuel is the chief congressional correspondent for U.S. News World Report.

 This column from The American Prospect was written by Greg Sargent.<hr width="75%">With the attention of the political world now turning to the 2006 midterm elections, the GOP is already preparing one facet of their strategy: They're hoping to use the looming battles over judicial nominations to rile up their evangelical base and to paint Democrats as liberal obstructionists determined to block President George W. Bush's choices at any cost. <br> Here's a name you'll hear more and more when that strategy kicks into high gear: Kay Daly. A blond, 38-year-old Virginia woman who describes herself, with disingenuous self-deprecation, as a "stay-at-home mom," Daly heads a four-year-old conservative group called Coalition for a Fair Judiciary. The organization's goal is to boost judicial candidates she deems worthy, which coincide rather overwhelmingly with the ones Bush deems worthy. During Bush's first term, her dogged advocacy for the president's judicial picks largely passed under the radar of the biggest mainstream media outlets, but her zeal won applause from the conservative establishment. American Conservative Union President David Keene recently described her as "the next Phyllis Schlafly." <br> Now Daly is poised to rise ever higher in the conservative firmament. While GOP strategists see upcoming judicial battles as key to expanding their electoral majority, hardcore conservatives see these struggles in stark ideological terms -- particularly the inevitable fights over nominations to the Supreme Court. Flush from Election Day gains, these activists see the courts as unconquered territory: the last redoubt of the left, the final frontier in their Holy War on liberalism. Making headway on that front is now mission No. 1 among right-wingers, and Daly's activities will be central to their hopes for success. <br> Daly is already sounding the conservatives' post-election battle cry -- and, in the process, she's offering an early glimpse of the GOP's plan to use judicial issues as a wedge in the run-up to the midterms. Her pitch is based on a standard-issue set of distortions and coded-references to East and West Coast elites: Democratic senators who oppose Bush's nominations are merely doing the bidding of liberal groups, like People for the American Way, who are funded by a shadowy consortium of trial lawyers, unions, and Hollywood celebrities. This alliance of Dems and liberal organizations, well aware that they're getting clobbered in the electoral arena, are using the courts to block GOP advances on moral issues like abortion and gay rights. What's more, Daly warns, Democrats continue doing the bidding of these groups at their peril. <br> This line may not be wholly original, but Daly is fast becoming its most vocal proponent in the mainstream media -- particularly now that it's become clear that judicial issues helped the GOP make gains on Election Day. On November 4 -- barely 24 hours after Bush's victory and former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle's defeat -- CNBC's "Capital Report" invited her on the show to offer the right's interpretation of the Democratic debacle. Daly immediately blamed Daschle's defeat on his "obstruction" of Bush's judicial picks. His loss, she said, was "a warning to those who are out there who are following in Senator Daschle's footsteps." She added a vaguely menacing coda: "I think there are going to be a lot of nervous senators who are up in 2006." <br> What enables Daly to issue such "Sopranos"-esque refrains? Does she command a mob of grassroots volunteers, ready to spring into action the moment she fingers an offending senator? Or is she a one-woman operation, a political operative who, simply by getting gullible reporters to quote her as president of a formidable-sounding "coalition," creates an illusion of grassroots support for Bush's nominees? <br> In interviews and on the coalition's website, www.fairjudiciary.com, Daly describes the group as comprising "more than 75 grassroots organizations dedicated to supporting qualified, capable federal judicial nominees." In an e-mail, Daly told me that the groups include Americans for Tax Reform, the Family Research Council, the Christian Coalition, and a number of others. Asked to name the group's top dozen donors, she said the organization hadn't focused on fundraising in the past but hoped to raise between $500,000 and $1 million in the coming year, mainly from small donors. <br> Ms. Daly also concedes that her group's staff now consists of "just me." And as is true with so many other "grassroots" groups on the right, it's impossible to know just how much clout the "coalition" she presides over actually wields. <br> The right has done something incredibly smart in recent years: They've recognized that by merely making a group sound powerful, they can eventually make it become powerful. That's why these organizations lend their name to Daly's coalition: It allows her to describe herself as the head of an impressive-sounding coalition of "75 groups." That designation enables her to get quoted in mainstream media outlets (she's graced CNN, "The Washington Post"," The Hill", and many others, often described exactly as she describes herself); that, in turn, inflates the organization's importance to the point at which Democratic senators in red-hued districts quake at the sound of her voice. Or, at least, such is the goal. What the right understands better than the left is that power flows from the mere perception of power. <br> After all, Daly doesn't appear to have any particular qualifications to speak as an expert on legal affairs. She is not a lawyer; she is a political consultant with an extensive background in marketing. She's worked a variety of corporate communications jobs, most recently with the Signature Agency, a Raleigh-based firm that develops marketing strategies for Fortune 500 companies. <br> Daly is at bottom a Republican operative. She has held a range of communications and policy positions for GOPers, like former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and former Representative Fred Heineman of North Carolina. In the mid-1990s, Daly married Jack Daly, an attorney with the U.S. Department of Labor. The Dalys represent a picture-perfect Republican union -- their second son's middle name is "Reagan" -- and are fierce partisan warriors who are not afraid to get their hands dirty on behalf of client or party. Jack Daly threw waffles at candidate Bill Clinton during a campaign stop in Winston-Salem in 1992. And last spring, in the midst of a nasty Republican congressional primary in North Carolina, the Dalys were accused of sending out fictitious e-mails to Christian voters about a rival of Kay Daly's candidate, in which a character named "Pastor Randy" falsely alluded to a variety of lurid criminal charges against the rival. Kay Daly has denied involvement. <br> Kay Daly's star began rising on judicial issues just after the 2000 election, when she orchestrated a communications team for what she called "an ad hoc coalition of groups" (sound familiar?) that lobbied for the confirmation of Attorney General John Ashcroft. After he was confirmed, Daly organized that group into a 501C4 and dubbed it the Coalition for a Fair Judiciary. <br> Daly's stock soared in 2003, when her group played a murky role in the bruising fight over Manuel Miranda, a once-obscure GOP Senate staffer who became a right-wing folk hero after he mysteriously obtained confidential Democratic strategy memos about judicial affairs. Just after excerpts of the memos were leaked to the media, Daly's website was among the first to post them in their entirety, leading liberal groups to allege that she was acting in cahoots with Miranda. That charge, of course, only made Daly more popular on the right. <br> The explosive controversy surrounding the scandal carried an important lesson for Daly and other conservatives. It showed that the battles over judicial nominations -- and the perception on the right that Dems were colluding with left-wing interest groups to block GOP judge picks -- could play neatly into a broader GOP electoral strategy by inflaming the party's evangelical base. For her part, Daly was very explicit about hewing to that strategy. In late 2003, she implemented an electoral pledge, asking Democratic Senate candidates in the coming 2004 elections if they would support a straight, filibuster-less "up or down" vote on the president's nominees. Those who didn't, she remarked cheerfully at the time, would be "labeled enemies of the constitution." <br> Daly is best understood as a marketing specialist who is hawking a singular product: outrage over "liberals" who won't simply rubber-stamp whatever judicial nominee Bush puts forth. Her customer base is comprised of right-wing Christians who readily, indeed eagerly, lap up her pitch. And recent history shows that the strategy works -- both for Daly's reputation on the right and for the GOP at large (which enjoyed pumped-up evangelical turnout on November 2, thanks in part to the judicial wars of the last few years). <br> The strategy, of course, will only grow more pronounced as the judicial battles heat up in anticipation of 2006. Just look at a fundraising appeal she e-mailed to supporters just before Election Day: "Even after this election ... Supreme Court vacancies loom ominously in the not-do-distant future. ... Please give your most generous contribution so that we can continue to take on the well-funded forces on the Left, educate the public in states with critical Senate races and go into the Supreme Court battle armed (not with spitballs, as Senator Zell Miller so aptly quipped) with a howitzer of information, action items and pro-active communications tools." The checks, no doubt, have already started flowing. <br> <b>Greg Sargent is a contributing editor at "New York" magazine. <br> By Greg SargentReprinted with permission from The American Prospect, 5 Broad Street, Boston, MA 02109.

 "I earned political capital, and now I intend to spend it." With those words, George W. Bush set out on a second term that is sure to run against most every wish of the Democratic Party. So what should Democrats do about it? Do they fight to the death, or should they let the administration win a few rounds? TAP Online columnist Terence Samuel and Prospect staff writer Matthew Yglesias debate the most effective strategy for congressional Democrats.<hr width="75%">Terence Samuel: <br> For Democrats trying to figure out what they need to do as an opposition party, there should be little confusion about how to approach the new role, or the newly acknowledged role. They have to come out slugging. There's recent history to draw on; it wasn't so long ago that Republicans, despite always being competitive (and sometimes even dominant) in presidential elections, seemed irrevocably tagged as the opposition party. Governors' mansions, statehouses, city halls, both chambers of Congress -- all were dominated by Democrats for more than two generations. <br> Republicans didn't just let the Democrats dig their own grave, though that wasn't an implausible strategy. They knew what they wanted and they fought for it. They actively went out and undermined and discredited the very foundations of the Democratic Party, slowly disassembling its coalition and appropriating its power. They began with the obvious, which is to define yourself by what you say "no" to: taxes, regulation, a woman's right to end a pregnancy at her own discretion. That's the essence of opposition. But to close the deal, they made people feel righteous about what they were against. So government programs become government waste, and regulation became red tape. It was clear that the government needed to get off the backs of the people, and, of course, every life was sacred. Suddenly they had core values. <br> The GOP assault was strategic, relentless, and completely unaccommodating to the notion that there was any redeeming value to the other side. "Liberal" became a dirty word and the U.S. government, that fabulous piece of constitutional architecture, became a force for evil. <br> Yet Democrats seemed not to be paying attention. Today's political battles are mostly about tactics and strategy, and that inattention, more than anything else, is why Democrats find themselves so often on the business end of the GOP's big stick. <br> Politicians on both sides like to say ideas matter. True -- but the ideas that matter most are the ones that belong to those in power, so ultimately the real battle is one for power. That's never been pretty and it's not really that much about ideas, either. It's about winning. The American people have sifted through the ideas and they're split evenly on which ones to embrace. While Democrats have favored wannabe statesmen and intellectuals to sell their ideas, the GOP of late has come to the table with crusaders and warriors. If one side thinks it's a cocktail party and the other comes ready for a bar fight, guess who wins when the brawl breaks out? The ones with the brass knuckles, not the champagne glasses. <br> Democrats may simply need their own Newt Gingrich, or their own Karl Rove or Lee Atwater, tacticians who believe in their mission or their man and are not willing to apologize for any weaknesses or shortcomings. Flaws be damned! <br> Democrats need to fight for the simple reason that they are out of practice, and they need to find out what it is they think is worth fighting for. Even as they remain unable to articulate what it means to be a Democrat, nearly half the country keeps voting with them. If they are right, and the other side is wrong, they need to say that. They need to say how and why, and then reassure voters that it's OK -- not just OK but downright American -- to feel the way they do. Much of that public reassurance will flow on its own with the self-assurance that the party in general seems to lack. Democrats have to stop seeming so wobbly, whether it's on war, or taxes, or abortion. They need to stand up and lead. Their following may already be in place. <br> On the point that the Democratic Party needs to fight, you'll get no argument from me. The question is which battles to fight and in what way. The model of the past four years has been characterized by the Republicans -- not unfairly -- as obstructionism, trying as hard as possible to block as many administration proposals as possible. At the time this made, or at least seemed to make, a great deal of sense. The 2000 election -- with its Democratic gains in the Senate, Al Gore's popular-vote win, and Ralph Nader's nontrivial margin -- appeared to illustrate the existence of a nascent center-left majority that failed to manifest itself inside the Beltway only due to some quirks of the voting system. Try to limit the damage George W. Bush can do in four years, the theory went, mobilize the forces of liberalism, and the Democratic return to power shouldn't be far off. <br> It was an idea that seemed to make sense, but it didn't work. That nascent center-left majority turned out not to exist. Bush turned out not to be very popular, but the Democrats turned out to be less popular still. The upshot is that Democrats need to do something to expand their appeal, and simply being the party that says "no" to a re-elected president and his expanded congressional majorities won't do it. <br> The starting point for any analysis of the issue has to be that, objectively speaking, blocking Bush's initiatives will be very difficult. Over the past four years, and especially since the 2002 midterms, the Democrats haven't been very successful at it. Reduced to an even smaller minority, and with a large block of Democratic senators still representing pro-Bush states, it will be harder still. Holding the caucus together to successfully filibuster legislation would likely take all the time and attention the leadership could possibly muster. And even under the best of circumstances, the efficacy of such a strategy would be undermined by the Republicans' ability to abuse the conference-committee process, the budget-reconciliation rule, and possibly even the "nuclear option" of simply rescinding the filibuster rule -- first for judicial nominations, and perhaps for other things later. <br> A better path would be to dedicate the bulk of Democratic time and attention to fulfilling the role played by opposition parties in the parliamentary democracies that the United States increasingly resembles. In other words, to outline an alternative agenda for the future. <br> Republicans didn't win control of Congress in 1994 simply by holding the line against Clinton-administration proposals. Instead, they took advantage of their status as a minority to position themselves as the party of reform. Every flaw in the federal bureaucracy, every frustrating aspect of Washington corruption, every nonsensical element of congressional procedure became -- temporarily, at least -- a wholly owned subsidiary of the Democratic Party that was running the country. This is a move that Democrats could easily imitate. The promises of reform in the "Contract with America" have gone utterly unfulfilled and, indeed, things have grown worse in almost every respect. As a minority party lacking in the privileges of entrenched power, the Democrats are ideally positioned to combine anti-corporate populism with anti-government populism, arguing not for the rollback of the state (major federal programs remain quite popular) but for its reform. <br> A similar approach can be carried over into more substantive policy realms. Liberals have ideas for improving health care, education, retirement security, and national security. A legislative strategy focused on building unity within the party around some of these ideas and communicating them to the public could build electoral support for candidates the next time around while improving the image of the Democratic brand. A strategy centered on saying "no," by contrast, will only increase the perception (deadly at the polls earlier this month) that Democrats don't really stand for anything, or, worse, that they are simply defenders of the status quo. <br> The proposals that Bush is likely to put forward will almost certainly be bad, but they will be targeted at addressing problems that are very real: a complicated and inefficient tax code, the rising cost of health care, the long-term shortfall in the Social Security budget. A Democratic Party toward which the electorate already exhibits considerable skepticism can hardly afford to present itself to the public as the party that's "against" tax reform, Social Security reform, or, generally speaking, tackling the big issues. Democrats need to break away from their self-image as the natural party of government that aims at taking "back" a congressional majority regarded as a birthright. The government that exists today is the Republicans' government, the tax code is their tax code, public problems are their problems, and the role of the opposition is to pin the blame on the incumbents and outline their own ideas for solving them. Ideally, Democrats wouldn't have to play an obstructionist role; when they do, they need to keep in mind their overall priorities and not get dragged into the Republicans' preferred battles. The focus needs to be on opposition -- outlining and selling an alternative agenda -- and not on obstructing the designs of a Republican Party fresh off a string of electoral wins. <br> Democrats didn't lose the election because they were tagged as obstructionists, or because they actually were obstructionists, or because they spent too much time obstructing rather than advancing a compelling alternative agenda. <br> They lost because they got out-muscled in Ohio, Florida, South Dakota, and all of those southern states where they lost Senate seats. In Texas, where Tom DeLay so brilliantly out-hustled them, Democrats lost four incumbents, two of whom, Martin Frost and Charlie Stenholm, had been in the House for 25 years. Those old Texas hands were not out of touch with their districts; they just got hammered by the other side, and not about ideas. Stenholm is so conservative that he spent a good part of the last decade explaining why he had not switched parties. Still, the bull's-eye on his back could not have been bigger if his last name were Rangel, instead of Stenholm. And they got him. <br> The GOP just played the game better, harder, and with more feeling. Who would think of a second round of redistricting between Census counts? People who understand the need to press every advantage and then do it. There's no question that some policy repositioning is in order, but that's routine work for any party that must balance the needs of base constituencies that are more radical with those of middle-of-the-road voters who can put it over the top. But repositioning carries its own risk, in that too much tweaking makes a party look like it's simply playing to the bad election results. Having yet again lost a big election, it's important for Democrats to examine whether they need to recalibrate their positions on tax reform, Social Security reform, and maybe even on guns, abortion, and gay marriage, plus all of the other important big issues of the day. And there may be no better place to begin that work than in the Congress, where the give and take of legislating can shake loose the occasional good idea. But more nuanced positions are not the Democrats' problems. (For example, la Kerry, "I oppose gay marriage but support civil unions"; "I voted no for the war for but to deliver authority for the war.") <br> The moral-issues barrier that Democrats find themselves up against is not so much a matter of whether they connect with voters on those issues but whether they command the respect of voters, wherever they are on the issues. It's about respect. And people respect honest combatants almost as much as they respect victors. <br> All those years in the majority may have allowed certain Democratic political muscles to atrophy: They don't go into a fight as if their lives depended on it. The party has a "you win some, you lose some" attitude that ensures that it will lose more than it wins. Different results will require different behavior. And it will require more than simply offering Democratic alternatives on the budget or on the tax bill or on Medicare. <br> Republicans did not offer alternatives to the Clinton health-care plan in 1993; they demeaned it, demonized it, and then defeated it. Ten years later, they stole the health-care issue from the Democrats with a massive prescription-drug addendum to Medicare, not just by selling it to the Congress and the country but by keeping the vote open for three hours until they passed it. Balls to the wall is the only way the game can be won. <br> After you establish your backbone bona fides, then you can offer your "Contract with America," your better plan for Social Security. You can offer yourself as an alternative to all that you oppose. <br> It would be foolish to doubt the importance of political organization, but if the 2004 election taught us anything it ought to be that the combination of anti-Bushism and what really was an unprecedented voter-mobilization effort still isn't good enough to win elections. What's more, Democratic fortunes were bolstered by objectively bad circumstances in the world: a dreary economy throughout much of the Midwest and a deteriorating situation in Iraq. Both the economy and the war may continue to go poorly, or even get worse, either of which would help the party in the future. Alternatively, one or both situations may improve -- which, under present circumstances, would be deadly for the Democratic Party. Counting on more bad news to keep the party competitive would be risky, and if the public were to sense that that was going on it would be politically deadly as well. <br> Democrats desperately need to take action to get a bit of the old "vision thing" and not just play hardball politics. The nuance problem you identify is a case in point. Bush has promised to appoint a commission to study large-scale tax reform. The resulting proposal will almost certainly involve yet another major lowering of taxes on the wealthy. At the same time, it will doubtless achieve a few worthy things in the way of simplification and loophole elimination. If Democrats stick to the pattern of the past four years and wait to see Bush's proposal, then start pointing out what a bad idea it is, and then try to block it, they'll find themselves accused of being "against tax reform." "No, no, no," they'll protest. "We're not against reform; we're just against this particular reform." It'll be a nuanced view, and they'll get slaughtered on it. <br> A better approach would be to seize the advantages that minority status grants. Without any realistic possibility of seeing their plan implemented, Democrats can afford to be utopian and ignore the special-interest influence and other facts of political reality that make tax reform difficult. The party could unite around a revenue-neutral plan to broaden the tax base by eliminating loopholes and deductions while lowering rates across the board. Acting swiftly while the wheels of actual legislation grind slowly, the party can then position itself as the first to author a comprehensive plan. "The president," they can say, "has promised the country tax reform. Where is it? We've got our plan." Thus the public debate could be focused, temporarily at least, on an appealing Democratic idea and not merely on charges and countercharges that cede the initiative to the White House. <br> There's no particular need for the party to move to the right on the domestic economic issues that continue to be its major source of strength, but Democrats can't allow concern over the harm Bush might inflict to get them stuck as the defenders of the status quo. No one ever founded a new majority on promises not to change existing programs. Backbone is good; indeed, it's necessary. But it must be backbone for something, not merely against the president's agenda. <br> <b>Terence Samuel is the chief congressional correspondent for U.S. News World Report.

 This column from the National Review Online was written by Gary Andres.<hr width="75%">President George W. Bush clearly roared back - scoring his best performance of the three debates. John Kerry "came back" as well - but the old John Kerry returned, one that had a hard time with crisp, concise answers and one that, at times seemed aloof and sanctimonious. <br> The president was more energized than his opponent and hit just about every point he needed to make. <br> Like the last debate, this one witnessed a reversal of fortune. Kerry clearly was supposed to dominate the domestic-policy-agenda questions and he did not. As for Bush, this was supposed to be the president's "weaker" area and his performance again Wednesday night - like the second debate - was very strong. <br> President Bush clearly had enough facts down to sound substantively credible, but he usually laced his answers with strong critiques of Kerry's position as well. Health care was a good example. The president ticked off a series of proposals aimed at lowering costs, like medical-malpractice reform, more consumer-driven health care and greater use of technology - all very sound answers. <br> Kerry seemed defensive, stiff, and tentative - never sure if he was on offense or defense. He also rambled a great deal and mentioned too many policy buzzwords. There was certain crispness in his language in the first debate lacking Wednesday night. <br> My general impression was that the boring policy wonk so many Democratic activists I've talked to over the past year feared - complete with facts, figures, and ice water running through his veins made a comeback Wednesday night - big time. <br> He gets the award for "legislative ghostwriter of the year" because of all the bills that passed that he happened to cosponsor - a lame response to Bush's charge that he has a vacuous 20-year Senate record. <br> I also thought Kerry's comments about working with Senator McCain on campaign-finance reform as his best example of what he would do to restore bipartisanship and civility was ludicrous. How about Social Security, health care, or education? <br> Kerry also must have lost the pages from his briefing book on values and manners. His values were about as wobbly as a ship in a storm in Boston Harbor, and I'm not sure after listening if his theological pedigree is based more on St. Timothy or Timothy Leary. <br> He's Catholic, an altar boy, in favor of marriage, but he can't vote to protect it. And raising the issue about the vice president's daughter was a corrupt, below the belt tactic we've come to expect from Democrats with a tradition linked to machine politics and organized labor like Senators Kerry and Edwards. <br> Yes, this debate welcomed back two "comeback kids." The president's comeback should buoy his supporters and convince undecided voters to support him. The senator's supporters probably were probably were not real happy to have the old John Kerry return. <br> Gary Andres is vice chairman of research and policy at the Dutko Group Companies and a frequent NRO contributor. <br> By Gary AndresReprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 This column from the National Review Online was written by Larry Kudlow</i><br>As George W. Bush mounts a strong comeback in the polls, stock market averages are mounting their own stealth recovery. There's a clear link here. Should the president be reelected, tax-rates on capital will stay low and may even drop some more. Wall Street likes this. <br> Bush's concept of tax reform is focused on reducing the multiple taxation of saving and investment. Under current law the same dollar of income is taxed once as work effort, a second time as corporate earnings, a third time as dividends, a fourth time as capital gains, and a fifth time as inheritance. This is a capital killer. <br> Without capital there is no investment funding for the very businesses -- large, small, old, or new -- that create jobs. Levying tax penalties on capital, as Sen. John Kerry would do if elected, would curtail the supply of the very seed corn necessary to grow the American economy. Capital is labor's best friend. JFK understood this, but his Democratic party has long since forgotten. <br> Kerry's Europeanized domestic plan would set up tax penalties on capital formation, upward mobility, and the formation of job-creating businesses. For the 90 million-strong investor class, Kerry's taxes on dividends, capital gains, and the most successful earners are a tax on the stock market -- and therefore a tax on economic growth and wealth creation. <br> On the flip side, Bush would use personal control, individual responsibility, and tax-free savings accounts to create new wealth for retirement, healthcare, and education. This is his ownership-society vision. It would represent a sea change in policy. Instead of government-directed solutions, Bush would move the country toward consumer- and investor-based solutions. Government dependency would end. <br> The stock market is a proxy for the future value of private sector free enterprise. So it's no wonder that share prices are rising along with Bush's polls. Online pay-to-play trading markets are showing sizable Bush leads. The Iowa Electronic Market has Bush at 57 cents and Kerry at 43 cents. A month ago these contracts were dead even. The Tradesport.com market has Bush at an incredible $63 and Kerry at a dismal $35. <br> The Gallup poll has Bush ahead 52 percent to 45 percent. More revealing, Gallup shows a major Bush move in key battleground states. In Missouri, Bush is up 14 points. In Ohio and Wisconsin, he's up nine points. In Pennsylvania, he's about even. <br> Noteworthy is the new horserace in New Jersey. The Newark Star Ledger/Eagleton/Rutgers poll shows Kerry's lead has shrunk from 20 points to just 4. Why the drop? I have long believed that voters in the traditionally blue-state region of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey harbor a lot of secret pro-Bush sentiment since 9/11. Nearly everyone there knows someone who lost a friend or family member in the World Trade Center. Folks in this tri-state area are going about their business each day, but deep down they fear it could happen again. <br> These voters may not agree with Bush on social policies, but they quietly agree with him on the Patriot Act, which has caught hundreds of terrorists on U.S. soil and has already stopped numerous planned attacks. They may not be thrilled about the messy campaign in Iraq, but they like Bush's toughness and unyielding single-mindedness in the war and on homeland security. Simply, Bush is giving workers in this Democratic corridor great hope that they'll return home safely to their families each and every night. <br> Bush may not win these states, but he will score a much higher popular vote than he did four years ago. Should he show up in the New York area once or twice in the next six weeks, he could conceivably pull off a huge upset. <br> Of course, measuring stock market performance seems almost insignificant when compared with getting loved ones home safely at night. But the stock market is not only a barometer of future wealth-creation, it has become a measure of future safety and security upon which wealth-creation depends. <br> In this light, a significant part of the political story is that broad stock averages have gone up nine percent since mid-August (with growth-sensitive sectors like tech, consumers, financials, industrials, materials, and energy leading the way). The bounce parallels Bush's recovery in the polls. <br> All of this undercuts another Kerry argument. There is no Hooveresque economy right now in the U.S. The stock market is predicting continued solid economic growth as far as the eye can see. A full 140 million people are working, a new U.S. record. The unemployment rate is at a historically low 5.4 percent. Businesses are investing and consumers are spending. <br> The economy may not be perfect. Homeland security may not be foolproof. But the polls and the stock market are predicting a strong Bush victory. <br> <b> Larry Kudlow, NRO's Economics Editor, is CEO of Kudlow Co. and host with Jim Cramer of CNBC's Kudlow Cramer. <br> By Larry Kudlow Reprinted with permission from National Review Online 
 Attorney Andrew Cohen analyzes legal issues for CBS News and CBSNews.com.<br>When the Justices began the Supreme Court term on the first Monday in October 2000, they had no way of knowing that the term, and their lasting legacy, would be dominated by a case that wasn't even on the docket. But two months later, on December 12, 2000, the Justices decided Bush v. Gore and the rest, as they say, is history. <br> The possibility of another nasty recount fight has to be on the minds of the Justices as they prepare for the coming term. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bush-adds-iowa-to-win-list/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">The election this year is tight.</span> There are plenty of "swing states" where a few hundred votes one way or another can tip the balance and, perhaps, the election itself. And while election procedures around the country have been improved since the debacle in Florida last time around, it is clear that there are still plenty of things that can (and will) go wrong. Even the fact that the Court accepted the last presidential recount case makes it more likely that it will have to accept another such case should it be asked to do so this time around. <br> So this preview of the 2004-2005 Court term starts off with this proviso; the granddaddy case of them all, Bush v. Kerry or Kerry v. Bush, may or may not materialize. If it does, all the cases below will recede into the background. If it does not, we'll have to be satisfied with a fairly typical docket from the Justices; a term that has its usual share of interesting and important cases as well as a few exceptional ones. There is no Pledge of Allegiance case on the docket this year to push everyone's emotional and cultural buttons. There is no massive campaign finance reform case to confuse everyone even more on a complex subject. Right now there are no huge terror law cases looming as there were last term. But there are plenty of other cases that will have people talking. <br> The most important cases of the term, at least so far, are on a subject <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-court-to-look-at-sentences/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">federal sentencing</span> that makes people's eyes glaze over. Yet the Justices clearly recognize that the current sentencing rules which directly affect tens of thousands of cases a year are a complete mess in the wake of a ruling they made this past spring. In fact, the Justices were so clearly concerned by the confusion they themselves caused that they promptly accepted two federal sentencing cases and set them for oral argument the very first week of the term. For a Court where time is measured in years, not weeks, that's an extraordinarily fast track. <br> So why the rush? Well, a growing number of judges across the country now believe that the federal sentencing guidelines which require judges to mete out sentences according to a legal and mathematical calculus are either unconstitutional or just plain unworkable given how the Supreme Court has interpreted them over the years. In particular, a June ruling by the Justices in the case of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-courts-quiet-bombshell/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Blakely v. Washington</span> has judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and defendants all over the country wondering whether a judge ever can impose a sentence based upon any factor such as the chance a defendant would pose a danger to the community upon release that is not found beyond a reasonable doubt by a trial jury. <br> If the Justices affirm that sentences must always be based upon jury-found facts then we can pretty much kiss the federal sentencing guidelines goodbye at least as we know them. If the Justices stop short of requiring this sort of factual inquiry, they'll have to explain how sentencing ought to work in light of their recent rulings. Either way, the whole landscape of sentencing is about to change. Now, I grant you this is not the kind of stuff that makes for dramatic play on the Evening News it's not a "picture" story, alas but because it affects so many cases it is by far the major issue of the term for the Court when it comes to the criminal justice system. Look for a ruling around the end of the year. <br> Around the end of the year is when the Justices will tackle the issue of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-court-entering-marijuana-fray/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">state-sanctioned medical marijuana use</span> and its relationship with a federal statute that criminalizes pot smoking. California (and other states) permit marijuana use for medical purposes but the feds, under the direction of Attorney General John Ashcroft, have been arresting medical marijuana users and growers there. The question for the Court is: which jurisdiction prevails? Does Congress have the power to trump a state law like this with a federal one? Or does the federal statute violate the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits federal laws that intrude upon purely intrastate activities? Maybe it is a good thing that the Justices will hear and decide this case after the upcoming election. <br> One case that will be heard before the election has to do with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/end-to-juvenile-executions-urged/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">juvenile offenders and the death penalty</span>. A few terms ago, the Justices ruled that the Constitution precluded as "cruel and unusual punishment" the execution of mentally retarded defendants. Now the question before the Court is whether the same analysis applied by the Court's majority in that case ought to apply to bar executions of murderers who were under the age of 18 when they committed their crimes. Only a few states still permit the practice and those opposed to it say that there is now a "national consensus" against capital punishment for juvenile offenders. We'll see. Just because the Court found a statewide consensus in one area of capital punishment law doesn't guarantee that they'll find another consensus when it comes to teenage murderers. <br> Then there are a gaggle of second-tier cases some interesting, some worthy even of a chuckle, and some downright heartbreaking that the Justices will hear and decide this term. There are two cases involving the shipment of wine and liquor. There is the usual assortment of search-and-seizure and traffic stop cases. (Can guard dogs be used in routine traffic stops?) There is a case about firearms and felons that will be heard on the day after the presidential election. There is an interesting case between Colorado and Kansas about water rights. And there are a few cases involving immigration issues that have newfound importance since Sept. 11, 2001. <br> There are some tax cases and a railroad liability case and a maritime liability case. There is an environmental case and a bankruptcy case and a trademark case and a case about the Truth in Lending Act. There is a Title IX case involving claims of discrimination at a high school. There is an age discrimination case and two cases about Native American rights. And just last week the Court accepted an important case about the public taking of private property. <br> Before the term is through, the Court will hear and decide dozens of additional cases. But it's probably a good idea to wait until after Nov. 2 to determine just how busy the Justices will be this term and what they will long be remembered for when it is through. <br> By Andrew Cohen 
 This column from The Nation was written by David Corn.</i> <br> The world is your playground/And you want to win. <br> So sang a little-known and unimpressive rock singer named Dexter Freebish at the opening night of the GOP convention. Was he sending a subtle message? Nah, he looked much too happy providing a generic backbeat for delegates who moments earlier had cheered a film tribute to Gerald Ford (it was a short film). And conventions are not the place for subtle messages. <br> Ask John McCain. In 2000, he was the victim of one of the dirtiest assaults in modern politics. Bush-backers circulated vile rumors about the man, and the Bush campaign refused to condemn this hit job. George W. Bush campaigned with the leader of a marginal veterans outfit who falsely accused McCain of betraying veterans, and the Bush administration would later reward this scoundrel with a job. Yet McCain played the loyal soldier at the 2000 convention, where he delivered a weird and robotic speech in which he endorsed Bush and did little to promote the reform-minded message of his own campaign. <br> For years later, McCain, the former Navy pilot and POW, again agreed to fly wing for the fellow who skipped out of his Air National Guard service. For weeks, McCain has been stumping with Bush (even while he has defended Kerry's Vietnam record), and some have asked, why is he cheek-to-jowl with Bush? Not too long ago McCain seemed to entertain -- if only for a moment --the notion of running as John Kerry's second. And how could he not bear a grudge against Bush for 2000? When I asked a Republican strategist close to McCain why McCain finally took a seat on the Bush Express, he replied. "He's a Republican." Does he want to be veep, should Dick Cheney take a powder? "He's a Republican," I was told. Is he positioning himself for a run in 2008, when he will be 72 years old? "He's a Republican." Does he want to be Secretary of Defense after Bush throws Donald Rumsfeld overboard? "He's a Republican." <br> Hey, maybe the reason is that he's a Republican. Washington is a binary culture. You either are a D or a R. And if you're an R you are expected to answer the call when it comes. So there was McCain, the first prominent speaker of the 2004 Republican convention, and this much-ballyhooed gig ended a flop. <br> McCain may be BMOC in Washington. But he hardly received a hero's welcome from the less-than-capacity crowd at Madison Square Garden. (Reminder to McCain fans, myself included: McCain was rejected by his party in 2000.) When McCain took the stage, the big-screen television showed Cheney clapping rather unenthusiastically. And McCain's speech did little to rouse the delegates. <br> Keeping with the skip-the-nuances M.O. of most conventions, McCain delivered a set of obvious nostrums, as he supported Bush's prosecution of the so-called war on terrorism and defended the war in Iraq: right makes might, love is stronger than hate. His rhetoric hardly soared: "But we must fight. We must." McCain issued a heartfelt call for reviving the national unity that appeared to exist in the days after the September 11 attacks: "We were not Democrats or Republican, liberal or conservative. We were not two countries. We're Americans." He noted that Democrats, like Republicans, are committed to winning the war against terrorism. "I don't doubt their sincerity." He praised Bush, though his actual endorsement had an odd ring: <br> "While this war has many components, we can't make victory on the battlefield harder to achieve so that our diplomacy is easier to conduct. That is not just an expression of our strength. It's a measure of our wisdom. That's why I commend to my country the reelection of President Bush, and the steady, experienced, public-spirited man who serves as our vice president, Dick Cheney." <br> I commend the reelection? Were we in the House of Lords? This was not a kick-ass call for Americans to swing behind the commander-in-chief. The crowd did respond with shouts of "four more years." But the delegates were not entranced by McCain's can't-we-get-along plea. What popped their cork, though, was a swipe McCain took at filmmaker Michael Moore (who was in the hall, as an accredited columnist for USA Today). Defending the war in Iraq, McCain said, "Our choice wasn't between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war. It was between war and graver threat. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Not our critics abroad. Not our political opponents. And certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who --" <br> Now the delegates went wild. It was the first signs of life in the audience. When the jeers died down, McCain continued: <br> "-- who would have us believe Saddam's Iraq was an oasis of peace when in fact it was a place of indescribable cruelty, torture chambers, mass graves, and prisons that destroyed the lives of the small children held inside their walls." <br> McCain, a war hero, fretting over Michael Moore? He was only elevating Moore's status. It was red meat, but McCain looked smaller for hurling it to the delegates. He then returned to his pitch for unity: <br> "We have nothing to fear from each other. We are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom, and promote the general welfare. But it should remain an argument among friends who share an unshaken belief in our great cause, and in the goodness of each other. We are Americans first, Americans last, Americans always ... We're Americans, and we'll never surrender." <br> McCain then left the stage in what seemed record-time. He had failed to sway the crowd, for soon after the delegates were roaring with delight when Rudy Guiliani spoke and sarcastically derided John Kerry for being a flip-flopper. This was an all-out attack on Kerry's sincerity. Guiliani, like McCain, voiced a yearning for the good ol' post-9/11 days when Americans came together, when Chicago cops traveled to New York to help out, when a fan at a Red Sox-Yankees game held up a sign that proclaimed, "Boston Loves New York," when Republicans stood hand in hand with Democrats. But Guiliani gleefully bashed Kerry as a man without principles. That's not the way to foment unity. (How Republicans can assail Kerry for being a knee-jerk liberal and, at the same time, accuse him of being nothing but a finger-in-the-wind, ever-shifting pol remains an impressive acrobatic feat.) <br> Guess who went over better with the Repubs? Though Guiliani's speech was much too long -- delegates started streaming out before it was done -- the GOPers cheered him on much more than McCain. It appears the Republicans enjoy calls for unity when the are coupled with in-your-face attacks. (Which probably could be said of Democratic partisans as well.) McCain was upstaged by Guiliani. His speech -- skipped by the broadcast networks -- barely registered. Yet the Bush campaign has gotten what it wanted: McCain's submission. He has become a prop of the Bush campaign. Given McCain's genuine streak of independence -- on campaign reform, on global warming, on tax cuts -- that is a sad development. But that's the price this good soldier pays for being a Republican. <br> By David CornReprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This year, Americans see sharper differences between the two political parties than ever before, and perhaps with good reason: as the Republican party prepares to hold its quadrennial convention, on many issues its delegates are indeed dramatically different from the Democrats who gathered in Boston last month. Here are the results of a CBS News/New York Times poll taken from August 3, to the 22th: <br> The Republican delegates are in agreement with GOP voters nationwide on a range of issues, including strong support for the Iraq war, the belief that government should promote traditional values, support for tax cuts, and wanting religion to be part of the 2004 campaign. Both groups are enthusiastic about George W. Bush, delegates especially so. <br> IDEOLOGY <br> Last month, a majority of Democratic delegates claimed to be moderates, not liberals (although they took decidedly liberal positions on many issues). Republican delegates, on the other hand, embrace the conservative label as do a majority of their voters. 63% of delegates call themselves conservatives, unchanged from 2000, when the party first tabbed George W. Bush to be its nominee. So do 57% of Republican voters nationwide. <br> POLITICAL IDEOLOGY <br> On some traditional measures of ideology, GOP delegates are even more conservative than Republican voters. 85% of delegates say the Federal Government is generally too involved in issues that are better left, they believe, to individuals. A similar number of 2000 delegates also said the government was too involved. <br> Most GOP voters agree, but to a lesser extent. There is somewhat more accord between GOP delegates and voters on this general philosophy than there was between Democratic delegates and their voters: Democratic delegates were strongly in favor of more government action while Democratic voters, asked about this question in July, were mixed. <br> ROLE OF GOVERNMENT <br> Republican voters are slightly more likely than Republican delegates to want the government to take an active role in promoting traditional values: 55% of delegates and 61% of voters say so. About one-third of the delegates headed to New York and Republican voters nationwide each say the government should not favor any one set of values. On this point, Democrats and Democratic delegates were in agreement with each other, but in the opposite direction: over seven in ten of each said government should not play a role in promoting any one set of values. <br> GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN VALUES <br> Republican delegates are almost unanimously behind the U.S. military action in Iraq. Eight in ten Republican voters feel the same way. Democratic delegates in Boston overwhelmingly thought the U.S. ought to have stayed out of Iraq, and most Democratic voters agree. <br> MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ <br> Republican delegates and Republican voters agree that most of the Bush tax cuts passed since 2001 should be kept in place, although most delegates would keep all of them. 61% of delegates want all of those cuts locked in as permanent. 30% of Republican voters concur, though 38% favor making most but not all of the cuts permanent, and one in five would repeal them at least some of them. <br> Democratic delegates and voters want most cuts repealed, marking a sharp difference with their Republican counterparts. Democratic delegates (though not their voters) are almost unanimous on this question. <br> BUSH'S TAX CUTS <br> Republican delegates and voters agree that the environment should not be protected at the expense of jobs. Democratic voters and delegates felt the opposite way. <br> PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT EVEN IF IT COSTS JOBS? <br> Religion is important in the lives of most delegates and voters of both parties, but Republicans are twice as likely to say religion is "extremely" important: almost four in ten GOP delegates and voters say that, compared with two in ten Democrats. And most Republican delegates and voters are untroubled by bringing religion into political discourse. 81% of delegates think it is appropriate for politicians to talk about their religious beliefs during the campaign, as do 68% of Republican voters. <br> SHOULD CANDIDATES DISCUSS THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS? <br> Democratic delegates and voters are opposite. About two thirds of each group of Democrats think religion should not be part of a presidential campaign. <br> ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT FOR BUSH THE CONSERVATIVE <br> Even more Republican delegates describe George W. Bush as conservative than say they are. 74% say the President is a conservative, and 21% think he is a moderate. 58% of GOP voters nationwide view the President as conservative. <br> GEORGE W. BUSH IS <br> Whatever their description of the President, Republican delegates are almost unanimous in their enthusiasm about him. Republican voters who back Bush are enthusiastic about the President, too, but not to the same extent. Just over one-fourth have reservations about him. <br> REPUBLICANS: FEELINGS TOWARD GEORGE W. BUSH AS A CANDIDATE <br> However, Republican delegates and voters are each more enthusiastic about Bush than their Democratic counterparts are about John Kerry. While the Democratic delegates in Boston were overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Kerry, many Democrats around the country backing Kerry are less so enthusiastic about him. <br> DEMOCRATS: FEELINGS TOWARD JOHN KERRY AS A CANDIDATE <br> Vice President Dick Cheney, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for Vice President, enjoys overwhelming popularity among the Republican delegates. 94% of the delegates view the Vice President favorably, and just 2% are unfavorable. Nationally, six in ten Republican voters have positive opinions about Cheney, but one-third have yet to form an opinion. <br> VIEWS OF DICK CHENEY <br> When asked whether Cheney should be replaced as the Vice Presidential nominee, just 7% of delegates thought he should. <br> STEM CELL RESEARCH, ABORTION AND THE DEATH PENALTY <br> There are few areas in which some Republican delegates (and voters) part ways with the President -- stem cell research may be one of them. President Bush has restricted government funding to research conducted only on existing stem cell lines. <br> Republican delegates do not hold a cohesive position on the issue; about four in ten support such research, and half oppose it. Republican voters are similarly divided. <br> EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH <br> Among those delegates who approve of stem cell research, half think federal funding should be extended to a larger number of stem cell lines, effectively disagreeing with the President's restrictions. Republican voters have similar views. <br> Seven in ten delegates oppose abortion altogether or would permit it only to save the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape. Most Republican voters agree. Democratic delegates are much more likely to take an opposing view, as do a majority of Democratic voters. <br> ABORTION <br> Republican delegates (and even more Republican voters) support the death penalty over life in prison with no parole for people convicted of murder by a wide margin. These views have changed little since 2000. <br> DEATH PENALTY OR LIFE IN PRISON FOR MURDERERS? <br> Democratic delegates and voters express greater support for life in prison than the death penalty. <br> SAME-SEX MARRIAGE <br> While very few Republican delegates think same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, many think same-sex relationships should be recognized legally. 3% of delegates think same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, and another 41% support civil unions for same-sex couples. 49% of delegates, however, think there should be no legal recognition of same-sex relationships. <br> More Republican voters, 11%, support same-sex marriage. 36% support same-sex civil unions, and 52% do not think same-sex relationships should be legally recognized. <br> SAME-SEX COUPLES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO: <br> Democrats have opposing views on the issue of same-sex marriage. 44% of Democratic delegates supported same sex marriage, and another 43% supported civil unions for same sex couples. Only one in twenty would provide no legal option for same sex couples. Democratic voters, asked in July, are more mixed on this issue. <br> RELIGION AND SOCIAL ISSUES <br> Most delegates to the Republican convention are extremely or very religious, Protestant, and hold conservative positions on abortion and stem cell research. In this area the delegates come close to mirroring the Republican voters they represent. <br> Nearly four in 10 Republican delegates say that religion is extremely important to them, as do 34% of Republican voters, and only 21% of Democratic delegates. <br> IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION <br> 65% of Republican delegates are Protestant, and another one in four are Catholic. Democrats -- both delegates and voters -- were more diverse in their religious preferences when asked in July. <br> THE MOST RELIGIOUS DELEGATES <br> The two out of five delegates who say that religion is extremely important to them hold stronger positions on most social issues than do less-religious delegates: <br> In addition, these delegates are more accepting of some overlap between religion, values and government. 90% would like to see the candidates for president discuss the role of religion in their lives during the campaign, and 68% think that government should play an activist role in promoting traditional values. <br> ECONOMIC POLICY <br> Republican delegates support free trade, and few call for more government regulation of business. Current views resemble those of Republican delegates in 2000, and reflect traditional Republican positions on these business issues. <br> 53% of delegates support free trade, even if it hurts domestic industries. 32% think trade restrictions are needed to protect domestic business. Their voters are even more supportive of free trade: nearly three in four Republican voters nationally reject trade restrictions. <br> TRADE RESTRICTIONS OR FREE TRADE? <br> Democrats both delegates and voters -- are much more supportive of trade restrictions. <br> Overall, few delegates want more government regulation of business -- a view that has changed little among this group over the years. 50% think government is now doing enough to regulate the environmental and safety practices of business, 26% would like it do even less, and 15% thin kit ought to do more in this area. As might be expected, majorities of Democratic delegates and voters would like to see the government undertake more business regulation. <br> IMMIGRATION <br> A slight majority of Republican delegates, 52%, think legal immigration into the United States should be kept at its present level. A similar number of Democratic delegates said so in July. But Republican delegates are more likely than their Democratic counterparts to want decreased immigration: by a two-to-one margin, Republican delegates say immigration level should be decreased, while the Democratic delegates said immigration should be increased by 23% to 14%. <br> LEGAL IMMIGRATION SHOULD BE</b> <br> Delegates of both parties are out of touch with their own voters. Nationally, voters of both parties want to see decreased legal immigration, with 53% of Republican voters and 48% of Democratic voters saying so. <br> FOREIGN POLICY BEYOND IRAQ <br> Two-thirds of Republican delegates support Bush's approach of preemptive attack, as do 51% of Republican voters nationwide. Roughly seven in ten Democrats delegates and voters -- are against the idea of preemptive attack. <br> SHOULD U.S. BE ABLE TO LAUNCH A PREEMPTIVE ATTACK? <br> The two parties differ significantly on another foreign policy area -- working with the United Nations. While Republican voters generally think it is important for the U.S. to work through the U.N. to solve international problems, the Republican delegates are more divided. 51% think it is at least somewhat important to work through the U.N. (although just 7% think it is extremely important), but 46% of Republican delegates do not think it is important for the U.S. to take a multilateral approach in solving international problems. <br> IMPORTANT FOR U.S. TO WORK THROUGH U.N. TO SOLVE PROBLEMS <br> In contrast, eight in ten Democratic delegates believed it is extremely important for the U.S. to work through the U.N.; no Democratic delegate thought working through the U.N. is unimportant. Views among Democratic voters nationwide are similar. <br> POSITIVE VIEWS OF MODERATE SPEAKERS <br> Republican delegates (and their voters) are quite enthusiastic about some convention speakers who do not necessarily share the typical party positions on certain issues, and their own conservative ideology. <br> Nine out of ten Republican delegates view former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, scheduled to address the convention on opening night, favorably; just 2% views him unfavorably. Nationally, two-thirds of Republican voters have favorable views of Giuliani, but one-third is undecided. <br> VIEWS OF RUDOLPH GIULIANI <br> Six in ten Republican delegates view Arizona Senator John McCain, another opening night speaker, favorably. 16% of the delegates view him unfavorably. McCain is one of few political figures about whom both Republican and Democratic delegates agree. In July, 56% of delegates to the Democratic convention viewed the Arizona Senator favorably; 17% were unfavorable. Voters with opinions in both parties also like McCain. <br> VIEWS OF JOHN MCCAIN <br> While both conservative and moderate Republicans hold positive views of McCain, moderates are much more likely to do so. 56% of conservatives and 74% of moderate delegates sees McCain favorably. <br> California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is also viewed positively by three quarters of the convention delegates. Republican voters nationwide view the California Governor favorably by 47% to 9%, though 43% of Republican voters are undecided or haven't heard enough about him to form an opinion. <br> VIEWS OF ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER <br> Conservative delegates also hold a favorable opinion of Schwarzenegger, despite the Governor's more moderate views on many social issues. <br> Two other prominent Republicans have lower profiles among both delegates and voters. Just over half of Republican delegates view House Majority Whip Tom DeLay favorably; 8% have unfavorable views of him, while 36% of the delegates haven't heard enough about Tom DeLay to form an opinion. Moderate delegates also hold a positive view of him, but are more likely to be undecided on Delay or haven't heard enough about him yet. Nationwide, just one in ten Republican voters have favorable views of the House Majority Whip, and eight in ten Republican voters are either undecided or haven't heard enough about him. <br> Six in ten Republican delegates view Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie favorably, while four in ten say they haven't heard enough about him to form an opinion. Hardly anyone has an unfavorable view of Chairman Gillespie. <br> VIEWS OF OTHER REPUBLICAN PARTY LEADERS <br> Republicans and Democrats, who agree about John McCain, also agree about Ralph Nader. Delegates to both parties' conventions have a negative view of the independent candidate. While many voters have any opinion at all about Nader, the Republicans and Democrats who do are also negative. <br> ARE CONVENTIONS STILL NEEDED? <br> Nearly all delegates to both parties' conventions say political conventions are still needed so the public can see who the members of the parties are and what they stand for. Voters nationally, especially Republican voters, are not as convinced. While 50% of Republican voters think political conventions are still needed, 44% say they are outdated and no longer necessary. <br> NEW YORK CITY <br> This will not be the first trip to New York City for many of these Republican delegates. And nearly all of them will be happy to come. 84% say they have been to New York before, and nearly all the delegates - 94% - have a positive image of New York. Nationally, 78% of Republican voters also have a good impression of the city of New York. <br> IMAGE OF NEW YORK CITY <br> More than eight in 10 delegates think it was a good idea for the Republicans to hold their convention in New York City this year.Only 9% of GOP delegates think it was a bad idea. Those who think it was a bad idea for New York to host the convention are more likely than those who think it was a good one to be worried about a terror attack during the convention. <br> HOLDING THE GOP CONVENTION IN NEW YORK CITY A GOOD IDEA? <br> New Yorkers, however, think the convention should have been held somewhere else. 41% of New Yorkers say it was a good idea for the Republicans to hold their convention in New York City, but 52% say they should have gone someplace else. <br> While in New York, delegates plan to do some sight-seeing. The Statue of Liberty, which recently re-opened after having been closed since September 11, tops the list as the place delegates want to visit most with 21%. 16% say the want to visit ground zero - the site of the terror attacks on the Twin Towers. Another 7% say they would like to take in a Broadway show. <br> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHILE VISITING NEW YORK? <br> As for one of the oldest rivalries in Major League Baseball, these Republican delegates say they would root for the New York Yankees over the Boston Red Sox. The Democratic delegates, who held their convention in Boston last month, would back the Red Sox over the Yankees. <br> CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM <br> One view that Republican and Democratic delegates share: they both believe that recent campaign finance changes (commonly known as the "McCain-Feingold" reforms) are making it harder for their candidates to compete. 44% of Republican delegates think the new law changes are making things harder for Republican candidates, 38% say they have had no effect and almost none of them think they've made life easier. Democratic delegates last month shared similar views about the impact of the laws on their own party. <br> THE MCCAIN-FEINGOLD CAMPAIGN REFORMS <br> This poll was conducted in early and mid-August, before the height of the recent controversy over ads by "Swift Vote Veterans for Truth." 48% of the Republican delegates said they have not heard much about "527's" in general. Those who have are roughly divided over whether the activities of those groups are helping or hurting the GOP's candidates: 19% say 527's have made no difference in the campaign; 13% say they are hurting GOP candidates and 11% say they are helping. <br> THE 2004 REPUBLICAN DELEGATE SURVEY METHODOLOGY <br> For the last few weeks, CBS News and The New York Times have been interviewing a random sample of delegates to the 2004 Republican National Convention by phone, fax, mail and email. This report summarizes the results of 1,200 interviews. <br> Much of the delegate contact information came from individual state parties. Some states' parties were more cooperative than others. We did not interview delegates representing American Samoa and Guam. The final data set is representative of all delegates to the convention, with the appropriate demographic and political distributions.The error due to sampling could be plus or minus 2 percentage points for the full sample of Republican delegates. <br> WHO ARE THE REPUBLICAN DELEGATES? <br> There are some key differences between delegates to this year's Republican Convention and those of previous years, according to interviews conducted by CBS News and the New York Times with a random sample of 1,200 Republican delegates. <br> More than four in 10 GOP delegates are women -- up from 2000. The number of delegates who say they are evangelical or born-again is also higher than it was in 2000. And while one in five Republican delegates are veterans, this number is down from 2000. This year, more delegates are members of the National Rifle Association (NRA). <br> Notable demographic characteristics of the 2004 Republican delegates include: 
 This column from The Nation was written by Kevin Phillips.<hr width="75%">John Kerry can win, given George W. Bush's incompetence, and White House strategists realize that. All the Democrats need to do is to peel away some of the Republican "unbase" -- the most wobbly members of the GOP coalition. The caveat is that not many Democrats understand that coalition or why it has beaten the Democrats most of the time since 1968. Nor do most understand the convoluted but related role of Bill Clinton in aborting what could have been a 1992-2004 (or 2008) mini-cycle of Democratic White House dominance and in paving the way for George W. <br> Elements of this shortsightedness are visible in both the party and the Kerry campaign. While attempts to harness "Anybody but Bush" psychologies and to attract voters without saying much that is controversial might win Kerry a narrow victory, this strategy would be unlikely to create a framework for successful four- or eight-year governance. Deconstructing the Republican coalition is a better long-term bet, and could be done. The result, however, might be to uncage serious progressive reform. <br> Republicans, in contrast, have been successful in thinking strategically since the late 1960s. From 1968 until Bill Clinton's triumph in 1992, Republicans won five of the six presidential elections, and even Jimmy Carter's narrow victory in 1976 was in many respects a post-Watergate fluke. The two main coalitional milestones were Richard Nixon's 61 percent in 1972 and Ronald Reagan's 59 percent in 1984. <br> The two Bushes, notwithstanding their dynastic achievement, represent the later-stage weakness of the coalition, which would have been more obvious without the moral rebukes of Clinton that were critical in the 1994 and 2000 elections. In the three presidential elections the Bushes have fought to date, their percentages of the total national vote have been 53.9 percent (1988), 37.7 percent (1992) and 47.9 percent (2000) -- an average of 46.5 percent. Keep in mind that in 1992, Bush Senior got the smallest vote share of any President seeking re-election since William Howard Taft in 1912, while in 2000, the younger Bush became the first President to be elected without winning a plurality of the popular vote since Benjamin Harrison in 1888. The aftermath of 9/11 created transient strength, but the essential weakness of the Bushes was palpable again by mid-2004. <br> Strategizing on behalf of a family with more luck and lineage than gravitas, the principal strategists for each Bush President -- Lee Atwater for number 41 and Karl Rove for number 43 -- have necessarily been Machiavellian students of the Republican presidential coalition and how to maintain it. After helping to elect 41 in 1988 because Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis was an Ivy League technocrat unconvincing as an occasional populist, Atwater observed that "the way to win a presidential election against the Republicans is to develop the class-warfare issue, as Dukakis did at the end. To divide up the have and have-nots." Since then, the focus on keeping Republicans together has evolved and intensified. <br> Despite the Republican weakness evident in 1992 and Bush's second-place finish in 2000, Rove is notable for his preoccupation with the GOP "base," which he presumably thinks of in normal majoritarian terms. However, in the case of Bush's running for election or re-election, it is also useful -- and the Democrats of 2004 would find it particularly worthwhile -- to focus on the GOP's "unbase." This, in essence, is the 20-25 percent of the party electorate that has been won at various points by three national anti-Bush primary and general election candidates with Republican origins: Ross Perot (1992), John McCain (2000) and, in a lesser vein, Patrick Buchanan (1992). <br> Most of the shared Perot-McCain issues -- campaign and election reform, opposition to the religious right, distaste for Washington lobbyists, opposition to upper-bracket tax biases and runaway deficits, criticism of corporations and CEOs -- are salient today and more compatible with the mainstream moderate reformist Democratic viewpoint than with the lobbyist-driven Bush Administration. Perot and Buchanan's economic nationalism (anti-outsourcing, anti-NAFTA) and criticism of Iraq policy under the two Bushes is also shared by many Democrats. <br> Taking things somewhat further, these members of the "unbase" of the Republican presidential coalition ought to be the Democrats' key target because (1) they have some degree of skepticism about Bush and (2) they are the segment of the GOP coalition most logically open to recruitment for a progressive realignment, short-term or otherwise. That is the way small or large realignments work: by wooing the most empathetic part of the current coalition. <br> In 1992, when Perot drew 19 percent of the November vote, George Bush Senior got only about 80 percent of the Republican vote. Most of the "unbase" and part of the base deserted. If McCain had been well funded in 2000, he might have been able to get 30-40 percent in GOP primaries nationally, and even without serious money, he did win the primaries in seven states, including New Hampshire, Michigan and Connecticut. Sticking with the idea that the GOP "unbase" is somewhere between 20 percent and 25 percent, Bush can afford to lose 5 to 7 percent of the overall Republican electorate. But if he loses 10 percent, he's probably done for, and if he drops 15 percent, he's finished. <br> It could happen. Back in late winter, when Kerry still had a winner's aura from the primaries, one CBS News poll showed 11 percent of those who had voted for Bush in 2000 were unprepared to do so in 2004. That was enough to put Kerry ahead, at least until the GOP's spring advertising blitz. Kerry looked better by late June, but part of the reason for Kerry's -- and the Democrats' -- failure to capitalize on Bush's weaknesses is that they seem unable to decide between two very different strategies. One might be called the Wall Street strategy, which includes rhetoric about failed policies in Iraq and GOP tax cuts that pander to the rich, but avoids most specifics or bold indictments of Bush failure. Critiques of U.S. economic polarization, NAFTA or globalization are sidestepped, and the example of Clinton-era federal deficit reduction so admired by Wall Street is held up. Indeed, Kerry's demeanor is appropriate to a man married into one of the biggest U.S. corporate fortunes. <br> It is plausible to think that this will enable Kerry to draw a slightly improved vote among upper-middle-class and even fat-cat Republicans disenchanted with Bush as an incompetent cowboy who has bungled Iraq and pandered to Falwell, Robertson and Bob Jones University. Pinstriped caution has already helped the Massachusetts Senator to haul in record levels of Democratic contributions, some from Republicans and independents. Still, for all its success in Manhattan, the Hamptons and Santa Barbara, this is not a strategy that resonates with swing voters in battleground states from Ohio to New Mexico. <br> The alternative -- at once bolder and riskier, but with a larger potential electorate -- involves targeting the ordinary Republicans who rejected at least one generation of Bushes to back Perot or McCain. These voters -- not a few thousand elites but millions of the rank and file -- are concentrated in the middle-class precincts of swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado and the Pacific Coast. <br> Even by the campaign's own polls, it is precisely the Perot-McCain states that Kerry most needs to win. For Democratic and left-tilting progressives, the second benefit is luring voters drawn to the outsider economics of Perot and McCain, not to the insider calculations of big donors and fundraisers like former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. It is the Perot-McCain constituency, more than the elite Democratic entente, that could best catalyze a bipartisan progressive coalition. A partial analogy, at least, can be made to the role that GOP progressives like George Norris, Hiram Johnson and Robert La Follette Jr. played during the 1930s in launching the New Deal. Convincing John McCain to run for Vice President in a Kerry fusion ticket would have been the strongest tactic, but Edwards is a persuasive alternative. Now for Kerry to repeat the boldness and refreshing candor would be an important further change of pace. <br> In addition to adopting a bolder style, national Democrats also need to grasp Bill Clinton's role during the 1990s in aborting some national trends and stirring others that did his party considerable harm. Indeed, Clinton's moral notoriety was central to the rise of George W. Bush at two junctures -- Bush's initial election as governor of Texas in 1994, a year dominated (especially in Dixie) by an anti-Clinton backlash, and the presidential race of 2000, in which regional disgust with Clinton was so strong that even Tennessee Southern Baptist Al Gore could not carry Arkansas and Tennessee against the religion-linked Bush campaign for moral restoration. <br> Without these offsets to Clinton's lengthy prosperity, it seems clear that 1992 should have ushered in a twelve-to-sixteen-year Democratic mini-cycle. Indeed, the sixteen-point collapse in Bush Senior's vote between 1988 and 1992 was the sort of hemorrhage mostly seen on previous realignment occasions. Clinton's failure to take advantage of this opportunity, instead facilitating the Bushes' return in dynastic form, is one of the too-little-understood ingredients of the 2000 upheaval. <br> Part of the emptiness of the Democrats' pinstriped or don't-rock-the-boat strategy is that it doesn't grapple with these circumstances. Not just the South but the kindred pivotal border states and the Ohio Valley cannot be counted on to reward a Democrat trumpeting the Clinton memory and legacy. Nor does bland centrism effectively respond to the Bush family's regaining of the presidency in 2000 by tactics and subsequent inroads on small-d democracy and small-r republicanism to which only a feckless Democratic nominee could turn the other cheek. <br> However, let it pass for the moment that Bush was put in office only by a 5-to-4 decision of the Supreme Court, hijacked the Democrats' mini-cycle, fought and botched the first father-and-son war in U.S. annals and convinced 55-60 percent of Americans that the nation is on the wrong course. There is a more stark yardstick that even cautious Democrats should understand: In 1991-92, George H.W. Bush, prior to his defeat, fell from a record high job-approval rating of 90 percent after the Gulf War to a low 30s summer bottom before the election. His son, who hit the low 90s right after 9/11, by early June had fallen to 42-43 percent, another fifty-point decline. No elected President has ever done this; the Bushes have done it twice. Maybe it's the gene pool. <br> Back in 1992, Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot went after Bush with the gloves off, softening him up so that the Democratic nominee Clinton didn't have to do that much. In 2000 Al Gore didn't run a strong campaign -- his occasional populism was as labored as fellow Harvard man Dukakis's in 1988 -- but some Republicans and independents had taken their cues from McCain. This year, by contrast, Bush had no primary challenge and will have no ex-Republican third-party opponent. Sure, some Republicans have attacked Bush through books, but while that's probably been worth a point or two, it's not the same thing. <br> To win this election decisively, John Kerry is going to have to feel the same outrage that Howard Dean felt, and he's going to have to express some of it with the same merciless candor that the Republican dissidents have employed against two generations of Bushes. In today's circumstances of a nation on the wrong track, most swing voters -- especially wavering GOP men who grew up on John Wayne movies -- will not be content with pablum. The Edwards selection seemed assertive, but if Kerry reverts to equivocation, he could face the ultimate epitaph on a political tombstone: Here lies John Kerry, the first Democratic nominee to lose to a Bush President who'd already dropped fifty points in job approval and earned the snickers of half the world. <br> By Kevin PhillipsReprinted with permission from the The Nation 
 This story from The Nation was written by John Nichols. <hr width="75%"> <br> Never let it be said that John Kerry rushes to judgment. Four months after just about every other Democrat had decided a Kerry-Edwards ticket was the best bet for the party, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has accepted the conventional wisdom and named North Carolina Senator John Edwards as his vice presidential running mate. <br> From that January night when Kerry and Edwards topped Howard Dean in the Iowa caucuses -- effectively ending the Vermont governor's chances of securing the Democratic nomination -- there was talk about how Kerry and Edwards would be the best combination for the party. Kerry was always seen as the ticket topper. While Edwards was a better campaigner, Kerry had the organization and the money that would allow him to prevail in the primaries. And so he did. But as soon as Edwards folded his campaign in early March, after Kerry swept the Super Tuesday primaries, the question became: When are these two guys going to get together? <br> Why, then, did it take four months to close the deal? Why didn't Kerry name his running mate in the spring, as some aides suggested he might, in order to mount a two-man challenge to the Bush-Cheney ticket during the critical months of late spring and early summer? <br> Kerry wasn't ready, or willing, to embrace Edwards any sooner than he did. It was no secret that Kerry thought of Edwards as something of a hot dog, a first-term senator who entered politics as a mid-life career change and still seemed to be a bit better at delivering a stump speech than at sorting through the details of public policy. Kerry, a four-term senator, was more comfortable with another Washington insider, former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. But Gephardt inspired less enthusiasm than Kerry. Eventually, even Gephardt acknowledged as much; in a conversation several days ago, the Missourian quietly released Kerry to select Edwards. <br> The consistently cautious Kerry was never going to make a dangerous or unexpected choice. But he might well have picked someone other than Edwards -- Gephardt, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack or Florida Senator Bob Graham -- if he had opened enough of a lead to look like a frontrunner. That never happened. With the election less than four months away, Kerry is, at best, running even with President Bush nationally and he is behind in a number of battleground states. <br> As the time to name a running mate approached, Kerry knew he needed to pump up the volume. And Edwards, who campaigned for the vice presidency more aggressively than anyone since Richard Nixon in 1952, made it clear to everyone that he was ready to give the Kerry campaign a charisma infusion. <br> It's a given that Edwards adds star quality to the ticket. On paper, he's a decade younger than Kerry; in person, he looks two decades younger. Edwards came out of the primary campaign with a reputation as the best candidate on the stump; in fact, several other candidates, including Dean and Al Sharpton, delivered better speeches, and Gephardt and Dennis Kucinich often scored more debating points. What distinguished Edwards was that his speeches were consistently solid and effective -- and, as he began to speak more and more about poverty, the most moving -- and his debate performances, while sometimes less than stellar, were never weak or embarrassing. What distinguished him even more was the skill with which he handled the press, and his ease as a one-on-one campaigner. Edwards wades into a crowd every bit as enthusiastically as Bill Clinton, and that's going to count for a lot in the handshake-to-handshake combat that will characterize the campaigning in the battleground states that are likely to decide the fall race. <br> So what else does Edwards bring to the ticket: <br> Above all, however, Edwards brings to the Kerry campaign something that has been missing to this point: a recognizable and appealing domestic-policy message. Kerry secured the nomination by playing on his record as a veteran and his foreign policy and national security experience. Democratic caucus and primary voters bet, perhaps wisely, that those strengths would be needed in a race with Bush. But Kerry never developed a functional, let alone inspiring message for the home front. With his talk about the need to close the economic gap between what he referred to as the "two Americas," and with his emphasis on developing programs to aid the working poor, Edwards renewed old Democratic Party themes that will play very well -- especially with wavering Democrats and independents -- in a year when pessimism about the economy could yet decide the direction of the presidential race. <br> Add it all up and Edwards looks like a sound pick for Kerry. The best pick? Not necessarily. Other contenders might have brought more to the ticket. But, of the prospects the ever-cautious Kerry was willing to consider, Edwards always looked to be the candidate with the most to offer. Now, only the most fundamental question remains: Will Kerry, who was never as comfortable with Edwards as he was with other potential running mates, be flexible enough to really incorporate Edwards, and the North Carolinian's "two Americas" message, into the fabric of the campaign? If he does, he might yet prove one of the oldest American political cliches true: The vice presidential selection could be the most important choice of Kerry's campaign. <br> John Nichols is Washington correspondent for The Nation.<br>By John Nichols Reprinted with permission from The Nation 
 This Column from The New Republic was written by Jonathan Chait.<hr width="75%">Conservatives have been elegizing Ronald Reagan for well over a decade, and his death this week, predictably, occasioned a climactic frenzy of adulation. The exaltations have grown so familiar by now that they have turned into a kind of mental reflex: It is as obvious that Reagan bore direct responsibility for the political transformation within the Soviet Union as it is that he bore no responsibility for the budget deficits within the United States. Having achieved total unanimity on the multitudinous aspects of Reagan's greatness, the conservative tributes could be distinguished from one another only by the poetic superlatives they chose. It was a contest of obsequiousness. You half-expect Peggy Noonan to build her hero a funeral pyre and hurl herself onto it. <br> What's most interesting about Reagan-worship is not so much that it overlooks his flaws but that it specifically overlooks his departures from conservative orthodoxy. Above all else Reagan's admirers extol his ideological certitude. The Gipper, they agree, held simple but profound views about restraining government and fighting communism, and he never wavered from them in the face of carping liberals. This narrative may be broadly true. But, although he was no liberal nor even a moderate, Reagan did repeatedly abandon conservative dogma. That he is nonetheless remembered as an unyielding conservative says less about Reagan than it does about the contemporary Republicans who lay claim to his cause. <br> Consider, first, Reagan's contribution to the demise of the Eastern bloc. Reagan's decision to rebuild the debilitated post-Vietnam military supposedly compelled the Soviets to reform themselves by forcing them into a costly arms race that put even more pressure on their teetering economy. "In the end, Reagan won the Cold War not by defeating the Soviets militarily, but by showing them that we had economic resources they could never hope to match," wrote Bruce Bartlett last year in National Review Online. "They simply couldn't afford to keep up." <br> Whatever you think of that explanation, it's hard to square with Reagan's 1987 agreement with the Soviets to ban medium- and short-range nuclear missiles. After all, if forcing the Soviets to deploy more weapons caused them to produce fewer consumer goods and weakened their leader's will, then letting them deploy fewer weapons, and divert the savings into the consumer economy, would have had the opposite effect. At the time, the right viewed the treaty as a betrayal. CONSERVATIVES CAMPAIGNING AGAINST MISSILE TREATY, read a New York Times headline; most candidates for the 1988 GOP presidential nomination opposed the treaty. Today conservatives simply gloss over that decision. This week's page-length Wall Street Journal editorial mourning Reagan made no mention at all of that highly significant treaty. Instead it praised his "willingness to walk away from Reykjavik and at other times from an arms control process that had become an article of blind faith among U.S. elites." <br> The missile treaty was no fluke. Alongside Reagan's (justly) celebrated steely revulsion toward communism sat a wooly-headed, almost peacenik, sensibility. Washington Post reporter Lou Cannon's 1991 biography of Reagan -- celebrated for its fairness by left and right alike -- revealed Reagan's attachment to anti-cold war movies like "The Day After" and "War Games," which inveighed against the horrors of nuclear war in the most syrupy way. He had a particular affinity for the 1951 science fiction film "The Day the Earth Stood Still," in which an alien arrived and forced the United States and Soviet Union to make peace. Reagan invoked this trope so frequently that Colin Powell, his national security adviser, would tell his staff, "Here come the little green men again." Reagan even brought up the movie in his 1988 summit with Gorbachev -- who, understandably, didn't know quite what to make of it -- in the course of proposing a deal by which both sides would destroy their entire nuclear arsenals. All in all, his view toward the cold war was far different than the "moral clarity" that is currently ascribed to him. <br> Conservatives likewise hail Reagan as an uber-supply sider. In a lengthy obituary, The Washington Times recalled, "Mr. Reagan resisted congressional attempts to raise taxes, despite a deficit exceeding $200 billion by 1986. 'Go ahead, make my day,' the president baited Congress." Curiously absent from this and other hagiographic accounts is the fact that Reagan signed two large tax increases in 1982 and 1983 (the former, it should be noted, in the midst of a severe recession). <br> Conservatives hail as Reagan's crowning achievement the tax reform he signed in 1986. Today, conservatives remember it as one sweeping movement. "He pushed down incomes taxes, too, from a high of 70 percent when he entered the White House to a new low of 28 percent," wrote Noonan in the "Journal." In fact, tax reform was a deliberate effort by the Reagan administration to scale back some of the abuses of its original 1981 tax cut, which allowed many businesses and wealthy individuals to escape taxation completely. (Treasury Secretary Don Regan, who spearheaded the plan, regaled the president with tales of how the wealthy could get away without paying taxes.) <br> It's true that the bill reduced the top marginal tax rate to 28 percent, but it did so only by eliminating loopholes and preferences for the rich. The bill raised taxes on corporations and ended (temporarily, alas) preferential treatment for capital gains income. And so, while it reduced nominal rates, Reagan's tax reform made the affluent pay a higher share of the tax burden. All this made it anathema to conservatives at the time. Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, and Dick Cheney led a revolt among House Republicans, who were backed by the business lobby, which stood to lose billions in tax preferences. It's inconceivable that a Republican president today would enact a progressive tax reform like that. Any Republican in good party standing would denounce such a thing as "class warfare." <br> It's also inconceivable that moderates like Donald Regan -- or Howard Baker, Richard Darman, David Stockman, or James Baker -- could be given decision-making authority over domestic policy in George W. Bush's Republican Party. That fact explains why Reagan would alter his policies and abandon conservative dogma when circumstances warranted. It's not that Reagan had a more supple ideology or greater command of the facts than Bush. It's that the ideological and political superstructure of the GOP has changed so much since then. Republican intellectual debates take place within a universe controlled entirely by the right. The party has built an ironclad alliance with the business lobby, from whom total loyalty is expected (GOP leaders police the lobbies to ensure that they don't hire, or give money, to Democrats) and to whom it is given in return. Reagan-worship constitutes an important element of that ideological edifice. That the reality of Reagan differed from the memory of Reagan is precisely the point: Myths are created in order to teach certain lessons. Republicans today agree that Reagan was America's greatest modern president, and that his greatness derived from his unswerving devotion to conservative principle. To violate Reagan's principles would not only insult his memory, it would contravene the laws of the political universe. The Reagan gospel, to be sure, is interpreted selectively. But then, so is the Bible. <br> <b>Jonathan Chait is a senior editor at The New Republic</i> <br> By Jonathan Chait 
 Given that John Kerry has thus far staked his presidential campaign largely on the economy's failure to produce jobs, it's no surprise that he was left spinning furiously after employers reportedly had added a healthy 308,000 positions last month. This hopeful development, he argued, was the result of some onetime occurrences -- for example, the end of a grocery-workers' strike in California. Besides, he continued, many of the new jobs were part-time. "So you are not looking at the kind of robust, important job creation that the country really needs to raise the standard of living in our country," he concluded during a roundtable discussion with reporters. <br> It is, of course, easy to poke fun at the Democrats' occasionally verbose and meandering presumptive nominee. But Kerry's defensive tone on the March jobs report highlights a more fundamental flaw in his economic message: By focusing on short-term economic outcomes and quality-of-life indicators -- many of which have little or no connection to anything the administration has done -- he's failing to deliver a broad critique of Bush's economic policies and values, missing the forest for the trees. <br> To the extent the Kerry campaign has hinted at a broad economic critique, it's that the plight of the middle class has worsened substantially on George W. Bush's watch. During the primaries, Kerry focused on job creation. More recently, he needled the administration over rising gas prices. Then, this week, his campaign unveiled an attempt to unify these complaints: a so-called <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kerry-us-misery-index-rising-12-04-2004/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">misery index</span> -- which combined jobs and gas prices with factors like the rise in college tuition, health care costs, and personal bankruptcies, along with the stagnation in personal incomes -- to indict Bush for the country's worst economic stretch in three decades. <br> Gregg Easterbrook has noted one problem with this approach. Another is that, as the jobs report showed, focusing on short-term indicators makes you look pretty silly whenever one of them improves, even if only temporarily. Moreover, many of the negative outcomes Kerry decries aren't really Bush's fault. Job growth, for example, has been slow mostly because unprecedented productivity growth (generally a good thing) has made it unnecessary to hire new employees even as the economy expands. <br> But the biggest problem is that, by concentrating on a grab bag of disparate indicators assembled only because they're all negative, Kerry is missing an opportunity to focus attention, broadly but clearly, on the ongoing pattern of fiscal recklessness and economic injustice that has consistently characterized the administration's policies. Yes, there are times when running on voters' anxieties -- whether or not they have anything to do with administration mismanagement -- is the only option a presidential challenger has. In 1992, for example, George H.W. Bush's generally sound management of the economy left Bill Clinton with no other choice. <br> But 2004 is not 1992. And, unlike the first Bush administration, the current one has taken every opportunity to reward the wealthy interests that finance its election efforts at the expense of the public good: a reduction of the top marginal income tax rate, a planned repeal of the estate tax, a large reduction in the tax on dividend income and capital gains, a "Medicare reform" bill that doubles as a windfall for pharmaceutical companies, an energy policy heavily skewed toward fossil-fuel industries -- the list goes on and on. Which is to say, whether or not college tuition rises this year, there are plenty of grounds on which to criticize the administration's economic stewardship. <br> John Edwards, Kerry's main rival in the Democratic primary race, developed a pithy and effective way of critiquing this agenda. The administration, Edwards argued, had embarked on a relentless effort to shift the country's tax burden from those who live off of their wealth to those who work for a living, and, more generally, to enforce one set of rules for the wealthy and another set for the poor and middle classes. Of course, each candidate has to articulate a critique that works for them, and it's unlikely that a Brahmin like Kerry would sound particularly believable aping Edwards, the son of a North Carolina mill-worker. But, unless Kerry can translate these same ideas into his own words -- perhaps using the Kennedy-esque language of shared mission and shared responsibility he tends to favor -- his chances of making inroads on domestic issues look worse and worse. As the recent jobs number demonstrates, economic circumstances may change between now and the election. President Bush's economic agenda won't. <br> The Editors 
 This column from The New Republic was written by Noam Scheiber.<hr width="75%">After more than a month of treating the coming Kerry-Bush match-up as a snoozer for the president, last week the nation's media woke up to the realization that Kerry might have a shot at winning after all. As documented by ABC's The Note, elite opinion seemed to shift when a combination of bad news (anemic job growth, pessimism about finding WMDs in Iraq, the upwardly revised cost of the recent "Medicare reform" bill) and White House missteps (the president's uninspiring performances during the State of the Union and on "Meet the Press," the apparent stonewalling of the 9/11 commission) gave the Kerry campaign an opening it quickly seized. <br> But, in retrospect, maybe the conventional wisdom on the presidential campaign shifted a little too quickly. As Karl Rove bragged yesterday to an audience of conservative activists, this week the Bush campaign regained much of the initiative it appeared to lose in the aftermath of the Democratic primaries. More importantly, that's a development that seems much more indicative of the campaign to come. Why more indicative? Because while Bush's early setbacks stemmed from a relatively fleeting set of circumstances -- including the Bush camp's surprise at the sudden, post-Iowa change in Kerry's fortunes -- Kerry's stem from a series of disadvantages more or less baked into the electoral cake. <br> One of Kerry's bigger problems is the difference between the two candidates' gut-level instincts. Bush in his natural state is an anti-intellectual cowboy: heavy on bravado, light on nuance. When he lets slip what he's really thinking -- like his ill-advised "bring it on" comment from last year -- and that comment gets repeated by political opponents, it probably alienates half the country, but it galvanizes the other half and ends up a wash. Kerry at his most authentic is a committed internationalist -- someone who values the stability of alliances over the freedom of unilateral action. There's nothing wrong with this position per se. Except that, when expressed in a single, unguarded comment capable of being distorted by political opponents, it probably alienates considerably more than half the voting public. <br> I'm obviously thinking here of Kerry's recent line about having met with "more leaders" rooting for him to beat Bush. (More than what? Unclear.) In addition to the very real possibility that the statement isn't true -- a possibility Bush and his surrogates have used to raise questions about Kerry's honesty -- it gives the Bush campaign an opportunity to invoke its most potent wedge issue: the perception that Democrats can't be trusted to defend American interests in the face of foreign opposition. (One Bush commercial has already accused Kerry of wanting to "delay defending America until the United Nations approved.") As Dick Cheney said in response to Kerry's remark on Tuesday, "We are the ones who get to determine the outcome of this election, not unnamed foreign leaders." Bottom line: Assuming the two candidates are equally likely to commit gaffes, the fallout from Kerry's gaffes is going to be more damaging. <br> Worse, the "more leaders" flap exposes a second weakness of the Kerry campaign: While its rapid response apparatus has capitalized on the Bush campaign's early mistakes -- in my mind, the Kerry people did a tremendous job scoring points on Bush's tacky 9/11 ad -- this machinery has proved less effective on defense. The problem is that the point of a rapid response strategy isn't just to offer some response -- any response -- when the candidate is attacked, so long as it's quick. The point is to offer a response that effectively deadens the issue -- a goal sometimes better accomplished without the over-the-top, war-room approach that's been the Kerry campaign's only speed to date. <br> During the "more leaders" contretemps, for example, the Kerry camp's response was to claim that what Kerry had actually said ("more leaders") was much more vague than the quote that first appeared in newspapers ("foreign leaders") -- so much so that, according to Kerry spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter, the phrase could have referred to "anybody, here at home, abroad, anybody." (This was at odds with the context of Kerry's comment, which clearly indicated he was talking about foreigners.) And, oh yeah, the campaign also trotted out Democratic foreign policy luminaries like Bill Richardson, Richard Holbrooke, and Madeleine Albright to argue, as Holbrooke did, "It's so obviously the truth what Kerry said, and the Republicans are just having fun with it." Shockingly, none of this proved very effective at making the issue go away. Unfortunately, things only get worse from here on out: Kerry, by virtue of his long voting record in the Senate, is going to be playing a lot of defense. <br> Kerry's third structural weakness is that having a reputation for being both a liberal and a flip-flopper is a combustible combination: Whatever you do to rebut one charge just confirms the other. Take gay marriage. In the past Kerry has tended to stake out relatively liberal terrain on the issue -- for example, he voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. This would seem to put him to the left of the average swing voter, a position that could be exploited by the Bush campaign. So how would Kerry insulate himself from this kind of attack? The only way that comes to mind is by moving rightward -- which Kerry did earlier this year when he hinted he might support an amendment to the Massachusetts constitution banning gay marriage. In one fell swoop Kerry transformed himself from a liberal on gay marriage to ... a flip-flopper on gay marriage. <br> Of course, polls consistently put gay marriage at the bottom of voters' lists of concerns. The question is whether the same dynamic would apply to something closer to the top of those lists -- say, national security. Kerry provided a tentative answer Tuesday in West Virginia. Responding to a Bush ad thrashing him for voting against last year's $87 billion supplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan, Kerry managed an impressive trifecta of ineffectiveness: "I actually did vote for his $87 billion, before I voted against it," Kerry told a crowd of veterans at Marshall University, before going on to explain that the version he voted for would have been paid for by repealing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Which is to say, Kerry's first instinct was to move rightward ("I actually did vote for his $87 billion"), his second instinct was to strive for consistency ("...before I voted against it), and his third instinct was to retreat into the kind of inside-the-beltway legislative-ese that got him into so much trouble last summer and fall. <br> Which brings us to Kerry's final structural disadvantage: For all the talk about various Democratic-leaning 527s (that is, independent nonprofits) helping to balance out Bush's huge financial advantage, Tuesday's showdown in West Virginia showed why nothing beats good old-fashioned hard money when it comes to waging a presidential campaign. Before Kerry could touch down in West Virginia, the Bush campaign had saturated the airwaves with the aforementioned weak-on-national-security commercial -- which framed the debate for Kerry's West Virginia trip in terms most favorable to Bush. By contrast, because none of the 527s trying to help Kerry can coordinate their message with his campaign (at least not legally), Bush is much less likely to face such focused debate-framing when he touches down in the swing states he's targeting. <br> Kerry sympathizers will respond that this kind of analysis reads way too much into what was, after all, only one week. Would that they were right. But a simple look at some recent polling data suggests that's unlikely. Several weeks of favorable coverage during the Democratic primaries and a couple of months of White House missteps had conspired to give Kerry a statistically significant lead over Bush in most polls by late February. This week, a New York Times/CBS Newspoll showed Kerry suffering a 10-point net reversal in his favorable/unfavorable ratings since that time. Maybe that's the kind of thing that happens even to fundamentally strong candidates when they suffer a couple of bad days. But, given the speed and size of the turnaround, the numbers seem far more likely to suggest that Kerry is settling into his natural equilibrium. Unfortunately for Democrats, that's not the one that has him winning in November. <br> <b>Noam Scheiber is an associate editor at TNR. <br> By Noam Scheiber 
 When first-term Illinois Senator Peter Fitzgerald announced last year he would not be seeking reelection in 2004, he seemed to be handing Democrats a golden opportunity to pick up a Senate seat. The state GOP was still reeling in the wake of a series of scandals, Democrats had claimed the governor's mansion and the statehouse in the 2002 elections, and Illinois's changing demographics were pushing the state to the left. The early favorites for the Democratic nomination were Dan Hynes, the 35-year-old state comptroller and son of longtime machine politician Tom Hynes, and Blair Hull, a former securities trader worth about $500 million. Hynes's clout impressed some, but many political observers believed that Hull's deep pockets would prove impossible to surmount. <br> But last night, as the primary returns rolled in, Hynes and Hull were both giving concession speeches and a young state senator named Barack Obama was declaring victory. How did Obama manage to overcome Hynes's reputation and Hull's personal wealth? The answer, in a nutshell: McCain-Feingold. In fact, it is possible that Obama is the first politician to be able to attribute an election victory in such large part to campaign finance reform. It is almost certain that he will not be the last. <br> One of the least-noted provisions of McCain-Feingold was the so-called millionaires' amendment, which raised the cap on personal donations for candidates running against self-funded millionaires. The amendment created a formula, based on the voting-age population of the state, that computes the amount a candidate may invest in his own campaign. Every dollar a self-funded candidate spends above the determined amount raises the donation cap for his opponents, up to a maximum of $12,000. (The standard donation cap is $2,000.) <br> The amendment was sponsored by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin to address a perceived problem in early drafts of McCain-Feingold: that eliminating soft money would amplify the advantage of millionaire candidates, since major parties could no longer flood their non-millionaire candidates with enough cash to reasonably compete. The amendment was hardly altruistic: In 1998, Durbin had watched banking heir Peter Fitzgerald wrest Illinois's other Senate seat from Carol Moseley Braun by spending $14 million of his own money. Fitzgerald overcame his own limited personal appeal by sequestering himself in the final days of the campaign and bombarding the airways with negative ads. <br> In many ways, Fitzgerald was the model for Hull, whose strategy was to spend early and spend often. Six months before the election, he had already spent $6.3 million of his fortune on signs, television advertising, and a series of gimmicky bus trips with seniors to Canada to buy prescription drugs. By late February he had spent over $20 million of his own money, and the strategy seemed to be working. Despite his complete lack of political experience, Hull was claiming 24 percent in the polls, ahead of 15 percent for Obama, and 11 percent for Hynes. <br> To be sure, Obama did not overcome this deficit solely because of McCain-Feingold. With an impressive resume -- he was the first black editor of The Harvard Law Review -- and endorsements from both The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times, he didn't lack for political appeal. He also got some help from Hull, whose candidacy imploded following a series of revelations about his personal life -- first that he hadn't bothered to vote in several recent elections; then, that his ex-wife had sought a civil order of protection against him; and finally, after he released his sealed divorce records, that his ex-wife had alleged he called her a "(big-time expletive deleted)" and punched her in the shin. <br> But Obama wouldn't have been able to take advantage of Hull's collapse if he hadn't exploited the millionaires' amendment to raise as much money as he did. Of course, McCain-Feingold didn't hand Obama the money; he still had to raise it. And it's a testament to the passionate, Howard Dean-like devotion he inspired that so many donors were willing to fork over such large amounts. (This phenomenon was not limited to the well-heeled. To wit, full disclosure: I turned my twenty-fifth birthday party into a kegger for Obama and raised $1,200 from my largely broke 20-something friends.) But the millionaires' amendment allowed Obama to convert the intense support felt by a relatively small number of wealthy donors -- among them George Soros, Michael Jordan, and a number of college professors and public intellectuals -- into television spots and a field operation that reached a wide audience. Meanwhile, as Hull kept digging deeper into his own pockets, the donation cap kept rising, meaning Obama could continue to return to the same loyal supporters for more and more money as the campaign wore on. "[The millionaire amendment] really did a great job in what it set out to do: leveling the playing field," says Obama Finance Director Claire Serdiuk. <br> Indeed, of the $5.6 million Obama raised during the campaign, $3 million came from 480 individual donors who contributed more than the usual limit of $2,000. Without the millionaires' amendment, those 480 donors only could have contributed $960,000 -- a difference of over $2 million, or more than a third of Obama's campaign war chest. <br> Campaign finance reformers would be entitled to celebrate Obama's triumph -- but they're quick to the point out that the millionaires' amendment could create as many problems as it solves. For one thing, says Paul Sanford of the Center for Responsive Politics, the amendment overwhelmingly favors incumbents, "because most of the time, the millionaire candidates are challengers. The incumbent candidates don't need to be millionaires because they can raise a lot of money." Also, if the rationale for capping donations is to limit corruption, or the appearance thereof, there's no reason to suppose that a candidate is any less corruptible just because he happens to be running against a millionaire. Because Obama's politics are decidedly non-corporate, and much of the support from his biggest donors came when he still looked like a long-shot, fears that he will serve their interests unduly are easy to dismiss. (It's hard, for example, to imagine University of Chicago professors suddenly leaning on Senator Obama to stick a loophole for public intellectuals into the tax code.) But Obama won't be the last candidate to benefit from the amendment, and it's not hard to conceive of a scenario in which the effects of the amendment wouldn't be so benign, at least for Democrats: Imagine, for instance, a self-funded millionaire liberal who runs a campaign crusading against big pharma, only to be beaten back by a windfall of $12,000 checks from Merck executives. In fact, Republicans stand to gain plenty from the amendment, since half of all GOP senators who lost to Democratic challengers in the last two elections were unseated by self-funded millionaires. <br> All of this remains very relevant as Obama prepares to face millionaire Jack Ryan in the general election. Ryan put $3.5 million of his own money into his successful bid for the Republican nomination, and he may be tempted to open up his checkbook even further in the general election. But if he's learned anything from observing the Democratic primary, he knows that using his personal fortune will carry a potentially steep cost. Will the threat of Obama's fundraising prowess convince Ryan not to use his own funds? If so, then Barack Obama will have breathed genuine political life into the millionaires' amendment of McCain-Feingold. And that's a good thing -- for now. <br> <b>Christopher Hayes is a freelance writer living in Chicago. <br> By Christopher Hayes 
 This Against the Grain commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer. <hr width="80%">Public Enemy Number One for the vast majority of Democrats is George Bush. Ralph Nader, liberal icon, occupies the second slot on the enemies list. Something is wrong with that picture. <br> Nader is thinking about running for president again. That has provoked a nasty, vehement, righteous barrage of opposition from liberals, progressives, Democrats and assorted Bush-haters afraid a Nader campaign could help re-elect Bush. Their anxiety may be understandable, but the shut-Nader-up campaign is appalling. <br> I say: Go for it, Ralph. <br> Why? Because Nader is not to blame for the fact that Al Gore is not president. Because I believe vigorous, high profile third-party candidacies (as high profile as third parties get in this country, that is) are good, even crucial for the political system. Because skilled political mischief-makers capable of occasionally piercing the homogenized, focus group tested, corporate sponsored claptrap of the two big parties are a rare godsend. Because more voices are better than fewer voices. <br> If people oppose Nader and are committed to Anybody But Bush, they should give money or time to the Democrats. People who complain about the rightward drift of the Democratic party shouldn't and the importance of free, diverse political speech shouldn't be working to keep Nader off the ballot and the big stage. <br> After a long conversation with him, I believe Nader wants to run. He says he'll decide by the end of February. He won't hook up with the Green Party this time. The key factors in his decision are whether he thinks he can get the volunteers and money to mount a 50 state campaign. "The money is a problem," he said. Backers in 2000 have abandoned him, with a vengeance. <br> Money is a problem not just for Nader but for the network of public interest and consumer groups he invented. Public Citizen, the biggest group Nader founded, lost 20 percent of its membership and $1 million in donations after 2000. (Full disclosure: I worked for Public Citizen writing a book on federal tax policy in 1984.) That's a sign of just how thoroughly some people blame Ralph Nader for the sins of Al Gore, George Bush and the United State Supreme Court. <br> But this is pure scapegoating. It's emotional. <br> Blaming Nader for 2000 is like blaming Steve Bartman for the Cubs failure to get in the World Series last year. Sure, if Bartman had not innocently tried to catch that foul ball headed for Moises Alou's mitt, the Cubs might have won Game Six. But if the Cubs had won four previous games, they would have made the Series. They could have come back from that freak play and still have won Game Six. They could have won Game Seven. There are lots of "could haves." <br> In 2000, Gore could have won his home state like almost all the other candidates in U.S. history have. He could have waged a semi-competent campaign and won New Hampshire, Ohio, Arkansas and Florida, handily. The Supreme Court could have ruled for Gore. Nader spent two and a half days in Florida in 2000, but it's his fault we went to war in Iraq? Right. <br> Nader says the "liberal intelligentsia touts itself as the most tolerant voice in America." But with their rabid demand for him not to run, "They're crossing from opposition to censorship." He understands some of this. "They are desperate to replace Bush, " he said. But he is mystified as to why their opposition is so, well, rabid. He is particularly dumbstruck by an open letter in the Nation magazine, supposedly the leading voice of dissent and civil liberties in the leftie world, commanding him to not run. There's a Web site devoted to keeping him out of the race. A Stanford law professor and blogger named Lawrence Lessig likens Nader to the tobacco and auto executives he's famous for attacking. He's being vilified. <br> I don't understand the degree of the hostility. Nader doesn't seem to either. He thinks it has something to do with the Left's inferiority complex. Fear of a Nader run, he speculated, shows "how low liberalism's self-esteem has sunk, how low its expectations are." <br> Nader believes that his campaign would help unseat Bush. Go ahead, chortle dismissively. I think he 's right. Nader talks about "field testing" lines of attacks, rhetoric, issues that the Democrats are too timid to use. <br> Perfect example: A few weeks ago Michael Moore, appearing with the dearly departed General Clark, called Bush a "deserter." This was deemed not kosher; Clark was urged to denounce the gadfly and apologize to his Highness. Well, it might not be by the Marquis of Queensbury's rule of politics, but President's Bush National Guard service is now a huge issue and it has tapped into some people's concerns about his moral authority to be a "war president." <br> Nader believes another campaign would bring some people into politics, perhaps into the Democratic column in November, and wouldn't scare any voters off. He wants attention focused on issues he thinks Democrats are too cautious on: poverty, corporate crime, minimum wage, regulation, campaign finance reform and media consolidation. <br> Fundamentally, Nader believes that ballot-access and campaign finance laws that discourage third parties are a serious civil liberties issue, an issue not close to the radar screens of the established civil liberties groups. He is outraged the big boys kept him and Pat Buchanan out of the debates in 2000. They will do so again if he runs this year. It simply galls Nader that only two teams get to play in the big tournament. It's not in his nature to just take it without a fight. <br> I think the zealousness of Nader-phobia reflects a larger rage and ugliness that has infected both sides of this narrowly and bitterly divided electorate (an infection I have written about ad nauseum, I know). If you're not with us, you're against us and we hate you. Clinton-haters. Gore-haters. Bush-haters. Not opponents, haters. <br> But it is precisely in times like these when dissident voices -- Right, Left, Radical Center -- are especially important. The electorate is divided, yes, but a huge slice of the population is simply alienated from politics and government altogether. And these voters, or non-voters, are better served when they can cast loud protest votes. Sometimes these votes are so loud that a Jesse Ventura becomes a governor. Minnesota survived. <br> In response to Lessig's insults on his blog, someone posted a message supporting Nader that said many people "feel betrayed, abandoned, and utterly unrepresented. I refuse to turn the act of voting into a choice between the lesser of two evils. That's exactly what the 2000 elections appeared to be, and I pray that the 2004 elections will be different." Two parties, nearly as similar as Coke and Pepsi, don't satisfy all consumers. <br> Third parties and independent candidates have served the country pretty well over. If John Breckinridge hadn't run as a Southern Democrat in 1860, Abraham Lincoln might not have been elected. I think Perot, Buchanan, John Anderson and Nader spiced up the national debate. <br> I hope Nader runs. I hope someone to the right of Bush runs too. More is better.

 This column from The New Republic was written by Jonathan Cohn.<hr width="75%">Suddenly sensitive to the fact that 44 million Americans have no health insurance while millions more fear losing it because of skyrocketing premiums, the White House has spent the last few days promising that this year's State of the Union address would include a new plan to make health insurance more affordable. <br> But there was nothing "new" about the "plan" President Bush unveiled last night. It was a hodgepodge of ideas he first touted as a presidential candidate in April 2000, and that he has deployed strategically whenever the polls show health insurance affordability is an issue. More important, it's unlikely these ideas will make health insurance "more affordable" at least, not for the people who most need the help. <br> The ideas are so unserious they're barely worth considering, except insofar as they demonstrate just how far out of touch this White House really is. <br> Malpractice reform: Almost every serious study looking at the relationship between malpractice lawsuits and rising health care costs has shown the relationship to be essentially nonexistent. There's probably a case for reforming the system on other policy grounds: the court system is a lousy mechanism for regulating safety. But it's got almost nothing to do with the cost or availability of health insurance. <br> Tax credits: This is the most reasonable idea Bush is offering, since it's not hard to imagine how well-crafted tax credits could help a few million people struggling to afford health insurance. But the big problem for the uninsured isn't that they don't have the money to buy a reasonably priced insurance policy; it's that reasonably priced insurance policies aren't available to individual purchasers. Insurance only becomes affordable when you buy it as part of a group (which is why it helps to work for a big company that provides benefits). Without some kind of program to make good group health insurance available to individuals, tax credits would make only a modest dent in the number of uninsured Americans lowering that number by a few million at best. Meanwhile, tax credits might encourage more employers to stop offering coverage altogether, enough so that at least some studies suggest the overall impact would be negligible. <br> Association Health Plans (AHPs): These sound like a great idea. Since, as I just explained, it's hard for small groups to buy health insurance, why not let small businesses band together to buy insurance together? Well, no reason at all. But small businesses can already do that in most states. The reason more don't exercise that option is that states regulate insurance pretty tightly to make sure the benefits are decent, that there's no discrimination against the infirmed, and that the providers of insurance are solvent and legitimate businesses. What Bush and the conservatives aren't saying about their plan is that it would get rid of these regulations. No doubt, rates would get cheaper for many businesses as insurers started offering stripped-down plans perfectly adequate for healthy people and altogether lousy for the sick. That's one reason that, a few years ago, the Congressional Budget Office looked at AHPs and decided that they, too, would not significantly increase the number of people with health insurance. <br> If you're a real wonk, you can read more about these policies. But the more important lesson to draw from Bush's speech is what it says about his overall priorities: Even if you accept the most optimistic and, frankly, wildly unrealistic estimates of what these proposals would do, they'd reduce the number of uninsured by less than ten million. Compare this to what the Democratic presidential candidates are proposing. The least generous plan out there right now is John Edwards's, which would reduce the number of uninsured by some 21 million i.e., more than twice as much. The most ambitious plan, by Howard Dean, would reduce the number of uninsured by more than 30 million. John Kerry's would nearly match that, while simultaneously reducing the cost of insurance for those who already have it. <br> All of these things cost money, naturally between $50 and $90 billion a year which is why all of the Democratic candidates are proposing to repeal some or all of the Bush tax cuts to pay for them. But this deal is a no-brainer. Because health insurance is so prohibitively expensive when individuals buy it on their own, the extra cash they'd get from tax cuts isn't nearly as valuable as access to government-provided group coverage, which is essentially what the Democratic plans would provide. It's clear Bush sees the trade-off differently: He'd rather give the money away as tax cuts most of them for the wealthy than help people get insurance. What remains to be seen is whether the millions of voters who say health care is a top election concern will grasp this before November. <br> <b>Jonathan Cohn is a senior editor at TNR and a Kaiser Family Foundation media fellow. <br> By Jonathan Cohn 
 After rising in public support following the capture of Saddam Hussein, the President gives his State of the Union message next week with a decidedly less positive audience. His approval rating of 50% matches his lowest approval ratings ever, and the largest number ever 45% - disapprove. <br> 			 BUSH JOB APPROVAL<br>Now<br>Approve<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="100" height="10"> 50%Disapprove<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="90" height="10"> 45% <br> 12/20-22/2003<br>Approve<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="120" height="10">60%Disapprove<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="66" height="10"> 33% <br> This decline (from 60% approval the week after Saddam's capture) comes after former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's criticisms of the Administration in a book and in interviews, and after continuing attacks on American troops in Iraq. And there is other bad news for the President. <br> The Democratic candidates, campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire, have also spent time attacking the President (as well as attacking each other). Nationally, Howard Dean still leads among Democratic primary voters, with 24% of the vote. Wesley Clark and Dick Gephardt are also in double digits. <br> Overall, most Americans say things in the country are worse now than they were five years ago. 57% say things are worse now, while 21% say they're better. But they are more optimistic than pessimistic about the future. Looking ahead five years, 45% say things will be better than they are today, while 26% think things will be worse. <br> GEORGE W. BUSH <br> The president's overall job approval ties with the lowest ratings he has received since taking office, and his disapproval rating is at its highest. Several other evaluations of the president -- such as his ability to handle an international crisis, and perceptions of the respect he receives from foreign leaders -- have fallen back to pre-9/11 levels after having risen sharply in the wake of the terrorist attacks. <br> 50% now approve of the job Bush is doing as president, and 45% disapprove. In August 2001 and November 2003 his rating was also 50%. Bush's approval rating has fallen over the past month; it was 60% in a CBS News Poll taken in mid-December, but prior to that had hovered in the mid-50s for several months. <br> Bush's highest job approval rating was in October 2001, when 90% approved of the job he was doing as president. <br> Republicans overwhelmingly approve of the President's job performance, while most Democrats disapprove. Independents are now slightly negative, with 45% approving and 50% disapproving. <br> In fact, most of the decline in Bush's approval ratings in the past month comes from Independents. With the exception of terrorism, Bush suffers significant double-digit declines in all approval ratings from this group. <br> 	This president's job approval rating surpasses his father's at the same point in that administration, and ties Bill Clinton's. In January 1996, as Bill Clinton was preparing his ultimately successful re-election campaign, only about half of Americans approved of the job he was doing. George H. W. Bush was in worse shape at the same point in his presidency, with a 43% approval rating and 47% disapproving. <br> PRESIDENTIAL JOB APPROVAL<br>George W. Bush, Now<br>Approve<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="100" height="10"> 50%Disapprove<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="90" height="10"> 45% <br> Bill Clinton, 1/96<br>Approve<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="98" height="10">49%Disapprove<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="80" height="10">40% <br> George H.W.

That unfavorable rating is his highest since taking office. <br> Other personal evaluations of the president reveal that he is viewed as a strong leader (although not as widely as in early 2002, a few months after the 9/11 attacks), and empathetic. However, only 41% think he shares their priorities and that measure has declined quite a bit since early 2002. And fewer than four in ten have confidence in his economic decisions, down from 47% a year ago. <br> Just over half of Americans think Bush is in charge of his administration, and about a third think others are running the show. While views of the president's leadership in this area were lower when he took office, they rose after 9/11 and have remained consistent since then. <br> During the campaign for president in 2000, Bush said he would be a uniter, not a divider. Americans themselves are divided as to whether that has come to pass; 43% think his presidency has brought different groups of Americans together, while 44% think it has divided them. <br> EVALUATING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S DOMESTIC POLICY <br> Perhaps reflecting the rising stock market, the Bush Administration receives more credit this year than before for a strengthening economy; 58% think the administration has made a lot or some progress improving the economy, up from 51% in January 2003. More now also think the administration has made progress reducing the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, but that number is still less than a third. Minorities see progress being made at improving public schools, and keeping Social Security and Medicare afloat for future generations. <br> There is evidence that many Americans see the improvements in the economy as a "jobless recovery." In fact, 45% think the administration's policies have caused the number of jobs to decrease, while less than half as many -- 19% -- think it has increased jobs. <br> ADMINISTRATION POLICIES HAVE CAUSED JOBS TO: <br>Increase<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="38" height="10"> 19%Decrease<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="90" height="10"> 45%Stay the same<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="58" height="10"> 29% <br> Few have seen much personal benefit as a result of the Bush tax cuts -- more think their taxes actually have risen. 32% say their taxes have gone up as a result of the administration's policies, while 19% say they have gone down. 44% have seen no change in their taxes. <br> 	 ADMINISTRATION POLICIES HAVE CAUSED YOUR TAXES TO: <br>Go up<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="64" height="10"> 32%Go down<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="38" height="10"> 19%Not affected them<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="88" height="10"> 44% <br> Wealthier Americans are more likely to have perceived a benefit on their tax returns; 31% of those with incomes of %75,000 a year or more say their taxes have gone down. <br> Views of the administration's policies are highly subject to partisanship; most Republicans see them as effective, Democrats view them as making little progress, and Independents are divided. <br> EVALUATING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S FOREIGN POLICY <br> Just as dealing with terrorism is a strong suit for the President himself, it is also a strong suit for his administration. Two thirds of Americans think the administration's policies have made the U.S. safer from terrorism, and only 15% think it has become less safe. <br> ADMINISTRATION POLICIES HAVE MADE U.S: <br>Safer from terrorism<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="136" height="10"> 68%	Less safe from terrorism<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="30" height="10"> 15%Not effect<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="28" height="10"> 14% <br> But the public is critical when it comes to relations with the rest of the world, especially the Arab world. By more than two to one, Americans think the U.S.' image among Arabs has become worse rather than better as a result of the Bush administration's policies. <br> 49% think leaders of other countries have respect for the president, but 43% think they do not. Just before the U.S.-led war against Iraq, many countries disagreed with U.S. plans for war, and just under half the public also thought Bush was respected. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, 67% thought Bush was respected by leaders of other countries. <br> 	When it comes to handling an international crisis, views of the President are mixed: 49% are confident in his ability to handle such a situation, but just as many are uneasy. These figures represent a more negative view than was the case just after the war with Iraq began and in January 2002 -- in fact, current views closely resemble feelings about Bush prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. <br> THE WAR WITH IRAQ <br> The war in Iraq divides the public in several ways: half the public thinks the war has made the United States safer from terrorism but just as many say the overall result of that war was not worth its cost. <br> A month after U.S. troops in Iraq captured Saddam Hussein, 50% now say the war has made the U.S. safer from terrorism, while 18% think the U.S. is less safe and 29% say the war hasn't made any difference. <br> Seven in ten Republicans say the war with Iraq has made the U.S. safer from terrorism, compared with 36% of Democrats and 47% of Independents. <br> Many also think that if Iraq becomes a stable democracy that may reduce the threat of terrorism against the U.S. While 52% say that would not make any difference, 38% believe the U.S. will be safer and only 6% think that would make the U.S. less safe. <br> Despite these generally positive assessments, Americans are more likely to say the result of Iraq war was not worth the loss of American life and other costs than say it was worth it. 43% think the war in Iraq was worth it, but 51% say it was not. <br> WAS IRAQ WAR WORTH THE COSTS?<br>Yes<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="86" height="10"> 43%No<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="102" height="10">51% <br> Views on whether the Iraq war was worth it correlates with evaluations of the war's impact on the fight against terrorism. Two-thirds of those who believe the war in Iraq has made the U.S. safer from terrorism say the war was worth it, while 87% of those whose think the U.S. is now less safe as a result of the war say the war was not worth it. <br> The public gives the Bush Administration mixed reviews on its efforts to fight two wars at the same time. Half thinks the Bush Administration has struck the right balance between fighting the war in Iraq and fighting the Al Qaeda terrorists, but four in ten say the Administration has focused too much on Iraq and not enough on Al Qaeda. Very few think it has focused too much on Al Qaeda. <br> This poll was taken after former Treasury Secretary O'Neill made the claim that President Bush decided to invade Iraq soon after his inauguration, eight months before the September 11th attacks. 33% of the public thinks the Bush Administration was telling all or most of what it knew about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before going to war. But more, 39%, think the Administration was hiding important elements of what it knew, and another one in five Americans believe it was mostly lying about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction before taking military action. <br> The percentage of people who think the Bush Administration has been telling the truth about what it knew about the weapons in Iraq has decreased in the past two months, from 44% in November. <br> Many Americans continue to think the Bush Administration rushed into the war in Iraq. 49% now say the Administration was too quick to get the U.S. militarily involved in Iraq; 35% think the timing was about right, and 13% say the U.S. was too slow to take military action. <br> THE PRESIDENT'S RECENT INITIATIVES: IMMIGRATION REFORM <br> Americans disagree with President Bush's immigration reform proposal to give illegal immigrant workers temporary work permits allowing them to work and stay in the U.S. legally for three years. Just one-third support the President's initiative. <br> Those in the West are the most likely to support the President's temporary worker proposal: 46% of Westerners think illegal workers should be permitted to get temporary legal status; but slightly more -- 51% -- oppose it.Many Americans do not want to see even legal immigration into the U.S. increased. Just 16% think legal immigration to the U.S. should be increased, 45% think it should be decreased, and another one-third say immigration should be kept at its current level. Three months after the September 11th terrorist attacks, even more Americans said the immigration level should be decreased. <br> More than half of Americans think immigrants coming to this country mostly take jobs Americans don't want, but many, 39%, say immigrants take jobs away from American citizens. These views are unchanged from 1996. <br> Opinions on President Bush's immigration proposal correlate with other views about immigration and immigrants. Those who want the immigration level decreased are opposed to the new temporary worker program, as are 83% of those who say immigrants take jobs away from Americans. <br> Many Americans do give immigrants credit for being hard workers. 46% say immigrants work harder than those who were born in this country; only 6% think immigrants do not work as hard. <br> THE PRESIDENT'S RECENT INITIATIVES: SPACE <br> Many Americans oppose some key elements of George W. Bush's recently announced space exploration program. A majority does not think a permanent space station on the moon is worth the costs and risks involved, and many are concerned that the country is already spending too much money on space programs. Also, while NASA's rover Spirit crawls the surface of Mars, public support for a manned mission there is divided, and lower than in previous polls. <br> For the first time since the CBS News/New York Times Poll started asking the question, there is not a clear majority favoring sending astronauts to the red planet. 48% of Americans favor the idea of sending astronauts to explore Mars but just as many - 47% - oppose the idea. Up to now, Americans have been supportive of such a program. In 1999, 58% favored sending astronauts to Mars. <br> Another component of Bush's proposal includes a permanent manned space station on the moon. The public opposes this. 58% do not think a permanent space station on the moon is worth the costs and risks involved; 35% say it is. <br> IS A PERMANENT SPACE STATION ON THE MOON WORTH IT?<br>Yes<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="70" height="10"> 35%No<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="116" height="10">58% <br> The space program's projected cost -- about $12 billion over the next five years -- may be too high for many Americans. Just 17% think the U.S. should be spending more money on space programs. In fact, 40% now say the country is spending too much, more than thought so after the Columbia disaster. <br> There are demographic differences when it comes to sending men (and women) to Mars. Men still favor the idea (and so do Republicans), while women are opposed (in 1999 54% of women favored the idea). Those under 30 appear most excited about the prospect of a manned mission to Mars: 66% of them favor the idea. <br> THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVES: MANDATORY TESTING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS <br> One major component of President Bush's education reform policy mandatory testing gets majority support from the public. But an even larger majority opposes using the results of the testing to determine federal funding for public schools, something the No Child Left Behind Act requires. <br> 71% favor mandatory testing in public schools in order to determine the quality of education students receive, but support for mandatory testing drops to just 19% if the results of such tests are used to determine whether a school can receive federal funds, as outlined in the Act. <br> 77% of the public opposes giving federal money to schools where students score well on tests and withholding federal money from schools where students perform poorly. That includes more than seven in ten Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. <br> THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND BIG BUSINESS <br> Public perceptions that the administration's ties to big business are too close continue. Two thirds of Americans think big business has too much influence on the administration. <br> A majority of Americans think the president himself puts the needs of big business above the needs of average Americans, and that view has become more widespread. 58% think he cares more about protecting the interests of large corporations, while 30% think he is more interested in protecting ordinary Americans. <br> Views on this question may impact whether or not people think the president shares their priorities. 77% of those who think Bush cares more about large corporations also think he does not share their priorities, and 76% of those who think he cares about ordinary Americans think he does. <br> Perceptions that the administration caters to the wealthy also persist -- in this poll, 57% think the administration's policies favor the rich. 11% think they favor the middle class and 25% think they treat all groups the same. <br> 	 BUSH POLICIES FAVOR:<br>The rich<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="114" height="10"> 57%The middle class<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="22" height="10">11%The poor<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="2" height="10">1%Treat all the same<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="50" height="10">25% <br> THE ECONOMY <br> The public's views of the economy while positive -- have slipped slightly since last month. Now, 54% think the economy is in good shape, while 45% think it is in bad shape. In December, 59% said the economy was good and 40% said it was bad. <br> However, American's ratings of the economy are more positive now than they were a year ago. In January 2003, 55% of Americans said the economy was in bad shape. <br> The public's outlook continues to be mixed: 34% think the economy is getting better, but more 39% - think it is staying the same. A quarter says the economy is getting worse. <br> In December, after the capture of Saddam Hussein, there was an uptick in the number of Americans who thought the country was headed in the right direction; now, views have slipped back to where they were in November: 53% say things in the U.S. have seriously gotten off on the wrong track, while 42% say things are going in the right direction. These perceptions mirror the opinions Americans had at the start of 2003. <br> The public's mood seems to be tied to the economy. 75% of Americans who think the economy is in bad shape say the country is going in the wrong direction. Among those who say the economy is good, 60% think things in this country are going well. <br> Half of Americans say the tax cuts enacted since 2001 have had no effect on the economy, 27% say the tax cuts have been good for the economy, while 17% think they have been bad. These views are nearly identical to what they were in the fall. <br> Republicans and Democrats disagree on this question. <br> DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY <br> When asked to compare things in the U.S. now to five years ago, 57% of Americans say things are worse today. Only 21% say things are better, while nearly as many think things are about the same as they were five years ago. <br> However, more are optimistic than not about the future of country. 45% expect things in the United States to be better five years from now; a quarter say things will be worse. <br> On the negative side, many Americans today feel the impact of a sluggish economy. Almost two-thirds of Americans are now having a difficult time keeping up with their bills more than the number who said so two years ago. Then, 55% said they were having a hard time keeping up with their bills. <br> 71% of those who reside in the Northeast are having a hard time paying their bills more than in any other region. Not surprisingly, those with lower incomes are more likely to say they are having a hard time keeping up. <br> Moreover, nearly four in ten Americans (39%) are concerned that they or someone in their household will lose their job in the next year (including 21% who are very concerned). <br> There are demographic differences on this question. Blacks are more likely than whites to be concerned about losing their job. Also, Americans without a college degree are more concerned than college graduates about them or someone in their household losing their job. <br> In assessing their family's overall finances, about half of Americans report their financial situation is the same as it was when George W. Bush took office. 29% say they are worse off, and 20% say their family is better off financially. <br> <font size="-2">This poll was conducted among a nationwide random sample of 1022 adults, interviewed by telephone January 12-15, 2004.

 This commentary from The Weekly Standard was written by Fred Barnes.<hr width="50%">The Democratic reversal on taxes has come full circle. Forty years ago, Democratic president John F. Kennedy believed tax increases would neither balance the budget nor create jobs. Kennedy proposed deep cuts in income taxes that were enacted by an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress after his death. In the 1980s, Democratic presidential nominees Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis had a different tack. Mondale said it was sad but true that federal taxes had to be raised. Dukakis said he might boost taxes, but only as a last resort. <br> Now all nine Democratic presidential candidates agree that increasing taxes must be a first resort. This is an amazing turn of events. Sure, some would sweep away President Bush's tax cuts in their entirety, and others would preserve the cuts for lower income brackets. But this striking fact remains: While serious candidates like Richard Gephardt and Joe Lieberman don't agree with wacko candidate Dennis Kucinich and demagogue Al Sharpton about much, they're on board with them on taxes. And by the way, so are Democratic congressional leaders. <br> It's as if Democrats live in a parallel universe where ordinary economic rules don't apply. Although the Bush cuts have helped trigger a roaring economic recovery, Democrats would repeal most or all of them. Howard Dean, the frontrunner for the nomination, would go even further. He would also lift the cap on the Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, now set at $87,000 of income. The result would be still another tax increase, for employees and employers alike. This would particularly damage small businesses, the source of most of the new jobs in America. The tax hike mania has seized even Lieberman, the most sensible of the Democrats. He is not content to restore the top rate for individual income, now 35 percent, to its Clinton-era level of 39.6 percent. He would raise it to 44.6 percent. So would General Wesley Clark. This would be nearly as economically counterproductive as Dean's payroll tax increase. <br> There's a devious aspect to the Democratic tax message. Lieberman, Clark, and the rest have touted their plans as tax reform. Other Democrats, notably Governor Mark Warner of Virginia, have done the same. Their aim is to disguise a huge increase -- Virginia's largest ever in Warner's case -- as merely a fair-minded restructuring of the tax code. And the press has mostly played along. Warner would raise the sales tax from 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent (while reducing it to 2.5 percent on groceries), boost the top rate from 5.75 percent to 6.25 percent, and increase business taxes. But the Washington Post continues to echo Warner's spin that this is tax reform. <br> Sorry, but real tax reform is something different. It has a neutral effect on revenue. It aims to broaden the tax base by reducing rates and eliminating special tax credits, exemptions, and loopholes. And this makes for a simpler, fairer system, leading to a more productive economy. With high rates like the ones Democrats are advocating, the pressure to carve out new loopholes becomes irresistible. Clark's plan, as the Wall Street Journal points out, is actually "reverse tax reform." He would increase taxes on a smaller base. <br> A falsehood is at the root of Democratic tax plans: that the wealthy bear less of the tax burden. In truth, the top one percent of earners paid 36.3 percent of income taxes in 2000, up from 19.75 percent in 1979. Call it trickle-down economics if you wish, but it's this one percent of Americans who are counted on to save, invest, stir economic growth, and create jobs. <br> As the presidential caucuses and primaries begin, some Democrats are beginning to fear that advocating tax hikes is political suicide. Even Dean, having been pounded by rivals over his desire to increase taxes on middle and lower income workers, wants to take the edge off his proposed hikes. Of course, he and other candidates who talk up middle-class tax relief don't favor a net reduction in taxes, only a few "targeted" cuts. And that touches on another problem: the near absence of prominent Democratic tax-cutters. At the moment, there are only two, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Senator Zell Miller of Georgia, who is retiring at the end of this year. These two worry that the reputation of Democrats as tax-raisers is hardening. They have reason to worry. <br> <b>Fred Barnes, for the Editors. <br> By Fred Barnes 
 This Against the Grain commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer. <hr> <br> After making war not peace in 2003, our president is taking advantage of the New Year and Democratic fratricide to dress up in his compassionate conservative costume again. First it was kindler, gentler immigration reforms, then an anniversary party for his favorite bill-that-became-a-law, the No Child Left Behind education program. <br> The NCLB (I can't use the whole, silly slogan again, I'm sorry) celebration is an especially ironic affair, and not just for the president. Bush is trying to collect the political capital from NCLB just as many states and school systems are rebelling because they don't have the real capital (or the desire) to comply with the burdensome law. And the Democratic candidates who were in Congress when NCLB was passed are busy attacking this program they all voted for. <br> The very details of the president's anniversary day schedule tell me most of what I need to know, albeit in a symbolic way. Bush traveled to Westview Elementary School in Knoxville, Tennessee for the obligatory read-to-kids photo-op and speech. Then he went to a campaign fundraiser. And then he got on Air Force One and flew to Palm Beach for - you guessed it - another fundraiser. The not so subtle point being, NCLB, like the posture of compassionate conservatism, has everything to do with winning elections. <br> That fixing schools would ever be the signature achievement of a 21st century Republican president was a dubious proposition from the onset. Why's that? It's pretty simple: the federal government provides only about seven percent of the budgets for America's schools. How much is tinkering with that seven percent going to help? What chance is there that seven would turn into fourteen? None. <br> And that's what Republicans believe in, right? It's called federalism. Parents and communities know best how to educate their kids, or at least they should have the right to do it themselves. Bureaucrats in Washington can only hinder, not help. Thus runs the credo that led so many foot soldiers of the Reagan-Gingrich era to attempt to abolish the Department of Education. <br> Well, NCLB turned that philosophy of federalism on its head, and put a dunce cap on it. <br> The basic idea of the legislation wasn't to give school and towns more resources, but to force them to comply with detailed standards - standards set by the feds - or face a slew of penalties and consequences. Accountability was to come from those faceless bureaucrats in Washington, not parents. <br> It is certainly the most intrusive federal foray ever into public schools. And for Republicans, it was philosophically incoherent (that's why more Democrats voted for NCLB than Republicans). <br> It is, however, a philosophic incoherence schools from Key West to Nome must heed. <br> Their third-graders through eighth-graders, at least 95 per cent of them, must take federally mandated tests each year. And if all the sub-groups in the school - boys, girls, brown, white and green - don't show annual improvement, a chain of requirements launches, beginning with forced permission for kids to go to other schools in the district and ending with mandated dumping of school management. <br> It gets worse. These mandated changes cost money but the law doesn't give the schools more money. Systems would have to pay to transport those kids who chose to go to "higher performing" schools. The failing schools have to pay for more teacher training and tutoring for low-income kids. Where's that money supposed to come from? Republican fundraisers? <br> When NCLB passed, schools were told they would get some more federal dollars to help comply. But the program has not been close to fully funded, as the president essentially admitted on anniversary day when he said he fund boost his 2005 budget request by about $2.1 billion, which critics will say isn't nearly enough. <br> NCLB has become a dreaded "unfunded mandate" as they call it in political science seminars. <br> And increasingly, schools and states are looking for ways to tell the feds to take their unfunded mandates and stick them up their appropriations committees. A few schools and school districts in Vermont and Connecticut have already told the federal government to keep its money, they're not going to comply with NCLB. Some schools in Virginia are debating doing the same. <br> But these are schools in relatively prosperous spots. Under Title 1 of The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, most federal education aid is directed to schools in poor areas. These are precisely the schools that cannot say "No thanks" to any federal aid; and they are the schools that will have the hardest time complying with NCLB. That's why the impoverished city of Reading, Pennsylvania, which is already on the NCLB probation list, is suing to protect itself from the clutches of that law. <br> And some Republican state legislators in Utah, where Republicans reign, are pushing legislation that would have the state opt out of NCLB and pass up all federal education bucks. <br> On the Democratic campaign trail, NCLB is a popular punching bag. But only Howard Dean opposed it, vocally, from the start. In 2002, then-Governor Dean even threatened to have Vermont opt out. <br> But Gephardt, Kerry, Lieberman, Edwards and Kucinich all voted for it. Now they want to reform it, to spend more money on it and to pillory Bush. <br> For these other Democrats, it's part of their highly unappetizing cake-and-eat-it syndrome. They want to vote for the war, and oppose it. Or they want to vote for the Bush tax cuts, and oppose them. They are all finesse, no fiber. <br> For President Bush, I expect that No Child Left Behind will remain an effective marketing slogan. <br> For schools, they're stuck with making the best of a policy born of finesse, marketing and cheapness. <br> <b>Dick Meyer, the Editorial Director of CBSNews.com, has covered politics and government in Washington for 20 years and has won the Investigative Reporters and Editors, Alfred I.

 This commentary from The New Republic was written by Ryan Lizza</i>.<br>When Howard Dean delivered his big foreign policy address in Los Angeles last Monday, coverage of a speech meant to plant him firmly in the Democratic mainstream was dominated by a single, easy-to-caricature line: "The capture of Saddam Hussein has not made America safer." Dean added the line to the speech at the last minute. "The governor penciled that line in himself," says a senior aide. "Technically, he's right, but you just might not want to say it that way." Indeed, the next day, the press, almost every other Democratic candidate, and much of the conservative echo chamber trashed Dean for the supposed gaffe. But, rather than retract the line, Dean actually made it a part of his stump speech, stubbornly arguing in Arizona the following day, "I hope very much this [Saddam's capture] will begin to diminish attacks on our troops, but I do not think it will make America's homeland safer." <br> For good or ill, Dean does not back down, even especially when everyone else thinks he's on the losing side of an argument. Next up: the future of the Democratic Party. This week, in a speech scheduled for the day after The New Republic goes to press, Dean will also lay out his vision on domestic policy, and what he has to say will surprise many. For the first time in this campaign, Dean will attempt to wrap his major policies into a larger governing philosophy, something he now calls "a New Social Contract with Working Families." Says an aide, "It's an attempt to give all of his proposals a packaging and a vision." Conventional wisdom argues that what Dean needs to do in this big speech is tack to the center, claim the mantle of Clintonian centrism, and begin pivoting toward the general election. Naturally, he intends to do the opposite. <br> Well, sort of. Instead of slavishly paying tribute to the politics of mid-'90s Clintonism, as every other major candidate is doing, Dean is going to point out how the Third Way lost its way. "He's laying out a new social contract that he would like to create between families, corporations, and government," a senior adviser explains. "The vision of it is that a social contract was first built by Franklin D. Roosevelt. With Social Security and other programs, the government stepped in to make sure people have certain freedoms. [That social contract] was built on by Kennedy and Johnson the goal of eradicating poverty, for example." Since Lyndon Johnson, Dean believes, Democrats have failed to build on and defend this legacy. "The Democratic Party under Clinton declared, 'The era of big government is over,'" the aide continues. "The idea was to minimize the damage done by Republicans as they rolled back the New Deal. But, in trying to say that the era of big government is over, essentially the Democratic Party has shifted to a defensive posture." Dean wants to go on offense. The text of Dean's speech declares, "I reject the notion that damage control must be our credo." <br> For Democrats who think the Dean campaign is setting the party back 20 years, his new speech will only confirm their belief that his candidacy is an explicit rejection of Clintonism. "From the beginning, [Dean] has tried to tap the same vein [Bill] Bradley did [in 2000]: liberals who thought Clintonism was fundamentally unprincipled," says a senior Clinton adviser. "The reason you don't find many Clintonites in the Dean campaign is that the Dean approach rejects so much of the Clinton approach. The most prominent Clintonite on Dean's team, Chris Edley, was one of the most prominent dissidents who disagreed with Clinton's way of doing things." In this view, the Dean campaign is driven by liberals who feel guilty about Clinton's tacks to the center. <br> Dean's aides argue that he is not rejecting Clintonism but building upon it. Reforming welfare and balancing the budget, they say, were measures intended to restore the public's faith in government so that it would once again be respected as a tool for social progress not as first steps toward dismantling government even further. If Clintonism simply means planting the ideological flag in the center, they add, then that center will just keep drifting right as Democrats repeatedly accommodate themselves to the Republican tug. Dean is merely positioning himself as the Democrat who is willing to tug back. <br> It's true that, as governor of Vermont, Dean was a proud New Democrat, championing welfare reform and balancing budgets. During the Clinton years, Dean was condemned by liberals, such as Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund, for his rabid defense of welfare reform. Similarly, Jeremy Ben-Ami, a veteran of Clinton's domestic policy council and now the Dean campaign's policy director, was an advocate of welfare reform inside the White House. (One of the few times Ben-Ami's name appeared in print during the Clinton years was when anti-poverty activists met with him to discuss welfare in 1997 and complained to the press that he was too obsessed with cost.) "Welfare was just out of step with the core values of the country, and I firmly believe in welfare reform," says Ben-Ami. "It was right on policy grounds and extremely important to the Democratic Party." Dean's New Social Contract, he says, "is the logical next step for the New Democrats. ... I feel strongly that Clinton's agenda was one hundred percent right. The Democratic Party needed to do it. But it's a new world. We need a new set of ideas and responses and a new vision. And the Republican Party is different, too. It's more heinous." <br> So what are these new ideas and responses? Dean's speech reiterates his support for a plan to move the country toward universal health care but incrementally, by expanding existing programs. It includes his plan to increase funding to help working parents pay for child care and higher education. He's going to start talking about tax reform, not just the repeal of the Bush tax cuts (a proposal for a middle-class tax cut is in the works, according to an aide). A plan to create some kind of retirement security account is also being written, but the details are a work in progress. Dean will also lay out some modest new proposals to deal with the excesses of corporate America. "He'll attempt to hit the re-regulation theme without using that word," says an aide. <br> All in all, it's a fairly moderate set of policy proposals. Indeed, if one were to put them in an existing category of political thought, that category would probably be Clintonism. As has been the case throughout his campaign, Dean has reversed the usual political calculus, offering relatively moderate proposals while positioning himself as outside the mainstream Democratic establishment. (Compare him, for example, with Richard Gephardt, who takes every rhetorical opportunity to attach himself to Clinton, even as he campaigns on trade restrictions and a $230 billion-per-year health care plan.) The other candidate whose message Dean's most closely resembles now is probably John Edwards, who talks regularly about middle-class financial insecurity. A Dean aide agrees but says their pitch to working families is a "more ambitious" version of the Edwards plan, which they see as rooted in Clinton-era timidity. "The line Clinton always used was, 'If you work hard and play by the rules, you shouldn't have to raise your kids in poverty,'" says a senior Dean adviser. "But is that good enough? What Dean is laying out is a little more ambitious than that. A family that works hard and plays by the rules should be able to make ends meet." <br> Which brings us to what may be the primary reason for Dean's latest rhetorical tack. The media may tag his New Social Contract as a move to the left at a time when conventional wisdom says he should be moderating his image. But, right now, the political imperative for Dean is not necessarily to move to the middle. It's still only December, after all. And, while his views on the war have given him a virtual lock on the upscale social liberals who will likely propel him to victory in Iowa and (especially) New Hampshire, he still needs to reach out to downscale Democrats who disproportionately rely on government help. These are the voters who will decide his fate in South Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona, and the other Southern and Western states that start voting on February 3. In the past, Democratic candidates with a profile similar to Dean's Gary Hart in 1984, Paul Tsongas in 1992, and Bill Bradley in 2000 found the post-New Hampshire contests to be a graveyard because they were never able to break out of what Ron Brownstein has nicely termed the "Starbucks ghetto." By contrast, it was by championing traditional Democratic spending programs like Social Security and Medicare with a populist, outsider message that Clinton clinched the 1992 nomination. And that may be the most fundamental way in which Dean's new political posture is a reflection, rather than a rejection, of Clinton. <br> <b>Ryan Lizza is an associate editor at TNR. <br> By Ryan Lizza 
 The immediate impact of the capture of Saddam Hussein by U.S. troops includes improvements in public perception of how the war is going for the U.S. in Iraq, whether it has been worth it, and assessments of President Bush's handling of Iraq. <br> Yet, the public is divided over whether the capture of Saddam Hussein means the U.S. has won the war in Iraq, and despite Saddam Hussein's arrest, few believe the war is over or that this country is now safer from terrorism. <br> In the last few days, there has been a double-digit rise in President Bush's rating on handling Iraq, some improvement in his overall approval rating, and a large shift in the public's mood. But so far, the President has made only small gains in his race for re-election, and personal evaluations of him and his domestic programs have changed little. <br> In CBS News/New York Times polling conducted December 10-13, the four days before the former Iraqi leader's arrest, Bush's job approval rating was 52 percent. In the two days after U.S. forces captured Saddam Hussein, the President's overall approval rating rose modestly to 58 percent, with 33 percent disapproving. Bush's approval rating is his highest since last July. <br> BUSH'S JOB APPROVAL<br>After Saddam's Capture<br>Approve<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="116" height="10"> 58%Disapprove<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="66" height="10"> 33% <br> Before Saddam's Capture<br>Approve<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="104" height="10"> 52%Disapprove<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="80" height="10"> 40% <br> IS THE WAR OVER?<br>Americans are not yet ready to declare victory in Iraq.

Two-thirds approved of the way the President was handling terrorism, higher than his overall approval, but still his lowest approval rating on that question ever. <br> APPROVE OF BUSH ON:<br>Terrorism<br>After capture 68%Before capture 64% <br> Iraq<br>After capture 59%Before capture 45% <br> Foreign policy<br>After capture 52%Before capture 45% <br> Economy<br>After capture 49%Before capture 44% <br> Overall<br>After capture 58%Before capture 52% <br> After Saddam's capture, the President's approval ratings rose most on foreign policy and on his handling of Iraq. The latter assessment, which had been below 50 percent since July, rose from 45 percent before Saddam's arrest to 59 percent in the days afterwards. His foreign policy rating rose from 45 percent to 52 percent. <br> As mentioned earlier, the President's overall job approval rating rose 6 points following the capture of Saddam, to 58 percent. Views of the president were and remain highly partisan, but there has been improvement among Democrats. Before Saddam's capture, 91 percent of Republicans approved of the job he is doing, while only 28 percent of Democrats did and Independents were split. After the arrest, 91 percent of Republicans approved of Bush, as did 35 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Independents. <br> The president has risen in the eyes of both Democrats and Republicans on his handling of Iraq and foreign policy. Before Saddam's capture, 26 percent of Democrats approved of his handling of Iraq; in the days after Saddam's arrest, 35 percent approved. Similarly, approval among Democrats on Bush's handling of foreign policy rose from 20 percent to 29 percent. There was an 8-point increase in approval of his handling of Iraq among Republicans. <br> But personal views of the president have changed little with the arrest of Saddam. As they were at the end of last week, the public remains mixed and highly partisan: 48 percent of the public has a favorable opinion of the president, and 31 percent has an unfavorable opinion. 86 percent of Republicans have a favorable view, and 56 percent of Democrats view Bush unfavorably. 38 percent of Independents have a positive image of Bush. <br> THE 2004 VOTE<br>In polling conducted in the four days leading up to Hussein's arrest, President Bush held just a one-point edge in a 2004 Election match-up with an unnamed Democratic contender. That advantage has now increased, thought not significantly, to a four-point edge in the two days since the capture. That change is within the poll's margin of error. <br> NOVEMBER 2004 VOTE <br>(Among registered voters)<b>After capture, 12/14-15<br>Bush 44%Democrat 40% <br> Before capture, 12/10-13<br>Bush 42%Democrat 41% <br> Last week, most voters said they were already sure how they would cast their ballot next November. 63 percent of voters who expressed a choice in the 2004 match-up said their mind was made up, and only 36 percent said it was still too soon to say whom they would vote for. After the capture, those sentiments remain much the same: 64 percent say their mind is made up, and 35 percent say it is still too soon to say. <br> But more voters now predict a Bush win next November. 61 percent think Bush will prevail; in September, 50 percent felt that way. <br> THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND IRAQ<br>Americans are divided over whether the U.S. was too quick to go to war with Iraq. 43 percent now say the Bush Administration was too quick to get the U.S. militarily involved in Iraq; another 42 percent think the timing was about right, and 12 percent say the U.S. was too slow to take military action. These numbers were similar before Saddam Hussein was captured. <br> WAS THE ADMINISTRATION TOO QUICK TO GO TO WAR WITH IRAQ? <br> After capture<br>Too quick <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="86" height="10"> 43%Too slow <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="24" height="10"> 12%Timing was about right <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="84" height="10"> 42% <br> Before capture<br>Too quick <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="94" height="10"> 47%Too slow <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="26" height="10"> 13%Timing was about right <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="74" height="10"> 37% <br> Americans continue to believe the Bush Administration was less than forthcoming with the public when it comes to what it knew before the war. 45 percent now believe the Administration was hiding important elements of what it knew about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and another 16 percent say it was mostly lying. 29 percent now think the Administration was telling the American public all or most of what it knew, down from before the capture of Saddam Hussein, when 37 percent said so, and down even more from a month ago, when that figure was 44 percent. <br> BEFORE THE WAR, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS</b>		<b>Telling all/most of what it knew<br>After capture 29%Before capture 37%11/2003 44% <br> Hiding important elements<br>After capture 45%Before capture 42%11/2003 37% <br> Mostly lying about weapons<br>After capture 16%Before capture 16%11/2003 16% <br> One of the president's personal strengths has been the public's perception of his integrity; this has been unaffected by Saddam's capture, or by doubts about the Administration's honesty in this case.

These views have changed little since early 2002. <br> BUSH TAX CUTS' EFFECT ON ECONOMY<br>Good			27%Bad			16%No effect		49% <br> The same is true about the recent Medicare bill providing prescription drug coverage for seniors. This poll -- both before and after the weekend's events -- shows no broad public belief that the new legislation will improve seniors' lives -- with seniors themselves just as negative. Just 24 percent of Americans think most senior citizens will be better off under the new rules than they were before, and 15 percent think seniors will be made worse off as a result.		 <br> NEW MEDICARE RULES WILL MAKE SENIORS<br>Better off<br>Total 24%Age 65+ 25% <br> Worse off<br>Total 15%Age 65+ 12% <br> No difference<br>Total 35%Age 65+ 41% <br> Few seniors see much benefit in the new rules. 25 percent of those aged 65 and over think they will be better off than they are now, but 12 percent think they will be worse off, and 41 percent think there will be no impact. 23 percent don't know. <br> Even Republicans demonstrate lukewarm enthusiasm for the President's Medicare reforms. 39 percent of Republicans think the changes will cause seniors to be better off, and 26 percent think it will have no effect. <br> However, the Bush Administration is getting increasing credit for improving seniors' prescription drug coverage.

Prior to Saddam's capture, 39 percent thought the country was headed in the right direction, and more -- 56 percent -- thought it was on the wrong track. In the days after Saddam's capture, the public is more optimistic, with 49 percent saying the country is headed in the right direction, and 43% thinking it is on the wrong track. <br> COUNTRY'S DIRECTION<br>Right direction<br>After capture<img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="98" height="10"> 49%Before capture <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="78" height="10"> 39% <br> Wrong track<br>After capture <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="86" height="10"> 43%Before capture <img src="/common/images/blue.gif" width="112" height="10"> 56% <br> In recent months these views have been strongly correlated with views of the economy; those who think the economy is doing well see the country as going in the right direction, while those who think it is bad view the country as on the wrong track. As positive assessments of the economy increase, so should assessment of the direction of the country. <br> Views of the war in Iraq also correlate with views on the country's direction. 74 percent of those who think removing Saddam was worth the costs see the country as on the right track, while 69 percent of those who say that effort was not worthwhile think the country is on the wrong track. <br> THE MOURNER-IN-CHIEF<br>Two-thirds of Americans think President Bush should attend some of the funerals for military personnel killed in Iraq; about a quarter say that would not be necessary. <br> SHOULD BUSH ATTEND MILITARY FUNERALS OF SOLDIERS KILLED IN IRAQ?<br>Yes			66%No			27% <br> The public seems unclear about whether the President has attended any of the military funerals, however. While just under a quarter of Americans know, correctly, that the President has not attended any military funerals so far, 26 percent think he has, and half do not know. <br> Separately, six in ten Americans think the public should be allowed to see pictures of the military honor guard receiving caskets of soldiers killed in Iraq as they are returned to the U.S., but a quarter disagree. <br> SHOULD THE PUBLIC BE ALLOWED TO SEE PICTURES OF CASKETS OF SOLDIERS KILLED IN IRAQ?<br>Yes			62%No			27% <br> OSAMA BIN LADEN<br>Regarding the war in Afghanistan, a major front in the broader war on terror, six in ten Americans now say that war cannot be won without the U.S. either capturing or killing Osama bin Laden.

 This commentary from The Weekly Standard was written by William Tucker</i>.<br>Mark Bocci is a personal injury lawyer in Lake Oswego, Oregon. In the 1980s, he took the case of a Filipino-American high school student who had suffered a grievous injury playing football. Kneed in the head by an all-state fullback, "Richard" suffered headaches and dizziness for two days, then collapsed with massive brain injuries. The doctor who saved his life said, "I'm not sure I did him a favor." Richard had very few motor skills left and required 24-hour care. <br> Bocci decided to pursue a product liability case against the manufacturer of the helmet. This was a risky approach, since all football helmets go through an impact- testing process before being marketed. The helmet in question had passed the test. With such a sanction at hand, manufacturers are usually able to defend themselves. <br> Sifting through 20,000 pages of discovery documents, Bocci found nothing incriminating. After an exhaustive search, however, he did uncover two other deaths and several cases of brain injury involving the same helmet. It turned out the manufacturer had quietly settled these cases to avoid publicity. The company also offered to settle with Richard's family now. <br> But Bocci's concern had been aroused. Pushing further, he finally turned up the former CEO of a rival manufacturer who had a story to tell. The CEO explained that the helmet in question was fitted with a "front in-sizer" to adjust for head size. This accessory came in two different sizes. One had passed the impact tests but the other -- a one-inch in-sizer -- had failed. Richard had been wearing a one-inch sizer. <br> By the time the case came to trial, Bocci and his partner, Jim Pippin, had invested six years and $350,000 of their own money in the case. "My wife and I had just bought our dream house," says Bocci. "Then we realized we couldn't keep it. One night we sat down with our two teenage daughters at the dinner table and told them we had a choice -- either we could stay where we lived or sell the house for Richard's sake. I'll be eternally proud of them that they didn't hesitate a moment. We moved." <br> Three years later, an appeals court finally approved the $11.2 million verdict Bocci won before a jury. The company immediately withdrew the helmet from the market. "We believe we prevented numerous other injuries," says Bocci, who this year was inducted into the Inner Circle of Advocates, the exclusive society of the nation's top 100 trial lawyers. "Richard is making tremendous progress," he adds. "He's got a 300-word vocabulary and is completely ambulatory. Full-time therapy has been a tremendous help." <br> Trial lawyers over the last couple of decades have become the mainstay of the Democratic party and the nemesis of the Republicans. A few years ago, Senator Howell Heflin, the Alabama Democrat, announced memorably that "Jews, labor unions, and trial lawyers" were the financial pillars of his party. Trial lawyers certainly have the wherewithal to make major donations. The Manhattan Institute has just issued a condemnation of the plaintiff bar titled "Trial Lawyers, Inc." The profession rakes in "almost $40 billion per year in revenues -- 50 percent more than Microsoft or Intel and twice those of Coca-Cola," trumpets the study. "[It] might well be the most profitable business in the world." <br> The ideological lines of demarcation are only becoming more entrenched. President Bush's attempt to curb medical malpractice and class action lawsuits have just failed to muster the 60 votes necessary for cloture in the Senate. Congress's effort to put a limit on asbestos damages also collapsed. With Senator John Edwards running a dark-horse campaign for president almost completely financed by his fellow trial lawyers, the plaintiffs' bar is gearing for Armageddon. "If Bush gets elected with big majorities in Congress," Edwards told the Inner Circle last summer, "you'll get tort reform like you've never seen before." <br> Yet behind this make-or-break political posturing, there are odd cultural crosscurrents. Although they have obvious Populist roots, trial lawyers in many ways fit the contemporary Republican ideal. <br> First, trial lawyers are self-made men (and they are nearly all men). With eerie predictability, they rise from humble beginnings and blue-collar backgrounds in the central portions of the country. Philip Corboy, the Chicago-based dean of personal injury lawyers, is the son of a Chicago police officer. John O'Quinn, the Houston billionaire who pioneered breast-implant litigation, is the son of an auto mechanic and himself trained at GM's Mister Goodwrench school before deciding to attend college. Ron Motley, the South Carolina lawyer who directed the 1998 tobacco litigation, is the son of a gas station owner. Mark Bocci's parents owned a grocery store. John Edwards's father -- as he repeats constantly in his campaign -- worked in a South Carolina cotton mill. <br> Often the first of their families to attend college, plaintiff lawyers are universally scornful of the Ivy League and other East Coast centers of privilege. Joe Jamail, the foul-mouthed Houston lawyer who won the $11 billion Texaco-Pennzoil case, nearly flunked out of law school at the University of Texas and displays a savage animosity towards New York lawyers. John O'Quinn still smarts because Democrats overlooked him in favor of New York ber-advocate David Boies in arguing the 2000 Florida recount. "If I'd been representing them, Al Gore would be president right now," he says with finality. <br> Third, the new trial lawyers have rebelled against the staid old privilege-laden profession of law by openly becoming businessmen. "We're the first generation to approach the law from an entrepreneurial perspective," says Wayne Reaud, who made a billion on the Texas Gulf Coast suing oil companies for asbestos exposure. "It used to be that a lawyer would win one big case and then buy a thousand acres in West Texas and watch his cows grow," says Reaud, whose father was a pipe fitter. "We were the first to put our winnings back into the next case. That made it possible to do a lot of things that hadn't been done before." <br> Finally, the most successful trial lawyers are generally socially conservative. Jere Beasley, the Alabama attorney who won $675 million from Monsanto for PCB contamination in Anniston, supports Alabama chief justice Roy Moore's efforts to display his Ten Commandments statue in the courthouse. "I think his beliefs are sincere," he says. Wayne Reaud displays a large crucifix on the wall behind his desk in his Beaumont office. Mark Bocci originally wanted to be a priest. Talk to any one of them long enough and they will tell you they feel a religious calling to their profession. "I'm basically a preacher," says O'Quinn, who often strikes an evangelistic tone in front of juries. "I'm like a man preaching about Christ who really believes in Christ. I happen to believe in it myself but that's not the point of our discussion. Go ask Rev. Ed Young, who has a parish of 25,000 here in Houston. He'll tell you I'm doing exactly what God wants me to be doing." <br> Granted this all smacks of religiosity -- the same kind that prompts baseball players to point to the sky after they hit a home run. But it is a religiosity that is utterly American -- and particularly prevalent in the states where the Republican party now draws its strength. <br> So what is it that places the trial lawyers so irrevocably in the Democratic party, and makes them generally regard Republicans as the scum of the earth? <br> The single dividing issue is the trial lawyers' view of corporate America. To trial lawyers, corporations are the incarnation of evil, sinister megaliths directed by amoral men who use their monstrous power to get away with enormous crimes. This is a rebirth of early 20th-century Populism, but with a twist. The Populists never dragged corporate America before the civil bar, stripping them of billions in the process. <br> "What kind of country are we living in?" asks John O'Quinn, his voice rising with the emotion that has swayed many a jury. "Was Lincoln just a fool when he said this is a country of, by, and for the people? Or did he say something that we can really believe in, that little children can recite with pride in school? No! This is a country of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the filthy rich corporations. A corporation can be a criminal -- an absolute criminal -- and nobody can do a damned thing about it!" <br> Part of this rant is for show. But trial lawyers also encounter corporate America in a way that few other individuals ever do -- through its legal departments. Corporate defense attorneys commonly pursue the strategy of wearing down opponents, filing motion after motion, and challenging every single aspect of a case before anything ever gets to trial. They pursue General Patton's tactic of making the enemy spend all his resources before we spend all of ours. (Cynics argue that corporate defense attorneys prefer this strategy because they are being paid by the hour.) Through most of the history of product liability and other tort cases, the plaintiff bar has been completely outgunned by corporate treasuries. <br> Now that has changed. What the trial lawyer juggernaut has achieved is a kind of parity. They are now able to match corporate giants through long litigation. "The tobacco companies had never lost a case, partly because they were experts at making plaintiffs spend all their money," says Reaud, who was on the Texas team in the 46-state litigation. "We put in $12.5 million from this state when the initial litigation bogged down in Mississippi and Florida. Then there were several more 'capital calls.' I know one attorney who sold his farm in order to stay in the game." The payoff, of course, was worth it. The 80-odd law firms that won the 1998 settlement divided fees of $20 billion -- money that is now available for new pursuits. <br> Indeed, the trial lawyers have themselves become masters at bankrupting opponents -- although not necessarily to their advantage, since bankruptcy leaves less money for their fees. More than 60 major companies have been put in Chapter 11 by asbestos litigation. The search for a solvent bystander has now led plaintiff attorneys to target such companies as General Motors, General Electric, and Vivendi, whose involvement in injuries to asbestos workers was completely incidental (GM, for instance, used asbestos brake pads in its cars) but whose deep pockets can be reached through the doctrine of "joint-and-several liability." Silicon breast-implant litigation bankrupted Dow Corning -- even though the entire theory of the harm from implants is now recognized as junk science, and the Food and Drug Administration is about to allow implants back on the market. <br> And so, as these two superpowers -- armed with their nuclear arsenals of the law -- reach a kind of parity, the question arises: Is any kind of dtente possible? Or will the mutually assured destruction of American civil justice lay waste the entire economic landscape? <br> It is possible to imagine such a dtente. To begin, corporate America and its Republican allies must grant diplomatic recognition to the trial bar and admit that injury lawsuits are a permanent and acceptable part of the economic landscape. Critics such as the Manhattan Institute talk of a $200 billion "tort tax" -- as if money spent on lawsuits were simply being burned. This is not the case. Damages paid in many legal settlements serve a distinct purpose in buying improvements in health and safety that would not be possible through any other channels. <br> Like it or not (and conservatives should like it), government regulation is inefficient in improving health and safety. But personal injury lawsuits, as in Mark Bocci's football helmet case, can deftly reach into remote corners of the economy that would never be visited by a government inspector. What's more, large transfers of money are an effective means of inducing these improvements. Although some jury verdicts may seem absurd, large damage awards can be an effective way of getting the attention of corporate giants. <br> A case in point: Ford designed the Pinto in haste by shrinking an earlier model. Cramped for space, it left the car's gas tank outside the rear frame, exposing it to rear-end collisions. The company recognized the danger but decided not to take any one of several corrective measures, most of which cost no more than $12 per car. An internal memo later justified this decision by estimating the number of wrongful death suits and costing them out at $200,000 per fatality, then the standard established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. When damage awards starting coming in, however, jury verdicts averaged $6 million. The company had grievously miscalculated. When it became clear that litigation costs would far exceed the original estimates, Ford did a massive recall and later withdrew the car from the market. <br> Says Richard Epstein, author of "Principles for a Free Society: Reconciling Individual Liberty with the Common Good": "Tort law is indispensable to any modern system of safety regulation. When directed toward the uncovering of fraud or incompetence, it works well. The problem comes when, in a search for deep pockets, it misdirects attention to some remote third party who is in a poor position to protect anyone from harm. We should be as skeptical of people who call for wholesale abolition of the tort system as we are of people who want to maintain the status quo." <br> Like them or not, lawyers are here to stay. On the one hand, it is easy to agree when articulate critics such as Walter Olson and Philip Howard complain that America is "overlawyered" and lament an age when everyone runs to the courthouse to solve grievances. But having a lot of lawyers is as inevitable as having a lot of people with college degrees. And there are compensations in being able to take grievances before a neutral arbitrator. Lawsuits, like war, are policy carried out by other means. Although personal injuries, consumer claims, mass torts, and class actions occupy a growing portion of the docket, the vast majority of time in American courtrooms is still occupied by one corporation suing another. That's what makes America such a great place to do business (unless you prefer to see such disputes settled with payoffs, collusion, or violence). <br> A dtente would also require conceding that America's judiciary is capable of curbing many of the litigation excesses by its own means. The common law moves slowly but surely. In the early 1970s, for example, courts were inundated with civil antitrust cases. Every time the newly active Interstate Commerce Commission charged a company with anticompetitive behavior, private plaintiffs up and down the line began suing for triple damages under the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act. For a while it appeared the entire economy might drown in private antitrust litigation. Then in 1977 the U.S. Supreme Court decided Illinois Brick v. Illinois, in which it laid down the principle that only parties that bought directly from the offending company could sue under Clayton. Antitrust suits quickly subsided to manageable proportions. <br> Many of the absurdities that emerge from the jury box are later rectified. The Arizona woman who infamously won $3 million for spilling McDonald's hot coffee in her lap eventually had the verdict reduced to $480,000. (She did spend a week in the hospital and required skin grafts.) When Joe Jamail convinced a hometown jury that Texaco (a New York company) had tortiously interfered when Pennzoil (of Houston) thought it had purchased Getty Oil, the $11 billion verdict (representing Texaco's entire net worth) was eventually whittled down to $3 billion. Newspapers report stories like the prison inmate who sues himself for $5 million and then asks the state to pay since he has no source of income -- but never note that filing a lawsuit means nothing. All it reflects, in fact, is the growing awareness among trial lawyers that the bigger the numbers they post on the docket, the better chance the story will land in the papers. <br> But detente requires both combatants to stand down. So looking at the other side of the ledger, what can we ask from the trial lawyers? <br> The first thing is an admission that there is a vast amount of overreach in the demands of the plaintiff bar. Trial lawyers, for instance, like to get juries to hit defendants with huge punitive damages on the principle that it will "teach them a lesson" and "send them a message." But punishment is a public function and should be subject to the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of "excessive fines." It is irrational that the trial bar should tout the public benefits of its work and then deliver windfall profits to a single plaintiff who is only one of hundreds or thousands of wronged individuals. (Oregon now requires 60 percent of punitive damages go into the state Crime Victims' Compensation Fund, a reform that could easily be extended to other states.) <br> In fact, the longest-running litigation marathons have exposed the civil justice infrastructure as a vast Ponzi scheme. Millions of people may have been harmed by inhaling asbestos fibers, but there is not enough money in the world to compensate them all at the price being set by jury verdicts. One Texas jury recently awarded $200 million to an oil field worker who feared he had suffered lung damage, even though he had no visible impairments. The system now rewards those who file first with the best lawyers; everyone else is left holding the bag. Legitimate asbestos victims with claims on bankrupt companies are now receiving less than 10 cents on the dollar for their damages. <br> Second, trial lawyers must admit that among their numbers are those who have turned class actions and mass torts into a racket. In California, as Walter Olson recently reported, attorneys sent letters to thousands of businesses citing their recent violations of the state's draconic consumer-protection laws and demanding payment for not suing. It is hard to imagine a plainer example of "racketeering." The New York State Trial Lawyers Association has created a nonprofit Big Apple Pothole and Sidewalk Protection Committee, which hires students to inspect New York City sidewalks and mark up maps with thousands of squiggles that supposedly represent pavement damage. These maps are then used as proof of prior notice in slip-and-fall cases that currently cost New York City $60 million a year. <br> Asbestos claims now number 90,000 a year and are still climbing -- even though the epidemic of the lung cancer mesothelioma, the principal disease from asbestos exposure, has been declining since 1991. This is because tort firms now run screening clinics at factories, often rewarding doctors for each positive diagnosis. This blatant recruitment of plaintiffs has turned many of the pioneering asbestos attorneys into opponents of the current campaign." <br> We had a 79-year-old former refinery worker come into our offices two years ago asking us to represent him," says Wayne Reaud of Reaud, Morgan Quinn. "We sent him to our doctor, who told us the man didn't have anything wrong with him. We told him this, but the guy kept insisting he was sick. 'I know I got it, I know I got it,' he said. What we didn't realize is that he had been recruited by one of these advertising firms in Dallas, and they had told him he had asbestos damage." <br> On the morning of June 13, 2002, the 79-year-old showed up at the firm's offices in Beaumont, Texas, with a shotgun concealed in a cardboard box and murdered Reaud's partner, 47-year-old Chris Quinn, a former Baylor football player and father of five children. Quinn's picture -- coaching his son's soccer team -- still hangs prominently in the hallway. "These advertising firms that file fraudulent asbestos cases don't have a bigger enemy in the world than me," says Reaud grimly. (The 79-year-old, Richard Joseph Gerzine, was convicted of murder by a Beaumont jury on October 27, 2003.) <br> Critics on both sides agree that while the American civil justice system is very fair at settling disputes between contending parties, it takes little note of the effect of courtroom decisions on interested third parties -- i.e., society at large." <br> American justice is conceived as a sporting contest between rival contestants," says Deborah Rhode, director of the Keck Center on Legal Ethics and the Legal Profession at Stanford Law School. "The question is how far lawyers should go in representing their clients' interest. Values such as good faith, honesty, and fair dealing that are essential for efficient markets and regulatory systems rely on shared restraint. Over the long run, the single-minded pursuit of clients' self-interest can be self-defeating, not only for clients but for society as a whole." <br> Author Philip Howard, who has founded a nonprofit called Common Good to reform "America's lawsuit culture," cites a recent decision in the House of Lords -- Britain's equivalent of our Supreme Court -- where the judges dismissed the claim of a young man who had broken his neck diving into a lake at a park where 160,000 visitors swim each year. Noting that the only way to achieve safety would be to prohibit swimming altogether, the Lords asked, "Does the law require all trees to be cut down because some youths may climb them and fall?" <br> "This is the missing link in American justice," says Howard. "Judges have lost sight of the idea that lawsuits concern not only the parties in the dispute but everyone in society." <br> Trial attorneys are now like the capitalist Robber Barons who sparked the reforms of the Progressive Era. Just as the Robber Barons built America into an industrial giant, so the trial lawyers have made America into a healthier, safer, fairer place to live. That many of them have become billionaires in the process may prove only that they were the first to recognize the need for action. Like their industrial predecessors, however, the new Robber Barons may require public restraint. As Theodore Roosevelt knew, the outsized success of any business endeavor presents problems to the rest of society. <br> If they are to play TR, Republicans will need to begin by granting that Trial Lawyers, Inc., has a critical role to play in promoting health and safety and policing corporate America. Trial lawyers, for their part, will have to begin by recognizing that corporate America is not indestructible and that their litigious successes could end up doing great harm to the nation. <br> <b>William Tucker is a fellow with the Discovery Institute, which supported this investigation. <br> By William TuckerBy William Tucker 
 This commentary from The Weekly Standard was written by Andrew Ferguson.<hr width="75%">Sometimes without straining I can remember the long-ago 1990s, when a number of people, including many of my friends -- well, including me, to tell the truth -- succumbed to what some of us came to call "Billy Bob Gasket Disease." That's not really the name we used, by the way. The real name came from a man who is still living in Arkansas and still intermittently in the public eye down there, and there's no point, at this late date, in dragging him into a discussion of an affliction that he, like most of us, has managed to survive. <br> Gasket Disease was closely linked to Bill Clinton. The man I call Billy Bob Gasket had been involved in Arkansas politics for thirty years or more. He was used to its homegrown scandals and the mostly harmless diversions enjoyed by members of its ruling class. In this spirit, back in the early 1970s, he became an energetic booster of the young Rhodes Scholar who'd come home from Oxford and Yale with the impressive hair and the glimmering eye and the semi-permanent catch in his voice. <br> Then, along about Clinton's first term as governor, Gasket noticed something. Bill Clinton was different. He was not just another in the long line of amiable cads and genial rous who had grasped power in Arkansas since Reconstruction. The new governor was, Gasket came to believe, the least principled, sleaziest politician he had ever seen at work. That the lack of principle and sleaziness were lacquered over with twinkly charm and vaguely progressive politics made the situation, for Gasket, all the more maddening. <br> And maddening is the word. As Clinton was returned again and again to office, Gasket was at first disbelieving, then agog, and finally crazed. Why couldn't his fellow Arkansans see the truth? Why couldn't they penetrate the governor's sheath of bogus empathy and concern to see the creature of seething ambition and power hunger and raw cynicism that writhed so self-evidently beneath? Gasket became a hair-puller, a lapel-grabber, a mid-sentence interrupter, a nut. When, in the late 1980s, national reporters began trickling into the state to look over the promising young governor with national ambitions, their search for knowledgeable Clinton watchers led them inevitably to Gasket, and they found a madman. <br> Clinton became president. Gasket Disease trailed him like a cloud. It laid waste to Republican ranks in Washington and far beyond, to vast stretches of the country at large -- by the end, if I read the polls correctly, roughly a third of all Americans had succumbed. Those who caught the disease didn't just dislike Clinton, as, say, they might have disliked Jimmy Carter. The crux of Gasket Disease was not contempt but unendurable frustration. They could not fathom why everyone else didn't grasp his essential, transparent fraudulence: the phoniness of the lower-lip-bite, the moist insincerity of the smile, the vanity in every tilt of the carefully coifed head. As with syphilis, so with Gasket Disease: Some Republicans recovered, others were driven mad. <br> And now, according to an increasingly common view, George W. Bush has had the same effect on his political enemies that Bill Clinton had on his. He has driven them crazy; the nuthouse lately vacated by the Clinton-haters has suddenly filled with Bush-haters. Gasket Disease, according to this view, alights without regard to party or ideology -- and indeed has become a professional hazard and fact of life for anyone who dares take sides in partisan politics. <br> Is there something to this trading-places idea? The steam rising from this year's stack of new books on President Bush suggests that there is. It's true that for sheer fantasy, none of these anti-Bush books contains anything to rival such Clinton-era classics as Terry Reed and John Cummings's "Compromised," which asserted that Clinton had been installed as president on the say-so of Ronald Reagan's CIA director William Casey, or Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's "The Secret Life of Bill Clinton," which implicated Clinton in drug-running and even murder. Still, the anti-Bush books I've been reading through are undeniably . . . overdone. Pick one up, turn it over in your hands, and you can hear, if you listen closely, the faint sound of veins popping. <br> The new crop of Bush-hating books owe a lot to conservatives in other ways, particularly to the political potboilers that have proved so lucrative in recent years: Michael Savage's "Savage Nation," Sean Hannity's "Let Freedom Ring," Ann Coulter's "Slander," Bill O'Reilly's "The No-Spin Zone" -- the list of right-wing bestsellers is long and dispiriting. Like them, the anti-Bush products are not books in the traditional sense. They're tracts, pumped up and inflated to a size sufficient to fit in display racks. In appearance they are indistinguishable from diet books or the oeuvre of Dr. Phil. Chatty and personal, skipping lightly from one subject to the next in brief, easily digestible chapters, interrupted now and then by diagrams or cartoons or pithy sayings helpfully printed in bold, they show no sign of having been written for people who read books. They have found their audience. <br> Among the many ties that bind them, the authors are unanimous in claiming inspiration from Paul Krugman, a columnist for the New York Times, who, to borrow a term from epidemiology, seems to be Patient Zero in this most recent outbreak of Billy Bob Gasket Disease. You can understand why they revere him so. Unlike most Bush-hating authors -- there are volumes out now by a comedian, a media gadfly, a few reporters, a political consultant, a talk-show host -- Krugman has a real job, as a salaried economist at Princeton. Ten years ago he started moonlighting, writing charmingly on economic matters for Fortune, Slate, and other general-interest magazines. His well-earned success brought him a regular column on the Times op-ed page. He has recently gathered dozens, though it seems like thousands, of his Times columns and published them under the title "The Great Unraveling." <br> Every collection of newspaper columns, paced in hiccups of 750 words or less, faces problems of redundancy and continuity. Whether from presumption or laziness, Krugman has made no effort to overcome them. The breathless tone is unrelieved, the repetition dazzling. Right from the start you wonder whether the author, much less a copy editor, has bothered to read the book. On page three, in a new introduction, we learn that "America's radical right now effectively controls the White House, Congress, much of the judiciary, and a good slice of the media." Seven paragraphs later, on page five, we discover that "America's right-wing movement now in effect controls the administration, both houses of Congress, much of the judiciary, and a good slice of the media." <br> So that must be his thesis -- what happens to a country when its right-wingers in effect control the administration, Congress, much of the judiciary, and a good slice of the media. (Wait -- did I say that already?) So that must be his thesis. (Oops!) What happens is mayhem. Krugman sees a country in which free speech is disappearing, the poor are paying more taxes than the rich, and religious superstition is supplanting evolution in grade-school curriculums. That none of these things is actually taking place does not dampen his eagerness to spread the word. "This is hard for journalists to deal with," he writes. "They don't want to sound like crazy conspiracy theorists." <br> Krugman is quite happy to, however -- he may not have a choice -- and it is this mixture of insouciance and paranoia that make his columns so unpleasant to read; painful, too, for anyone who took pleasure and profit from his earlier stuff in the 1990s. "Together," he writes, "these columns tell a coherent story." They do. Column by column, we watch a talented fellow jettisoning one gift after another -- his humor, his prose style, his mental discipline, his taste -- in a rush to alert everyone else to the terrible fantasy that grips him. "The Great Unraveling" should be of interest only to sadists and shrinks. <br> The books by Krugman's acolytes may have broader appeal. Their common thesis is most economically summarized in Jim Hightower's "Thieves in High Places" -- not in the text itself, which is rendered unreadable by a tumult of exclamation points and sidebars and graphs, but in the book's index: <br> Bush administration: agenda to disunite America, 36-37 contaminated food and, 208-9 corporate interests of, 5-9 dangerous policies of, 3-4 early elitist agenda of, 76 <br> And so on, down to "undermining U.S. democracy, 240-43," the book's climax. <br> The titles of many of the books, too, rely on a single trope, as in Al Franken's self-amused "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them." Why "lies"? Why not "power-crazed" or "corrupt" or "hypocritical"? And "stupid" -- what happened to "stupid"? Any competent Bush-hater thinks their man personifies these traits, too, of course. Yet the word "lies" and its variants now, in common parlance, signify them all -- a shorthand summary of his every despicable instance of despicableness. <br> The question is why, and the most obvious possibility is that Bush really is a liar: a liar of astounding dimensions, a liar so vast that his lies overwhelm his standing as oligarch, hypocrite, or idiot. Another possibility suggests a reaction to the Clinton years. Of all the accusations leveled against Clinton, the hardest to refute was that he was a liar. Accusing Bush of the same may thus stand as a rebuttal to Clinton's accusers, since Clinton's lies, we were so often told, were about the trivial matter of an illicit liaison, while Bush's lies are about matters of state. (If only Bush had an illicit liaison to lie about!) As James Carville's ghostwriter cleverly puts it in "Had Enough?", "Democrats lied about something we really like: sex. Republicans lie about something they really like: war and money." Calling Bush a liar is a twofer. It at once underscores the gravity of the present president's misconduct, and it condemns the frivolousness of the previous president's accusers. <br> There is a strategic benefit as well. If Bush is a liar, the public is off the hook. Every political polemicist thinks of himself as a Tribune of the People. Populist is part of the job description -- and part of the self-image. <br> The problem for polemicists in attacking a relatively popular president is that the People are implicated as well: Maybe they like him because they're as depraved as he is. Which is unthinkable. (For if the People are evil, what of their Tribune?) Conservatives struggled with this difficulty in the 1990s, when Clinton, despite their well-orchestrated abuse, maintained his popularity through both his terms. "Where's the outrage?" wondered poor Bob Dole, swinging his lamp into musty corners as he wandered the country in 1996. In the deeps of the Lewinsky scandal, William J. Bennett published a book around the same question, "The Death of Outrage." From Where's the Outrage? it is a short hop to What in God's name is wrong with you people? If, on the other hand, the People are being lied to relentlessly, then they don't really know what's going on, and they can't be blamed. They may be chumps, but they're not evil. <br> In "Bushwhacked: Life in George W. Bush's America," by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose, we meet several of these misled Americans -- and they're just as colorful and earthy and pathetic as a populist could hope for. No one does populism as ruthlessly as Ivins, a graduate of Smith College and a former reporter for the New York Times, who holds a graduate degree from Columbia. Her political opinions are as reliably left-wing as this pedigree suggests, but she prefers to present herself as one of them spunky Texas gals what's jes full o' sass -- the love child of Noam Chomsky and Minnie Pearl. She uses the word "shit" a lot. Her newspaper columns, a slapdash mix of ideological platitudes and mild jocosities, made her famous a few years ago when they were collected in a huge bestseller with the unintentionally funny title, "Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?" (She can and does!) Incredibly, she has not won a Pulitzer Prize. <br> "Bushwhacked" is the best of the Bush-hating books. There is a sameness to the others, from their avenues of attack to their taste in jokes; at least four of them, by my count, reach for the line "It's deja voodoo all over again" to describe the administration's economic policies; the unimaginative Joe Conason, author of "Big Lies," was even desperate enough to use it as a chapter title. (And it wasn't funny the first time.) All rely heavily on the same statistics cribbed from Krugman columns and from precooked studies got out by think tanks such as Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "Bushwhacked" sets itself apart by glossing over the dreary technicalities in favor of original reporting, presumably by Dubose, about all those colorful victims caught in the Bush nightmare. <br> "This country is not working for most of the people in it," Ivins and Dubose write, which will be news to most of the people in it. It is certainly not working for any of the people in this book. We meet a high-school student with money problems, an environmental activist who's angry, and a single mother with a ghastly job skinning catfish on an assembly line. Their portraits are engaging and sometimes poignant -- the stuff of real journalism -- until you realize how cheaply Ivins is using these unhappy people as stage props in her larger argument. Their stories are necessary because the argument is so weak. It turns out that no set of facts could ever contradict the anti-Bush thesis; for that matter, any set of facts could be adduced in its support. Bush-hatred, as the philosophers say, is unfalsifiable. <br> George Bush's career, like that of most politicians, traces a zigzag, as he first tacks right, then left, then back to the middle, in his endless quest to be loved for as long as possible by as large a group of voters as he can reasonably seduce. A critic might see this as cynicism, but a Bush-hater can't grant even that much. Did Bush -- to take one example -- sign an extension of unemployment benefits to those without work earlier this year, over the objections of doctrinaire conservatives? Well, yeah. And a pretty big one it was, too. But it is only a minor inconvenience for the authors: "So Dubya [that's George W. Bush] did better than his old man [that's George H.W. Bush] and signed a bill that got some help to some workers. But two million jobs had disappeared since he took office two years earlier." <br> And Bush's "education reform," the cloyingly titled "No Child Left Behind Act," caressed and nurtured in the ample bosom of Ted Kennedy, reviled by right-wingers and libertarians? It greatly expanded the federal government's role in the nation's public schools, after all, and vastly increased their funding, with special attention given to poor schools, which were asked in return only to test their students more frequently. You would think the haters would be happy. <br> Yet Ivins and Dubose have discovered that the bill is really designed to be a windfall for big business interests -- specifically, companies that publish those standardized tests that schools will be required to use. "Follow the money," they write, inevitably. This larcenous scheme, as described here, is breathtakingly ingenious, slightly confusing, and not terribly efficient, especially if the point was merely to enrich more of Bush's rich friends. (That's what the tax cut was for!) "The idea is to set up strategic partnerships that involve market penetration in schools," write Ivins and Dubose. "Education is all about business." <br> It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: If Bush had refused to sign the education bill, he would have proved himself an uncaring hypocrite, by the standards of Ivins and Dubose. Because he did sign it, however, he has proved himself an oligarch. Bush-hatred adapts itself to any circumstance, fits any set of facts. "The term compassionate conservative is a bitter joke," they write. "Anybody who tells you different is lying for money." <br> So we are back to lies -- the engine of the Bush dreadnought. Yet what's a lie? It's a straightforward question, and a crucial one for the Bush-haters, but they're confused about the answer. In "The Bush Hater's Handbook," Jack Huberman tries to get to the heart of the matter. "Two lies stand out as the Bush administration's most basic, founding lies, if you will. The first is summed up by the political formula, 'Run center, govern right.'" He goes on: "The Bushies' second basic lie: their pretense that the closest election in history . . . somehow amounted to a mandate for a radical shift to the right." <br> There are some obvious problems here. For one thing, the lies singled out by Huberman aren't lies, at least as the word is conventionally defined, and it's not at all clear that "Run center, govern right" can be called a "political formula," much less a lie, and it's even less clear that the Bushies ever mounted a pretense that the election was a right-wing mandate, which doesn't seem to be the kind of thing they would make a public pretense about in any case; also, even assuming these two "founding lies" are lies, they're the same lie. Which means there's only one founding lie. Plus, it's not a lie. <br> Jack Huberman doesn't get us very far. Yet his confusion on the subject of Bush's lies isn't much more severe than that of the other Bush-haters. As author of a book with the title "The Lies of George W. Bush," David Corn should have thought the thing through. There is some evidence he tried. With an admirable, undergraduate earnestness, Corn devotes his preface to a meditation on what constitutes a lie, offering dutiful paraphrases of Machiavelli, Plato, and the inevitable Sissela Bok, author of "Lying." His own book has "an incendiary title," Corn acknowledges, "with an incendiary theme," and sure enough he begins it with two incendiary sentences: "George W. Bush is a liar. He has lied large and small." <br> This is an arresting opening, in my opinion -- a quick strike, building immediate momentum. But then he tries to illuminate Bush's lies by placing them in a historical context: "Most presidents lie." They do? Indeed, "there are many varieties of presidential lies," and fffffffft, the air is leaking from the balloon already. <br> Corn's partial list of presidential prevaricators doesn't help him regain the momentum. William Henry Harrison said he'd been born in a log cabin. "Not true at all," Corn says. Supporters of President Lincoln told voters he was a country lawyer; in fact, Corn writes, Lincoln was a rich railroad lawyer. Franklin Roosevelt fudged the facts in his effort to lead the United States into World War II. In a speech delivered after dropping the Bomb, Harry Truman called Hiroshima a military base, which was only partially true (apparently there was a big city surrounding it). Bill Clinton "promised an initiative on race relations and never produced one." As a candidate, the first president Bush said: "Read my lips: no new taxes," and then, two years later -- well, you know the ugly truth. <br> David Corn doesn't need any advice from me, but really, this is not the way to stoke an incendiary theme. If presidents have been liars from George Washington to Chester A. Arthur to Bill Clinton, then Corn's title and his opening two sentences, in retrospect, aren't nearly as shocking as they were apparently meant to be, and this in turn raises the fatal suspicion that maybe George W. Bush isn't so bad as the title suggests, either. Corn's definition of "lie" is pretty elastic, after all. Before he finishes his introduction he's expanded the word to include a broken campaign promise, an oversight, an incomplete admission, and a misrepresentation made by one group of people on another person's behalf. <br> But wait. His cogitations continue. And suddenly we learn: "Comparisons to previous administrations, though, are unimportant." They are? Here a reader can get really confused. The historical context doesn't matter? That can't be right. How come? "Bush is the president the nation has now -- at a point when honesty in government is needed as much, if not more, than ever." But surely this is just cant. Undermining government with lies is always wrong, isn't it, whether in George Bush's time or William Henry Harrison's? This is so hard to understand! <br> The form that Corn's confusion takes is important, because it is so widely shared by the Bush-hating books. Through them all runs a chasm separating the language used, which is sustained at the highest pitch, from the events being described, which are often mundane. The technique is usually called hype, and it's an essential feature of politics nowadays, thanks to the influence of television in all its absurdity, but on the page, between book covers, it's harder to shrug off. Corn's particular method, in the body of his book, is to print a Bush lie in bold type, and then to try manfully to expose its falsity in several hundred words. <br> A few examples will give you an idea. "I don't get coached," Bush once said. But Corn, through his own reporting and that of others, has discovered that Bush operatives use focus groups to test some of their rhetorical formulations. <br> There's more. Bush, describing Texas in 2000: "We still have no personal income tax." Corn: "An amendment to the state constitution -- proposed and approved by a Democrat-controlled legislature before Bush took office -- prohibited the imposition of an income tax without a voter referendum. Bush was assuming credit for a policy established before he had arrived." <br> Bush: "It's time to listen to each other." Corn: "Bush's call for a wide-open and respectful debate with plenty of listening was hokum." <br> Bush, a month after the September 11 attacks: "[We are] taking every possible step to protect our country from danger." Corn: "Plenty of steps were not taken." <br> Bush: "My [energy] plan helps people in the short term and long term." Corn: "Most of the plan's proposals, if implemented, would not affect energy markets for years." <br> Uncle! "This book does not document every single lie," Corn writes. The head swims at the thought of the ones that didn't make the cut. <br> Sometimes, like the old Washington Generals, the Bush-haters score despite themselves. Bush's failure, in the 2000 campaign, to disclose his drunk driving arrest in 1976, as Franken and others point out, was a breach of faith with supporters who had relied on his good word (and it may have cost him a victory in the popular vote). He has never plausibly answered reasonable questions about his service in the Air National Guard, questions explored at encyclopedic length by Corn and Conason. And the means by which Bush made his personal fortune -- mau-mauing the local government of Arlington, Texas, into subsidizing his sports team with taxpayer money, thus quadrupling its value and his profit when it was sold -- is a particularly tawdry instance of corporate socialism. <br> All true, yet all relatively trivial. I myself (if you'll excuse a personal note) have no special affection for George W. Bush, though I voted for him, and I am open to the idea that he is an unusually accomplished liar, though it strikes me as unlikely. Having read through the books of his political enemies, however, and having seen them discharge their heaviest artillery, I am even more open to the idea that he is the recipient of larger amounts of unearned abuse than any president since Abraham Lincoln, with the possible exception of Franklin Roosevelt. Both of whom were liars, as we've seen. <br> Why do they hate him so? The experience of Billy Bob Gasket is illuminating. Conservatives afflicted with Gasket Disease were called Clinton-haters because their dislike for the president struck other people as out of proportion -- a personal reaction inexplicable by the plain facts. It seemed not only beyond reason, but beyond politics. Clinton was the most conservative Democratic president since Grover Cleveland: overseer, among much else, of the 1996 welfare reform, the only significant reversal of the welfare state since its inception. It is unlikely, for the foreseeable future, that American conservatives will have another Democratic president so hospitable to their interests. <br> In the same way -- and always excepting foreign policy, which was utterly transformed by the September 11 attacks and which, in any case, is not the preoccupation of most Bush-hating books -- Bush's performance as a policymaker leaves little for his political opposites to complain about, and much to please them: steady increases in the nonmilitary budgets across the government, for the arts and humanities, for disease research, and now, most spectacularly, for government-run health care. Not only does Bush show no appetite to restrain the welfare state, he's been happy to enlarge it in ways that Clinton himself, hindered after 1994 by a hostile Congress, didn't dare. <br> To explain today's politics it is tempting to cite the old and excellent joke about feuds among college professors: The fights are so furious because the stakes are so low. The slow and stable advance of the federal government is unlikely to be undone by a president of either party, and the frenetic activities of political enthusiasts will redirect it in only the most marginal ways. Yet the joke doesn't really explain Gasket Disease. Bush-haters hate Bush for the least articulable reasons, the visceral kind that never quite rises to the level of rationality. They're often at a loss even to explain who it is they hate -- the Yalie plutocrat or the hill-country Bible-thumper? The failed businessman or the cunning Babbitt? The calculating liar or the master of malaprops, the wimp or the caveman, the evil genius or the boob? <br> The Bush-haters know they must scramble for more high-minded reasons to explain themselves, and this year's stack of new books is the unpersuasive product of their efforts. Taken together the books make plain, if only inadvertently, that the cause of our most recent outbreak of Gasket Disease is something much deeper than policy, much deeper even than politics, plunging down and down into the mysteries of cultural identity in fractured America. At the end of "Bushwhacked," Molly Ivins speaks for all Bush-haters when, with typical artlessness, she sums up our present state of affairs: "There is something creepy about what is happening here." But they can't quite put their finger on what it is. <br> <br>Andrew Ferguson is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard. <br> By Andrew Ferguson 
 Story: This commentary from The New Republic was written by Jonathan Cohn.<br><br>If the measure of a good compromise is the number of different parties it disappoints, then the new bill on Medicare reform would seem to be a smashing success. The AFL-CIO and Ted Kennedy hate it, but so do anti-government Republicans in the House and a gaggle of policy wonks at the Heritage Foundation. Even the bill's supporters -- most important among them, the American Association of Retired People (AARP) -- admit it's seriously flawed. And that's just the way the architects of the compromise say they want things. As Louisiana Senator John Breaux, one of two Democrats who participated in the final negotiations, put it, "No one got everything they wanted." <br> In fact, there's a long list of people -- from insurance companies to prescription drug manufacturers -- who got exactly what they wanted, and then some. Magically enough, they also happen to be groups that have spent a ton of money financing political campaigns and then lobbying the members they helped elect. <br> First on this list is the pharmaceutical industry. The Medicare compromise pumps $400 billion over ten years into the purchase of prescription drugs. Some of that money will simply displace money people already spend on their own, but much of it will be new money that would not otherwise have been spent. For the drug industry, that means more revenues and profits. But even more important here is what the government isn't doing: forcing down drug prices. Because private insurance companies, and not the government, will in theory be administering the benefit, the government won't have the power to bargain with drug makers the way that foreign governments do. Meanwhile, drug company lobbyists managed to gut a provision that would have legalized limited re-importation of drugs from Canada, where prescriptions cost less. Also gone is a proposal that would have eliminated some of the legal tricks drug makers use to thwart competition by generic manufacturers. <br> So the drug industry ends up with bigger sales but no pressure to lower its prices. Pretty sweet. Apparently that $22 million the industry spent on political contributions in 2002, 80 percent of it on Republicans, was a worthwhile investment. <br> It turns out that the insurance industry has also given a lot of money to political campaigns, most of them Republicans. And -- surprise! -- they make out extremely well, too. The compromise envisions the insurance companies playing two roles in the new Medicare universe: as a provider of stand-alone drug benefits, to those beneficiaries who wish to remain in traditional Medicare, and as a provider of traditional Medicare services plus drugs, for those beneficiaries willing to opt out of the system altogether and go with a private plan instead. Because participation is entirely voluntary for the insurance companies, the compromise authorizes the federal government to spend up to $12 billion effectively bribing companies to enter the program and then stick with it. <br> In other words, the insurance industry gets extra money to take on more customers -- plus the right to drop out whenever they decide the business is no longer sufficiently profitable. What else could they want? <br> Medical providers -- i.e., doctors -- are not exactly big fans of the private insurance industry. So you might think they'd oppose this compromise, given that it means more Medicare recipients will end up in managed care. But, no, they like the plan, too. And who can blame them? Buried within the text of the bill is a 1 percent increase in the money Medicare pays physicians -- this instead of a 4 percent decrease that the existing formula would have imposed. <br> So the doctors get more money out of a bill that's supposed to be about giving seniors assistance with prescription drugs. Again, not too shabby -- although, again, not so surprising given that health professionals donated $42 million in the 2002 elections, two-thirds of it to the Republican majority. <br> This explains why, for all the talk about making nobody happy, trade groups are tripping over themselves to push the bill through Congress. As Robert Pear and Robin Toner reported this week in "The New York Times," the former chief of staff to House Majority Leader Tom DeLay is coordinating a massive lobbying effort by everybody from the American Medical Association -- which vowed to "blitz Capitol Hill with an advertising and grass roots campaign" -- to the American Association of Health Plans -- whose director declared that "America's seniors are a giant step closer to having more health-care choices and prescription drug coverage under Medicare." <br> Of course, given the fundamental irrationality of the American health care system, sometimes doing the right thing in the long-term -- i.e., reforming Medicare -- requires doing the wrong thing in the short-term -- i.e., buying votes by subsidizing politically influential interest groups. But far from doing the right thing in the long-term, this bill actually makes Medicare less efficient and undermines its long-term financial stability. <br> It does this, first, by trying to introduce more competition into Medicare -- a cause Breaux and others have championed for years. In addition to authorizing a future demonstration program in which private insurers would bid for business against traditional Medicare in up to six communities, competition advocates secured financial incentives that would entice more insurance companies to offer Medicare benefits under the existing Medicare-plus-choice program. If this works, it would shift more people out of the old, government-run program and into private managed care plans. <br> Breaux and his allies justify their position by arguing that the private sector can adapt to changing medical technology and public health data more quickly than the Medicare bureaucracy -- and that the private sector is, by definition, more efficient than a government program. But it's not clear that either argument is true. Medicare certainly has its problems, but it incorporates new treatments pretty quickly -- so much so that much of the private sector frequently takes its cues from the program. And, assuming your measure of performance is the share of insurance spending that actually goes to medical care, Medicare is actually more efficient than the private sector. In traditional Medicare, just 2 percent of the money goes to overhead. Private sector plans, by contrast, spend an average of 15 percent on overhead. That might seem counter-intuitive if you assume, as many Americans do, that government is inherently inefficient. But it makes sense when you consider that the government doesn't have to spend money on advertising, among other things. <br> Not only does this brand of "competition" not make Medicare more efficient; it dramatically depletes the program's funds. According to the non-partisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, for every beneficiary who enrolls in a private plan today, the government already pays 119 percent of what it would have paid for that person's benefits in the traditional Medicare plan. The compromise bill would jack that rate even higher, up to around 130 percent. So if this reform becomes law, Medicare will actually wind up spending more money on less efficient coverage. <br> Unfortunately, it may also have less money to spend, period, thanks to a second major -- and less well-understood -- provision in the bill. As things stand, Medicare gets part of its money from payroll taxes, part from premiums, which beneficiaries pay, and part from general tax revenues. Under the compromise, if the actuaries who oversee the program determine for two consecutive years that general revenues will be covering more than 45 percent of the program's total costs, then Congress will have to act to change the program -- either by cutting benefits or raising payroll taxes. What's more, under the provisions of this law, those changes will be filibuster-proof, requiring only 51 votes instead of the usual 60. <br> In theory, there's nothing wrong with mandating that the federal government find a way to pay for entitlement programs like Medicare. But if the idea here were really to limit the share of the federal budget that goes to Medicare, then the plan could have called for doing precisely that. Instead, it merely calls for limiting the amount of program funding that comes from income taxes, which are progressive, thereby shifting the relative financial burden of the program from the wealthy to the poor. Needless to say, a program that relies on the poor to provide an ever-larger portion of its financing is hardly one you'd consider stable. <br> It's only when you consider the impact of these two efforts simultaneously that the larger "reform" agenda starts to come into focus. First it makes a Medicare financial crisis more likely. Then it demands that, in case of such a crisis, Congress either cut benefits or raise payroll taxes -- either of which will hurt the poor and middle class. The more you think about it, the more this starts to seem a lot like the Bush tax cuts: Once again, Republicans and a handful of conservative Democrats have come up with a plan that would shift taxpayer dollars from those who need it to those who don't, making it more and more difficult to sustain vital government programs. <br> But for all these flaws, at least seniors get a generous new drug benefit out of the bargain, right? Well, not exactly. To be sure, the bill would make prescription drug coverage available to every senior for the first time in American history -- an important step. Unfortunately, the people who need the help the most -- low-income seniors facing daunting medical bills -- don't actually make out so well under this scheme. Many low-income seniors now rely on both Medicaid as well as Medicare, with Medicaid covering the co-payments and deductibles they might not otherwise be able to afford. Unless the bill's language changes at the last minute, the new law would prohibit Medicaid from plugging these gaps. As a result, estimates the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, about 6 million elderly people -- all of them low-income, most of them in nursing homes -- would end up paying more for drugs than they do now. <br> All of which would, at the very least, seem to call for careful consideration -- and maybe some more negotiation. Instead, the Republican leadership is insisting on a quick vote before Thanksgiving, this despite the fact that the bill's final language hasn't even been written -- and that the Congressional Budget Office hasn't even calculated its cost. Promoters of the compromise say an early vote would keep the debate from becoming too partisan. More likely, it would keep critics from letting Americans know what's really in the bill -- and killing a bad idea before it's too late. <br> <b>Jonathan Cohn is a senior editor at TNR and a Kaiser Family Foundation media fellow. <br> By Jonathan Cohn 
 Editor's Note: CBSNews.com is delighted to be offering stories from two distinguished new partners, The New Republic and The Weekly Standard. TNR and the Standard are the two most influential, interesting and, most important to us, fun political magazines in the country (and they both have handsome Web sites, too). Not coincidentally, they inhabit very different sides of today's ideological spectrum, with TNR headed left and the Standard going right. <br> This commentary from The New Republic was written by Peter Beinart.. <br> John Kerry, Richard Gephardt, and John Edwards -- who supported the Iraq war -- now denounce it nearly as vehemently as Howard Dean, who did not. Dean, acting like the front-runner he is, spends less time attacking his rivals for trying to have it both ways. Wesley Clark, who was supposed to sharpen the campaign's national security debate, has instead embraced its mushy middle -- first saying, la Kerry, that he would have voted for the Iraq war resolution while opposing the war itself, now saying he opposed the resolution, too. <br> The campaign's real clash is over domestic policy. It closely resembles the fights that defined Democratic primaries in the 1980s and 1990s, and its main protagonists are Gephardt and Dean. The media often depict the Democratic primary as a battle between liberals and centrists. But those terms don't capture the real divide within the party: between yuppie reformers and working-class party regulars. The yuppies are culturally liberal and fiscally conservative. They deride President Bush's tax cuts as unaffordable but suspect we can't afford big new spending programs either. And, reflecting a middle-class, progressive tradition that dates back a century, they are skeptical of anything that smacks of machine politics. They like anti-politicians who tell hard truths. Alienated by quintessential party man Walter Mondale, they flocked to aloof outsider Gary Hart. Alienated by all-things-to-all-people Bill Clinton, they flocked to Paul Tsongas, who equated fiscal belt-tightening with moral virtue. Alienated by packaged, scripted Al Gore, they flocked to introspective, idealistic Bill Bradley. And, this year, they have made a religion of Howard Dean. <br> The party's working-class regulars, while hostile to the Christian Right, are more culturally traditional and a bit more hawkish (though less so in pacifist Iowa). But, more important, as the people who bear the brunt of cuts in entitlement spending, they don't view fiscal belt-tightening as morally bracing. The term "reform" is as likely to fill them with anxiety as enthusiasm. And, while the yuppies want to shift power to disinterested individuals (i.e., themselves), the regulars see latter-day political machines (i.e., unions) as their protectors. It is no surprise that the candidates who appeal to these regulars -- Mondale, Gore -- thrive in blue-collar, union-heavy Iowa. The yuppie candidates -- Hart, Tsongas, Bradley -- do best in white-collar, individualistic New Hampshire. 	 <br> The central political story of the first nine months of 2003 was Dean's eclipsing of Kerry as the yuppies' standard-bearer. The cerebral, aloof Kerry had seemed poised to inherit the upscale voters who had supported Hart, Tsongas, and Bradley. But Kerry's waffling on the war convinced many would-be backers that he represented politics as usual. Since Dean's rise, Kerry has begun attacking him for wanting to balance the budget by repealing the entire Bush tax cut and for opposing free trade. But denouncing Dean as too hawkish on the deficit is a bad way to win back white-collar Democrats, and bashing him as protectionist is a bad way to win over blue-collar union members. Kerry has lost one half of the Democratic base, and he is ill-equipped to win over the other. <br> Gephardt, on the other hand, has emerged as Dean's perfect foil. With his roots in ethnic, Catholic St. Louis, he has experience appealing to culturally traditional blue-collar voters. And no national politician since Mondale has such deep ties to the labor movement. Moreover, Gephardt's central attack on Dean -- for supporting Medicare cuts in the mid-'90s -- reinforces his appeal among exactly the voters he needs to win. <br> Dean, as the national media is discovering, is the most committed fiscal conservative to contend for a Democratic presidential nomination since Tsongas. In Vermont, which isn't constitutionally obliged to balance its budget, Dean nonetheless made balancing the budget his top priority, repeatedly spurning calls for greater social spending and winning praise from the libertarian Cato Institute. He has flirted with raising the Social Security retirement age and, as Gephardt charges, supported far deeper cuts in Medicare than most Democrats. On the stump, Dean delights in tough-love statements like: "Tell the truth: We cannot afford all of the tax cuts, the health insurance, special [education funding], and balancing the budget." <br> If Dean embodies the fiscal conservatism of yuppie Democrats, Gephardt embodies the regulars' passionate commitment to preserving entitlement programs. He voted against Clinton's 1997 deal, which cut Medicare to reduce the deficit, saying the budget need only be in "rough balance." His health care plan is much bigger than Dean's and tailored to win union support. <br> In appealing to unions and defending entitlements, Gephardt is pursuing roughly the same strategy that Mondale, Clinton, and Gore used to defeat outsider deficit-hawks. But that strategy is far harder now than it once was, because, over the years, the balance of power in the Democratic Party has been shifting: Dean supporters have been moving in, and Gephardt supporters have been moving out. Non-college-educated men have been drifting into the Republican Party. (In his final years as majority leader, Gephardt had to adjust the boundaries of his blue-collar St. Louis district because it was becoming too Republican.) Conversely, a 1998 "National Journal" study showed that the wealthiest 100 American communities, alienated by the GOP's fiscal irresponsibility and evangelical moralizing, were growing steadily more Democratic. This infusion of wealth into the Democratic Party means candidates with yuppie appeal can raise far more money than they could in the past. The last such candidate, Bradley, stunned political observers by raising almost as much money as Gore -- a development that foreshadowed Dean's extraordinary fund-raising success this year. <br> Dean, who learned fiscal conservatism from his investment-banker, Republican father, embodies today's Democratic Party better than Gephardt, the son of a Teamster from working-class St. Louis. Perhaps nothing explains the fight for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination better than that. <br> Peter Beinart is the editor of The New Republic. <br> By Peter Beinart 
 Editor's Note: CBSNews.com is delighted to be offering stories from two distinguished new partners, The New Republic and The Weekly Standard. TNR and the Standard are the two most influential, interesting and, most important to us, fun political magazines in the country (and they both have handsome Web sites, too). Not coincidentally, they inhabit very different sides of today's ideological spectrum, with TNR headed left and the Standard going right. <br> This commentary from The Weekly Standard was written by Hugh Hewitt. <br> Within minutes of the release of exit polls from California last night, Democrats had wheeled as one and began the hopeless attempt to spin the disastrous verdict. Senator Dianne Feinstein led the charge, but the refrain echoed throughout the party: This was a verdict on Davis's handling of the budget, a handling very similar to the fiscal mismanagement on the national level. <br> Howard Dean had the message on his website 18 minutes after the polls closed: <br> "Today's recall election in California was not about Gray Davis or Arnold Schwarzenegger. This recall was about the frustration so many people are feeling about the way things are going. . . . Tonight the voters in California directed their frustration with the country's direction on their incumbent governor. Come next November, that anger might be directed at a different incumbent . . . in the White House." <br> This delusional spin is great news for Republicans across the country. Gray Davis was booted from office because he imposed a massive tax hike on all California drivers while fecklessly allowing illegal aliens to get drivers' licenses. Davis was all Clinton-Carville when it came to the politics of personal destruction, and he didn't bother to disguise his total dependence on Sacramento's iron triangle of special interests: Indian gambling, trial lawyers, and public employee unions. <br> All of which is obvious. But when Democrats reflexively reject even the obvious conclusions, they demonstrate a capacity for political suicide reminiscent of Britain's Labour party in the late '70s and early '80s. The refusal of Dean and other senior Democrats to understand Tuesday's vote is an almost certain indication of electoral disaster ahead. <br> Americans are taxed too much, and lied to too often. The party of Clinton and McAuliffe remains addicted to trash politics, deceitful tactics, and lawyers' tricks--whether in the courtrooms of Florida or the Ninth Circuit. Disgust with the Democratic Party's entire approach to politics is palpable, but Democrats have set their faces against it and now cling to a vision of higher taxes wrapped around incessant America-bashing. <br> Arnold surfed the wave of voter anger into office, and needs only do what he promised to do: Repeal the car tax via executive order. Speak plainly and often about special interest domination of Sacramento. Revoke the drivers' license bill, and push through genuine workers' comp reform. <br> He does need to keep conservatives close. They protected his right flank in the election, and need only to be recognized as a significant part of the governing coalition. For example, when Justice Janice Rogers Brown of the California Supreme Court is confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the D.C. Circuit, Arnold should nominate a principled and credential conservative like my colleague John Eastman. With a few high profile appointments, Arnold will solidify the GOP behind him. The first time he leaves the state to campaign and raise money on behalf of a GOP candidate for a U.S. Senate seat, even McClintock die-hards will recognize the wisdom of supporting Arnold. <br> And when George W. Bush next arrives in the Golden State, to be greeted by Governor Schwarzenegger and thousands of energized volunteers, Democrats may finally begin to understand that willful avoidance of facts changes neither the facts nor the political dynamics that flow from them. <br> Hugh Hewitt is the host of the Hugh Hewitt Show, nationally syndicated radio talk show, and a contributing writer to The Daily Standard.

 Attorney Andrew Cohen analyzes legal issues for CBS News and CBSNews.com.<br>Fresh off their monumental decisions in June on affirmative action and gay rights, and after a summer break cut short by oral argument on campaign finance reform, the justices of the Supreme Court this week return to action in earnest. They find waiting for them a term that has its usual assortment of important, interesting, and evocative cases as well as a smattering of disputes that, well, let's just say you probably won't be hearing or caring much about when they get resolved. <br> Clearly, the headliner case of the term so far is McConnell v. FEC, the rambling dispute over whether the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, in whole or in part, is constitutional. Because their decision will necessarily affect the rules going into the 2004 presidential campaign, the justices came back one month early from fishing or sightseeing or writing or speaking or listening to show tunes or whatever else they do during their summer recess to hear nearly a day's worth of arguments in the case. They are expected to issue a decision, or perhaps a series of decisions, worthy of the thousands of pages of briefs thrown their way by all of the parties. Don't expect much clarity in this area when the decision comes down and don't expect any side in the fight to be particularly pleased with the result. <br> The term's undercard has another case with important political ramifications. In Vieth v. Jubelirer, the Court will look at what state legislators can do when redistricting counties following a census, an issue that is ripe in Pennsylvania and soon will be in Texas and Colorado, where nasty redistricting fights have broken out and are just beginning to wend their way through the courts. The justices can stop those nascent disputes in their tracks with a clear ruling. An ambiguous ruling, or a ruling that limits the power of the courts to referee these disputes, might create gerrymandering chaos after next November's election. <br> The Court this term will perhaps further refine and define its landmark school voucher ruling a few years ago. In Locke v. Davey, the justices will decide whether Washington state's scholarship program must be available to theology students as well as those majoring in secular studies. A decision in favor of the students might encourage other states to direct public money to religion-based studies. A decision in favor of Washington might signal a limit on the Court's willingness to endorse vouchers. Last week, the Court also accepted for review another case, this one out of Arizona, which also focuses upon Establishment Clause issues as they relate to parochial schools. <br> Speaking of religion, perhaps the nation's best-known legal dispute the fight over the constitutionality of the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance has not yet been formally recognized by the Court. We are still waiting to learn whether the justices will take the case and decide it on its merits. Last year, remember, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the two words violated the First Amendment's religious establishment clause. If the Court takes the case, the justices could declare the words "ceremonial deism" and simply overturn the lower appeals court. Or the justices could order the words stricken after all, they weren't in the original pledge but added during the Cold War. Or the Court simply could permit the 9th Circuit ruling to stand. Stay tuned. <br> Another looming fight which the Court has not yet formally recognized involves the issue of whether Guantanamo Bay terror detainees are entitled to any constitutional rights. So far, the lower courts have answered that question with a resounding "no" but the justices may choose the two cases as vehicles to announce their post-9/11 positions on such matters. Likewise, the bitter battle over what rights terror suspect Zacarias Moussaoui is entitled to may reach the Supreme Court before this term is out. Finally, there are two "enemy combatant" cases involving Jose Padilla and Yaser Esam Hamdi, American citizens held indefinitely without charges, that cry out for Supreme Court attention. Will this be the term when the justices finally speak out on the merits of the government's war on terror? Again, stay tuned. <br> There are plenty of familiar topics on the docket this term. Several cases involving the Americans with Disabilities Act, always a popular choice for the chronically litigious, will be before the Court. There will be several bankruptcy cases as well, perhaps a sign of the economic times. Police power cases involving the validity of searches and seizures, Miranda warnings, and custodial interrogations litter the calendar. There are at least three Clean Air Act cases this term and an important case involving the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, in which the justices will look at whether that federal law prohibits "reverse" discrimination. <br> But the Court also will hear cases involving statutes you probably haven't heard of. For example, the justices will focus for a time on the Pittman Underground Water Act, the Tax Injunction Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Indian Civil Rights Act as well as the "cramdown provision" of federal bankruptcy law. Since they will be together as a group for the tenth straight year, the justices undoubtedly will have to focus again on the usual parade of questions about looming resignations and retirements from the bench. And a term like this one just might make that scenario fairly appealing to one or more on the Court. <br> By Andrew Cohen 
 Nudism is getting bigger and bigger in the United States today. And according to market research, suburban Republicans tend to be the group of nudists who stand out the most. So, unlike the image that many of you may have, these people are not irresponsible, wild "hippies." These conservative clothes-less citizens favor tax reform and enjoy reading "Golf Magazine." They just do their politicking and reading in the nude. It's interesting that when there is so much secrecy and subterfuge in politics, this particular group is for full disclosure. <br> Why are there approximately 25 percent more nudists today than 10 years ago, and why are so many of them Republicans? Have they become the political party with nothing to hide, or is this just a reflection of the sagging economy? <br> When you think about it, nudity is quite conservative. It certainly goes along with the concept of "back to basics." Benjamin Franklin liked to sit naked in front of an open window each day taking what he called, "air baths." George Washington and Thomas Jefferson regularly went swimming without clothes. Apparently, they weren't just anxious to be freed from the chains of tyranny, but from the seams of their britches as well. <br> Clothing has traditionally been used to demonstrate status. Kings and queens wore outfits that cost more than the homes of an entire village. Nudity is a living statement of egalitarianism, where nobody shows off their latest designer clothes. So, our Founding Fathers would agree that nudity is definitely democratic. But why is going without clothes becoming so popular today? Maybe people are troubled by the world that the business suit, the military uniform, and the cocktail dress represent. So they rid themselves of these clothes, and relax, temporarily forgetting about their responsibilities and troubles. <br> Nudism is big business an estimated $400 million a year. That's an awful lot of money for a business without pockets. In addition to resorts, there are clothing-optional cruises, as well as summer camps for children and adults. So there's no indication that the nudist industry is going to go bust. <br> Although it's hard to know the exact statistics, experts believe that the state with the most nudists and the most naked tourists is Florida. That's right, the site of so much political wrangling in the last presidential election is also the home of the greatest concentration of unclothed voters. Now that we know how important Florida is politically, and now that there are even more naked voters there than a few years ago, we're bound to see a lot of campaigning for their votes. Obviously, the Republicans have an edge right now with nudist voters, but I think we can expect the Democrats to be standing right behind them (well, maybe not right behind them). <br> American politics being what it is, the Democrats will do their best to narrow the nudist gap. Don't be surprised to see candidates on both sides adopting "pro-nature" platforms. We'll probably hear speakers talk about how confining clothing is, and how we all have to accept each other for who we really are. If it's a close election, it's possible that at least one desperate candidate will doff his or her clothes and join in the volleyball game. <br> Citing national security, Attorney General John Ashcroft will probably propose that all airline passengers fly in the nude. That will make it much more difficult to conceal weapons. It may also do wonders for travelers' morale, reviving the spirit of "the friendly skies." <br> And is a clothing-optional Presidential Debate anymore preposterous than what happened in Florida last time? Going after the naked vote is completely consistent with American politics. After all, we certainly have a tradition of politicians getting caught with their pants down. <br> By Lloyd Garver 
 The man in the White House is the most underrated tactician since Ronald Reagan. In his latest Against the Grain commentary, CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer says that's just the way George W. Bush wants it. <hr><b>CBSNews.com has obtained an advance excerpt from President Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in New York City, September 2004: <br> "As your president, I was proud to shepherd in the greatest expansion of government health benefits since the Great Society programs of the 1960s. By making sure that Medicare will pay for prescription drugs, we have ensured that America's seniors finally have the coverage they have been deprived of for so long. And to the millions of 'baby boomers' that will retire in the coming decades, I say you will never have to worry about paying for your medicines again. Democrats talked the talk; we Republicans have walked the walk." <br> General George W. Bush is about to cut the Democrats off at the pass on the one big issue they thought they "owned" Medicare. Democrats and their president began trying to expand prescription drug benefits in 1997. They failed. Now Bush is about to take credit for success. <br> Some liken Republican Bush's prescription drug cure to Democrat Clinton's welfare reform breakthrough; both are "Nixon in China" gambits. <br> I think the Bush regime's strategy more closely resemble Tommy Franks' drive to Baghdad. <br> Decisively taking advantage of a routed and disorganized enemy, Bush is attacking their core territory with a fast, flexible infantry of policy and positions. Resistance is sporadic and the opponent's leadership is missing in action. <br> The Bush Army has clear and simple goals for this war and that, they say, is half the battle. <br> George Bush wants to be a two-term president. He does not want the geeks from that goofy Democratic co-ed fraternity to have any power on campus. He wanted to cut taxes a lot and he did; he thought it was good for the economy, good for rich people and good for controlling and strangling future government spending on most everything except armies, Medicare and Social Security. He wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein and he did. <br> The Bush Army also has tactical genius. <br> Most of his opponents will never admit that because General Bush is inarticulate and nonintellectual. That is Tactical Genius Trick #1. "I am the master of low expectations," Bush said on the way back from the Mideast summit. <br> Bush moves forward, quickly. He fights the next battle, not the last battle. He staged the Israeli-Palestinian summit just a few weeks after he invaded an Arab country. <br> Like Nixon, Bush is fully capable of scaring his foes into thinking he is capable of doing something really nuts so that they let him do something they think is only a little bit nuts. With deficits soaring and war costs piling up, Scary Bush said he wanted to cut taxes by at $700 billion more. The guy just won a war and he got big tax cuts just two years ago, so the Democrats figured that he could probably shoot the moon. Whammo. A $350 billion passes in no time. <br> General Bush knows the value of a good enemy, like Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden. Domestically, Bush not only has the foils to his left, the Democratic Party of Nancy Pelosi and Tom Daschle, but also on his right, the Republican party of Tom Delay. He plays them like a violin. <br> Example: the tax cut that just passed denied an expanded child-care tax credit to many low-income families. Democrats were properly outraged and so were some Republicans. But Tom Delay wasn't. He thought it was outrageous to give people whose income is so small that they pay little or nothing in taxes a tax cut or especially a refundable credit. Delay provided Bush with an extreme right flank, and Bush marched through the center, supporting the expanded child-care credit. <br> Bush's finesse on Medicare illustrates all these strategic and tactical wiles. <br> As Washington's moist summer of 2003 started to simmer, the prescription drugs issue was nowhere near the front burner. That spot was reserved for the search for Saddam, Iraqi WMDs and the post-mortem on how US intelligence was used or abused. <br> Bad issues for Bush. Could lead to high gloss investigative hearings. Need a diversion. Use the 'move fast, move forward, don't fight the last battle' edict. <br> Thus, The Battle of Prescription Drugs. The President had not spent much time or political capital on it since the election, when it was a prominent issue. Bush spent far more ammo on a campaign to steer Medicare and Social Security toward privatization, a truly scary prospect for Democrats and most seniors. That, we see now, was diversionary fire, the Nixon scare 'em gambit. <br> When prescription drugs suddenly emerged on Congress' fast-track docket in June, Bush essentially abandoned the privatization shtick. Democrats, led by Ted Kennedy, saw an opportunity not just to dodge a sniper's bullet (privatization), but to actually accomplish something important. Not perfect, but important and a step in the right direction that can be tinkered with later. And if Democrats block the bill because they don't want Bush to get the credit, they really look like weasels. <br> Now, suddenly, Bush's Army is at the outskirts of the Democrat's Baghdad Medicare, fount of political capital and party identity. Top White House political strategists have said clearly that Medicare's prescription drug coverage is the key issue for 2004. If Bush can get credit for breakthrough legislation here, he has taken away the enemies best issue. <br> Prescription drug coverage is of course vital to the Democrats most loyal constituency old people. Splitting this stronghold is key for the Bush Army. But the issue is equally important for all us baby boomers with retirement-phobia since the stock market crash. It's a big credential for his "compassionate conservatism." <br> There's more. The Tom Delay battalion is furious at Bush for caving in on privatizing of Medicare and for adding a huge new entitlement benefit to Medicare. Bush dissed them. The General has taken advantage of dug-in shooters on the left and the right flanks to march straight through the high middle ground. <br> Bill Clinton could plot war games like this with even more aplomb. It just turned out he couldn't get bills passed and enemies vanquished. <br> George Bush, in Iraq and on the Potomac, is getting it done. The question to be answered: Has he done good? <br> Dick Meyer, the Editorial Director of CBSNews.com, is based in Washington.

 The Gary Hart Story looks a little different now that we're in the post-Clinton era. Will Hart decide to try to be the Comeback Kid II? In his latest Against the Grain commentary, CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer says it might be fun to watch. <hr> <br> On Saturday May 3, 2003 the Democratic presidential candidates will have their first debate, an absurd eight months before the first primary of 2004. <br> God help us. <br> American campaigns, by far the longest in the world, are getting longer, for no good reason. Candidates must now be marathoners, which in my mind, means they're masochists. <br> The ultimate lonely long-distance runner in the Democratic field is Gary Warren Hart. He's been running since 1983. <br> Age breeds some wisdom and Hart plans to skip the South Carolina charade. <br> Technically, Hart is just flirting with running. He says he'll decide soon whether to get in, but added, "I am not about to wait another 20 years." <br> Hart brought his maybe-campaign by CBS News this week. These little candidate get-togethers usually focus on the mechanics of running for president name recognition numbers, approval ratings, fundraising progress, consultants under contract, target states, and handicapping the rest of the field. <br> Hart didn't talk tactics. In the realm of tactics and mechanics, Hart doesn't have a prayer. He talked about the gargantuan wads of cash spent in presidential campaigns with genuine bewilderment and disdain, not with the false sanctimony of someone who is going to go out and raise the money anyway. <br> A Hart campaign would be the longest of long shots and the political press corps has not taken his flirtation very seriously. He's been out of politics for 15 years. He was never a natural on the stump. And, of course, there's the fact that his 1988 campaign came to an abrupt and embarrassing end because of a sex scandal and a boat called "Monkey Business." <br> "He's got an expiration date on him that says 1988," a Colorado pollster told Hart's hometown paper. <br> Indeed, I glibly dismissed Hart in a column I wrote in February. I shouldn't have. <br> In 1984, Gary Hart was the candidate of "new ideas." His opponent, Walter Mondale, a believer in old ideas, responded by swiping a then-famous Wendy's ad "Where's the beef?" <br> These days Hart's thinking is very meaty and refreshingly contrarian, especially in a Democratic Party that is so intellectually and strategically timid. <br> Hart's two "big issues" are more Republican than Democrat. <br> Number one, Hart thinks America isn't safe enough. He says the state of homeland security is a "scandal." This is the issue that put Hart back on the sound-byte plane. During the Clinton administration, Hart and former Senator Warren Rudman, R-N.H., co-authored a report that dramatically documented America's vulnerability to terrorism and called for a cabinet agency devoted to just that. Nobody paid much attention, until September 11, 2001. <br> Number two, Hart believes the American economy is living beyond its means, piling up so much foreign debt, consumer debt and national debt that that the capital investment needed to keep the economy growing in the long-term isn't possible. He wants to shift to a tax system that taxes consumption, not income. Democrats normally don't like this approach because poor people need to consume a much higher slice of their incomes than rich people. <br> These sound like Republican planks, but Hart thinks President Bush is oblivious to them. <br> Hart was a critic of war and he remains unapologetic. He thinks Donald Rumsfeld's Department of Defense has committed the U.S. to a unilateralist, go-it-alone foreign policy that is wholly inappropriate for a world increasingly populated by well-armed countries and ethnic-cultural populations (Muslim fundamentalists, for example). And he thinks the Democrats were caught flat-footed and have been rolled by Rummy. <br> Similarly, Hart believes the Bush administration has a big, ambitious domestic agenda that the Democrats are equally clueless about. Bush's policies, Hart argues, aim to "dismantle everything from the New Deal to the Great Society." Privatizing Social Security is part of it, but the main scheme is to rack up so much debt and deficit that social spending is impossible for years to come. <br> All of this takes Hart neatly back to his last political moment in the sun 1984. <br> In Ronald Reagan's first term, a scaredy-cat Democratic Party rolled over as Reagan cut taxes, poured money into the military and created deficits that his budget director said were a "Trojan Horse" for radical reductions to domestic programs. Sound familiar? Ronald Reagan was immensely popular in his first term and the Democrats were having an identity crisis. Sound familiar? <br> Hart says of President Bush, "He shares with President Reagan a simple, if not simplistic, view of the world that serves him well." <br> So why is Hart again itching to take on a popular incumbent with a simple, easily communicated platform and a well-oiled political machine? It makes him seem even more a Don Quixote. <br> Hart was the campaign manager for George McGovern's quixotic 1972 campaign. The epilogue to his memoir of that campaign, "Right from the Start," said, "The Democratic Party, under penalty of irrelevance and extinction, must bring forward a new generation of thinkers who are in touch with the real world " <br> That hasn't happened. Hart says he doesn't know why. <br> Bill Clinton did not bring forth this new generation of Democratic ideas. "He left no legacy," Hart said. "I've known him for 30 years. He's a tactician." <br> On the contrary, Hart says that big, creative thinking about American politics for the past 20 years has been dominated by the healthy competition on the Right between neo-conservatives, Christian conservatives and Gingrichians. <br> Hart's 1984 run came at a moment that had similar promise for Democrats. A radical Left still sparred with the labor union-New Deal Democratic mainstream, while Hart and his fellow neo-liberals tried to forge a radical center by focusing on such un-Democratic themes as military reform, technology and economic growth. That was the last intellectual high point for the party. <br> So I'm hoping that Gary Hart might stick around for the real debates in next January. <br> Dick Meyer, the Editorial Director of CBSNews.com, is based in Washington.

 In her latest Political Points commentary, CBS News Senior Political Editor Dotty Lynch looks at the rise in internecine warfare within the Republican Party. <hr>On Easter Sunday, the 23rd airing of Charlton Heston's 47-year-old film "The Ten Commandments" swept the ratings. But this week, the Republican's 11th Commandment, "Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican," didn't fare quite so well. <br> What happened? Saddam was toppled, President Bush has a popularity rating of 73 percent and two-thirds of American can't even name a Democrat running for president. Republicans hold both houses of Congress (not to mention the Supreme Court), so everything should be coming up roses, right? <br> Well, not quite. The Club for Growth, a conservative group devoted to knocking off moderate Republicans they can't keep in line, ran an ad comparing Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine and George Voinovich of Ohio to the French for their refusal to vote for the president's $726 billion tax cut. Snowe and Lincoln Chaffee of Rhode Island criticized Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum for gay bashing; Voinovich stiffed President Bush when he went to Ohio to push for his big tax cut and the president dissed Voinovich for advocating "little bitty tax relief." Dennis Hastert and Tom DeLay are on Bill Frist's case for not delivering conservative programs, and the White House got into a snit when Frist went off to Asia and without telling them about Snowe and Voinovich. <br> And then there's the return of Newt. In his most Newt-like tones, the former Speaker dumped all over the State Department, called Colin Powell's diplomacy a disaster and his upcoming trip to Syria ludicrous. Gingrich an ally of Donald Rumsfeld and member of the Defense Policy Board along with Powell nemesis, Richard Perle let it all hang out in the Washington Post and later at the American Enterprise Institute in a speech conservative foreign policy analyst Frank Gaffney called "Churchillian." <br> The next day Powell and Rummy tried to make nice over lunch at the State Department, but their allies were all over the place stirring the pot. Al Hunt in the Wall Street Journal called the Powell-Rumsfeld rivalry "perhaps the most intense and high-stakes intra-administration feud since World War II." <br> One Republican consultant tried to explain all this discord by attributing it to the spoils of war. "Maybe they all suddenly feel emboldened. During the war over everyone's been cooped up and stressed out and now they are feeling their oats." There appears to be no accountability. The fissures inside the party on taxes vs. deficits and on social issues are coming to light. That puts the focus back on the question of leadership and who is really running the show. <br> When it comes to politics it's Karl Rove, of course. But on foreign policy and on the Hill the power centers are diffuse. During the war, not only did President Bush suffer a setback on taxes, but his treasured ANWAR oil drilling proposal went down, his judicial nominees and faith-based programs stalled, and Medicare reform remains a tangled mess. <br> Another Republican suggested that the Rove-Bush technique of "flooding the system" with big programs is bound to create tension, spurring public officials to fight for their piece of the action. One GOP consultant said they may be taking the president's popularity and Republican electoral dominance for granted and assuming that this infighting won't cost them anything. <br> The good news for the GOP is that the fight over the tax cut is about how big it should be, not whether cutting taxes at all is good policy. Rove said last year at AEI that he was determined to make sure the Republican base knew that George W. Bush was committed to cutting taxes and that the perception of him wanting lower taxes might even be more important than actually getting them. <br> The GOP base is happy. Ninety percent of them support the president and have for two years. White House pollster Matthew Dowd sent a memo out to Republicans this week warning them that the high poll ratings would come down and that at some point the president might even trail a Democratic opponent in the polls. He urged them not to panic if this happened and cited lots of historical precedents to bolster the point that if the president's re-elect rating was at 45 percent or above, he'd win. <br> The White House is betting that despite the squabbles the party will come together when it matters, and that George W. Bush will sail to victory in 2004. And they may be hoping that when the polls do start to come down, some Republicans will get a little worried and start obeying that 11th commandment once again. <br> By Dotty Lynch 
 Last week, it was a Democratic tax plan the Republicans should like. In this week's Against the Grain commentary, CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer looks at a GOP plan the Dems should dig. <hr>Who'd have thought that smack dab in the middle of Against the Grain's first ever, much-anticipated two-part series on federal tax plans, President Bush would sack his economic team? A coincidence? I don't think so. <br> For the record, Against the Grain is one of the very few venues that defended Paul O'Neill. I liked O'Neill. I liked his no-b.s. pronouncements, his gaffes, his tin ear for politics and his trip to Africa with Bono. I liked Larry Lindsey, too. <br> And I liked their dislike of the way the tax code treats corporate dividends. Supposedly, some kind of repair for that problem was to be included in the administration's economic "growth" plan. <br> While they shuffle the deck, White House spin dealers say that the new faces don't mean new policies, just new sales pitches. So I guess that some cut in the taxes on dividends might still be in the cards. <br> That would be a good thing. <br> Any stimulus (or growth) package that passes next year is going to be "show business," in the candid words of the late, great St. Paul of Alcoa. They'll mix two tablespoons of investors' breaks with one teaspoon of cuts for the middle class, and add a sprinkle of something for the poor on top. Then, if the economy happens to swing back, Washington will take the credit. <br> But adding a well-designed reduction in the taxation of dividends to the recipe might create some lasting good, whatever happens with the economy in the short run. <br> Here's the disservice the tax code perpetrates on dividends: a business' net profits are taxed at the corporate rate and then, when the business distributes some of those profits to shareholders as dividends, they are taxed again as personal income to the shareholder. <br> This is taxing the same money twice and it's not fair. <br> Fixing the unfairness, though, is not the main virtue here. Reform would allow the market to allocate capital more efficiently. It would stop government penalization of dividend-paying stocks and dividend-stock investors. Most importantly, it could help eradicate some of the accounting flim-flam that has scandalized corporate America this year. <br> Here's why: <br> The corporate dividend, once the security blanket of Main Street investors, has become almost extinct. In the 1980's and early 1990's, the average dividend yield on stocks in the SP 500 varied between 5 percent and 6 percent. For the past five years, that dividend yield has been below 2 percent. In the boom years, dividends seemed like sops for suckers. <br> This happened greatly because the tax code punishes dividends. <br> On the business end, it works this way: businesses can raise capital two ways, by issuing stock or borrowing money. Interest payments are deductible to corporations; dividend payments are not. So companies have a tax-based incentive to borrow money rather than issue stock. <br> On the individual side, dividends are taxed at regular income rates while capital gains are taxed at lower rates; $1,000 in dividend income is taxed more than $1,000 in capital gains. That gives investors a tax-based incentive to prefer capital gains to dividends. <br> Now here is where corporate crime comes in. <br> The trend away from dividends coincided neatly with the self-interest of corporate managers who were increasingly rewarded with stock options. Just as the tax code discourages dividends, it encourages stock options; grants of stock options to company execs are tax deductible (so they reduce the company's tax bill), but they do not have to be listed as expenses (so they increase the company's earnings on paper). <br> Now, stock options increase in value only when the stock price goes up. Managers who have stock options have magnified incentive to boost their company's stock prices. Shareholders seeking capital gains, not dividend income, make money only when prices rise. <br> With stocks that don't pay dividends, prices go up when the firm's earnings go up, are forecast to go up or investors bet they will go up. So stock prices are greatly determined by how good the company's books look. Because of they own stock options, corporate managers have had greater incentive than ever to cook the books, as this year on Wall Street amply demonstrated. <br> Earnings are numbers on computers screens; shareholders can't buy things with earnings. Accounting ledgers can be manipulated; dividend checks can't be, they either come in the mail or they don't. If they come, and the checks clear, investors really could care less if a company's earnings statements are doctored. <br> According to Alan Greenspan, when dividend yields were higher, "one of the problems we did not have is earnings manipulation." <br> Eliminating the tax penalties for dividends does not mean forcing companies to pay dividends; it is simply treating debt and equity, dividend income and capital gains income equally. <br> Growing companies can often create more value for shareholders by reinvesting their profits than by paying dividends. They will continue to do so and the market will judge them. For example, shareholders in Cisco Systems, which is sitting on some $21 billion in cash that could be distributed as dividends, recently voted not to do that. <br> There are two ways to fix this. Either companies should be allowed to deduct dividends, or individuals should receive an exclusion or preferential rates for dividend income. The latter is easier to sell politically. <br> Democrats have traditionally fought both solutions. You know the sound byte, "These are tax cuts for the rich." <br> Well, a lot of non-rich people have 401(k)s and mutual funds now. Even if they don't have dividend income, or if it's tax exempt in their retirement accounts, they have an interest in more honest big businesses. Candidate John Kerry picked up on this and he's now a liberal Democrat who favors cutting taxes on dividends. <br> Many Democrats assume that voters still believe they are the party that protects the little guy's wallet. The 2000 and 2002 elections should have cured them of that notion. <br> Dick Meyer, a veteran political and investigative producer for CBS News, is Editorial Director of CBSNews.com based in Washington. <br> E-mail questions, comments, complaints and ideas to <br>Against the Grain <br> Dick Meyer 
 In her latest Political Points commentary, CBS News Senior Political Editor Dotty Lynch reflects on the final days of Campaign 2002.<hr>Aunt Gertrude, my 97-year-old aunt in Marlboro, Mass., who usually doesn't skip a beat, looked surprised when I said I was really busy this year on the election. <br> "Oh no, that's not coming up already, is it?" she asked. At first I thought she was starting to slip. Then I realized that I felt the same way. It seems like just yesterday we were counting chads in Florida. And then Sept. 11 happened and our gyroscopes went out of whack. Campaign 2002 is being fought under the old rules in a world that's very different from the one where those rules made some sense. <br> Democratic campaign consultants say, for the most part, that Sept. 11 hasn't affected their strategies. And they point to their victories in the 2001 gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey as shining examples of why Sept. 11 shouldn't matter this year. <br> Republican consultants say much the same thing about their campaigns on a micro-level. But the White House has believed for the past year that the national unity which followed the terrorist attacks would work in their favor and give President Bush and GOP candidates incredible political capital to spend on the midterm elections, especially on recapturing the Senate. <br> Karl Rove, the White House political sage, got roundly criticized last winter for suggesting what every political operative knows to be true: that in the aftermath of Sept. 11, the war on terrorism would be a great political asset for the GOP. "We can go to the country on this issue because they trust the Republican Party to do a better job of protecting and strengthening America's military might and thereby protecting America," Rove told the Republican National Committee in January 2002. <br> And go to the country they did. While Vice President Dick Cheney was shuttled from one secure undisclosed location to another, President Bush blew the lid off the moratorium on politics, and beginning with an event for his brother Jeb on January 10, made 67 fund-raising trips to 34 states, raising $145 million for GOP candidates. <br> In addition, he has Get-out-the-Vote trips scheduled to 23 states to in the final two weeks of the campaign. His pitch at these events, often coupled with a taxpayer-paid presidential speech in the same city, isn't just foreign policy; mostly it's about his tax cut, something beloved by Republicans who believe down to their toenails that Democrats want to tax and spend it away. <br> <b>From Art Linkletter to Saddam Hussein</i> <br> Meanwhile, the Democrats have careened from domestic issue to domestic issue trying to get some traction, still believing that those golden oldies that won Al Gore the popular vote in 2000 prescription drugs, preserving Medicare and Social Security and keeping the economy strong would work for them, if only they could engage the voters. They were outfoxed on prescription drugs by the Republicans, who put out their own plan, and with the help of Art Linkletter and a $9-to-$13-million ad campaign paid for by the pharmaceutical industry, mired the debate in confusing details. In the late spring and early summer, the Democrats thought their moment had come. First, energy giant Enron declared bankruptcy and then telecom colossus WorldCom followed suit. The stock market took a dive and Democrats' hopes soared that their favorite populist themes might produce momentum that would not only allow give them control of both the House and the Senate, but do so with convincing margins. <br> But by September, the focus was back on foreign policy, first Iraq and then North Korea. And as candidates still fought about privatizing Social Security, corporate responsibility and prescription drugs, the national focus was on almost everything but the midterm elections. Democrats caved on the Iraq resolution as a way to get it off the agenda so that their economic message might return. But the Tyndell Report, which counts the number of minutes broadcast networks spend on particular topics, showed little enthusiasm for the elections. For the week of Oct. 14-18, the networks spent 86 minutes on foreign policy issues Iraq, Bali, North Korea and the war on terrorism 81 minutes on the D.C. sniper and gun policy, and six minutes each on the stock market and breast cancer. Campaign 2002 ranked tenth on the list of stories, rating just five minutes of national coverage. <br> Local stations were almost equally devoid of election coverage. A study done by the Lear Center found over half of the local stations in the top 50 markets did no political coverage on their major news shows in late September and early October. Those that did concentrated heavily on the governors' races, and only 22 percent of the stories were on the Senate or House. <br> Of course, television was not completely without politics. Campaign advertising records were again smashed with over $300 million spent by the end of September. This is the last election in the pre-McCain-Feingold era and campaign committees showed no evidence that the law, which was deliberately set to go into effect on Nov. 6 the day after the midterms has slowed down their old soft-money addiction. Combined, the national parties raised $685 million this cycle. Governors, who won't be impacted by McCain-Feingold, were even bigger spenders, combining to dole out $200 million by September. The 72 major party candidates for governor will have easily raised over a half-a-billion dollars for their campaigns; Democratic candidates in just two states, California and Texas, together will have spent well over $100 million, mainly on TV ads. <br> <i>New Trends: Back To The Roots And Early Voting</b> <br> Campaign 2002 did see a few "new" trends. One was a renewed emphasis on grassroots campaigning. The unions decided a few years ago to cut back their use of TV ads and put together a state-of-the-art field operation. Steve Rosenthal, the outgoing head of the AFL-CIO's COPE is spearheading a huge GOTV drive in the key Senate states. While they won't say how much of their $32 million political budget is going toward this effort, it is a very sophisticated plan where union members will receive up to 20 contacts by Election Day. The Republicans are trying to match this with a hi-tech voter contact system of their own, and maestros Tony Feather and Blaise Hazelwood have the operation in high gear. <br> A second trend is the increase in early voting. About 15 percent of the national vote this year will be cast prior to Election Day, and in Oregon 100 percent will be cast by mail. While early voting is particularly prevalent in Western states, a total of more than 30 states will have some type of absentee or "no-excuses" voting prior to Nov. 5. Campaigns have shifted their strategies to account for this and are building heavy absentee voter drives into their Get-Out The Vote plans. In Michigan, for example, veteran Democratic Rep. John Dingell was in a very tight primary race in which half the votes he needed 23,000 of 46,000 his campaign deemed necessary before the polls opened. States from Florida and Maryland to South Dakota and Iowa report there's been a surge in requests for absentee ballots. <br> Along with early voting there appears to be another trend: early dropping out. First Andrew Cuomo in New York, then Bob Torricelli in New Jersey and then Mike Taylor in Montana all three threw in the towel when the polls showed they were in danger of losing. New Jersey Democrats had enough time to recover after a couple of court decisions went their way. Republicans in Montana were left with a "suspended" campaign, although Taylor's name is still on the ballot. <br> <i>Two Weeks To Go</b> <br> As we go into the final two weeks of the campaign, most Republicans will admit to cautious optimism, although the Washington Post says some of them, including those at the Heritage Foundation, are "giddy" and already planning policy changes from tax cuts to tort reform when they regain full control of Congress. Democrats are counting on strong absentee voter and Get-Out-The-Vote drives in battleground states to hold their one-seat Senate advantage that keeps them as players in Washington. They're still trying to change the topic to the economy and are ending the campaign with an ad that will run in states where President Bush is blitzing, asking voters to cast their votes as a check on Republican economics. 
 It's not a case of the fox guarding the chicken coop. President Bush should listen to Warren Buffett on fixing business woes, argues the latest Against the Grain commentary from CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer. <hr>It sure ain't business as usual when the second richest man in the world stands as the most important reformer of big business in this land of big business. <br> That's just what Warren Buffett is today. And he's making President Bush and congressional Democrats look lousy by comparison. With luck, he'll shame both sides into moving smart and fast to fix some broken business laws. <br> On Monday, for the second time in seven days, the president gave a high-profile speech intended to buck up investor confidence, offer assurance about economy as a whole and show resolve as a corporate crime-fighter. And for the second time in seven days, the market tanked after the speech. <br> Also on Monday, newspapers reported that the Coca-Cola Company would start subtracting the costs of the stock options it grants to employees from its yearly earnings. <br> Later in the day, The Washington Post Co. announced it too would account for the value of stock options as an expense. <br> By dinnertime, the Senate, controlled by Democrats, declined to mandate these same accounting changes for stock options for all companies for the third time in a week. <br> The leading and most credible advocate for these seemingly arcane accounting changes is Warren Buffett. Mr. Buffett happens to be a director and a major (really, really major) stockholder of Coke and the Post. <br> Other companies will surely follow the Buffett example, and real reforms will be firmly in place in at least a token number of companies, while Washington fiddles. <br> Buffett and many others believe that reining in the stock option boom is absolutely central to curbing the current crime wave. How come? <br> Simply put, stock options can give company executives powerful, short-term incentives to artificially boost their company's stock price by making their books look better than the businesses really are. <br> A stock option gives an employee (or a director) an "option" to buy company stock at a certain price in a certain time frame. If the stock is trading for more than that certain price in that certain time frame, the "option" has value - it is profit. <br> CEOs of the nation's largest companies receive more than half their compensation in the form of stock options. And the current string of scandals clearly shows the danger of situations where top executives can cook company books to give short-term boosts to stock prices, thus making their options more valuable. Valuable is an understatement: Croesus-like wealth is commonplace for execs at even the most mundane big companies and stock options are the path to it. <br> Options are the means of acquiring what investment bankers call "f--k you" money money so big you don't care what happens to your company or anything else ever again. Cash in the options, get out and it really doesn't matter if the company is bankrupt, the workers are on the street and shareholders are up a creek two weeks later. <br> The government gives stock options favorable treatment, making them nearly irresistible for companies. Corporations can deduct options on their taxes (lowering their tax bills) but (unlike regular salaries) they don't have to report them as expenses against revenues in their financial reports (thus making the company's profits appear larger). <br> Microsoft, for example, said that if its 2001 financial reports had treated options as an expense, its profits would have been reported as $5.1 billion rather than $7.3 billion. That's a 30 percent difference. <br> Sanford Bernstein Co., the New York analysts, estimate that if the country's 500 biggest companies had subtracted options from revenues, their annual profit growth from 1995 to 2000 would have been 6 percent instead of 9 percent. <br> Buffett and company don't want options banned, they just wanted them accounted for properly and fairly compared to other expenses. <br> Twice in the 1990's the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a private group that sets accounting rules, tried to clean up the counting for stock options. Twice it was blocked by pressure from industry and Congress. Interestingly, in 1994 the key pressure came from Senate Democrat and moralist Joseph Lieberman. <br> The ideology of options sounds neat. Their boosters argue that options make management interests coincide with the stockholders. They have been most famously and promiscuously used by tech companies, who still lead the lobbying against reform. <br> And they do it well. Thanks to the Democrats, options reform died in the Senate three times in one week, despite being championed by master-crusader John McCain. <br> To the degree that this market meltdown is caused by crookedness, Mr. Bush has not done his job of persuading the public that he is a vigilant and competent corporate crime cop. He has flip-flopped all over the place about what new legislation he'll support. Now he must support, indeed insist on, the tougher reforms passed by the Senate over weaker House proposals. <br> But earning credibility on this is made more difficult by his resume, by his record in the oil and baseball businesses and by the new press attention to that record. He's not a natural for the get-tough-on-boardroom-crime beat. Same for Vice President Cheney, except more so. <br> That credibility can come only from action, from constructing a new record now that Bush is in the White House. Rhetoric is irrelevant. Spinning his business record is irrelevant. <br> Changing the rules for stock options is obviously no panacea. But it's important, fundamental and symbolic. President Bush should become a convert, quickly. <br> Taking advice from the second richest guy in the world shouldn't be that hard. <br> Dick Meyer, a veteran political and investigative producer for CBS News, is Editorial Director of CBSNews.com based in Washington. <br> E-mail your questions and comments to <br>Against the Grain <br> By Dick Meyer 
 The tax code is the greatest testimonial to our inability to solve a problem we created, says CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer in his latest Against the Grain commentary.<hr> <br> "There is going to be a revolt in this country over the income taxes."<br>- Treasury Secretary Joseph W. Barr, January 1969 <br> Our tax code is an abomination."<br>- Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, February 2002 <br> The Soviet Union collapsed. The Berlin Wall crumbled. The Queen Mum is dead, "Wall Street Week in Review" is off the air and Mike Wallace is going part-time. But the Internal Revenue Code stands tall and grows mightier by the hour. <br> The U.S. tax code is the most sadistic device ever devised by the bureaucratic mind. It is an epic devourer of time, money, sanity and American ingenuity. Its complexity is indefensible. It is evil, the Lord Voldemort of American government. <br> This conclusion is inescapable regardless of your fiscal religion. It doesnt matter if you think taxes are too high or too low, too progressive or too regressive, too round or too flat. It is the complexity, the immensity, the indecipherability, and the inanity of system that is the enemy. On that, everyone agrees. <br> Yet our tax system has withstood assault from generations of Treasury Secretaries, Senators, candidates, Nader's Raiders, flat tax crusaders, fat cats, consumption tax zealots, tax lawyers, scam artists, and every normal person who has ever tried to fill out a tax return. And it keeps on growing. <br> I heard Daniel Patrick Moynihan give a pretty good one-sentence answer about 18 years ago. Taking on the tax lobbyists, he said, "Is like pitting your kidneys against a brewery." <br> I know, I know: gross over-simplification. There are lots of reasons why the tax code is so complex and difficult to comply with. <br> Businesses and personal finances are complicated, so the tax laws are too. Way back in 1927, the Joint Committee in Internal Revenue Taxation declared that, "It must be recognized that while a degree of simplification is possible, a simple income tax for complex business is not." <br> But that does not explain, and it certainly does not justify, the mind-boggling complexity, inefficiency and absurdity of a set of tax laws that now runs over 7 million words. <br> Ponder a few factoids to renew your taxpayers outrage: <br> The tax code contains five different definitions of what a child is. Depending on whether you're trying to figure dependent exemptions, head-of-household filing status, child tax credit, child care tax credit or earned income tax credit, you have to wade through five different sets "bewildering rules" defining a child, according to the Administration's 2003 budget message. <br> This years CCH Federal Tax Reporter, a commercial publication that's a bible for tax professionals, runs almost 51,000 pages. <br> It costs an estimated $194 billion a year for businesses and individuals to comply with the tax laws, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative research group. These are the direct costs (paying the tax lawyers and accountants and filling in the forms), not the indirect costs (time spent on tax planning, tax litigation, capital directed to tax compliance rather than productive investment). <br> To put that dollar figure in perspective, $194 billion is roughly equal to Wal-Marts total revenues last year. The work hours put into tax compliance exceed the total work hours of the auto industry, the computer manufacturing industry, the airline manufacturing industry and the steel industry combined. <br> Since 1954, Congress has enacted 33 significant changes in the tax laws, one every 1.4 years. <br> In short, the tax code is so complex because Congress made it that way. The tax code is by far the richest source of goodies for officeholders to hand out. The tax lobbyists, to be fair, are the enablers. <br> You cant put a $500 million handout to a local company in the budget, but you can easily create an unnoticed loophole in the tax code that will save that company $500 million. Similarly, Congress couldnt, say, write checks to everyone who wanted to buy a house, but it could pass a home mortgage deduction. <br> Spend a couple decades making loopholes for various industries, even specific companies, or creating incentives for various socially desirable goals (from charitable giving to weight loss), raising and lowering rates to sail on the political winds and lo and behold, the system is a mess. <br> No one defends the current system. Not the IRS Commissioner, not the Treasury Secretary, not the President. <br> Yet tax simplification has vanished as an issue. <br> In the 1980's, tax reform was a hot issue that attracted rising stars on all horizons, like Bill Bradley, Jack Kemp, and Dick Gephardt. The basic idea was to get rid of all the loopholes, credits, and deductions in order to radically lower rates and simply the entire process. <br> A decade later, Steve Forbes based his whole presidential campaigns on tax simplification and got surprisingly far. <br> Now tax reform is invisible. <br> In February O'Neill talked tough on tax reform with all the genuine credibility of a businessman who was wasted years on tax issues. He committed the Administration to a tax simplification program, but we've heard nothing about it since. <br> It is ironic that tax reform disappeared just as campaign finance reform appeared, and passed. You could argue that campaign finance reform makes real tax reform possible for the first time by reducing the clout of narrow interests. <br> Campaign finance reform is not an end in itself. Its ultimate goal is to remove obstacles to passing laws on their merits, not on the bankrolls of their backers. <br> Tax reform would be a good test campaign finance reform. <br> Dick Meyer, a veteran political and investigative producer for CBS News, is Editorial Director of CBSNews.com based in Washington. <br> E-mail your questions and comments to <br>Against the Grain <br> By Dick Meyer 
 In her latest commentary, CBS News Senior Political Editor Dotty Lynch charts the field for the 2002 gubernatorial elections.<hr>The nation's governors are meeting in Washington this week and they are not happy campers. Many of these governors came to office in 1994 and have run their states with nice surpluses. Now that has changed. The surpluses are gone, the federal government is being stingy and many state constitutions now require the governors to balance their budgets. Unlike the fed, they can't run deficits. <br> That leaves two solutions, both of which politicians hate: They can either raise taxes or cut services. <br> They come to Washington for the National Governors Association meeting united on a bipartisan proposal to get more money for their states for welfare reform. As the federal government shifted this and other programs to the states, governors, who like their autonomy, complain that they have not received adequate financing to run these programs. Medicaid funding is always on the agenda and this year so is more money for education. Republicans have made great headway with voters as the party that is best for education, but President Bush's budget has given Democrats a target to get the issue back. <br> In fact, Democrats are feeling pretty optimistic about their chances of recapturing a number of state houses this year and believe the issues and the political landscape favor them. There are 36 states holding gubernatorial elections and Republicans now hold 23 of them. Of the 18 open seats, Republicans have to defend 11. <br> The GOP had some big wins in the 1990s, but since 1999 the Democrats have been making a comeback. In 2001, despite the overwhelming popularity of President Bush and the overarching trauma of the September 11 attacks, Democrats won governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. Their hope is that the issues that worked for them in the past the economy, education and health care will get them the majority of governors' slots in 2002. They also say these favorable factors have enabled them to recruit some good candidates, especially in the "red states" like Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee and Arizona, where national Democrats have fared poorly. <br> The Republicans, of course, think differently. They believe that, unlike 2001, President Bush will get involved in these races and that his popularity and his programs will help statewide candidates. The education issue has worked for them in the past and they believe tax relief and fiscal responsibility are also winning issues. <br> Most of the big states have gubernatorial races this year and many involve some big names. Here's a rundown of some states to watch: <br> The Big Four: <br> The M States <br> Minnesota, Massachusetts, Michigan, Maryland and Maine all have lively contests with colorful candidates. In Minnesota, independent Gov. Jesse Vetura has been fighting again, but this time with the local media. His popularity is down and a recent Minneapolis Star Tribune poll had his re-election rating at 29 percent. He hasn't officially announced whether he'll run again. In Massachusetts, acting Gov. Jane Swift, dubbed "Calamity Jane" by the local press, should face a tough challenge in this strongly Democratic state. But the Democrats haven't solidified behind any one candidate and now former Labor Secretary Robert Reich has jumped into the fray. <br> In Michigan, the Democrats have a wealth of particularly strong candidates. Former Gov. Jim Blanchard, former House Minority Whip David Bonior and up-and-coming Attorney General Jennifer Granholm are in a tight race for the nomination to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. John Engler. Most believe that the Democrats have a good shot at taking back Michigan. In Maryland, Lt Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is in good position to become the first of her generation of Kennedys elected to statewide office, although the popular young mayor of Baltimore, Martin O'Malley, is itching to get into the primary against her. <br> Finally, in Maine, Democratic Rep. John Baldacci has a clear primary field and a good shot at defeating whichever opponent emerges from the contested GOP race. But there are a number of independent and Green Party candidates looking to repeat the win of outgoing Independent Gov. Angus King. <br> There are also competitive races in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Charlie Cook, the respected election analyst, says it's "hard to see the Democrats not picking up some governors' mansions." The current lineup is 27 Republicans, 21 Democrats and two independents. But Cook thinks that even if the Democrats wind up with the majority, it won't be a huge one. <br> This week, the governors and some gubernatorial challengers will be in Washington raising money, lobbying and trying out their messages for the fall. Usually these NGA meetings are very substantive, but this year there's likely to be plenty of politics mixed in. <br> E-mail your questions and comments to <a href="mailto:PoliticalPoints@cbsnews.com">Political Points <br> A veteran of the Washington scene, CBS News Senior Political Editor Dotty Lynch provides an inside look at the issues and personalities shaping the political dialogue in the nation's capital and around the country. 
 Is another run for the White House in Dick Gephardt's future? In her latest Political Points commentary, CBS News Senior Political Editor Dotty Lynch takes a look at the House Minority Leader's prospects.<hr> <br> When Dick Gephardt ran for president in 1988, the Missouri Democrat's 15 minutes of fame began in his neighboring state of Iowa, where he topped the field in the first-in-the-nation caucuses. Despite spending 110 days in the state and moving his mother into a garden apartment in Des Moines, his campaign had languished by the fall of '87. In January of 1988 it was re-ignited with one ad suggesting that a Korean-made Hyundai would cost $48,000 if Korea's tariffs were imposed in the United States. <br> Last Thursday, almost 14 years to the day, Gephardt roused the crowd at the Democratic Leadership Council with another impassioned cry this time for hybrid cars. His rather more prosaic version of John F. Kennedy's promise to send an American to the moon was to shoot to have a majority of cars in American showrooms be hybrids by 2020. <br> You have to wonder what it is about cars that gets this guy so stirred up. <br> Gephardt's speech, a 14-page policy analysis which many called "Clintonesque," and which his staff billed as "visionary," was the second of three high-profile speeches the House minority leader is giving over a 10-day period. <br> The first, on Jan. 19, was a red-meat partisan speech to the Democratic National Committee in which he called remarks by White House aide Karl Rove to the Republican National Committee "shameful" for allegedly politicizing the war. Gephardt also blamed the recession not just on Sept. 11, but on George W. Bush, and he accused the Bush administration of not having the right values. <br> Gephardt's third big speech will come Tuesday night when he gives the official Democratic response to the president's State of the Union address before a national television audience. In the meantime, Gephardt has been making the rounds of the weekend talk shows and his aides have that "presidential look" in their eyes. <br> Despite Gephardt's seniority in the Democratic leadership, it has been Sen. Tom Daschle who has become the most recognized Democratic leader in the past few months. Daschle's ascendancy to the status of Senate majority leader last June, his prominence in the anthrax hysteria following the arrival of a tainted letter in his office, and his savvy in using the media have catapulted the South Dakotan to the top of the Democratic heap over Gephardt, as well as the MIA Al Gore. <br> There's a bit of sibling rivalry right now between the Gephardt and Daschle camps. Gephardt's aides were eager to remind reporters of the confusion Daschle caused about tax cuts in his big speech on Jan. 4, and to make clear that Gephardt's speech at the DLC wouldn't be a dry budget analysis but one of ideas and vision. <br> The speech which was quite Clintonesque, ionly in its length covered the map from information technology to pension reform. But it was the audience that showed Gephardt's real strength and reminded us why, after so many false starts, Democratic operatives still get those presidential yearnings about him. <br> In recent years Gephardt has been seen as organized labor's guy, but in his early years he was a true moderate and one of the founders of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. Front and center at Thursday's speech was John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO and no friend of the DLC, which was founded in part to cut the clout of labor inside the Democratic Party. <br> Also in the audience were Terry McAuliffe, now chairman of the DNC (but once a Gephardt staffer who included Gephardt as a member of his wedding party); Clinton aides John Podesta and Harold Ickes; and Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile and press spokesman Kiki McLean. Brazile and McLean, known to many through their Gore connections, were on Gephardt's team in that 1988 White House run. <br> Gephardt emerged from the '88 campaign as a populist, but in fact he is an institutional Democratic who has polished his skills as a conciliator and legislator over the years. That is both his strength and weakness. He is an extraordinarily patient man, a good listener and a cautious politician. <br> In 1991, when the gang of consultants and pollsters were sure he'd pick up the pieces of '88 and run again, he decided against it. At the 1996 convention, the buzz was that Al Gore was bending over backwards to counter Gephardt's head start with party stalwarts and labor, but by '99 Gephardt decided once again to stay put and hope that the Democrats would take over the House. <br> In his massive, political cum psycho-babble book, "What It Takes," Richard Ben Cramer describes Gephardt as a driven and methodical man who believes in the system and his own ability to figure out how to make it work to solve problems. The ultimate way for Gephardt to do that in the '80s was to get into the Oval Office and set the agenda. Now, at the age of 60, he's still methodically working the system, but often that approach makes him seem tedious and unexciting in an age of hyped media and hot personalities. <br> Gephardt is pulling his punches about another run for the White House, claiming that all he's thinking about is 2002 and the possibility of that House speakership. But the advisers are circling, and the gleam in their eyes is back. One thing is for sure, Gephardt has a jump on the others for people who want a steady, solid and hardworking guy. But the question remains: Is it his fight too? <br> E-mail your questions and comments to <a href="mailto:PoliticalPoints@cbsnews.com">Political Points <br> A veteran of the Washington scene, CBS News Senior Political Editor Dotty Lynch provides an inside look at the issues and personalities shaping the political dialogue in the nation's capital and around the country. 
 In her latest commentary, CBS News Senior Political Editor Dotty Lynch takes a look at the reform-free 2002 U.S. Senate campaigns.<hr>With campaign finance legislation on a fast track, the 2002 elections could be the last federal elections under the old rules. A provision to have the new law go into effect 30 days after passage was struck in a last-minute deal in the House and replaced by a stipulation that says it would take effect on November 6, 2002. And, of course, by then Mitch McConnell and others may have tied the law up in the Supreme Court with a challenge saying it's a violation of First Amendment free-speech guarantees. <br> But whatever happens in the future, it's clear that this year's campaigns will not be effected by the new legislation. I asked one Democratic consultant if he thought the climate in the country that propelled passage of Shays-Meehan would make parties and candidates dial back their spending in 2002. He laughed. "It wouldn't do to end the year with any soft money in the bank, now would it?" In fact, he went on to say, "with the Senate controlled by the Democrats by only one vote, virtually every competitive Senate race will be a pitched battle." And big money for TV ads is the best way these consultants know to fight. <br> There are 34 Senate seats up in 2002 and 18 of them are in that competitive pitched-battle status. According to Congressional analyst Charlie Cook and operatives from both parties, the 18 are: Minnesota, South Dakota, Missouri, Arkansas, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Colorado Iowa, Montana, Louisiana, Georgia, New Jersey, Maine, Oklahoma, Alabama and Oregon. Tennessee could be added to the list if Sen. Fred Thompson changes his mind and decides not to run again after all. <br> The hottest races include Minnesota, South Dakota and Missouri, where Democratic incumbents Paul Wellstone, Tim Johnson and Jean Carnahan face strong GOP challengers recruited by the White House; and New Hampshire, Arkansas and Colorado, where Republican incumbents Bob Smith, Tim Hutchinson and Gordon Allard face tough Democratic opponents who can and will raise serious money. Republicans also have to protect three open seats North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas where longtime incumbents Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond and Phil Gramm are retiring. <br> Because of September 11, many of these candidates started raising money a little late, but they are in fund-raising high gear right now. The national parties have started throwing huge amounts into these races and have just completed a volley of paid advertising in five states. The National Republican Senatorial Committee kicked off the ads on February 8, and also signaled that President Bush was about to get into the fray big time. The ads which ran in Minnesota, South Dakota, Missouri, Iowa and Montana attacked Democratic incumbents for being prtisan on the stimulus package while the president was calling for bipartisanship. <br> The Democrats countered in an interesting way. In three of the states they made it clear how helpful these Democrats had been to the president. In Montana, Sen. Max Baucus' campaign ran a classic testimonial ad with Mr. Bush giving credit to Baucus for the passage of the tax-relief bill. In Iowa and Minnesota, the Democrats were a bit more, well, Democratic, invoking populist themes and the "E" (Enron) word. <br> I asked a number of political advisors what, if anything, these early ads tell us about the kind of campaigns and issues we're likely to see this year. <br> All the consultants point out that many of the races are "quirky" and most will turn on very individual circumstances rather than big national issues. In New Hampshire, for example, one strategist said the race is about two guys who want to be in the Senate and a governor who wants to talk about her record. In Arkansas, it's about a "family values" candidate who left his wife and married a staffer, versus the son of a former senator who's done very little and is scrambling to get a resume. In South Dakota, the campaign's about whether voters want Tom Daschle's little brother or George Bush's rubber stamp. <br> So despite all the hoopla, don't expect to see reform any time soon in campaigns for the U.S. Senate. The big money and negative ads will be out in force for a last hurrah. <br> E-mail your questions and comments to <a href="mailto:PoliticalPoints@cbsnews.com">Political Points <br> A veteran of the Washington scene, CBS News Senior Political Editor Dotty Lynch provides an inside look at the issues and personalities shaping the political dialogue in the nation's capital and around the country. <br> MMII, CBS Worldwide Inc.

 Texas Gov. George W. Bush still leads in voter preferences for the 2000 presidential election, but there are indications in a new CBS News/New York Times poll that whomever the parties nominate, the eventual result could be close. <br> Bush's overall image remains positive. He is viewed as more moderate than the Democratic frontrunner, and he demonstrates crossover appeal. Bush dominates the field of contenders for the Republican Party nomination, but his general election campaign lost some ground over the past week after he received negative publicity following an interview on foreign policy. <br> Currently, Bush leads Vice President Al Gore by nine points among registered voters: 50% to 41%, down from 52% to 37% last week. Bush leads former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley by 51% to 39%, also narrower than his lead last week. The tightening in the race has been especially dramatic among those paying the most attention to the campaign. <br> <b> THE GENERAL ELECTION VOTE </font> <br> Both Democratic contenders lead Arizona Sen. John McCain in a general election match-up. Gore leads McCain 47% to 36%, and Bradley leads McCain 47% to 30%. <br> Adding a Reform Party candidate to the equation has relatively little impact; in fact, voters are very negative about both announced candidates and the party overall is unfavorably viewed. <br> <b> BUSH'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES </font> <br> A good part of Bush's consistent (although shrinking) lead is his appeal to Democrats and liberals. Currently, one out of every five Democrats say they would vote for Bush against Gore, and one in four liberals would choose Bush. Bush does even better among each of these groups when pitted against Bradley in the election. <br> Bush's widespread appeal, however, does not carry over to another Republican, John McCain. In a horse race against Gore, only 61% of Bush's general election voters say they would support McCain. With Bradley as the Democratic nominee, the figure drops to about half. Many of the defectors are the Democrats, liberals, and women to whom Bush has crossover appeal - they go home to the Democratic party when he is not in the race. <br> But the news is not all positive for Bush in these match-ups. Among voters who are paying a lot of attention to the election at this point, Bush fares much less well than he does with the entire electorate. Among this group, the general election trial heats with both Bradley and Gore are even. The overall opinions of Bush among the most attentive are equally divided, with 36% favorable and 34% unfavorable. Registered voters as a whole hold positive views of Bush. <br> In addition, McCain also draws even with both Gore and Bradley in the general election vote among those who are paying a lot of attention, which is much better than he does among all registered voters. Those who are paying a lot of attention to the race are more active voters, however: They do not differ substantially from other voters in their partisan affiliation. <br> Currently, only 19% of registered voters are paying a lot of attention to the campaign - compared to the 17% who were paying a lot of attention in December of 1995. By election time in 1996, however, almost half of all registered voters said they were paying a lot of attention to the campaign. If this trend in preferences continues as more voters begin to focus on the race, Bush may have a more difficult road to the nomination and beyond. <br> Indications of a closer race can also be sen when voters are asked whether they would vote for a Democrat or a Republican in the presidential election, without indicating names of nominees: 41% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate and 40% would vote for the Republican if the election were held today. <br> <b> IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </font> <br> Most voters, however, reflect conventional wisdom when asked which party will win the White House in 2000. 52% of voters expect the Republican party to take over the White House. Only 32% say the Democrats will. <br> <b> THE CANDIDATES - INCREASING NEGATIVES </font> <br> As the primary campaigns heat up, images of the candidates have grown increasingly negative. Among four major presidential contenders - Bush, Bradley, Gore and McCain - unfavorable views of each have increased by around 5 points since the end of October. <br> <b> OPINIONS OF THE CANDIDATES </font> <br> Bradley and McCain remain relatively unknown nationally. 69% of the public cannot rate Bradley either favorably or unfavorably, and 74% cannot rate McCain. <br> Most of the other Republican presidential contenders are even less well known, with the exception of Steve Forbes. 57% of adults nationally have no opinion of Forbes, or have not heard enough about him to form an opinion, but those who do have an opinion are predominantly negative: 31% unfavorable compared to 11% favorable. <br> Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch is viewed unfavorably by 19% of adults, and favorably by 6%, but 74% cannot rate him either way. Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes are even more unknown, but those with opinions are more negative than positive. <br> Of the four leading presidential contenders, Bush and Bradley are seen as the most ideologically moderate candidates. 35% of voters believe that Bush is a moderate, and another 38% think he is a conservative. Similarly, 32% of voters see Bradley as a moderate, but, even though many of his positions are to the left of the vice president, only 25% label him a liberal. <br> In contrast, 45% of voters see Gore as a liberal, and only 24% call him a moderate. McCain, known by fewer voters, is seen as moderate by 23% of voters and conservative by another 23%. <br> These ideological perceptions are also reflected in voters' responses to the question of who - between Gore and Bush - would better represent their views in Washington: 49% say Bush would while 42% say Gore would. Even one in five Democrats say Bush would better represent their interests. <br> All four candidates are seen as having clear ideas bout what they would like to accomplish as President. Gore leads the pack with 65% of voters saying he has a clear idea of what he would like to accomplish. 54% of voters say Bush has a clear idea of what he would like to accomplish, and 53% say the same of Bradley. Here again, McCain is relatively unknown: 40% of voters don't know how clear McCain's ideas are, but 37% say he has a clear idea, and only 23% say he does not. <br> Voters like each of these candidates for various reasons. Voters who like Bush are most likely to cite his experience - 18% - and his father - 16% - as their reasons for liking him. But even though Bush's image is tied closely to his father, most voters believe that the younger Bush is working hard to become president, rather than riding on his father's coattails: 55% say Bush is working hard to earn the presidency, compared to 36% who say he expects to win without working hard because of his family connections. <br> Voters who like McCain say it is his honesty and integrity that they like: 32% point to this, and another 18% mention his image as a war hero. 29% of those who like Gore say they like him because of his experience, and another 9% specifically cite the current administration's accomplishments. Another 17% say they like Gore's honesty and integrity. <br> Those who like Bradley point to his honesty and integrity - 23% - their agreement with him on the issues - 16% - and his experience in government - 14%. Only 5% of voters who like Bradley say they like him because of his career with the New York Knicks. <br> <b> THE PRIMARIES </font> <br> Bush continues to dominate the Republican primary nationally, with 68% of the likely vote. McCain is Bush's closest competitor, with 8%. Despite Bush's commanding lead, however, only one quarter of Republican primary voters say they have made up their minds, a drop from one third just last week. In fact, those who now support Bush for the nomination are less committed than his supporters were last week. Only 28% of Bush's supporters say their minds are made up, compared with 43% who said the same one week ago. <br> McCain does slightly better among those Republican primary voters paying a lot of attention to the race: he receives 14% of the Republican primary vote among this group. <br> Gore maintains a sizable lead over his competitor for the Democratic nomination, Bill Bradley. Gore currently receives 56% of the likely Democratic vote, compared to Bradley's 30%. Among Democratic voters, too, there is room for change: Only 36% say their minds are made up, and 63% say it is still too early to tell. <br> <b> THE PARTIES </font> <br> The Democratic party continues to have an advantage when it comes to party image. 52% of adults have a favorable impression of the Democratic party, while 39% have an unfavrable impression. Republicans are slightly less popular: 48% view the Republican party favorably and 43% view it unfavorably. That is, however, an improvement from the party's negative image during the impeachment and Senate trial of President Clinton. <br> On a host of issues, especially those that Americans most want the government to address, Democrats are given the edge over Republicans. When asked the most important problem for government to address, adults most frequently cite health care (13%), and Social Security and Medicare (12%). On dealing with both of these issues, people give the Democrats huge advantages. <br> <b> WHICH PARTY IS MORE LIKELY TO ...? </font> <br> 54% of people say Democrats are more likely to make the right decisions about health care. 50% and 49% say the Democrats are more likely to make better decisions about both Medicare and Social Security respectively. People also prefer Democrats on issues like the environment and education, and they perceive them as caring more about people. <br> Perhaps as a result, Democrats currently hold the edge in generic congressional voting. 45% of voters say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their House district today, compared to 38% who would vote for the Republican candidate. <br> <b> WHICH PARTY IS MORE LIKELY TO ...? </font> <br> The public is more divided over fiscal and other issues. Democrats have a slight advantage on leading the country into the new millennium. But the public divides over the issues of the economy, balancing the budget, and cutting taxes. Some of those issues have been traditionally Republican. The public also divides on the relative honesty of each party's candidates. In fact, 17% say that neither party has more honest candidates. <br> <b> WHICH PARTY IS MORE LIKELY TO ...? </font> <br> Republicans have an edge on crime, military and moral issues. They are given a thin edge on reducing crime, and roughly half of the public thinks that Republicans are more likely to uphold traditional family values. 57% say the Republicans are more likely to keep the military strong. And finally, people believe that the Republican party has higher ethical standards than the Democratic party by 46% to 23%. <br> <b> THE REFORM PARTY </font> <br> Only 26% of adults nationally have a favorable impression of the Reform party, while 53% have an unfavorable impression. This lack of popularity may reflect in part the unpopularity of two of the Reform party's current presidential contenders: Patrick Buchanan and Donald Trump. <br> Roughly half of Americans have an unfavorable view of Pat Buchanan, the one declared Reform party candidate. Only 10% have a favorable impression of Buchanan. Buchanan's unpopularity pales, however, in comparison to Donald Trump, his potential rival for the nomination. Two-thirds of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, while only 7% say they view him favorably. Trump's image appears to have worsened since last week when 58% of adults had an unfavorable impression of him. <br> Reform party primary rules allow any registered voter to participate in the primary by requesting a mail-in ballot. Just 10% of voters say they are very likely to take part in the Reform party's primary next summer. Buchanan finished first among those voters though too narrowly to say he is clearly leading given the small sample size. <br> Twenty-three percent chose Buchanan, followed by 17% for Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. Party founder Ross Perot is in third place with 15%. Trump currently garners only 8% of the likely Reform vote while a substantial 17% of likely Reform voters choose none of the options offered. <br> In general election match-ups against Bush and Gore, and against Bush and Bradley, Buchanan polls only 6%. <br> The Reform party is not currently meeting people's hopes or expectations for a third party. In 1996, 41% said that a third party would produce better candidates for political office. Faced with the reality of the Reform paty, however, only 19% say it is doing just that. <br> Also in 1996, most people - 58% - said that a third party would raise issues that the two major parties failed to address. When asked specifically about the Reform Party now, only 41% say it is addressing such issues. 36% of adults in 1996 though a third party would give them more say in government, but only 19% now feel the Reform party offers them that benefit. <br> This poll was conducted among a nationwide random sample of 1,162 adults interviewed by telephone November 4-7, 1999. There were 953 registered voters. The error due to sampling could be plus or minus three percentage points for results based on the total sample of adults and the sample of registered voters.

 While the Senate leadership promises a debate on campaign finance reform before its expected October adjournment, the public expresses support for a key proposal of the McCain/Feingold bill - banning "soft money" contributions. Fifty-one percent of Americans would like to see a ban on unlimited contributions to political parties, while 42 percent oppose banning these contributions. <br> <b> BANNING SOFT MONEY </font> <br> Republicans are more supportive of banning soft money than are Democrats, perhaps in response to charges of 1996 Democratic National Committee fundraising improprieties. Fifty-six percent of Republicans favor banning soft money, while Democrats are divided. <br> The public also supports the current practice of limiting individual contributions to candidates. When asked to choose between limiting individual contributions and allowing individuals to contribute as much as they would like, 62 percent of Americans express a preference for limiting individual contributions. Only 36 percent would allow unlimited contributions. <br> <b> PREFERENCES ON INDIVIDUAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS </font> <br> In a somewhat ironic twist, those who can most easily afford political contributions - high income Americans - are also the most likely to support limits on individual contributions. <br> Although majorities favor limits on contributions to both candidates and parties, the public is unwilling to take the more dramatic reform step of publicly financing campaigns. Fifty-eight percent of Americans oppose using tax money to finance political campaigns, while only 37 percent favor public financing. <br> <b> PUBLIC FINANCING OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS </font> <br> This poll was conducted among a nationwide random sample of 722 adults, interviewed by telephone July 13-14, 1999. The error due to sampling could be plus or minus four percentage points based on the entire sample. The sampling error for subgroups is higher.

 On Sundays, I make tacos and my famous guacamole for my family. Food bonds us, and it's a way for me to keep in touch with my Mexican heritage. And yet, although my childhood was full of culture, adventure and happiness, for years I denied that I was Mexican. In fact, I finally came out as Mexican only a few years ago. <br> Born in New York City to an Ecuadorian mother and a Mexican father, my family always told me that I had the best of both worlds. I traveled to Mexico and Ecuador. I loved my abuelita's Mexican cooking -- enchiladas, yes please. <br> But I was teased in my New York school because I "looked Mexican." I was told to "Go back to Mexico!" by a classmate. The few other Mexican students at my school were also made fun of by other Latinos. I never understood why discrimination existed among us. <br> I live in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, and my parents enrolled me in a military school, predominantly Puerto Rican and Dominican. It was the best decision they made. If I had gone to public school, things could have been worse. After all, I had heard all about the fights in the public schools in my neighborhood. <br> My father wanted to protect me from the discrimination and the fighting. He told me his car was keyed and "wetback" was spray-painted across the window, all because he had a Mexican flag hanging from his mirror. His job at South Street Seaport was worse. He worked a 15-hour shift each day, packing fish and shrimp, barely earning minimum wage while being called a "beaner." <br> "Don't say you're Mexican," he would tell me. <br> But his attempt to protect me from the cruelties of society only made me doubt my identity. <br> At home, I did embrace my Mexican-ness. I would secretly confiscate my dad's Angeles Azules' albums and hide in my room to play them on my Walkman. I imagined myself being in Mexico as the romantic Cumbia beats gently played through my headphones. <br> Trapped in a bubble full of anguish and despair, I tried to figure out who I was. I confided to my mother that I couldn't handle the pressure of lying. I battled low self-esteem and depression during my teens, which contributed to my shyness. I felt very ashamed, and I thought if I'm ever going to come out as Mexican, why couldn't I look like Thalia or Selena? <br> Instead of hanging out with friends, I stayed home to read and write, excelling in English class and receiving honors. <br> One day while my dad drove me to middle school, he turned the volume up to blast his Norteño music, embarrassing me to the core. I quickly turned off the radio, worried that someone heard the music. "Dad, what are you doing?" I said. He chuckled and kissed me on the forehead. I knew he didn't want to keep our Mexican-ness a secret anymore. <br> But by then, for me, the damage had already been done, and I continued to lie throughout high school. <br> I was born in 1993, a product of that mass immigration to New York. My father had come to the United States from Mexico in 1991, walking through the Tijuana desert and swimming the Rio Grande. He married my mother in 1992. <br> She was already a resident and obtained her American citizenship in 1994. She told me to be proud of who I am and encouraged me to embrace my multiple cultures. She also convinced my father to get his documents. He studied day and night, took the exam, and became an American citizen in 2004. <br> My father was the only direct link I had to my Mexican heritage, and when my parents divorced in 2006, he left and took everything of his that could have taught me more about being Mexicana. Their separation made me even more depressed. However, in a way it also came as a bit of a relief because I no longer had my father to tell me to lie. <br> And, in fall 2011, I came out as Mexican. <br> It was during my first semester at Brooklyn College. The diversity on campus, the same one my mother attended, amazed me and encouraged me to make new friends. "Wow, they (students) look just like me!" I said to her. She was glad I had found my comfort zone. <br> The campus was my haven: an artistic, colorful and warm environment that welcomed me with open arms where students have the opportunity to learn about each other's cultures and traditions. <br> With my caramel complexion, straight long brown hair and petite stature, I now feel very much Mexican, as well as Ecuadorian and American. I even got a tattoo to merge my pride of these cultures: the skull of a condor on the right side of my ribs represents Ecuador's national bird and a headdress adorned with feathers represents my indigenous Mayan ancestors. <br> I love both my parents, and I appreciate that they tried to protect me from the hurtful stereotypes imposed on Mexicans. And that long journey to discover my cultural identity, as difficult as it was, has taught me to love myself. I have learned how to embrace how complicated being Latina can feel. And I'm thankful that I have.​ 
 It's hip to be Hispanic. <br> I was on a call the other day with someone who joked that she wanted to be named an "honorary" Hispanic because "that's the cool group right now." <br> They're everywhere, in all 50 states. And they're shaping how Americans think about sports, fashion, food, entertainment, music, pop culture, business, media, the arts and the digital world. <br> But today, Hispanic Heritage Month is mostly about looking forward and pondering the impact that Hispanics are going to continue to have on this country for as far as the eye can see. <br> In politics, many of what analysts call "battleground states" are heavily populated by Hispanics. Nevada, Florida, Colorado and New Mexico mattered a lot on election night 2012, and they'll matter more in the years to come. <br> What does this all mean anyway? <br> Hispanics have put all their eggs in the basket of changing demographics. They've assumed that, as their numbers grow, they'll automatically become powerful, influential and prosperous. <br> The other day, I was on a panel where a university professor suggested that the best hope for immigration reform was for America to get to the point where Hispanics represented so much of the electorate that no politician would dare cross them. <br> Alas, it doesn't work that way. In fact, as the Hispanic population grows in the years to come, we can expect many non-Hispanics to panic and batten down the hatches. For instance, even though most Hispanics in the United States are U.S.-born citizens, you'll see more Arizona-style immigration laws intended to put immigrants in their place. And often, those laws will wind up also victimizing those U.S citizens who simply resemble immigrants. Read: Hispanics. <br> This year, to mark Hispanic Heritage Month, I thought that I'd give my compadres something they could really use: a reality check. For most Hispanics in the United States, life is not a fiesta. Things are not rosy. They're actually quite bleak. And demographic trends being what they are, that's bad news for the whole country. <br> It's true that some of the nation's corporations are making a play for Hispanic customers, but not many of their top executives and board members are Hispanic. <br> Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said in a statement that while she couldn't comment on specific allegations, the company doesn't "tolerate or condone discrimination in any form." Snyder said that the guide wasn't part of any "formal or company-wide training" and that it is "not representative of who Target is." She also apologized for its content. <br> It's true that Hispanics are now able to help decide elections, and that they're courted by both parties. Yet Hispanics are treated disrespectfully by both the Democrats who take them for granted, and the Republicans who write them off. They're often insulted, deceived, manipulated, and exploited. It's shoddy customer service. <br> Enough of this. Things need to get better for this population. But it won't occur organically. There is no magic tipping point. Things are not going to just start happening for Hispanics when they get to a certain percentage of the population. They have to make them happen. <br> Hispanics already know how to work hard, sacrifice everything, and believe in the American dream. Now they need to know what they're worth, refuse to settle for less, and accept that only they can make dreams come true. 
 From the White House to statehouses across America, from Main Street to Wall Street, there will be many commemorations marking Hispanic Heritage Month, which officially kicked off on September 15 -- but does all the hoopla matter? <br> Yes. All the proclamations, mariachi music and exultations, even the tacos served at these tributes are necessary -- especially if, beyond cocktails and soggy nachos, everyone takes the time to learn the stories and recognize everyday Hispanic American heroes who gave and continue to give of themselves to this nation. <br> The story of my father, a patriot and Korean War veteran, is worth highlighting, particularly during this month when the nation pauses to celebrate Hispanic contributions. <br> Two years ago he was buried, draped in his two beloved flags -- an American and a Puerto Rican flag. The fact that he went into the afterlife swathed in 51 stars and eighteen stripes spoke to the duality of my father's bicultural experience. This twin allegiance was neither exceptional nor paradoxical. Dad's double cultural devotion is at the heart of the Hispanic American experience. <br> When he was deployed at the age of 17, my father was a country boy from the southern coast of Puerto Rico who spoke only a few words of English. And yet he served this nation valiantly and was honorably discharged after three years of combat in Asia. Even though it was a source of immense pride (and pain, too, I'm sure), Dad rarely spoke about his time in Korea. And he didn't have to -- his body bore the evidence of the physical wounds endured, including a missing finger, blown off by a mortar attack. And while curious to hear war stories, we respected his wishes and never brought up the conflict. Implicitly, we understood to steer clear of that part of his life. <br> So upon his death at 76, we learned something astonishing about our dad. Though he was racially black and ethnically Puerto Rican, a Hispanic American who lived his adult life in New York City, Dad was officially listed in Army documents as white. While we were shocked at how a dark chocolate Latino would be mistaken for a Caucasian, historians looking into the exact numbers of Hispanic soldiers who served in wars aren't. <br> Detailed accounts of Hispanics in the armed forces were not kept until the 1970s, according to the Pew Center for Latino Studies. While some records show that thousands of Hispanic American men -- Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans for instance -- fought in the Civil War as well as the two World Wars, researchers have determined that many more served and died than official documents show. As a result of the omission, the full story of Hispanic sacrifice may never be fully told. And that is a shame, since Latinos have been part of the building of America -- including dying while protecting it -- for hundreds of years. If the records don't show that Hispanics served and died, that we toiled in the trenches and contributed with blood, how does our nation measure Hispanic contributions, let alone acknowledge them? <br> In the new American conversation, cultural celebrations like these matter, and they matter greatly. They help us better explain our Hispanic story to each other and ourselves; they matter for the individual and national psyche, because they allow the 50 million-plus Hispanics, and the larger American family, to better appreciate the Hispanic story within the greater American narrative. <br> For a long time, I didn't know about my father's heroic efforts in Korea and the legacy that he left his blood family and larger American family. Learning his story and that of the Borinqueneers and the 65th Infantry, for example, allowed me to more profoundly appreciate and connect with my larger American heritage. And it filled me with a mix of pride and cultural strength. <br> This is why commemorations like Hispanic Heritage Month are important -- a collective look back affirms that we were there, and that we are here, legitimately. Celebrations like these serve as reminders that we belong and that this nation is ours too. <br> Pausing to take stock and celebrate Hispanic heritage matters today more than ever, because it cancels out the cries of xenophobes with bully pulpits and megaphone outlets who scream at Latinos to go back to where we come from, who question our American legitimacy and our stake in conversations beyond immigration. (Hello Syria!) Knowing that our forebears served with distinction defending freedom and were just as patriotic as any Marlboro man shuts down the voices of separation and hate and propels a song that unites. It also sets the record straight. <br> A month dedicated to Hispanic heritage also adds to the richness of our story -- a story that tells the world that even if our grandmothers and grandfathers were born in or immigrated from other lands, and their English was broken, they, we, their heirs are no less American than any of the Mayflower descendants. These stories are living testaments to the complexity of how this nation was built and an affirmation that we are one nation, indivisible, made up of many. It is this rich and powerful heritage of many who together have built and continue to shape these United States. <br> Glossing over Hispanic contributions puts in danger this great American experiment; celebrating it fortifies it. These celebrations nourish our country's exceptionalism because they declare to the world -- as well as to us and each other -- that of many, we are one. <br> If ever the ignorant and divisive haters question my sons' American legitimacy, it warms my heart that they know their chapter in America's story -- that their abuelo, their grandfather, was an American patriot who fought for this country while being 100% Puerto Rican and 100% American. And that the two loves are hardly contradictory -- in fact, it's a 100% hecho in America story! 
 Experts are putting forward all sorts of reasons Mexico recently became more obese than the United States -- and one of the most overweight countries in the world. <br> Poverty, tacos, urbanization, soda. Those are the widely discussed culprits. And they, along with the choices people in Mexico make, are no doubt part of the story. <br> But there's an uberfactor here: Mexico's neighbor to the north. Could one reason for Mexico's growing, deadly obesity problem be that the country is unfortunate enough to share a border with the United States -- land of the Coke, home of diabetes? <br> Maybe U.S. trends such as fast food, fried food and soda drifted south. <br> It reminded me of a smart Economist story I read in April. <br> I called up Dr. Juan Rivera, director of the research center on nutrition and health at Mexico's National Public Health Institute, to see what he thought of this theory. <br> Rivera didn't blame the United States, but he did blame "sugary beverages," which the United States produces and markets. Mexico's soda-and-sugar-water consumption numbers are staggering. The average Mexican drinks 163 liters of sugary beverages per year, Rivera said, which tops the world. <br> That's almost nine cans of soda per week. <br> A rising middle class as well as the prevalence of greasy street food, including tacos and quesadillas, also accounts for much of the problem, said Christopher Wilson, an associate at the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute. But Mexico's rich neighbor also plays a role in (here's the crucial part) shaping the country's tastes, he said. <br> "Potato chips are very popular, as is drinking lots of soft drinks," Wilson said. "But we see similar trends not only related to food and junk food but, at a broader level, commercial tests in Mexico are fairly closely linked to tastes in the U.S. And that's because of the intensity of cultural interactions" between the countries. <br> The fast-food-ization of the world, and the health problems that have followed, started with America and have spread far and wide. <br> At a certain point, though, does it matter where the problem started? <br> Rivera, the public health official in Mexico, was quick to claim obesity as a problem Mexico has to own -- regardless of its origins. <br> "I think there is more influence of the fast food industry (and) the sugary beverages in Mexico than in other countries as a result of being neighbors to the U.S.," he said. "... But I think that globalization is such now that you see very, very similar things in many other countries, even in countries that are less developed. So I would not blame too much on the U.S. The problem is ours, and we have to solve the problem." <br> Some important steps already are being taken. Mexico banned soda in schools, Rivera said, and might soon propose new programs to combat obesity. <br> Mexico's close relationship with the United States, however, means that America and its corporate proxies should share the responsibility of implementing solutions. <br> It does matter where these deadly trend originated -- and who started them. <br> The least the U.S. could do is be a better neighbor. 
 "We are now several years into what has been one of the deepest, most sustained, and catastrophic economic downturns in U.S. history. One notable feature of this downturn is how relatively infrequently our current hard times are finding representation in popular culture. ... Even amongst the abundance of fluff and escapist fair that Hollywood produced in the 1930s, filmmakers then frequently and directly acknowledged the role of the Great Depression on people's lives, in a way that films and television don't often do today." <br> Geier seems to me exactly correct. The logical follow-up question: Why? How can such an overwhelming experience go so unnoted? <br> I'd suggest two answers. <br> Unlike in the Depression, we're not "all in this together." The United States of the 2010s is a much more stratified society than the United States of the 1930s. The media executives who oversee our popular culture lead lives far removed from those of less-advantaged Americans. They sell into a market more internally segmented and subdivided than the market of the 1930s. <br> And also unlike the Depression, we cannot agree on what has happened to us. The U.S. is polarized, as well as stratified, and even the most basic facts become ideologically charged. The political right and the political left each have their own histories of the Great Recession, with almost no points in common. And you'll tell a very different story about the severity and duration of the recession if you blame it on President Obama than if you blame it on reckless banking. <br> Yet the economic disaster around us is too big a story to go untold -- or to be left only to the news columns and the op-ed pages. <br> That was my thought, anyway, a year and a half ago, when I set out to do what Geier laments has gone undone. <br> In my day job as a political pundit, I talk a lot about the dysfunction of the American political system. That dysfunction is not a new fact, but it has taken on new importance in these hard economic times. <br> So I took on a second challenge: to write a story in which the recession appears just as it does in the lives of so many Americans, an unremitting reality. <br> "Patriots" is a comic novel, a satire about Washington and Washington politics. It tells the story of an aimless young man, dropped into Washington because he has failed at everything else, who finds himself in the middle of the political machinations that render the U.S. government so useless to its people. <br> In the story, a new president is about to take office. He's got big plans to turn things around. But his plans threaten the power and position of important people, and they set out to destroy him. My aimless young man accidentally becomes a central figure in the plot -- and he must make some big decisions about what side to take. <br> Political ambition pushes him one way. A nameless feeling of ... something else ... pushes him the other. <br> What I wanted to show and explain was why your government has gone AWOL at exactly the moment when decisive action was most needed. <br> I wanted to show and explain how wealth buys powers in Washington and how power is used to gain wealth. <br> I wanted to show and explain that, despite all the reasons for cynicism, the right person can make a difference for the better. <br> Did I succeed? I await Geier's verdict -- and yours. <br> Here's an excerpt from David Frum's "Patriots": <br> We had an event to get to: a 6 o'clock reception hosted by regional electrical power distributors for the New York-New England congressional delegation. <br> It took only a few minutes to reach the venue: Capitol Hill's favorite restaurant, John Henry's Steakhouse. The name was kind of a joke. John Henry's occupied the ground floor of a marble-faced building erected in the late 1970s as the headquarters of a union, the International Brotherhood of Railway Workers. Dwindling numbers had long ago forced the union, like most unions, to abandon its palatial former headquarters. The only reminder of the building's original purpose were the carved scenes in the building's lobby of muscular men working on the railroad. <br> The restaurant name spoofed the old railwaymen. But the interior of John Henry's owed nothing to the age of steam. It was all aquamarine glass, shiny chrome, and butterscotch leather -- very different from Washington's usual drab style. <br> As soon as we entered, Senator Hazen was greeted by a pleasant-faced middle-aged woman in a functional office hairdo and bright red suit jacket. "Senator Hazen! So delighted you could join us!" She hurried the senator deeper into the room. <br> I was distracted by a waiter carrying a tray of lamb chops. Soon followed another tray: miniature crab cakes. Senator Hazen did not like me to drink on the job, but he surely would not wish me to go hungry. <br> Grilled vegetables on skewers with goat cheese! I love goat cheese. <br> Duck spring rolls! <br> Tiny tacos stuffed with shrimp and guacamole! <br> Sliced marinated steak! <br> The steak looked too messy for a napkin, so I asked a server for a plate and a fork. She looked at me as if at an utter newbie. "No plates or forks tonight, it's a congressional function." <br> I did my best with the steak anyway, then headed to the bar for a sparkling water. Through the throng, I spotted Mac Kohlberg. He looked anxious and distracted. <br> "Hey Dr. Kohlberg." <br> "Hello," he grunted. <br> "Do you know why I can't have a plate here?" <br> "Ethics rules," he said to a place in space somewhere over my shoulder. "Lobbyists are not allowed to buy meals for members of Congress dinner. And dinner is defined as anything eaten with a plate and cutlery." <br> "But they can eat appetizers all night?" <br> "Oh yes, nothing corrupting about appetizers." His eyes darted around the room, looking for somebody. I didn't see her either. <br> "I have to go," he said abruptly. He left too early. The next waiter presented porcini-stuffed quail. <br> As I wiped the quail juice off my fingers, I was approached by the red-suited woman who had met us at the door. "You're with Senator Hazen, yes?" <br> "Yes, indeed." <br> "This is for him." She handed me an unsealed envelope. I couldn't help peeking inside: a stack of checks, probably thirty altogether, each in the amount of $5,000, each inscribed to Hazen's campaign fund. That pleasant smile again. "We thought it would save trouble if we gathered all the contributions in one place." <br> The senator had a private dinner scheduled at eight at an apartment in the Ritz Carlton on West M Street. I glanced at my watch: 7:30 already. Time to go. I pushed my way through the now almost impassable crowd of suited men and women. I found Hazen sipping mineral water abstemiously. No quail for him. I escorted him past the valet parkers to Mehtab and the car. "Shall I come with you sir?" <br> "No need," he answered. "That's the end of the working day. Get yourself some rest. Oh" -- he glanced at my feet -- "and get yourself a shoeshine. We have a meeting in the Oval Office tomorrow." <br> The senator closed the car door behind him. <br> Well, that was a surprise. <br> The restaurant faced the parking lot at the foot of the Capitol Hill in which the truckers had made their camp. Through the cold night sky I could see huge fields of white light for the TV cameras and small dots of orange light: the truckers' heating panels. They cast a bizarre glow on the monument to sad President Garfield, first assassinated, then forgotten. The smell of the diesel exhaust from the generator that powered the heaters tainted the air. <br> I'd never actually seen these truckers who had caused so much mayhem. I stepped toward the fumes. <br> * * * <br> The trucker encampment was surrounded by a thin cordon of police. My Senate staff badge persuaded them to allow me through. <br> Inside the cordon, you felt the weight of the huge mass of surrounding equipment: the trucks themselves, the police cars beyond the trucks, the TV sound trucks beyond the police cars. You smelled diesel fuel and Port-a-Potties and heard the echoes of talk radio and Patriot News. <br> As I approached the center of the action, suspicious faces scrutinized me. The protesters, maybe three dozen of them, were sitting in clusters. I approached one of the clusters: four men, one woman. Three of the men and the woman were seated in lawn chairs. The fourth man was kneeling on the pavement fiddling with a bunch of wires leading from one of the trucks to a small TV set on a rickety little plastic table facing the chairs. Except for the unhappy expressions on their faces, they looked like they had settled in for a tailgate party. But maybe the unhappy expressions expressed a reaction to me. In my staffer's suit and badge, I must have looked like everything they had come to Washington to protest. <br> I introduced myself. "I'm with Senator Hazen's office." The name did not seem to mean much to them, but the title did. <br> "U.S. Senator?" asked one of the seated men, a man in perhaps his early sixties wearing an orange parka overtop blue jeans. The parka, obviously once expensive, now showed wear at the elbows and rips at the cuffs. <br> "Yes, sir." <br> "Which state?" queried Orange Parka. <br> "Rhode Island." <br> "Not much of a state!" <br> "He's one hell of a senator." <br> That broke the ice. <br> Another of the seated protesters spoke up, the group's one woman, in her early seventies maybe, little curls of a faded blond perm peeking from beneath a knit pink wooly cap. She was wearing a pink fleece stamped on its left side with the slogan, "Don't Tread on Me." <br> "Where's your senator on the Trucker Protest?" <br> The answer, "I don't know" probably would not satisfy anyone. I improvised. "He's always proud to see American citizens exercising their free-speech rights." <br> "That's good," she said. Beside the woman sat a man of the same vintage, wearing khaki Dockers and a black fleece blazoned with the same "Don't Tread on Me" slogan. His hair, where he still had it, was close-cropped in military style. He nodded in agreement with the woman's words. <br> I asked, "Everything going OK with the police?" <br> "They've been sweethearts," said Mrs. Don't Tread on Me. <br> "Did they give you the Port-a-Potties?" <br> She shook her hand, "No, that was Barney's idea," pointing to the man on his hands and knees, fumbling with tangled cords. He was a tall, heavy man in his mid-fifties or so, which made him the baby of the group. A heavy golden watch on a metal link band protruded from beneath his lined windbreaker. "Barney loaded them in his truck when he heard about the protest." <br> "You should have brought beer," I said. <br> That made them all laugh. "No beer on federal property," answered Orange Parka. Mrs. Don't Tread on Me asked me my name. <br> Mrs. Don't Tread on Me nudged Mr. Don't Tread on Me. "Why don't you get Walter a chair?" <br> A broken-down old lawn chair was produced. I was poured a cup of sweet milky coffee from a thermos. <br> Introductions were done. Orange Parka was named Bob. He had been a builder up in Minnesota until his contracting business went bust two years before. Mr. and Mrs. Don't Tread on Me were a married couple from Alabama, named Mary Beth and Dale. Dale was a retired army major; Mary Beth, a retired Veterans Administration nurse. Barney, the man on his knees, owned a trucking company. The last member of the group, a slight, nervous-seeming man with a grey goatee had retired this past summer after 40 years of teaching math in a Fort Worth high school. He hesitated to give his name, but the others gave it away: "Dennis." <br> "There!" announced Barney triumphantly, and the TV came to life. <br> He stood up and turned to shake my hand. <br> "Is that your truck?" I asked. <br> "Yep. I used to have six. The bank took the others, but I kept the one with the satellite dish." <br> This time I was the one to laugh. "What are you watching?" <br> "I hope we're going to watch Mark Dunn [the host of a 5 p.m. show on the "Patriot News Network"]. I DVRed his show, but we had a little trouble with the wiring. I think I've fixed everything though." <br> "That seems a lot of trouble for one TV show." <br> Dennis the retired math teacher spoke up softly. "No it isn't. You have to watch Mark Dunn every day. Otherwise you miss the connections." <br> "The connections?" <br> "Everything's connected. It's all linked up. The banks, the bailouts, the people selling us out in Mexico -- you don't understand it until you watch Mark." <br> Mary Beth, the former nurse, caught my skeptical look. "So what are they saying about us up the Hill?" <br> "A lot of concern that you're taking up so many parking spaces." <br> "We're all sorry about that. I've never even had a speeding ticket. But some things are more important." <br> "Like what?" <br> Bob in the orange parka asked sarcastically, "Would you listen if we told you?" <br> "All ears." <br> "We talk to people from the media all day long. If it's not the media, it's pollsters. If it's not pollsters, it's some smart-ass blogger trying to provoke us to say something against blacks or gays or Mexicans. But nobody seems to listen, not really. We're not haters or crazies. We're not even really a movement exactly. Most of us met for the first time when we parked here." <br> "So what brought you?" <br> Dennis the math teacher inserted himself back into the conversation. "The US military is pretty much the only institution worth a damn in this sad country of ours. Now they're being sold out the same way the politicians have sold out everything else." <br> Bob added, "I'm here to do something to stop this crazy spending, all this debt. It's wrecking this country. We're going to be papering our walls with worthless dollars." <br> "It should mean something to be an American!" Barney said intently. "These people flood into our country. America means nothing to them, just a way to earn a few bucks. My mother's father came here from Greece. He opened a restaurant and flew the flag every day! But now? You can't recognize this country any more." <br> "Mark Dunn says we're losing our country piece by piece," insisted Dennis. "And our government doesn't do a damn thing about it." <br> I had discreetly sloshed the muck in my Styrofoam cup onto the grass. I refused a refill as politely as I could. "The government seems to be doing a lot," I said. <br> "Too much," said Dennis. <br> Bob reclaimed my attention. "When I was your age, I never believed it myself when I heard an older person say this or that used to be better. Don't older people always talk about the good old days? But the old days were good -- better than now, anyways. My dad served in World War II. When he got out of the service, he found a job in an auto parts plant near Pittsburgh. Just like that. And him a man with an eighth-grade education! He became a supervisor, bought a nice house. He took us camping every summer. He retired to Florida and lived a comfortable life all the way to the end. He taught himself golf, even. <br> "Now look at me. I'm 55 and divorced. My ex-wife got the house. Who's ever going to hire me again? And my kids? Loaded up with student debt. My son is working in a Starbucks. They call him an assistant manager. He makes the same as my dad made in the plant in the 1970s! I know because my dad kept all his old pay stubs in the attic. Now my daughter's pregnant. The guy's disappeared. And she doesn't care! She says she never liked the guy that much anyway, she wants to raise the baby on her own!" <br> Dale -- a man who apparently had long ago decided to let his wife do the talking -- suddenly burst out: "And the drugs! God, they're everywhere. I wanted my son to go into the military, straighten him out. He flunked the drug test. They wouldn't give him a second chance. And now they're covering up for all these Mexicans? Who the hell is selling us these drugs anyway?" <br> "And get this government off our backs," said Bob from his orange parka. <br> "Wait a minute," I said. "Wasn't Dennis a government employee?" I pointed to Mary Beth. "And you?" I turned to Dale. "And you, too?" <br> They shook their heads at my cluelessness. <br> "I taught math!" said Dennis. "I'm not some bureaucrat. You think we can stand up to the Chinese without math? My ex-wife, she was a big union activist. I said to her all the time, 'You teach music, of course you need a union. But my work is the real deal.'" <br> "Sounds like your ex-wife needed to watch more Mark Dunn," I said. <br> Dennis ignored the irony, assuming he even heard it. "Without Mark Dunn, I'd never have got through my divorce." <br> "So, Walter," Mary Beth said, "what's this boss of yours going to do for us?" <br> I felt the weight of the envelope in my suit jacket pocket, stuffed with campaign checks. I thought: Maybe if you could write us some of these ... <br> "I can reassure Bob a little. Senator Hazen wants to try to balance the budget, stop us getting so deep in debt." <br> Barney laughed savagely. "Ha! They all say that!" <br> "You going to raise my taxes?" demanded Dennis. <br> "We'll try not to." <br> "Or cut my Medicare?" <br> "Or our veterans' benefits?" added Mary Beth. <br> "I don't know that we can balance the budget without any cuts to anything," I said. <br> "Of course you have to cut things!" Mary Beth said cheerfully. "Welfare and foreign aid. And all those people who don't pay any taxes at all -- they should be paying something, even if it's only $10 a month. I see them drinking frappa-dappa-chinos, they can afford contribute something. They're riding in the wagon, they should get down out of it and help the rest of us pull the wagon. What I'm talking about are the benefits we've earned. Our veterans risked their lives for this country, they deserve everything they get. Dale did two tours in Vietnam. Medicare? Seniors have paid for it." <br> "We're not asking for anything we're not entitled to," said Dennis. "No handouts. We want our country back, that's all. The way it used to be." <br> "And we'll raise hell if we don't get it!" Barney boomed. <br> "I'll tell the senator," I promised. <br> I thanked them for the coffee and hoisted myself out of the lawn chair. I took a roundabout route home, through the Hotel Monaco. The shoeshine man was still on duty. He did a beautiful job too. 
 Condescension is never appetizing. Not even when it's wrapped around a chimichanga. <br> Let me set the table. Milbank was making a point that I've made dozens of times myself: Given the nation's demographics and the direction they're headed, the GOP is on a suicide mission if it continues to alienate Hispanics. <br> But for a long time, Senate Republicans seemed intent on preventing that from occurring. They filibustered the nomination by doing what senators in both parties do during a filibuster: spouting nonsense for hours on end. <br> Milbank seized on the nonsense that came from Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. The senator's remarks really had nothing to do with Latinos. They were about Arizona. <br> "The lettuce in your salad this month almost certainly came from Arizona," McCain said on the Senate floor. "It's also believed that the chimichanga has its origin in Arizona." <br> Milbank sneered: "The chimichanga? It may be the only thing Republicans have left to offer Latinos." <br> That told me that Milbank's knowledge of Latinos was a taco short of a combination plate. As dysfunctional as the modern-day Republican Party is with regard to immigration -- in large part, because it has basically volunteered to be the party of white Americans who are freaked out over shifting demographics -- the GOP offers Latinos quite a bit in other areas. <br> For instance, a major reason you have even a sliver of accountability in America's public schools is because a Republican president -- George W. Bush -- pushed through the No Child Left Behind, the most important educational reform measure in 50 years. <br> Republicans also offer Latinos a full menu of conservative selling points: strong defense, smaller government, lower taxes, pro-life judges and a defense of traditional marriage. <br> By the way, as someone who is pro-choice and supports gay marriage, those parts of the GOP message don't work on me. But the point is, they do work on Latinos who are more socially conservative. <br> Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, eagerly bit into Milbank's snarky quote, sending it out in a tweet. <br> Of course he did. It's not like someone such as Messina has much else to do, with regard to Latino voters. The modern Democratic Party strategy for Hispanic outreach amounts to simply this: "Hola! Vote for us. We're not Republicanos!" <br> I can't blame Messina for opportunistically seizing on a quote from someone else that he thinks will make his job easier. That is what political operatives do. <br> But I do blame Milbank. His remark was uninformed and uncalled for. Latinos can trace their ancestry to a variety of different countries, and they're not interchangeable. <br> Chimichangas might mean something to Mexicans or Mexican-Americans, but where does that leave Dominicans, Cubans, Brazilians, Puerto Ricans and others? Also, it's never a good idea for someone who isn't Latino to presume to know what appeals to Latinos. Lastly, if it's not too much to ask, just once I'd like to not be defined by a food group. <br> Politicians have dished out this tactic for years. In his congressional and Senate races, Lyndon Johnson went into the Hispanic enclaves of south Texas and handed out tacos and beer. <br> Years later, President Gerald Ford tried to bond with a Hispanic audience by taking a bite out of a tamale. Bill Clinton loved Mexican food and consumed it with gusto. During a visit to a Mexican restaurant in Tucson in the late 1990s, Clinton showed his affinity with Hispanics by eating enough to satisfy an entire Mexican family. <br> No political party is perfect. And neither Republicans nor Democrats are doing a very good job of serving Latinos at the moment. On the immigration issue, both have failed us. <br> But the truth is that, despite what some liberals want Latinos to believe, the GOP offers a lot to that community. At moments like this, however, liberal Democrats offer only sarcasm, insults and condescension. <br> It's enough to give you indigestion. 
 "Go home!" she yelled at me. "Why don't you go back home to Mexico before you ruin this country like you ruined your own!" <br> I was standing in a crowd at the Music Midtown festival in Atlanta, where I live. A few minutes earlier I'd met a group of five people who'd been standing in front of me -- here from Mexico City -- and I had begun speaking Spanish with them. <br> Atlanta has a growing Latino community, and I am actively involved. Whenever I get the chance to speak to someone in Spanish here, I introduce myself. My new acquaintances and I were talking about what a great time we were having and how remarkable the city of Atlanta was for bringing back the festival to Piedmont Park. <br> And that's when I heard the yelling woman next to me. As if "go home" wasn't clear enough, the woman -- a 20-something Caucasian -- repeated the words in Spanish. <br> I froze. I didn't quite know what to say, and I didn't want to believe she was talking to me or the group of people I had just met. <br> As a third-generation Mexican-American growing up in Los Angeles, I had never encountered such overt racism. In fact, because my family was long since assimilated, among my Latino friends I was always considered the "pocho" or "white boy" of the group. (As I write this, a part of me knows somewhere in L.A., a friend of mine will be proud to know someone actually considered me Mexican enough to yell "go home" at me.) <br> My Mexican friends remind me that I am American first, Mexican second and that my English is better than my Spanish. <br> "Yes," I tell them. "But I can never walk into a room and be white." <br> Evidently, to some the brown color of my skin means I'm not even American. My friends and family tell me what I experienced that night is a microcosm of what is happening to Latinos across the country. You don't have to look hard to find it. In news stories, in political discourse, on talk radio, in everyday conversation it seems it has become OK to treat Latinos in a negative and antagonistic way -- whether they are new immigrants or longtime Americans. The anti-immigration legislation sweeping across the United States has made this plain. People in my Latino networks say they've noticed the change. And now I understand what they mean. <br> Like many Americans whose grandparents or parents came here from somewhere else, I live at the intersection of my two cultures. I eat tacos, but I love cheeseburgers. I go salsa dancing, and listen to rock n' roll. I speak Spanish and English, and depending on the crowd, sometimes Spanglish. I love my country and my cultural community. My duality is my reality, just like the 50 million other Latinos in the United States. <br> I have been luckier than many. Before this incident, the closest I'd ever come to blatant racism was in junior high. I was in the jazz band and played first trumpet. One day our jazz band teacher invited in his predecessor, a local legend who had made Eagle Rock High School's jazz program famous in the 1980s. <br> The visiting instructor pointed me out and asked me to play him 16 bars of music. I did, but he quickly interrupted. <br> "Stop, stop, stop. I don't want to hear any of that mariachi music. This is jazz." <br> I didn't think anything of it. Instead I felt terrible that the legend standing in front of me didn't think I was good enough. I went home that night, and like every night, at 6:30 p.m. my family sat down for dinner to talk about our day. <br> "How was your day, Nicky?" my dad asked. <br> So I told him. Outraged, the next day he went to my principal and filed a formal complaint. The legend didn't come back to visit the jazz program again. Weeks later we received a letter in the mail from him apologizing for his insensitive comments. My family saved the letter. <br> My father was hypersensitive to ethnic identity and deeply proud of his Latino heritage. The son of a naturalized immigrant from El Salvador and a Mexican mother from Texas, he grew up in Los Angeles during a time of racial tension. When I was young he would tell me stories of the race riots in his high school, violence against people of color, and awful accounts of the struggle he had to make it as a Mexican-American teen in the 1960s. <br> He died when I was 17 years old, but one of the phrases he implanted in my mind before he passed was a statement activist Cesar Chavez made famous: <br> "Si se puede" -- "Yes you can." <br> And now, here I was, at 28, with this stranger yelling at me to "leave." I stood there in the middle of a damp crowd on a late Atlanta evening, not comprehending, the wind still and the vibrations of Coldplay's "Yellow" filling the space in the air. <br> I didn't say a thing. <br> I didn't have to. <br> The crowd around us looked in amazement at this woman. Some of them spoke up to her, telling her she was wrong to talk to us like that. The group of people from Mexico City looked at her in disgust and, realizing from the look on my face that I must not be accustomed to what I was hearing, they turned toward me to offer support. <br> One of them, a young man, grabbed my hand and raised it high in the air. <br> "Estamos aqui," he said, which translates to "We are here." <br> It was the "Si se puede" moment. <br> The woman continued to taunt us for some minutes, but when we did not reciprocate her hatred, she stopped. <br> The band played a few more songs before ending the set, and the crowd dispersed across the park into the Saturday evening. <br> As I walked away, the woman and I locked eyes. <br> "I don't think you understand who you said that to," I told her. Thinking to myself, I am as American as you are. <br> "What," she said laughing. "Are you some kind of celebrity or something?" <br> No. But like the Mexicans I was standing with, I am a human being. And I am home. 
 Seth Rogen, co-writer, co-producer and co-star of the animated comedy Sausage Party, is unhappy with me -- for defending him. <br> A reviewer for a site called Autostraddle at first praised the movie, including its depiction of a talking lesbian taco voiced by Salma Hayek. <br> Un-publish. Last week, I did a show on free speech. A tweet I sent out plugging it said, The attack on free speech even extends to silly movies like @SethRogen's Sausage Party. <br> Rogen's followers pounced, one saying, It's baffling that some people can't comprehend that criticism is a part of free speech ... Everything is working as intended. Stossel is a tool. <br> But wait! I agree! As I said in my TV show, private organizations have the right to publish or un-publish just about anything. <br> To clarify: Private individuals are free to criticize all they like, and the First Amendment forbids government to decide whether a taco is offensive to lesbians -- or to fundamentalist Christians for that matter. <br> Private citizens and private organizations, whether they're TV channels, universities or activist groups, can duke it out in the arena created by our right to free speech. <br> I fear that the growing belief that no one should ever have to suffer being offended or hearing something that upsets them could come back to haunt us with calls for real censorship. That would be a real attack on free speech. <br> I can't order people to listen to their enemies any more than I can order my enemies to shut up. The best thing we can do when we hear upsetting ideas is respond with good counterarguments. <br> Keep making art, voicing opinions and expecting other people to tell you you're an idiot who should stay silent. That's the messy process by which we learn from each other. 
 As a Mexican student studying in the United States, I have never really noticed the celebration of “Cinco de Mayo.” I know it exists of course; it is hard to ignore any party in a college campus since Friday and Saturday nights revolve around going out. When I think about my Mexican heritage, however, Cinco de Mayo celebrations do not really make an impact. I am proud of being Mexican, but celebrating it in the U.S is not really a part of that. <br> It is so interesting, because of this, that it is such a big deal in the United States, but is it a big deal for the right reasons? In my college campus it is mostly about margaritas and parties. There are a lot of multicultural groups on campus that push for a celebration of the day worthy of our Mexican heritage, but most people do not go to these celebrations. It is not wrong for people to go to a party with a Cinco de Mayo theme, but they should not make fun of the holiday, either. <br> The problem is not that this holiday is over-celebrated at all; it is just that the original memory of the day might be compromised. This is not a call to ban all Cinco de Mayo celebrations and it is definitely not a request to U.S. citizens to stop drinking margaritas and eating tacos on this day. This account is mainly a story. A story about remembering a legendary day in Mexico City when the soldiers faced certain death but instead pushed forward and survived, and this is coming from me: remembering can definitely include margaritas and food. Keep your parties with margaritas, keep wearing those sombreros around your day, just try to think at least for a minute of what this holiday might mean to someone in Puebla. <br> A Cinco de Mayo party is still a party with a few traditional dishes and just a bit of remembrance. <br> I have come to accept the celebration here and have worked on my remembrance of the day instead of worrying about the way others remember. Instead of being offended, be proud of your heritage and talk to those around you. Celebrate Cinco de Mayo with them. Tell your friends about the legendary Battle of Puebla that is celebrated in your country over a round of refreshing and colorful margaritas. 
 This week I took advantage of a beautiful afternoon and went for a walk with my 11-year-old son. We left our car in a parking lot and sauntered from one end of our small town to the other and back again. <br> Not long after we began doubling back to our car, my son noticed something unusual in the gravel near somehibernating train tracks that slice through town. <br> He stopped to poke it with a stick and I continued moving along. When I looked over my shoulder and invited him to catch up, he was locked on his gold find like a 49er. <br> I turned around and walked back to hear him wondering aloud about the mysterious object. He was even more intrigued when he flipped it over. “What are those lines?” he asked. <br> “Are you positive?” <br> Thankfully, he’s had “the talk” and has an age-appropriate understanding of what happens when a man and a woman love each other very, very much. Still, the questions fell like April showers. <br> I began to think too, but as he speed-chatted as only an 11-year old boy can, my mind began to both wonder<i>andwander. <br> Or, is she terrified to tell her parents because she’s practically still a child herself? <br> Or, is she hiding the news like a secret under oversized shirts and a missed girls’ night out? <br> Or, because she sees no other options, is she thinking of visiting a doctor for other reasons? <br> Whatever she’s experiencing, whatever decisions she might be making about life, family and future, I hope she knows how much God loves both her and the child she carries. <br> I hope she knows that God has big plans for the baby inside her. He wants that child to grow, to be loved, nurtured, taught and tested. And whether by biological mother or another, God wants that baby hugged, kissed and prayed for and with. <br> I hope she knows that it will be tough, but worth it. Sure, there will difficult days. But while a few are brutal, many more are beautiful. 
 When I was a little boy, fresh from the long train ride from Mexico City to El Paso, then to Los Angeles and San Diego on a train bursting with young men in uniform going to war against the Empire of the Sun I was told I had a cousin who played baseball but he, too, was on his way to fight in the war. I was a little kid of three, I didn’t know what baseball was. <br> He died ... never admitting publicly that he was the first Hispanic, Mexican American baseball superstar. Thats a shame but, he was a product of his time. <br> When I went out for football in high school, I practiced on the same field Ted Williams played baseball on and my coach was the catcher on Williams’ high school baseball team. Coach picked me up one day after practice while I was hitchhiking home. He asked me if I knew the Williams family, I said no, but that we were distant cousins, I was told. He told me that Ted’s mother made the best tacos he had ever eaten, that he had eaten them by the ton because Ted Williams was his best friend. Did my mother make good tacos, he asked. I said, no, my mother couldn’t make a tortilla to save her life, but I could. <br> The story is covered in depth by former Boston Globe Editor Ben Bradlee Jr’s new book, “The Kid: The Immortal Life Of Ted Williams.” Williams did everything he could to hide the fact that he was half-Mexican. After his spectacular debut in the Major Leagues in 1939, Bradlee tells us, he came home to San Diego on the train and was aghast when he looked out and every Mexican relative of his from both sides of the border was there to welcome him home, the first Mexican American baseball hero. He high-tailed it off the train through another car. He was not proud of being what he was and he was afraid that bigotry would hinder his career. <br> There are relatives of mine who still feel the same way, now in 2013. <br> One recalls that World War One Medal of Honor awardee David B. Barkeley told no one his mother was Mexican because the U.S. Army had just invaded Mexico twice and was filled with anti-Mexican bigots from corporal up to General Pershing. <br> If Ted Williams was 18 years old today, he would be proud of being Mexican American. The times and the country have changed since the 20s and 30s when he grew up in San Diego where one in three people are of Mexican origin. A Mexican American is even running for Mayor in a Special Election. San Diego has never had a Mexican American mayor since it became an American city in 1850. It never elected a Mexican American city councilman until 1992 (without being appointed first). <br> I do so with a grin on my face because I know that the Mexican-haters among us who double as Minutemen will choke on this declaration. It’s a big grin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 There are many among us who do not study, savor or digest history of any sort much less American and/or Mexican history. Those people disregard history and prefer only to live today and look to the future. <br> Numbers first: There are more people of Mexican heritage within sight of Los Angeles than all the Cubans, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans in the U.S. combined. Fact: two thirds of all American Hispanics are of Mexican background. <br> Will Mexican Americans be bought with government cash and goodies, or will they remember that Democrats invaded Mexico three times and never elected Mexican American Governor until a century after Republicans did &nbsp; <br> Nonetheless, the media treats all such ethnic specific populations the same, despite longstanding political differences. Puerto Ricans as a rule can hardly understand the Mexican American; conversely, Mexican-background people don’t know much about Cuban and Puerto Rican problems and views. <br> If someone says “Boricua,” Mexicans have no idea what that means. Some Puerto Ricans call themselves “Boricuans” trying to identify with native peoples who lived in Puerto Rico when Columbus discovered it. <br> Two thirds of American Hispanics are of Mexican background. That is why the Mexican American political future is absolutely essential to the American political process. How Mexican Americans vote may determine the future of the country. <br> Older Cubans are reliably Republican because Democrats – they feel – handed Cuba over to the Communists at the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 that President Kennedy caused when he reneged on his promise of air support to American-trained Cubans. Younger Cubans with no memory of having been run out of Cuba have tended in recent years to vote Democrat, but the percentages are still 50-50. <br> For example, Romualdo Pacheco, born a Mexican citizen in Mexican California, was first elected to the California State Senate in 1857 as a Republican. In 1861 Governor Leland Stanford appointed Senator Pacheco Brigadier General and Commanding Officer of the California Native Cavalry, a Union armed force that disarmed Confederate sympathizers in Southern California. <br> Republican Pacheco served as governor for a year. He ran for Congress in 1877 and defeated an incumbent by one vote. He served in Congress until his defeated opponent convinced his old House colleagues to accept him rather than Pacheco. Pacheco came back a year later and defeated the incumbent again. He served two terms. In 1890 Pacheco was appointed Ambassador to Central America and its various countries. <br> Marco Rubio is the first Republican Cuban elected Senator with Florida also scoring a Spanish-descent Republican governor in Bob Martinez in 1987. No Puerto Rican has been elected Governor or Senator of any state. <br> Democrat President Woodrow Wilson invaded Mexico twice in 1914 and 1916. Democrat President Polk fomented war with Mexico in 1846 in order to steal California and the Southwest.

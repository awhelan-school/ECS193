It might very well be that Donald Trump tweets himself into a one-term presidency. <br> This week has moved President Trump into a political red zone. Until now, the President has also generated strong support within the corporate sector, which has been pleased with his mix of tax cuts and deregulation. Trump can kick and scream all he wants, but as long as the bottom line is good, many business and financial leaders could very well be willing to turn a blind eye toward the bullying and bombast. <br> But now the tweet-storms are encroaching into dangerous territory for the President. His tirades are starting to spook the markets and to trigger retaliatory tariffs that can have a damaging economic impact. <br> If the Trump base starts to suffer too much, the frustration that led these voters to support him could move them toward another candidate. Trump is threatening to get rid of NAFTA, which would be another huge blow to free trade. <br> Support from Republicans outside of Trump's core base -- those who would have preferred another Republican candidate -- remains strong, but could easily start to thin. <br> More than anything else, as was evident with the resignation of Gary Cohn (who refused to step down even after Charlottesville), this might convince the corporate world to start looking for a new president. <br> Although there are ongoing negotiations to resolve these issues, such as saving NAFTA, the President is getting in the way. The tweets and statements are causing damage that can be hard to undo. It is unclear whether President Trump has the capacity or the will to renege on his supporters on these issues, given the tensions that have already emerged over the omnibus spending bill. <br> Many of President Trump's strongest supporters currently suffer from the same overwrought confidence that Hillary Clinton's supporters exhibited in 2016. They see a Teflon politician for whom nothing can go wrong. Yet, as Clinton's supporters discovered on election night, no one is invincible on the campaign trail. In this case, the tweets that have consumed so much of our attention since January 2016 could very well be the key that opens the door to a new leader in 2020. 
Despite long and detailed lists of the obvious benefits of diversity, those two words, inclusion rider, could revolutionize Hollywood and transform all of America -- because we have a national problem that spans far beyond the red carpet. <br> This is where inclusion riders of all shapes and forms come in. As a nation we need to lift each other up. We need to understand that if one of us can't rise, all of us are kept down. <br> This is similar to what inclusion riders can do by having one person, the person with pay privilege, demand that others should be included, represented and paid fairly. But doing this individually won't solve all our problems. To state the obvious: This won't fully work if only women step forward. People of all genders in Hollywood should be using inclusion riders. <br> It also won't work if only Hollywood moves toward fair pay and inclusion. <br> After all, it's not just women in Hollywood who need a lift. Women across America would be better off if we were all treated, paid, hired and promoted fairly. <br> We have a situation. <br> Too many women are being excluded from fair pay and representation to the tune of billions of dollars. <br> But the examples don't stop there. <br> Quite simply, women are being excluded from economic security on more than one level. Improving inclusion while addressing wealth inequality will be crucial in the years to come. The need for universal protections and benefits that stay with the worker instead of being tied to a specific workplace, which everyone -- at every wage level -- can access, is becoming increasingly urgent. <br> But women don't. <br> So in honor of International Women's Day, on Thursday, we need people of all genders to stand up -- whether they stand on a red carpet or on a regular floor -- and demand inclusion and equity for each and every person in our nation.
For the better part of a decade, we have worked with the military to identify root causes and institute safeguards that prevent sexual harassment and sexual assault and increase support for survivors. <br> But the organizational failures at the root of sexual harassment and assault are not unique to the military. Leaders abusing their authority; cultures that frequently close ranks to prevent negative attention; victims suffering retaliation; assailants protected by their colleagues; lack of institutional support; unclear or obstructed paths to justice -- these are the same shortcomings now being revealed across industries, from entertainment to education; media to Congress. Sexual harassment and sexual assault in professional workplaces is widespread in America -- but there are positive steps we can take. <br> While not an apples-to-apples comparison, many of the systemic changes instituted over the past decade within the military can be translated to the civilian sector. <br> Similarly, private entities should, if victims request it, be encouraged to provide alternate places of work immediately to victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault. Responsible employers ought to provide victims no-cost legal support -- you should not suffer financial hardship because you endured sexual harassment at work. Regular, anonymous climate surveys are useful tools every industry should adopt to determine the prevalence of harassment. And private institutions should clearly outline the professional consequences of sexually inappropriate or illegal behavior in the workplace. <br> While every institution must wrestle with how best to change its culture and do right by victims, the fight against sexual assault in the military has imparted lessons and created tools that have broader applicability. <br> A military unit succeeds or fails based on its members' ability to trust and cooperate with the women and men standing beside them. As we look around the halls of Capitol Hill, there are places where our culture trends toward insularity over transparency. But, like in the military, trust is essential between members, staff and all those involved in making our government run. <br> Military sexual assault is far from a solved crisis and we have much more work to do to change the military culture that has enabled these crimes for too long. But systemic changes in the military have had an impact and can also serve as a model for how broader society moves forward from this watershed moment.
The book has not been released yet, and there is little way of confirming how much of it is true. But when writing my book "The Residence," about the approximately 100 men and women who work as chefs, maids, ushers and florists on the White House residence staff, I heard many strange stories. Some of them were disturbing, but they also made iconic presidents and first ladies more human. <br> Historically, it is the kind of seemingly small revelations of personal behavior and individual quirks like those included in Wolff's book that reveal the compulsive nature of some of the men who have occupied the highest office. In the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson made life hell, for example, for plumbing foreman Reds Arrington (who got his nickname because of his mane of bright red hair). For the five years he was in office, Johnson was obsessively focused on the water pressure and temperature of his shower. It was never hot enough, and the water pressure was never at the needle-like intensity he so desperately wanted. <br> Sitting in the Oval Office, Johnson would call Arrington while he was in the plumbers shop, located underground between the White House and the West Wing. "If I can move 10,000 troops in a day (referring to the Vietnam War), you can certainly fix the bathroom any way I want it!" Johnson would bellow. It's not hard to imagine Trump doing something similar. <br> LBJ's younger daughter, Luci Baines Johnson, is still defensive about his fixation. "A shower that had volume and force was one of life's few comforts," she told me. "I'm sure he probably expressed very specific guidelines and expectations and probably expressed them with a firm hand. But it's not much to ask for when you are the leader of the free world, getting that small little bit of solace and creature comfort." <br> Sometimes the stories I heard confirmed the public reputations of these men and women who are so famous but so unknowable at the same time. Maid Ivaniz Silva spent most of her time in the family's inner sanctum on the second and third floors of the residence and told me about accidentally walking in on a naked Ronald Reagan when she went to turn down the bed and close the curtains in the Reagans' bedroom. When Silva walked into the adjoining sitting room, she found Reagan sitting stark naked and reading the newspaper. She ran out of the room, her face bright red. When she passed him in the hallway later that night, Reagan looked at her, teasing: "Hey, who was that guy?" <br> "I don't know sir," she said, laughing shyly. <br> Wolff's excerpts indicate that Trump prefers McDonald's cheeseburgers because they're precooked and therefore a less accessible target for a would-be assassin. While that may sound odd, and true or not, it resonates with stories I've heard before. I interviewed more than 50 former residence staffers, including former executive chef, the late Walter Scheib, who told me one of his goals as the White House chef was to keep the first family alive. "This is no small consideration given all the people that dislike the president for whatever reason, whether it's international or national," he told me. <br> Scheib, who worked in the White House from 1994 to 2005, also said, "There is no one more important to the physical safety of the president than the pastry chef and the chef." Executive Pastry Chef Roland Mesnier told me the same thing. He was hired by Rosalynn Carter and didn't leave the White House until 2006. He confirmed that even after 9/11, no food tasters stood by in the kitchen to make sure the president's food wasn't poisoned: "We were it," he said. "The system we had to buy the food was actually the safest it could be, the simplest way. You send someone to the store that doesn't have any public White House connection. Nobody knows who he is." <br> For many years, he was Bill Hamilton -- officially the White House storeroom manager, who retired in 2013 after being a member of the residence staff since Dwight Eisenhower's administration. Hamilton was responsible for buying food for family meals and state dinners, and he often ran out to pick up whatever the first family needed, from toilet paper to apples. He rode in an unmarked Secret Service van to pick up supplies. He wouldn't tell me which supermarket he went to, and it was clear that the key was anonymity: No one knew he was shopping for the first family, and no one was interested in tainting or poisoning the food he was buying. Trump's reported paranoia is easier to understand given this context. <br> Trump's alleged lack of trust in the household staff also sounds familiar. The head of housekeeping, Christine Limerick, left the White House for several years after an explosive fight with first lady Nancy Reagan, who was horrified when some of her extensive collection of hand-painted porcelain Limoges boxes were broken by accident during cleanings. Reagan was so furious that she had Limerick pack up her keepsakes and put them in storage for several months. <br> Limerick quit in 1986 after seven years and returned only when Barbara Bush became first lady. "It wasn't because Mrs. Reagan was who or what she was," Limerick told me. She left "because I realized that I was getting close to talking back." Members of the household staff began photographing the first family's bedrooms, bathrooms, sitting rooms and offices before major cleanings so they could have a record showing that everything was put back in its place. <br> When Limerick decorated the Christmas tree in the Yellow Oval Room on the second floor, Bill Clinton was upset. He is allergic to pine, but Hillary Clinton wanted a real tree for a few days -- the plan was to put the tree up around December 19 and take it down as soon as December 28. Limerick knew how much the President liked putting up the decorations with their daughter, Chelsea. It made him feel normal, even for a few minutes. But one year, Limerick told me, Hillary Clinton asked her to put up the ornaments because Clinton had an event that night. But when the president came up to the second floor after attending the event he was furious when he saw some of the decorations already hanging on the tree. "Who did this?" he yelled. Presidents feel out of control of their own lives and sometimes rely on small traditions to feel normal. <br> How people in positions of power treat those who cook and clean and generally pick up after them says a lot about their character, but the truth is that while genuinely bizarre, this latest alleged behavior from Trump is not much different from some of the men, and even one first lady, who came before him.
We have entered an age in which women can safely discuss sexual misconduct in the workplace without fear of retaliation and retribution. <br> As a small player in this recent uprising and as a product of generations of fierce women, I recognize the potential brevity of this moment and don't want us to squander it with only rage and pain. I have heard a simplified and repeated story line these last few weeks -- men are vile and women are victims. And I do not want to re-enforce a story line that pits men against women. <br> While healing will require time, unified awareness around the issue and a great deal of humility, we must use this moment to improve the future. In other words, we must transform this reckoning into a reconciliation. <br> We must take advantage of the opportunity to shift the lens through which we view power and freedom. The men who have been publicly accused in recent weeks could have been replaced years ago. But they were protected and supported because the industries surrounding them believed these men's ability to deliver sponsorship, viewers and ticket sales far outweighed the responsibility of providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. <br> We also need to reconcile that the behavior, highlighted by the #MeToo campaign, is not restricted to a few bad apples -- it's far more pervasive. To repair this issue, we need to address the root cause and not oversimplify it as the reprehensible actions of a few "villainous" celebrities. This kind of societal reconciliation is hard. It requires us all to take a hard look at ourselves and our actions, or in many cases, to reflect on the actions others took against us. <br> I would like for us to consider that by labeling these men as villains, we are neither curing the underlying problem nor achieving the freedom we desire. In fact, the label itself serves as an insurmountable block against addressing and acknowledging similar actions we might exhibit ourselves. By identifying these men's actions (I am not discussing cases that require law enforcement) as fringe, it reinforces the perception that this is a rare occurrence. Many abusers do not recognize their actions as wrong, and by villainizing common-place sexual assault, we are creating an impediment in raising awareness of the breadth of the issue. <br> At this point, there are many men and women who would greatly benefit from reconciling the abuse of power they have engaged in from both sides; I can tell you this practice has greatly benefited my life. I had to reconcile staying in an unhealthy and abusive work environment because I held some poisonous beliefs. I believed I didn't have other options and that I somehow equally deserved and created the treatment I received. To heal, I had to repair the places that allowed for this abuse, and I did that through learning to love and value myself. <br> I implore us to embrace and examine the discomfort of this historic time. Allow the anger, the rage, the sadness and the numbness to sink in. Only then can we treat ourselves with all the compassion and vigor we can muster. A society in which everyone, men and women, allow themselves to feel and process difficult experiences is both healthier and less susceptible to predatory behavior. <br> This is not an impossible task, but it is a hurdle we must overcome. Today, we are in mourning. We are still immersed in a time that has only recently unchained the suppressed female voice. Tomorrow, we will be required to live again, and I hope we choose to heal.
Is what Abbott said in a July 2016 traffic stop -- recorded on a dashcam -- worse than what Officer Michael Amiott did last month to Richard Hubbard III in Euclid, Ohio? <br> Hubbard, who was charged with driving on a suspended license and resisting arrest, is shown cooperating with Amiott -- and then the officer slams him against the car. After telling Hubbard to face away from him, he gives him no time to comply before applying force. Amiott said in a police report, "I began using closed fist strikes to the face and head of the suspect in order to end his resistance." <br> Watch the video to see how this really went. <br> Harris County attorneys deny this, saying her pants fell down and that they conducted a visual strip search. Watch the video and judge for yourself. <br> My money is on Corley's version of events. Why? Just think about it. In the best-case scenario, police in Houston are arguing they held a pants- and underwear-less woman down on the ground for several minutes and forced her to spread her legs while they visually examined her most intimate parts. That's how they are defending what they did! <br> Imagine the outrage if a frat boy told a prosecutor he didn't do anything wrong by holding down a woman and examining her vagina because her pants happened to fall in front of him. The claims by police in the Corley case are just as absurd. <br> It can't be true that sarcastically saying cops only kill black people will get a police officer in Cobb County, Georgia, fired more quickly than actually brutalizing black people. <br> Corley was initially charged with possession of 0.02 ounces of marijuana and resisting arrest, charges that were dropped. Two of the officers, who were indicted by a Harris County grand jury on charges of official oppression, were cleared of wrongdoing and remained on the force. A federal civil rights trial is scheduled for January. <br> If you really want to know why black Americans are so angered by the kinds of conversations we've been having these past few weeks, including watching President Donald Trump equate those confronting racial bigotry with the bigots themselves, watch these videos. <br> It is an unbroken string. The monuments were often erected when black progress was becoming most evident, as a way to re-assert white dominance, to remind black people to stay in their place. They were designed as state-sponsored intimidation. Police brutality has long served a similar purpose. <br> The brutality is awful enough -- it is made worse when so many people, so frequently, make excuses for it. They either look away or claim it is only a few bad apples, no matter how many times it happens, no matter the presence of enduring racial disparities. <br> It's time to stop looking away.
The recent story of an Australian woman shot dead by police in Minneapolis is a tragedy of epic proportions. Summoning law enforcement to report what she believed to be a sexual assault occurring in the vicinity of her home, Justine Ruszczyk, according to one of the officers on scene, startled police and was shot dead by an arriving officer still seated inside his patrol car. <br> This appears to be a horrific split-second decision and mistake that resulted in Ruszczyk's tragic death and a police officer's life irrevocably altered. <br> In the wake of this tragedy, Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau was forced to resign when the city's mayor expressed a "loss of confidence" in the chief's ability to lead the department. <br> The victim was white and the officer involved has been identified as Mohamed Noor, a Somali-American in the Minneapolis Police Department. <br> Ergo, there has been no rush to judgments condemning the Minneapolis force as "hopelessly racist," and no demands for it to be placed under a consent decree. So how might this case fit into the larger narrative about race and policing in America? <br> Well, it raises three points that we must acknowledge in order to begin the national conversation on how to address tensions between law enforcement and the communities they serve. <br> First, we must acknowledge America has a deep and complicated history when it comes to African-Americans and law enforcement. The early beginnings of our nation saw slave patrols in the guise of "law enforcement" wielded as the disciplinary arm of the slave codes in the colonies and states. First implemented in South Carolina in 1704, the patrols were designed to maintain control and instill fear -- a mechanism that ensured the smaller outnumbered white populations on plantations could deter slave uprisings and revolts. These patrols also enforced the fugitive slave laws, serving as the "catchers" of runaway slaves, as well as judge, jury and executioners. <br> Fast forward to the civil rights movement's Selma-to-Montgomery march some two months after I was born in 1965; the appalling images still shock the senses and are indelibly ingrained in our national consciousness. Who can look away from the images of the courageous marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge meeting Alabama's Public Safety Commissioner Theophilus "Bull" Connor's fire hoses, police batons and attack dogs? Terrorism employed as an instrument of the state. <br> Those of us in law enforcement must understand and appreciate this truism -- that in our country's 241-year history, injustices have been committed in the name of "justice." And that though many wear the badge with honor, there are still some in our ranks today who abuse their power and apply the law unevenly and injudiciously. <br> Secondly, let's also remember what former FBI Director James Comey spoke about in a critically important speech at Georgetown University, titled "Hard Truths: Law Enforcement and Race": We all carry in us implicit biases based upon our understanding of others and shaped by our own experiences. Individually, we must resist the uncontrollable urge to succumb to these biases. <br> To acknowledge this shouldn't make us "racist." But in today's hyperpolarized environment, to mention these truisms typically results in being shouted down and unjustly labeled. Rather than blaming an inherently racist criminal justice system, could we not instead attribute partial causality to the disproportionate amount of African-American interactions with law enforcement? <br> To admit as much and seek a solution would be brave. And we could counterbalance that effort with another equally important one. This one requires law enforcement to be honest as well, and to acknowledge that it is insane that we currently have no national database to harvest, store and retrieve data related to officer-involved-shootings. <br> How can this be? If Google can glean my web surfing tendencies and target advertising based on my apparent interests, how are we not able to accurately compile the numbers and circumstances involving police shootings? <br> Want a solution? I suggest tying federal funding to reporting compliance. Currently, the Washington Post seems like the only reliable repository for data related to police shootings. But it shouldn't be. <br> While we're at it, law enforcement is a wholly human endeavor, fallible and made up of mortals -- like me -- susceptible to making mistakes. And, yes, there are bad cops. I certainly know this firsthand from having worked as an undercover FBI agent on a case targeting police corruption in the New York metropolitan area in 2002. But these few "bad apples" don't represent the vast majority of those who wear the badge and swear an oath to protect us. <br> And, finally, let's acknowledge that media coverage can also be skewed in its portrayal of officer-involved-shootings, reinforcing a trope by making it appear that unarmed blacks are seemingly always the victims of overzealous police. <br> Does anyone believe that greater media coverage is directed at police shootings of whites? My evidence may be anecdotal, but I challenge the reader to argue that officer-involved shootings of white Americans get as much coverage when compared to shootings of people of color by police. <br> In short, we must address these three truisms. Until we do so, we're simply dismissing large pieces of the causality in our current racial divide, and irresponsibly pretending that some hard truths don't exist. That makes us afraid to confront them. So we don't. And that's counterproductive to the cause demanding that national conversation.
Cardinal George Pell, former archbishop of Sydney and Melbourne and current head of the Vatican's Secretariat for the Economy, denied the allegations that will require him to return to Australia from Rome to face multiple charges of sexual assault. <br> Certainly, the early 2000s were the peak, with the Boston Globe bringing the issue to national prominence, resulting in lawsuits, criminal charges and the Academy Award-winning movie "Spotlight," about the journalists who uncovered both the abuse and the coverup by the church hierarchy. <br> That's 101 too many. <br> Despite his association with the more open-minded Pope Francis, Pell rose to prominence under Pope John Paul II, who named him a bishop and eventually a cardinal. Of course, John Paul II — his elevation to sainthood notwithstanding — will be remembered for having a blind spot when it came to the sex abuse crisis. <br> Pell's star rose in the church in part because of his reputation as an orthodox watchdog, regularly denouncing homosexuality, divorce and women's ordination. If the charges against him are found to be true, it would be further evidence that this issue crosses the traditional so-called "liberal" or "conservative" lines in the church. <br> Sadly, even our current, popular pope has a mixed record on responding to what is clearly more than a few individual "bad apples." Catholics — at least those who have not already left the church over this issue — are right to trust the criminal justice system more than their church. With Pell, we shall soon see what that system ultimately discovers and decides.
Today, President Donald Trump fulfilled one campaign commitment -- withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement -- and busted another -- choosing to exercise the waiver of not opening a US embassy in Jerusalem -- at least for now. <br> So what do the President's actions today tell us about the Trump administration's foreign policy and the role of politics and personality in shaping them? Here are my takeaways: <br> Apples and oranges <br> To a large degree, the two decisions taken today represent totally different situations. The action on the Paris accord is strategic and is likely to have profound consequences for US credibility and diplomacy, not to mention the future of the planet in the years to come. <br> Coming on the heels of Trump's disastrous European tour, the American retreat from an agreement that includes 195 nations will call into question Washington's reliability as an ally and partner, not just on climate change but on any number of other matters. <br> The US now has the distinction, along with Syria and Nicaragua, of being one of three countries outside of the agreement, and that's not good company. And US withdrawal removes the moral and practical leverage America might have exercised on other nations to maintain their obligations and commitments. Many might argue that had the US remained, the Trump administration would have undermined the accord from within. But, clearly, being at the table would still have been preferable to not being there at all. <br> The decision to exercise the waiver on opening an embassy in Jerusalem, on the other hand, was tactical. The President sought a Solomonic fix: waive, but in his explanation repeat, his campaign commitment that at some point the embassy would be opened in Jerusalem. <br> In comparison to withdrawal from the climate change agreement, the Jerusalem matter can be reversed at the President's discretion. No damage was done. Had he broken precedent with his three predecessors and not exercised the waiver, the impact would have been much more serious; and like withdrawal from the Paris accord, would have had a significant negative impact on an important foreign policy issue -- the pursuit of Arab-Israel peace. Indeed, it would have augured badly for the success of an issue with which Mr. Trump is increasingly identified. <br> Is campaigning governing? <br> On many issues it is. Presidents run for office and get elected on the basis of commitments they make to their supporters. But on other issues, what was said during a campaign fades away or is adroitly finessed. <br> The two decisions the President made raise the intriguing question of why on foreign policy Mr. Trump has kept certain commitments and not others. He said he'd tear up the Iran deal -- "the worst deal ever" -- and he hasn't; he said he'd go after China as a currency manipulator; he hasn't; he said he'd withdraw or at least reshape an obsolete NATO; he didn't; and of course, on the promise to open an embassy in Jerusalem, he just used the waiver. <br> Since there doesn't appear to be an ideological dimension to much of what Mr. Trump does on foreign policy, one can only assume that a combination of factors -- including advice from his foreign policy team; (James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, H.R. McMaster, Jared Kushner); conversations with foreign leaders (China's President Xi Jinping; King Abdullah of Jordan; the Saudis); reality (the immediate negative consequences that certain decisions might produce for his administration); and his own instincts combined to persuade him to change his mind. Clearly, that was the case on the Jerusalem embassy issue. <br> Politics and personality <br> And just as clearly, that was not the case on the climate change issue. It seems doubtful that Mr. Trump is ideologically opposed to action to prevent global warming. And the decision to withdraw from the accord was reportedly a hotly contested one within his administration, right up to the last moment. <br> One explanation is that rejection of the Democrats' climate change policies -- like immigration and building the wall -- is an issue that resonates deeply with his "forgotten man" constituency; one that he repeatedly talked about in the campaign; one that he'd have a difficult time explaining away if he didn't fulfill it; and one that is somehow associated with his predecessor. <br> The President is reacting against the elites, the idea of a global community and the notion that each nation in the international system has a stake in one another's success. Indeed, of all the decisions on the foreign policy side since he became president, none better signals that America first is -- at least on climate change -- America only. <br> Indeed, the Paris agreement was viewed as one of Barack Obama's signature achievements and one of which he was proudest. In Trumpland, differentiating his administration -- or seeming to -- from his predecessor is good politics and creates the sense that Mr. Trump is not only reversing his predecessor's achievements but transforming the way America does business. <br> Finally, unlike the embassy issue, from Mr. Trump's perspective, the climate change challenge is a distant and abstract matter and doesn't really impact his here and now, though much of the world disagrees with him. The Jerusalem embassy issue on the other hand is key to Trump's commitment to cut the ultimate Middle East peace deal which is now inextricably linked to him. <br> When it comes to President Trump, it's impossible to ignore the personal dimension in the style and substance of his governing. Withdrawing from Paris is, to be sure, consistent with his politics and his policies: but it's also congruent with his persona. <br> As a self-described master of negotiations, Trump believes that his predecessor negotiated a series of bad deals -- from Iran to Cuba to climate change. And he feels that the Paris deal in particular has left America as a laughingstock. The not so subtle message is that President Trump would have negotiated a better deal.
Sadly, the Justice Department, now led by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is unlikely to tackle this issue. <br> A top student and athlete, Edwards, 15, was shot to death when a police officer fired his rifle into a car in the Dallas suburb. The officer was later terminated. <br> This comes as the Justice Department has refused to charge two police officers in the July 5, 2016, convenience store shooting of Sterling. A bystander's video showed police pinning Sterling to the ground before shooting him. <br> The Sterling case marks the first high-profile police shooting decision made under Sessions' watch. And it appears as if Sessions' pro-police, law-and-order philosophy is already starting to influence the way decisions are made in his department. <br> So we shouldn't hold our breath waiting for the attorney general to press charges in the death of Edwards -- or anyone killed by the police, for that matter. <br> Sessions' supporters say he has changed since those allegations were made against him in the 1980s, but many -- myself included -- are still suspect. <br> During the 2016 campaign, Sessions was a devoted cheerleader for then-candidate Trump's law and order, stop-and-frisk platform. Despite his controversial record, Sessions was confirmed for the position of America's top prosecutor by the Senate. <br> Sessions said he believes these consent decrees lower police morale, and he opposes the federal government's role in "dictating to local police how to do their jobs -- or spending scarce federal resources to sue them in court." <br> But problems policing in America is not a matter of a few bad apples, as Sessions suggests, but a systemic issue in police culture and law enforcement practices. These tragic, senseless incidents, such as the killing of Jordan Edwards and Alton Sterling, are a reminder of this reality. And there are likely to be more, particularly if police feel they will not be prosecuted for using excessive or unwarranted force. <br> There is no reason to believe that Sessions will do anything to reform plagued police departments, hold them accountable to the public or seek justice for the victims of police violence. Despite his image as being pro-police, he serves neither the police nor the communities they serve when he normalizes the festering wounds of police brutality and misconduct and the longstanding mistreatment of communities of color. <br> When innocent, unarmed honor students are shot, we have a problem. <br> But the new attorney general will not solve this problem -- he will only make it worse, largely because he does not believe a problem exists.
Neighbors were troubled: her altar didn't contain a normal Catholic saint but a skeleton in a dress -- Saint Death, or Santa Muerte. <br> Nevertheless, the service attracted hundreds of strangers. Thousands of people visit Tepito every day to go shopping, and Queta's house is near the subway. <br> As Mexico City's central market for illegal merchandise, Tepito offers miracles of consumerism, afternoons of respite from the grind of economic exclusion. <br> For the same reasons, it is well trodden by crime reporters, whose reporting on the oddity at Queta's house helped the crowd grow to thousands. <br> When you see this crowd in pictures, everyone carrying skeletons in colorful robes, it might look weird or menacing. <br> Even some Mexico City residents can find it all too exotic, and their view is usually colored by a rumor that Santa Muerte is a "narco saint." <br> Yet the prayers the devotees come to hear are as old as Christianity, familiar and reassuring to those raised Catholic -- even if clergy members abhor the added details. <br> From across this city of 20-some million, the subway brings Santa Muerte fans into Tepito, and they in turn bring ideas and gestures as diverse as Mexico's regions, with certain commonalities. <br> They arrive carrying statues from home, and sometimes sacks full of presents -- apples, cigarettes, party favors. Some distribute scrolls of paper tied with ribbons, bearing photocopied prayers and testimonials written in longhand. In the hour before the rosary, passing out presents is the main event, a carryover from ordinary parish festivals. <br> There are differences, though. This exchange of gifts can tell us something about who the devotees are and what they value, if we look at the rosary and its prayers first. <br> What do they pray for? Like at any church, there's an array of personal problems, including the ones people would rather not specify. <br> But the formal service, pieced together by Queta in the early years, crystallized around five themes she kept overhearing: unemployment, imprisonment, medical crisis, addiction, and being "mixed up with the wrong crowd." <br> Prayers for the prisoners directly acknowledge that worldly judgment is defective: "We pray for those who justly or unjustly groan behind bars; please help the rightly convicted find you, and show the falsely convicted a way out; put a fair judge in their path." <br> Between repetitions of the Lord's Prayer, the constant refrain here is also the most common citywide, appearing on T-shirts and medals: "Santa Muerte, please don't take away your protection (no me desampares de tu protección)." <br> Concern with protection, and with losing it, unifies the devotion, and suggests a way of looking back at the flow of gifts. <br> The little scrolls recount people's experiences finding themselves without "protections." <br> A few are pleas for information, circulated by families of loved ones who have gone missing. They hope for tips, since the authorities have found nothing. <br> Others thank her for resolving some bureaucratic impasse. <br> The majority tell of patients turned away from public hospitals, or who were victims of malpractice, and who would have died, if not for the Santa Muerte. <br> All add depth to the theme of "dis-protection," or desamparo. There are failures of the justice system, the health system, the official church, even failures of old-fashioned protection rackets. <br> Into the breach walks Death herself. And who could be better qualified? Of all the known authorities, she has the only decent record of impartiality: she comes for us all, rich or poor. <br> Along with objects meant to be placed on the recipient's home altar, small services are also given freely. The gathering is attended by babalaos, priests representing Santería, an African diaspora tradition that comes via the Caribbean. <br> Dressed in white, they offer special purifications of people's statuettes using cigar smoke. Others, with little money to spend, get in on the joy of giving by splashing tequila on random passing statuettes, or spraying them with a scented spray. The attitude is warmth toward strangers. <br> The widest net of inclusion involves artwork made by prisoners, who can help support their families by making tiny carvings of Santa Muerte of leftover bones from stew. People value the pieces for the suffering they contain, and gladly commission them, no questions asked. <br> Gift-giving like this happens at parish festivals, but members of a parish usually know each other. Here, by some tacit rule, anonymity is maintained. This is partly because of the rumor that devotees are violent. The average Santa Muerte devotee is, in fact, not violent, though many have witnessed violence. <br> But the average devotee also can't rule out the possibility that other people in the crowd harbor bad intentions. These hours of inclusion and generosity require a suspension of mistrust. <br> The gospels describe how Christ fed a multitude with almost nothing. One interpretation of the miracle of the fishes and the loaves leans toward sociology: the real miracle was that he got strangers to trust each other and stop hoarding. For many centuries, a wide array of Christian gatherings have gently reminded believers of that lesson. <br> At the Tepito rosary, people stop fearing each other long enough to be kind: to transsexuals maligned by the church, sex workers abused by the law, absent prisoners, even individuals they suspect would be dangerous on any other day. <br> Their recognition is granted, oddly enough, by way of anonymity. Outlaws and the excommunicated are recognized as children of God and Santa Muerte through a common experience of "dis-protection." <br> Confessed Catholics participate -- fully aware that the Catholic leaders condemn Santa Muerte. <br> According to the official doctrine, Christ overcame Death -- and these people appear to worship Death. <br> But there is an alternative reading, one that Mexico City Catholics are often willing to consider. <br> In a way, the gathering expresses Catholic values, consciously or unconsciously, by honoring a fellowship of the "dis-protected." <br> Standing in the crowd during the gift-giving, you could even ask yourself whether it's a revival of old-fashioned reasons for sharing with strangers.
March 2017 is the first March of my life that I've had to be reminded of Persian New Year. <br> It happened at my local dog park in Harlem, on an unseasonably hot day, as my standard poodle buddied up to an old Siberian husky. The owner and I broke into the usual dog-talk. Dog names first, then ours. I said my name slowly, though it came out softer than I hoped, and I searched the woman's eyes -- something I have caught myself doing again recently, decades since my early days of refugee anxiety, when I'd first come to America with my family on political asylum from Iran. <br> She didn't blink. Instead, she said, "Beautiful name, what is it?" I'd heard that sentence my whole life, so I blurted it out with rehearsed confidence: "Iranian." <br> Between us, a mess of ellipses, the sound of basketballs on courts, some distant siren, a tangle of dog barks. Then another classic: "What does it mean?" And my usual: "It's an ancient Zoroastrian name, an unusual one for Iranians." <br> I thought to explain that I'm of Muslim background, but instead I just hoped for the awkward parting of people whose only connection is canines. She looked deep in thought and I thought maybe she felt sorry for me -- Iranian in a time of Trump's Muslim Ban, after all -- but maybe she felt her own discomfort. <br> She cut into my ruminations with a question I didn't expect: "Isn't your New Year coming soon?" <br> Her knowledge was surprising, but I was astounded more than anything by the realization that I'd forgotten this holiday of holidays, on Monday this year. I gave the stranger a flustered "thank you." <br> By the time I got back to my apartment I was deep in that complicated cold sweat I used to know well. <br> How did that stranger know that? Why did she want to talk to me? What did that stranger really think? A pause. What exactly am I afraid of today? <br> A time of beauty, hope and optimism <br> Persian New Year, or Nowruz, is a celebration of spring. It falls at the time of the vernal equinox (which shifts in accordance with axial precession). Weeks before it happens, every Iranian I know excitedly looks up the time online and plans a day around it. This is not a holiday we take lightly. <br> The celebration is many thousands of years old with roots in ancient Indo-Persian culture, a religion some say the prophet Zoroaster himself created. Meaning "new day," its spiritual origin has extended to secular appreciation by all sorts of people who can claim some ancient Persian origin, including, of course, modern-day Iranians. <br> These days, many Instagram accounts all over the world have turned Nowruz traditions into cult obsessions. Nothing makes for a good photo like the table-setting "haftsin," an arrangement of seven foods beginning with S: sprouts ("sabzeh"), wheat pudding ("samanu"), dried oleaster ("senjed"), garlic ("sir"), apples ("sib"), vinegar ("serkeh") and sumac fruit ("sumac"). All this is skirted with spring paraphernalia like candies, eggs, mirrors, flowers and even goldfish. One could argue Iranians worship beauty even more than Americans, and it's never more apparent than in Nowruz aesthetics. <br> My favorite memories of Nowruz involve me trying to derail my mother's efforts in beautifying our Nowruz best she could. The profound mischief of altering the haftsin without my parents noticing was a great goal of mine—one time, at age 6 or 7, I tried to drown a hairless Barbie in the goldfish bowl. Often I'd try to pollute the immaculate individual haftsin bowls with Cheerios and MMs, anything obviously American. <br> But I also relished all the cultural "abnormalities" that could feel like American transgressions -- for instance, my parents waking us up in the middle of the night on a school night to celebrate "tahvileh sal," the exact moment of equinox, a given ritual no matter what horrible hour it came. <br> We grew up with few luxuries, so I usually felt so excited that Nowruz was also a time of treats. All Nowruz's symbolic purification talk was exciting for me as it meant we were to wear new clothes that day -- and that meant a mall visit, during which I could make a case for some impractical Wet Seal creation ("We have to do it for Persia!" I'd cry, waving some lacy tube top on sale). And all sorts of luxurious-seeming foods entered our lives then and only then too. The Persian cookies (walnut, chickpea, almond, rice) from the Persian grocery stores in LA's "Little Persia" were my favorite. Later, in college, my parents sent care packages full of them and I boasted to friends that these were Persian comfort foods. <br> Most of all, in my youth I believed Nowruz might have the power to eclipse the other darknesses of my homeland that played nonstop on television and in the news. I hoped the imagery of beauty and hope and optimism could mean something more: maybe Americans could see themselves in it all. <br> Family old and new <br> This year, Nowruz falls at half past six in morning for me. I've never been the best early riser but I know the hour well these days; since the election, my nights are a mess of anxiety-induced insomnia keeping me up close to dawn. Then, early in the morning, my dog has taken to waking me up with a sermon of barks -- something he never did before. <br> I soon realize my 110-unit turn-of-the-century Harlem building has had its share of early morning visitors in uniform. Different neighbors give me different numbers on our building's deportations, while another neighbor tells me not to talk about any of this. My building happens to be mostly Muslim -- brown, black, and white Muslim -- and is located close to several prominent mosques, one of the reasons I've loved living here. But in the hallway my neighbors and I wonder what others are saying. In hushed tones we curse the casual and constant bigotry of this administration, just as we beg each other to take good care. <br> We residents have become closer since the Paris Attacks last year, when police presence in this neighborhood ramped up noticeably. Before that, many of us didn't know where we stood, who we were -- you can't always tell who is Muslim, after all. None of our names sounded it, none of us fit that profile Islamophobes have -- the maintenance guy from Montenegro, the waitress of Lebanese origin, the Turkish couple, the Egyptian siblings, the old black Muslim families who've been in Harlem for decades, the other Iranian woman who is a student where I teach. And of course, me, who passes for everything, with the additional complication of a Zoroastrian name. <br> For the last few years, I've been joking I'm a Secret Muslim. Iranian nationalism and exceptionalism always steered my father -- the man who named me "Porochista," after Zoroaster's daugher -- far away from discussions of Islam. Nowruz was always a time for my father to wave his Iranian flag (the one with the lion and sword, not the Islamic Republic one), to color-copy and frame Persepolis photos from library books, to present me and my brother with fake gold Zoroastrian-iconographic pins. "The great Persian empire!" he'd cry in our tiny moldy apartment with the decaying carpet, surrounded by sometimes-hostile neighbors. <br> That same father took us to Zoroastrian temples in Orange County for years. I never understood why we got such dirty looks until I was past my teens and realized we'd only been religious tourists at their temple. We were never Zoroastrian, and we couldn't be. The religion was dying -- some say less than 150,000 remain -- because you have to be born into it. Still, its old traditions, like Nowruz, have retained their influence in cultures of the region. Muslim Iranians tend to look to Zoroastrianism with pride. <br> But when my father sought to gild my identity with a Zoroastrian name, it wasn't out of simple pride; it took me years to realize that maybe he thought it was protection from all sorts of futures. When he'd hush my late grandmother as she recited Quran verses in public, maybe it wasn't out of shame for his actual cultural origins -- maybe he just didn't trust Americans to hear it. <br> Just as I try to let go of Nowruz, it comes <br> This year, once Nowruz announced itself to me, I wanted to forget it. Even in my circle of Iranian friends in New York I hear us beginning to plan but thinking twice in a way we never did before. "Not in the mood," one friend tells me. "Not in the mood," I tell another friend. And I think about how my parents and I are barely in contact right now -- all of us locked in our own suffering, fear not bringing us together at all. <br> Naturalized at 23, I think about how my birthplace is still on that passport, in those bold letters: Iran. I think about my father back home in LA with only a green card. I think about all the old traumas (the racial slurs my family and I endured when we first came to this country in the early 1980s) and the usual traumas (all the times I've been pulled aside at airports) and the new waves of traumas (daily online harassment, like the time the poet on Facebook, friends with 222 of mine, told me to "go back to whatever Third World shithole you come from"). <br> I try to imagine skipping Nowruz altogether; I try to imagine giving in to grief as an opportunity to meditate on the horrors of this era. But it's hard to commit to even a lack of commitment these days, not knowing what will happen next. <br> Just as I try to let go of Nowruz, it comes for me. It starts when a neighbor's card appears by my door: "Happy 1396, we are with you," it says in cursive. Later I find myself scrolling through the Instagram accounts of families in Tehran and I marvel at their haftsin skills, and catch myself dreaming of a last-minute gathering. <br> At the dog park, still covered in March snow, the old stranger with the husky appears again, and we chat about the promise of new blooms, our worries of climate change, the complications that separate and connect us. Happy New Year, we say to each other, Nowruz Mobarak. She reveals to me she taught in Iran long ago, and I realize she knows the hospital where I was born and has been to my mother's hometown, that she remembers skiing on a day like this in our mountains. <br> We walk together and laugh at how our dogs can't stop licking the mounds of gray city ice that have a way to go until they are gone, but finally show signs of melting. <br> Nowruz is here, Nowruz has come. You can only stop a New Day so much.
With the nation divided and protests already occurring around President Donald Trump's inauguration, it might seem that now is a good time to avoid large public gatherings. But Saturday's Women's March on Washington is resolutely aimed at being a peaceful and meaningful demonstration against discrimination and hatred. Given this, it is important that none of us let a few bad apples deter us from participating. <br> For those planning to attend, whether in Washington or any of the cities where marches and rallies are being held, here are some tips to help you and your family stay safe -- remaining vigilant and assured in your own preparedness for whatever unexpected circumstances may get thrown your way. <br> 1. Preparedness and a plan <br> There are some basics that are all too easy to forget: Drink plenty of water; wear appropriate, comfortable shoes; make sure you apply sunscreen, even if the forecast calls for clouds, the sun's rays will affect you. These steps may seem minor, but they will make what is sure to be a long day more manageable. <br> Lay in some situational awareness. Before you arrive at the event, study the route, know which roads are closed, where crowds will be gathering beforehand for the rally and where the march itself will take you through the city. Does your spouse have trouble walking long distances? Remember that you may be on your feet for a long time. Take these things into account. <br> One more thing: be sure to know what your kids are wearing -- even take a picture of them-- in case they get lost and you need to ask authorities to help you find them. <br> 2. Designate a destination point <br> Organizers and DC officials are anticipating big crowds, so there is a high chance your group could get split up, especially if you have older kids who want to be independent and explore. Set a destination point and a time to regroup afterward. <br> 3. Assume no cell <br> Either because in an emergency public safety officials take over some bandwidth or simply because service may be congested with so much activity, assume that cell phones will not be as operational as usual. Plan accordingly and use the previously planned meetup point as a fail-safe destination if you get split up. It's also a good idea, especially if you're attending with younger children, not to get distracted on your cell. It only takes a few seconds of lapsed attention to lose track of a small child in a crowd of this size. <br> 4. Go with the crowd <br> Keep tabs on your personal space and be ready to maintain it or adjust it in a crush. If you feel the crowd getting too dense for comfort, get out before it gets worse. If it's not possible to get out immediately, try to conserve your energy (don't shout or shove!) and don't let your arms get pinned to the side. Keep firm, well-spread footing (that's where good shoes come into play again) and keep your arms close to your chest. <br> Don't resist the force of the crowd. Similar to a rip tide, the rush of the crowd will be stronger than your chance of withstanding it, so try to go with the flow as you look for openings (moments of stillness) to weave in and out of the surge in a diagonal, stop-and-go motion. <br> The most important thing you need to do while you're trying to get out of a crowd is to avoid falling -- and to keep those around you from falling as well. If someone near you goes down don't just ignore the situation, take the lead and lend a helping hand. <br> 5. Don't be a martyr <br> There is a chance that individuals will be in attendance to express their own free speech in opposition to the march. Stay focused and stay positive. Heed the wisdom of our former first lady, "If they go low, you go high." A successful march will be one fueled by passionate, peaceful protest, not physical altercation or mass violence. There will be no victory in starting trouble for the sake of starting trouble. <br> Stick to the march and stay on message. And, above all, be safe.
I am so sorry that the world I've brought you into is one in which not only is Donald Trump possible, but possibly the next President of the United States. I had hoped that by this point in history, we would be better than this. Apparently, we're not. <br> You know some of what Donald Trump has said and done in this campaign. You hear it on the news, kids talk about it at school. "I hate Donald Trump," you said the other day during breakfast. Please don't. Don't hate one sad man with a lot of power and little self-restraint. And don't hate the people who are enthusiastically supporting him. Donald Trump is running a campaign of hate, and hate cannot be solved by hate but by empathy and understanding. <br> It is important for you to understand what Donald Trump represents. He is a mirror reflecting a dark and dangerous part of our history that, whether we like it or not, is in all of us. So I want you to understand the part we've all played, whether we meant to or not, in giving rise to Donald Trump. <br> Our nation was born of genocide. Before there was even a glimmer of anything called America, there were millions of native peoples living all across this land. But to make way for our white forebears, the native people were slaughtered. Ever since, the idea of who "we" are as white Americans has been defined in perpetual opposition to some threatening, non-belonging "them." This is not new. It is our national DNA. <br> But white Americans rationalized the slaughter of native people who they saw as lesser -- as "savages" not quite as human as the colonizers themselves. This same "logic" was applied to rationalize slavery -- that people from Africa were somehow inherently less than the white European Americans and, therefore, it made perfect sense for the one to subjugate and oppress the other. Even after the abolition of slavery, the persistent belief in the inferiority of black Americans led to decades of enforced segregation and violent oppression -- as it still leads to injustice today. <br> When you look back on this horrid history, it's important you understand that slave holders and segregationists and those who defended inequality did not think they were doing anything uniquely wrong. In fact, for the most part they believed their actions to be just. The same is true of those supporting intolerance and inequality today. Mass injustice doesn't result from a "few bad apples," but from the mass of people willfully supporting injustice. <br> There was a time in our history when sexual assault was not even a concept, let alone a crime. So too, the lynching of black men and women was often ignored or even actively encouraged by our leaders and their laws. There is no doubt that we have made progress since then, but not nearly enough. I remain desperate to protect you from a society that quietly but habitually tells you that as a girl, you're not equal to boys -- that you're more valued for your body than your brains, that you don't deserve the same opportunities let alone the same basic respect. And the truth is, black men and women are still treated vastly differently under our laws and in our communities. As you grow up, it will be easier for you to get into college and get a job and buy a home than it will be for your black friends. That's not because you will have earned it more or deserve it more, but because our society thinks less of people who aren't white. At the same time, you will be less likely to be harassed in stores or stopped by police, let alone shot and killed based on nothing but the suspicion that we unconsciously attach to dark skin. This isn't something for you to feel guilty about. This is something for you to help change. <br> Still, even in the face of this imperfect history, I was under the illusion that we had all progressed further than it turns out we have. As the arc of our history has bent, however haltingly, toward justice, most Americans grew to actively reject overt sexism and racism and other kinds of discrimination, and at least aspire to fight against the unconscious biases that still haunt our lives. <br> Despite this, a not insignificant fraction of Americans, even today, see the equal treatment of women and people of color as a bad thing. They believe that if others get more opportunity, they will get less. These Americans see themselves as history's rightful owners of opportunity. When they talk about wanting to "Make America Great Again," the "better times" they evoke may have seemed better for white Americans, but they were eras of torment and torture for people of color and, often, women as well. Always be wary of anyone who promises a better future by going backwards. The future by definition aspires toward progress. <br> Our progress as a nation is something you can be proud of. As you grow up, it's important you understand more and more about the dark parts of America's history, but also the bright moments where we moved forward. Once upon a time in our nation, black people were the legal property of white people and only white men could vote. We changed all that. Our history has progressed imperfectly, but make no mistake about it, it has progressed -- and that simple but glorious fact should always give you hope. Do not let those fighting against this progress convince you that they are the only ones who love their country. Fighting to make our nation more inclusive and more just is one of the highest forms of patriotism I can imagine. If you always fight for fairness and justice, you will make me proud and you will make our country proud. You will be a bright light in our nation's still-unfolding story. <br> All of this may be too hard for you to understand right now. After all, you're only eight years old. But I know you understand the difference between right from wrong. And I know that you know the things Donald Trump has said about Mexicans and veterans and Muslims and women are wrong. More importantly, you know that what he stands for is wrong -- a narrow vision of America that promises opportunity for some through the oppression of others. That "logic" shaped the mistakes of our nation's past. I pray every night it will not shape our future. <br> You've said that if Donald Trump wins, you want to move to India. I'm afraid to tell you that the current prime minister of India isn't much better than Trump. But more importantly, no matter what happens on Election Day, we will stay and fight for justice. If Trump wins and does the things he has promised, we will not only march in the streets, but we will use our bodies to stop his forces from entering mosques or raiding homes of immigrants. And if Trump does not win, we will still need to fight -- against the strains of intolerance and hate that still course consciously and unconsciously through each of our minds and our entire nation. If Trump is defeated, there is much work to be done to ensure that another Trump does not rise. <br> On November 8, I will take you with me to vote. And together we will vote to elect Hillary Clinton the first woman president in the 227-year history of the U.S. presidency. And with that choice we will also vote to uplift the best of America's values. With every fiber of our beings, we will continue to vote and speak and write and march and do whatever we can to uphold and uplift justice and inclusion and fairness and kindness and equal opportunity for all. <br> I cannot promise you that these values will always govern every moment of our nation's future, just as they clearly failed at times in our past. But I can promise you that I will fight for a world and a country that is, at its core, as loving and generous and beautiful as you are. I will fight for the world that you and all children deserve. Electing Hillary Clinton and defeating Donald Trump is just one step. Onward.
A host of questions remain unanswered. For starters: How is it possible that Wells Fargo employees could cheat customers for at least five years? Why wasn't it stopped sooner? What is Wells Fargo doing to fix its problems, including making these customers whole? And what additional safeguards are needed to prevent this kind of extraordinary fraud from happening again? <br> Preventing another scam of this magnitude requires insisting on real accountability from those who allowed it to happen, and perhaps even encouraged it. Wells Fargo's leadership still hasn't said who is ultimately responsible for the practices, aggressive sales culture and lack of controls that led its employees to open millions of accounts without customers' knowledge. <br> True, Wells Fargo fired thousands of tellers and other front-line employees over the scandal -- people earning modest hourly wages of $12 or $15 an hour -- but the "bad apples" excuse won't cut it in this case. A business cannot have 5,300 employees nationwide engaged in illegal behavior without management knowing or looking the other way. <br> It's no wonder the people of Ohio are writing to my office, demanding more accountability. Wells Fargo has the responsibility to impose real consequences by clawing back bonuses when abuse like this occurs. <br> As one Ohioan who wrote me put it, "our laws have to have real teeth that hurt," in order to stop this type of fraud. <br> That means making the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has forced financial companies to pay more than $440 million in civil penalties and returned almost $12 billion to US consumers in its five-year existence, stronger in its pursuit of bad actors. <br> The Wells Fargo scandal is another reminder of how dangerous our banking system can be without strong oversight and protections. Yet, too many in Washington seem to have collective amnesia about the abuses that led to the Great Recession and enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act in the first place. <br> The special interests and their allies in Washington may have moved on from the financial crisis, but the hundreds of thousands of consumers abused by Wells Fargo don't have that luxury. And neither do the millions of Americans who lost their homes or watched their savings shrink when they paid the price for Wall Street's risky bets. <br> The Wells Fargo debacle is a stark reminder that Wall Street abuses can take many forms. We can't afford to take our eyes off the ball. 
The reality is that by injecting themselves into the American presidential campaign by criticizing a candidate in the highly political arena of the Democratic National Convention, the Khan family opened itself up to some pushback from the target of their criticism. <br> So while the Khans themselves first politicized the death of their own son by wading into political waters, Trump should have resisted his usual propensity to go for the jugular and personally attack those who have criticized him politically. <br> And while the way in which Trump launched his counterattack against the Khans can be legitimately criticized, we should not consider it taboo to criticize people who have lost a son or daughter in military action -- especially when those parents are essentially leveraging that death to take a political stance on an unrelated issue. <br> After all, unlike during the Vietnam War period, the United States does not have a conscription law that involuntarily drags young Americans against their will to fight in faraway hellholes. Humayun Khan, the Khans' son, volunteered to serve in a U.S. military that since World War II has spent its time on conducting distant imperial adventures rather than simply defending the country, its people, and its freedoms. <br> Fast forward to today, and the overblown furor over Trump's inartful counterpunch has obscured the candidate's momentous comments about terrorism at the Republican National Convention. Although Trump's anti-terrorism policy needs some work (like repudiating his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, which he has already watered down), he has been the first major American politician to seemingly reach the impolitic (but true) conclusion that the United States would have less blowback from terrorism if it refrained from trying to meddle in other nations' affairs by a policy of regime change and nation building. <br> ISIS has had to resort to inspiring attacks because they have difficulty reaching the faraway United States, which in any event has fewer unintegrated and radicalized Muslims. In contrast, countries in Europe -- France, Germany, and Belgium -- are a lot closer to Middle Eastern and African zones of conflict and have more directly felt the consequences of U.S.-led military interventions in Iraq and Syria, in which they are also participating. <br> It is, of course, unfortunate that Trump regularly obscures the legitimate issues he raises by using personal attacks that invoke unfavorable stereotypes. But that should not overshadow the fact that sometimes, including in his wariness of foreign intervention, he has a point.
It seems smug to put it this way, but I will give Donald Trump credit for one thing: bathrooms. <br> It's not an undercut. On the issue of legislating transgender bathrooms --and maybe only on this issue, if you ask me -- Trump is completely right, and his rival Ted Cruz completely wrong. <br> I'm not sure how seriously Trump has contemplated this very controversial, thorny issue. Suffice it to say, it's likely that his position, which is that transgender people like Caitlin Jenner should be able to use whichever gender bathroom they want, was not informed by any deep philosophical contemplation of free societies or identity politics, nor by the limits of the Constitution or the role of the states. <br> (Again, not being smug ... I'm confident this is the case because when pressed later on his position, he walked it back slightly to say that this should be decided by the states and not the federal government, which is perplexing since the controversial laws we're talking about were passed ... by states.) <br> Rather, it's likely that, like most of Trump's "policies," this one was cooked up in about two minutes, in between a bite of NY strip steak and a swig of Sprite, and is based on nothing more than the chaotic machinations of Trump's bombastic inner monologue. <br> It should matter -- when picking a plumber or a President -- how a person arrives at a conclusion. And that Trump spit out his verdict with the careful contemplation of a carnival fortune teller machine should matter. <br> But regardless, it's important to acknowledge when even the least responsible thought process still produces the right conclusion. Maybe that tells us something about Trump's gut, or his worldview or his humanity. <br> So forgetting how he got here, let's acknowledge that Trump's position is sane, logical and -- perhaps most notably -- divorced from the cultural persuasions of either his adopted political party or many of his supporters. <br> For one, on its face, laws that prohibit a transgendered male-to-female from using a public women's restroom are totally unenforceable. Trump's famously overly-simplified approach to issues -- Build a wall! Bomb the s--t out of them! Ban them all! -- is probably helpful here. Are we going to arrest people for choosing the wrong restroom? Are we going to post a police officer outside every public restroom? Are they going to look for Adam's apples or breasts? Or will guards ask outright what a person's gender is? This is, in a word, absurd. <br> For another -- and this is the argument Trump would make if he were at all fluent in conservative political thought -- it is entirely UN-conservative to essentially grow the government to support an outsized Big Brother police state that will monitor our bathroom trips. This is the stuff of Orwell, not Locke. <br> It's also a solution in search of a problem, as Trump noted. Is there an epidemic of trans agitators exploiting their adopted genders to invade women's restrooms and do untoward stuff to young girls? If so, I missed all the paranoia over non-trans men sneaking into women's bathrooms, and doing untoward stuff to young girls. What is to stop any man from walking into a public ladies' room in the first place? <br> The arguments for such legislation are, in short, entirely fabricated, a cultural and political invention used to stoke public fear, pledge fealty to a cartoonish, far-right totem of morality, and stand athwart some imagined political correctness. <br> This, it should be noted, is how Ted Cruz arrived at his conclusion. And that matters, too. <br> The real question is what Trump's supporters will think. Do they agree that Caitlin Jenner should be able to pop into a stall next to their daughters? Or do they think these laws are right -- and Trump is wrong?
He contained multitudes, flouted convention and ruled his world. <br> He was a physically small person who spoke softly and still dominated every room he inhabited. At any given moment, he could brandish the contents of his "dirty mind" without apology or explanation and, in the next moment, convey the power of religious faith with the righteous conviction of an evangelical firebrand. <br> His eyes were deep dark pools that devoured your resistance -- and prepared you for anything. <br> James Brown and Joni Mitchell were his idols and, under their seemingly disparate influences, he could throw down the thickest, hardest grooves of any rhythm-and-blues musician of his generation while weaving some of the most enigmatic, indelible imagery in pop music. (I hear doves cry as I write this, but they don't make up even an eighth of the memories swarming in front of me.) <br> He got under people's skins even while he seemed to keep them at a distance. His devotees took his impudence for an invitation. The weirder and more outrageous he got, the more convinced people were of his honesty. "He tells the truth," a teddy-wearing fan in Philadelphia told me when I asked why she devoted Thanksgiving Day 1984 to his concert -- and her waking life to his music. <br> When writing about Prince Rogers Nelson, whose death at 57 seems to have shaken the whole universe to its knees, you becomes aware after a while that you're compiling an inventory of contradictions, all of which he wore with as much nonchalant swagger as the electric-purple, gold-fringed tunics he wore in the mid-'80s, when he was at or very near his peak as a pop star. <br> This was when most of the squares calling shots in the mainstream media wasted their time straining to compare Prince to Michael Jackson, to whose dominion as unofficial "King of Pop" Prince seemed to be the only legitimate threat, especially after both the movie and album "Purple Rain" seized the zeitgeist's attention away from the mercurial Jackson. <br> Apples and oranges, we insisted whenever such direct comparisons were made. Jackson's artistry may have been as boundary breaching and galvanic in impact as Prince's and they both knew their way around the blues-and-soul block. But Prince went to places MJ never did; some dark and forbidding, others erotic and cathartic. Jackson could inspire poetry; Prince wrote "Raspberry Beret," "Erotic City," and (insert guitar lick here) "Kiss," among many, many others. <br> A far better comparison to be made -- really -- is with Miles Davis. As with that willful, shape-shifting jazz giant, Prince was an inscrutable chameleon, rigid only in his unwillingness to keep to a single course, artistically and otherwise. At one point, he was willing to risk the oceans of good will he summoned from the public by insisting he be referred to by an arcane symbol I've never been able to find on my keyboard. <br> It didn't matter. As was the case with Davis, everywhere Prince went, millions followed. <br> Why? Ask why people read great books. (Something Prince once encouraged while handing out a Grammy.) There was always, in Prince's life and work, a reason to keep turning the page to find out what happens next. We all figured that someone who so resolutely followed the path he cleared for himself, leaving gleaming paradoxes and thundering guitar riffs in his wake, had to be in on some universal secret, some as-yet-unknowable key to finding harmony in discord, illumination in darkness, constancy in chaos, something that, when you put all the craziness together, came close to that truth my fan friend talked about more than 30 years ago. <br> The book is now closed before we could find out more. And we feel cheated, bereft -- and lonelier, somehow, than we were when he was always around. 
 After that evidence emerged, the independent prosecutor and the local solicitor, who filed more charges against the paralyzed man based on the word of the cops who had wrongly said the man shot at them, were not moved enough to call a press conference to explain the discrepancies -- even though they had spoken publicly months earlier to claim the officers did nothing wrong and the man was a bad guy. <br> In Baltimore, a jury deliberated this week over the fate of the first of six officers charged in the Freddie Gray case. Gray died after suffering a severe spinal injury while in police custody, sparking massive protests and rioting. It's rare that the officers were charged; it would be rarer still if any or all of them are convicted. On Wednesday, the jury was deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial. <br> Truth be told, though, is that we don't have to rely upon that kind of analysis. Police officers have already told us why this keeps happening: because they allow it to. It begs the question: Why are so many cops -- good cops -- seemingly comfortable with wrongdoing in their midst? It's as though in their eyes, evil is only evil when it wears a bandana, not when it wears a badge. <br> They wouldn't tolerate a gang member executing a man in the middle of a street or kicking a man in his face while he's on his hands and knees. But they seem unmoved when a fellow officer does it. <br> Juries and prosecutors and political leaders frequently go along with that thinking, which sends a clear, chilling message to communities that already fear and distrust the police, that they have nothing to lose if an encounter with an officer goes badly because their version of events won't be believed, and those who harm them won't be brought to justice anyway, so why not resist? <br> What's more, "a substantial minority believed that officers should be permitted to use more force than the law currently permits and found it acceptable to sometimes use more force than permitted by the laws that govern them." <br> From the study: "Even though most police officers disapprove of the use of excessive force, a substantial minority consider it acceptable to sometimes use more force than permitted by the laws that govern them. The code of silence also remains a troubling issue for American police, with approximately one-quarter of police officers surveyed stating that whistle blowing is not worth it, two-thirds reporting that police officers who report misconduct are likely to receive a 'cold shoulder' from fellow officers, and more than one-half reporting that it is not unusual for police officers to turn a 'blind eye' to improper conduct by other officers. These findings suggest that the culture of silence that has continually plagued the reform of American policing continues." <br> The code of silence is somewhat true in most professions, but not like it is for police officers. For instance, journalists believe it is part of the job to publicly criticize bad journalism, even harshly. The reluctance by police officers to do the same damages community relations and creates distrust, making it harder to effectively fight crime. Shining light in the dark places among your own is often painful, but also disinfecting. <br> Seven years after the Justice Department study detailing that code of silence among police was released, a December 2007 article by USA Today reported that federal prosecutors were concerned about a rise in police brutality cases and that even large police unions were "concerned that agencies were dropping standards to fill thousands of vacancies and 'scrimping' on training." <br> This was before anyone talked about the now-debunked "Ferguson effect," claims by the likes of presidential candidate Gov. Chris Christie that President Obama was making things hostile for law enforcement, or that #BlackLivesMatter was the cause of distrust of police. <br> Why? Because the blinders cops wear when evil is perpetrated by fellow officers are often worn by jurors who refuse to believe cops can do wrong, making convictions difficult to attain. <br> More Justice Department investigations into police departments, like the one recently announced for Chicago, may be necessary. But as long as the public -- and cops -- continue accepting this level of bad behavior by police, the distrust will remain. <br> Many people, including President Obama, call on communities of color to help law enforcement get rid of the criminal element within their groups, whether they be black gangs or Islamic extremists. Why aren't more of us demanding that law enforcement do the same? <br> Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was forced to pledge to demand better accountability and transparency from the police department. He apologized for the McDonald killing. <br> He isn't the only one who has some explaining to do.
The poll found that 2 out of 10 blacks and Hispanics felt unfairly treated by the police over the past 30 days. This is virtually the same finding from the early 2000s where black Americans felt equally vulnerable to police misconduct (there is no data on what Hispanics would have said in 2000s). The poll also showed that 8 in 10 blacks and 2 in 3 Hispanics agree that the criminal justice system favors whites. <br> Given the racial inequality across the criminal justice system -- from arrests to charging to sentencing to death penalty application -- this is hardly surprising. <br> Even 5 in 10 white Americans acknowledged the racial imbalance of our system. <br> Still, the realities of this observation may be tougher to redress than we are willing to admit. Despite the post-racial aspirations of many Americans in the Obama era, such evidence points to the growing gap between our collective racial fantasies and our lived realities. <br> This perception of mistreatment held by blacks and Hispanics is supported by empirical evidence. <br> The challenge of such situations is that police are not necessarily operating from a place of intentional racism or differential treatment. To the contrary, they may sincerely intend to treat all adult criminals the same. Unfortunately, the psychology of racism is so deeply embedded within all of our minds -- black officers often make the same errors of judgment -- that people of color are disproportionately read as criminals. <br> This is why nearly every police shooting of an unarmed person is met with outrage from the public, and an equally passionate defense of the officers by friends, family, and colleagues who insist that they aren't racist. The difficult truth, however, is that both may be true. <br> The officer may not have had racist intentions but, given the psychological evidence offered above, nonetheless engaged in actions borne out of racism. <br> Similar issues emerge in courts when white police officers are charged with shooting black citizens. In these cases, defense attorneys compel jurors (and the broader public) to put themselves in the shoes of the officer. Jurors are then legally tasked with invoking the "reasonable person" standard of common law: "What would a reasonable person do under the same conditions?" While such questions are typically helpful, they falter under the pressure of white supremacy, which has normalized the fear of black bodies for nearly 400 years. <br> As a result, jurors can relate to Darren Wilson's fear of unarmed Michael Brown or even George Zimmerman's fear of unarmed Trayvon Martin and decide that a shooting was justified because they, too, would have done the same thing. They too, saw the unarmed teens as violent threats. <br> Unfortunately, these determinations aren't necessarily generated out of "objective" assessments of a threat, only a general consensus that certain people (or kinds of people) are threatening. Given our country's commitment to reinforcing notions of black pathology through film, literature, music, religion, and the sciences, it is no surprise that people, even black people, have a heightened fear of blacks. <br> It also no surprise, then, that jurors are more prone to exonerate someone for shooting a Black person. In essence, the law can be used to codify irrational, white supremacist fears about Black and Brown people. <br> In order to truly address racial injustice, we must acknowledge what Princeton professor Imani Perry refers to as "post-intentional" racism. The concept, in part, suggests that we don't need the presence of angry, foaming-at-the-mouth racists or blatant discrimination to legitimize or experience racism. <br> The challenge of this realization is that we can't simply locate and eliminate racist "bad apples" -- a blatantly racist police officer or a white supremacist juror-- from our society. Rather, we must take up the deeper challenge of addressing the structural and psychological dimensions of racial injustice that exist everywhere, even the most "polite," "progressive" or well-intentioned spaces. <br> We must accept that our collective problems cannot be resolved at the level of simple policy changes, even if we had the political or moral will to do so. We must question whether the current systems of law, economy or politics have the capacity to yield justice. <br> We must examine the ways that white supremacy is embedded deeply within our collective psyches and our social institutions. We must move beyond finger-pointing and ultimately arrive at new, creative and courageous responses to the dilemmas of racism in America.
Zora O'Neill: It's different across the Atlantic <br> One night years ago in Amsterdam, some friends and I had an epic dinner -- creative food and excellent wine, served by a smart, enthusiastic woman. When the bill came, we knew tipping wasn't the norm in the Netherlands, but we felt compelled to leave something, to show our appreciation. When our server saw the extra cash, she looked irritated, even hurt. "What is this?" she said, throwing it back on the table. <br> "We're American," stammered my friend. <br> "That's the only way we have of showing you we like you," I added. <br> Which is sad, when you think about it. I've worked in restaurants and bars in the U.S. and abroad, but I've never loved the transactional nature of American tipping. Nor do I like how it empowers jerks to use it as a punitive measure. I tip like crazy, but I also feel obliged to be nice to waiters and waitresses. It's a joint effort — isn't dinner better when everyone is happy to be there, well-paid and well-fed? <br> Beyond these touchy-feely concerns, tipping is part of a larger problem of price transparency in America. We're encouraged to consume based on price alone, disregarding labor and other costs. Yet the price we see is rarely the price we pay: sales tax, tips, that sneaky .99 price ending. Even our paychecks are lower than we expect, after withholding. (In the Netherlands, people quote salaries after taxes — mind-blowing, right?) <br> Danny Meyers's proposal to eliminate tipping at his restaurants is a small step toward easing Americans' chronic sticker shock. More important, he'll be paying servers a respectable wage and raising menu prices to reflect that. The only problem is I'll have to find another way to tell waiters how great they are. <br> Andre Spicer: The worst part of dining experience <br> For a European, eating in an American restaurant is akin to attending a high school reunion. <br> The prospect is always really exciting but in actuality it's all right. <br> First, you have to deal with waiters who insist on becoming your new best friend. They want to tell you their name, their opinions on the entire menu and even their life story. Next, you have to choose from a menu with so many options that it would make a math professor's head spin. <br> When the dish arrives, you are faced with so much food that it could easily feed a medium-sized family. After working your way through this food mountain, you are faced with the worst part of the whole experience -- tipping. <br> Your average European sees tipping as an utter anathema. Why not just include it in the bill to start with? Tipping is even more awful because it draws attention to money. Paying for something is like going to the bathroom -- best done quickly and discreetly. <br> However, tipping turns the whole process into a drawn-out ordeal where money is at the center stage. There are so many opportunities for embarrassment. What if you don't give them enough, or too much, or don't say the right thing? <br> In some places you know tipping is preferred in cash. I had always wondered why Americans insist on using dollar bills when small notes had been long abandoned in most other advanced countries. One day it occurred to me -- dollar bills mean people can feel their pockets are stuffed with cash. <br> Andre Spicer is a professor of organizational behavior at Cass Business School, City University London. <br> John Winterman: Tipping culture won't go away <br> Being in an industry with high rents, high cost of goods, and slim profit margins, I am a firm believer in the current tipping culture in America. <br> Almost everyone in the restaurant business would like to pay their staff more, whether through benefits, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock options or real wages. The reality can be very different. Seemingly small decisions on a daily basis hit hard and fast when multiplied out over X number of employees with X number of shifts and X shifts per year. <br> Some people say if restaurants in Europe don't tip why do we do it? I don't want to compare apples with oranges. Our system is different. You would really have to compare factors such as payroll, labor costs, rents, taxes, costs of goods, hours of operations, holidays, employee benefits, even preferred habits and dining times. <br> Unfortunately, some people think restaurants are just sitting on large pools of money. In reality, most of the revenue that comes in is already spent. Investors want money back. Suddenly there is a crisis in the lime or avocado markets. Or fuel costs go up. As British celebrity chef Marco Pierre White says -- we are not magicians. We don't pull a rabbit out of a hat. <br> To change a system you can't just cut a branch, you have to cut the tree -- down to the root. Then you have to dig the root up and replant. Otherwise, there will be no real change. <br> If there is a better business model, I'll be intrigued to see how the new math works out and how a business can thrive. Until someone can show a truly better way to manage our industry's economics, I don't anticipate a seismic shift in how restaurants are run. <br> John Winterman is managing partner at Bâtard, a fine-dining restaurant in Tribeca, New York. <br> Kat Kinsman: Servers deserve fair wage <br> Whenever I write about tipping, I find that there are always people who argue they didn't believe that they should have to subsidize a server's life or a restaurant's bottom line by giving a tip at the end of a meal. <br> My argument has always been: Well, why should these people have to subsidize your night out, often to the detriment of their own family's welfare, health and emotional well-being? <br> Danny Meyer is doing the right thing by eliminating tipping. Eating out costs what it costs and workers aren't some sort of alien species who have infiltrated our culture. They're hardworking humans who deserve the stability of a wage and not have to be subjected to the whims, prejudices and sobriety levels of their customers. It may take a while to catch on, but we'll get there and it'll become the norm. <br> And since Pete Wells, dining critic of the New York Times is with me at a food-related event, he adds that while tipping subsidizes restaurants, one side benefit may be that small restaurant owners are getting a chance to make a go of it. But ideally, we should have a system where higher restaurant prices result in a fair and competitive wage for workers. <br> Mel Robbins: Danny Meyer's 'tipping point' <br> I applaud Danny Meyer's bravery to shake up the restaurant industry. If anyone can make this work, it's Meyer. Winning an unprecedented 26 James Beard awards, he is revered as a visionary. <br> Disparity between the front and the back of the house has always been an issue. I can attest to this as far back as the late 1980s when I worked my way from being a busser to a hostess to a waitress and finally a bartender during college. Restaurant compensation models haven't changed much since then. Front of the house might display the finesse with the customer, but without the line cooks who bring technical skills to the team, there would be no food to serve. <br> The new model could work in Meyer's restaurants because he draws a particular type of clientele who are there for a high-end experience. And he clearly trusts his employees and his customers and wants to take care of them both. If his clientele pays $40 for a steak now, they can probably absorb a $50 price tag. The real question is how it would affect the industry. <br> But the fact is that the math is not that simple. If restauranteurs charge more for meals, they'll pay higher in taxes. As restaurants move to higher wages, the benefit costs will be higher, too. As transportation and food costs rise, so does the cost of doing business, which are normally reflected in higher costs on the menu. I'm sure Meyer's latest move will be a winner, let's just hope isn't a recipe for disaster for smaller restaurants. <br> Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. <br> Edward Frame: Unequal power dynamics <br> Tipping normalizes this assumption. It encourages people to think of service like a perk — something extra — and not a career for millions of individuals, many of whom are compensated far less handsomely than I was. It establishes an unequal power dynamic between guests and waiters, blurring the distinction between service and servitude. <br> Danny Meyer's decision to phase out tipping at his restaurants will help clarify this distinction in the popular imagination. Waiting tables is hard, stressful work; sometimes it can be incredibly rewarding. For many servers, however, the job isn't what some guests imagine it to be: a part-time gig for folks who can't do anything better. <br> Edward Frame, a writer living in New York, works at The New School. <br> Cicely Simpson: Let restaurants decide <br> America's restaurants are feeding our nation's economy and providing real pathways to success for over 14 million Americans. We celebrate the men and women who own and operate our nation's restaurants and our workforce that keeps the industry thriving. <br> We've found that the practice of tipping has traditionally attracted millions of employees to our industry. The current tipped model still has strong support from American diners and they are more than happy to promote a spirit of hospitality by rewarding good service. One national survey indicates that 65% of consumers asked said they would keep with the current tipping system. <br> It is unfortunate that the tipped model is often misunderstood. No one in the restaurant industry makes a "subminimum wage." If an employee's tips plus their cash wages don't add up to at least the minimum wage, their employer is responsible for bringing the employee up to the required minimum. <br> With over 1 million restaurants nationwide, the restaurant industry is filled with unique business models, ownerships and varying concepts. It is vital that restaurants continue to have the freedom to choose what works best for their business and their employees. <br> Cicely Simpson is executive vice president of policy and government affairs at the National Restaurant Association. 
I have to admit, even back when I was playing high school football, we heard Texas had the most hardcore high school football mentality in the country. <br> But even this is crazy. <br> Would a high school coach really give an order like this? And why would these young men obey it? <br> The answer to the first question is: yes. Across this country, we've canonized high school football coaches. Sure, to run a successful football team requires expertise and talent, but at the same time, a high school coach is hardly above reproach. <br> Nearly all my coaches were terrific leaders. In a single-mom home, high school coaches were my substitute dads; their lessons were invaluable to my development. It's their voices many adults hear in their heads when they need a (figurative) kick in the pants. <br> But every high school athlete also remembers that errant, transitory assistant coach -- usually some rudderless ex-varsity star, festooned with tattoos -- who showed up to a few preseason practices, regaled students with his conquests and cursed liberally about his ex-girlfriends. This guy is always popular with the players; they think he's cool. <br> Usually, it turns out, he's not cool. <br> At some point, unceremoniously, the "cool coach" would disappear with nary an explanation, either on his own or by order of the head coach or athletic director. Don't believe me? You haven't heard of a rogue teacher doing anything inappropriate with a student in the last couple of years? Why not an errant coach? An assistant coach can have his own fiefdom out there on the field, away from the monitored school halls. <br> When we were in high school, the qualifications for assistant coach consisted of having a car, and having free time at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday. Luckily, ours were good people, who were committed to educating youth and teaching values. But if you're shocked that any assistant coach could possibly have bad judgment, then maybe you expect too much of a job that depends upon volunteers willing to accept three-figure salaries. Lest you think this is an attack on coaches, it's not at all. Coaching is a job -- like teaching or day care -- that can be infiltrated by bad apples. <br> But what about the culpability of the students? Are they more responsible than the coach? Or were they just following orders? <br> The question comes down to: Can subordinates be held responsible for merely following orders? And if so, where in the chain of command do we draw the line? <br> While the "superior orders" defense is mostly raised in military situations, the quasi-command structures of football teams and other organized sports is loosely analogous enough to apply the test: Did the players not know, nor could they reasonably have known, that the order to take a shot at the referee was unlawful? <br> The answer feels like yes, at first blush. But then again, it's not like we don't make allowances for vengeance in sports. <br> We accept that baseball pitchers sometimes throw at batters or hockey goons are deployed to pick a fight, ostensibly to remedy some past wrong. We accept sports violence motivated purely out of vigilantism. It may garner a penalty, even an ejection, but retribution rarely results in legal trouble outside the game's jurisdiction. <br> And if you find yourself saying: "OK, the players go after each other, but the referee has always been off-limits." Has he really? <br> You've never seen a coach or manager -- the leader of a team, in a professional league -- get nose to nose, spittle to spittle, with an official? And that's the pros! Still, the professionals may be safer than the youth leagues, where refs have to worry about being physically assaulted with a deadly parent. The reality is, referees, umpires, even line judges, may be "off-limits," but only "sort of." <br> Likely, sports experts (mostly self-anointed) would probably agree: blindsiding an unsuspecting referee is an aberration, even in one of our most physically violent sports. <br> What about the fact that they are juveniles? <br> It makes the test more complicated: First, is a 15-year-old mind aware of the "manifest illegality" of this act? Second, if he is aware, then is a juvenile independent enough to disobey direct orders from a highly respected adult "superior"? <br> Reasonable minds will differ on the culpability of the student-athletes. Some may say they are primarily responsible, others will say they were victims of a coercive authority structure and the strictures of the adolescent mind. <br> As for the coach? He gave the direct order. He's an adult. He admitted it. He faces potential liability in his profession and possibly legally, but even harder to quantify is the damage done to young athletes, especially the ones in desperate need of a role model. 
The motive in Goforth's death has not been determined, but according to the Harris County sheriff, the killing was linked to the broader national conversation about police shootings of African-Americans --sometimes armed and sometimes unarmed. <br> The police community was hit as hard by this disgusting act as the journalism community was by the WDBJ-TV killings last week. Let's acknowledge that. Violence is out of control, and I agree with the sheriff that "#livesmatter." It is time to drop any other descriptive adjectives -- journalists' lives matter, black lives matter, police lives matter, every single life matters. <br> If you don't believe me, just ask Kathleen Goforth, the widow who says she was "lucky to have him" or ask Andy Parker, the grieving father who lost his daughter Alison in the WDBJ shootings, or ask the families of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Michael Brown or any of the other countless surviving family members of human beings who have lost their lives due to violence. <br> Not all violence is criminal -- but all violence is violent and all pain is pain and all suffering is suffering. Life is precious and life matters. Life is short enough as it is so let's allow each other to live, because life matters.
I just watched a bunch of the presidential candidates' announcement videos, one after the other. I won't try to guess how they might affect "would-be voters." I'm going to struggle to explain how these stupid videos affected one would-be voter: me. <br> I'm a political hedonist. I want to feel good about my gal or guy. I don't want to just feel only less horrible. And I won't vote for the "lesser of two evils" so as not to "waste my vote." Someone needs to really deserve my vote to get it. <br> So I didn't try to guess how these videos will affect other voters, but this is how they affected me. You are the others -- so click on the candidate's name to watch, and then look in the mirror and give your own report. Remember, we're the people. <br> Here we go: <br> I never considered myself a Hillary fan, but I love her to pieces compared with the people who put this video together. It's just to-do lists from random actors (I don't care who they started out as, once they're in a video, they're actors). These actors have nothing to do with Hillary, or government. <br> Not seeing or hearing much of Hillary or being reminded of anything she's ever done really was their best bet at winning me. And I always like seeing men holding hands, but some of the other people had a little hipster-farmer vibe. <br> He is, as far as I can tell, the only candidate who's talked about what he will do other than offering hope. He's spoken against the National Security Agency, and that alone makes him the frontrunner just because he said something. Maybe the others said something, too, just not in their videos. <br> I remember he also said something slightly weasely about vaccines. Maybe a tiny itty-bit against vaccines and he's a little bit pro-God in government? I liked his dad's being anti-war and I kind of like that I didn't have to watch another stupid video, but that's not enough to win me over. Bye-bye, Randy. <br> I disagree with KoBros a lot, but probably less with them than I disagree with Bernie Sanders -- it's hard to measure. It's like comparing Vermont apples and billions of barrels of oil. Bernie is kind of a socialist and I'm kinda not. He's for big government, and I'm not. He thinks central planning can solve problems and I think even if central planning could solve problems, I'm against it. <br> It's the freedom thing. I'm a New Englander, a Western Masshole from right near New Hampshire and Vermont, and I'm much more of a New Hampshire, free-state guy than a People's Republic of Vermont guy. <br> All that being said -- if I had nothing to go on other than these announcements, Bernie would have my vote wrapped up. I'm shocked by that. I've always just dismissed him as not my kind of nut. But checking my heart, it seems I'd rather have ideas that I disagree with then no ideas at all. He doesn't look like he's selling peanut butter or douche. He doesn't sound like he's selling a Marvel comics movie. He seems like he wants to talk about how we should govern ourselves and he knows we can disagree without being evil. <br> If these candidates are my only choices (and they are not!), I would vote for Bernie if for no other reason than he didn't offer me hope, and he didn't make me feel that if I voted for him, I would win something. He made me feel like we should talk about government. <br> I have no idea how these videos will affect the people, but I was shocked by how they affected this one person. <br> Bernie? That's gotta change, right?
This is a difficult but necessary thing to say: Incidents of police-involved killings and assaults on unarmed African-Americans are unlikely to end soon. That's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a "moment." And it's also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it. This is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis. <br> The peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in Baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over. The violent response of police officers to unarmed African-Americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as "race card" politics and black grievance. But this year's spate of killings and assaults, from Ferguson, Missouri, to North Charleston, South Carolina, to most recently Baltimore, are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the African-American community. <br> So what makes now different? The advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally. As a result, it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed African-Americans as has happened in the past. <br> To call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed African-Americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it. A true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions. The loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system. <br> How do we face this crisis? <br> First, we must recognize that there are no quick fixes. The culture of policing in cities such as New York and Baltimore has developed over decades. Policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house. To subvert that culture will require vigorous, targeted and consistent training. That training must include a focus on managing implicit bias, encounters with the mentally ill and how best to de-escalate encounters with members of the community, especially young people. Training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles. <br> President Barack Obama is right when he reminds us that policing, like education, is a function of state and local government. And it's true that his options are limited. And yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities. How? By conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards. In contrast, while the Department of Justice provides more than $1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country, those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training, data collection or other measures with an explicit anti-racial bias focus. That must change. <br> Much has been made of rogue police officers, "bad apples" and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system. They undoubtedly exist. But the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline, punish and, where appropriate, remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch. There must be zero tolerance for racism, brutality and corruption in police departments. <br> Making this change will require law enforcement to value the integrity of the badge over the unquestioning solidarity that has too often resulted in the protection of officers who have committed egregious acts. Yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve, we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality. <br> Ultimately, the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally, including who we decide to recruit to serve. Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm, for example, has told me he was always skeptical of new police recruits who expressed a desire to become narcotics or homicide detectives. That thinking reflects a spirit of adventure, he told me, rather than a spirit of service. <br> Hamm is right -- policing is, at its core, a service profession. Those we select for this difficult and dangerous job should not only demonstrate mental toughness, courage and smarts, but also integrity, maturity, empathy and a commitment to the communities they serve. <br> A national crisis requires a national response, and that means that federal, state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality. Until we see that kind of wholesale engagement, the lives of innocent people -- and the integrity of our legal system -- hangs in the balance.
When it comes to the U.S. fraternity and sorority system, it's a disturbing truth: Life is largely segregated by race, money and power; and, yet, most of us find that unsurprising. <br> This week, however, we got more evidence this callous status quo needs to change. <br> The push came in the form of a nine-second YouTube video, which I'm sure you've seen by now. It reportedly shows members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma chanting these chilling lines: "There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me." <br> The video is hard to watch, but I have a feeling it's one we need to see, both because it hints at the inner workings of certain Greek organizations, and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the United States. I'm thankful someone -- someone who was on the bus to witness the racist chants -- was brave enough to film this and to help it become public. <br> That alone should give some reason for hope. <br> Others weren't, but I was shocked by the video. This, in 2015? In my home state? Both of my parents participated in Greek life in Oklahoma, but at a different university. I know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement. What happened on the bus at OU doesn't negate their positive experiences. But it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion. Sometimes students are excluded from Greek life, in theory, because they're seen as uncool or don't "fit in" with a particular chapter. But we'd be kidding ourselves if we didn't realize that, often, a person's race -- or sexual orientation, for that matter -- factors into this you're-in, you're-out process. <br> And it's hard for me not to see the SAE video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this exclusionist ideology. This is a case of dangerous group-think run amok. <br> In a system that remains largely divided by race, perhaps videos like this shouldn't be so surprising. That's the view of Matthew Hughey, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who studies racial dynamics in American Greek life. <br> The U.S. fraternity and sorority system is "a form of American apartheid," he told me in an interview on Monday. Instead of thinking of the Oklahoma fraternity members as "bad apples," he said, we should see them as part of a "bad orchard." That orchard includes, but isn't limited to, Greek organizations, he told me. It also includes the rest of us and our country's racist history. <br> "Largely, these organizations reflect a supersegregated and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world," he said. <br> That's 3.8% minority members, in those instances. <br> Hughey's sample size is small but his results also echo what anyone who's spent time on a college campus knows to be true: There are white fraternities and there are black ones. <br> Sometimes we even dare call them that. <br> Far too many of us, especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in Greek life, either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism, sexism and violence in the U.S. Greek system as somehow isolated. <br> It's clear that's not the case. <br> All of that was just SAE. <br> It's clear there is a recurring problem here -- one that needs fixing. <br> One easy place to start would be simply getting more information. Why don't universities force these organizations to report their demographics so we can see exactly how segregated this system really is? Hughey told me that data isn't available. Then we could know the answers to some interesting questions: How segregated are Greek organizations? Are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others? What's the trend over time? Is there progress? <br> Universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations. Do traditionally black and Latino fraternities get as much school funding and attention as the white frats? If not, why? And why are these groups so incredibly divided in the first place? What does that do to the student body as a whole? <br> I'm not calling for an end to the Greek system. But it's a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes. <br> "Any time there are racist remarks made, we must speak up as Americans," Boren, the OU president, said in a news conference. He added that he hopes the SAE students "think long and hard" about the incident as they pack up and vacate their fraternity house early this week. <br> "I hope they think long and hard about how words can injure and hurt other people," he said. <br> The rest of us should do that, too.

Yep, you read that right. <br> Half of the world's vertebrate animal populations are gone. <br> That's mind-blowingly infuriating. <br> And it's worse for some species and regions, in particular. <br> The report overall considers 10,380 populations of 3,038 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, and says populations have declined by 52% between 1970 and 2010. <br> But for freshwater fish and other species, the drop is 76%. And for for species in the Neotropics, which includes Central and South America, the decline is 83%. <br> Just wow. <br> Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF, writes that, "This has to make us stop and think." He's correct, of course. But we can't stop at the thinking. We need prompt, dramatic action. <br> All that, and we must take swift action to curb carbon pollution. <br> "Climate change has already been linked to the population decline and possible extinction of a number of amphibian species in the Neotropics and in Australia," the Living Planet Report says. "In the Arctic, the effects of a rapidly warming climate have been suggested as likely causes of decline in body condition and numbers in many polar bear and caribou populations." <br> This stuff is depressing, but the report does offer signs of hope. <br> It relays a case study from Belize, for example, which started estimating the financial value of protecting ecological resources, particularly those along the coast. "Belize's coastal and ocean ecosystems provide services worth up to $559 million per year -- equivalent to 43% of GDP," the report says. Facts like that make it clear why there's a financial as well as moral incentive to protect our remaining natural resources. <br> The authors cite wind farms in Denmark as another success. <br> "December 2013 marked a significant milestone, when wind power provided an equivalent of 57.4% of Denmark's electricity consumption -- the first time ever that wind power supplied more than half of a country's electricity needs for a whole month. December 21 set another record, with wind turbines generating the equivalent of 102% of Danish electricity consumption," the authors write. <br> But things aren't as bad as the WWF report makes it sound, he said. <br> "Overall, there is no question that the status of biodiversity is going down -- that things are not improving," he told me. "That said, I'm not a fan of this Living Planet Index. The reason is it sort of mixes up apples and oranges and lots of other fruit, too, for that manner. It's a little difficult to unpack exactly what it means. There are many people in the media who assumed it means 50% of species have gone extinct in the last 40 years -- and that's not true." Instead, the report claims 50% of some vertebrate populations have disappeared. But a single species could still exist with a smaller population size. <br> Assessing individual ecosystems and species is more useful, he said. <br> The risk of considering so many species -- and so many types of data -- in a single report, Pimm said, is that it can make action seem impossible. <br> And, for him and others, that's not the case. <br> There's much to be done. <br> We can set aside protected habitats, put firm caps on carbon emissions, break up gangs that trade in illegal wildlife parts and continue to fund scientific exploration to ensure their safety and continued viability. <br> We should move urgently in that direction. <br> The point is that we know which direction to move in. <br> It's bad out there, but it's sure not hopeless. <br> This report -- and a host of others -- shouldn't be a total downer. They should be read as a clarion call for action. 



Before we jump into a debate about the environmental costs of eating meat, here are three things you should know: <br> 1. I've experimented with vegetarianism twice, but it's never really stuck. Round one ended when I had a dream about a spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy's, and then woke up to march zombie-style to that fast-food restaurant to order it. Round two may or may not have ended with the brunch I had Sunday, I'm still not sure. <br> 2. I ate chicken chilaquiles for brunch on Sunday. It was delicious. <br> Therefore, 3. This is not an anti-meat polemic. <br> "(S)omeone who regularly eats factory-farmed animal products cannot call himself an environmentalist without divorcing that word from its meaning," he wrote in that book. <br> Since it's Earth Day, I thought that last point might merit some dissection. Is it possible to eat meat in modern-day America, consider yourself an environmentalist and sleep soundly without being a hypocrite? Or, as Foer argues, are those terms increasingly incongruous? <br> Animal rights aside, there are plenty to consider. Here are a few: <br> At a time when rivers in the American Southwest are running dry because of drought and climate change, it's worth considering the impact our eating habits have on water use. <br> It's fallen slightly since then, which is good news. <br> I travel frequently, and value flexibility, so I've never really wanted to be too strict about my diet in the long term. But one day? One week? One month? It's not that hard. <br> To the minority of vegans and vegetarians who like to proselytize about their eating habits, I'm sure that seems like an annoying cop-out. But there are plenty of environmentalists who advocate a middle-road approach to meat consumption. <br> "Certainly there are modest steps we can all take that can really have a significant benefit if a lot of people did them," said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at NRDC, the environmental group. "We often fall into this mistaken all-or-nothing mentality." <br> I like that approach. It's one more people are likely to stomach. <br> And it's one that -- even for a day -- can have real impact.
When it comes to the gender pay gap, the cynics have used smoke and mirrors to deny the truth while Congress continues to come up short on critical legislation. <br> So now, the President is not waiting another minute to make real progress. He is taking action. <br> He also challenged the Senate to "start making this right" by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act when it comes up for a vote on Wednesday. The Senate has tried twice, but the act was blocked by a handful of stubborn Republicans. <br> Yet for millions of women struggling on the brink of poverty, the wage gap is all too real. <br> Despite increasing education and greater professional success, women in the aggregate still make less than men: on average, 77 cents on the dollar, and even less if you are black or Latina. This persistent pay gap has real implications for women and their families, especially when 40% of our nation's households with children rely on women as a primary or sole source of income. <br> It's not surprising then that polls rank equal pay for equal work as a top issue for women across the country. <br> But like a bad magician, the naysayers are trying to use smoke and mirrors to fool us into believing the problem is just an illusion. They say the wage gap is a myth, based on anecdotes, not data. <br> They say there's no need for new laws, because it's already illegal to discriminate. Any differences that remain, they say, can be explained away by personal choices. <br> While it's true the wage gap is due to a combination of factors, study after study has shown the wage gap — as much as 40% of it — holds true even when we control for factors such as education level, profession or position. It cannot be fully explained by personal choices, and can be attributed in some measure to overt or unintentional gender-based discrimination. <br> That's why we still need Congress to act, to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure that all employers are held to the standards embodied in Tuesday's executive actions. <br> When the rubber meets the road, let's hope we move beyond the rhetoric to acting on real solutions. Don't make the President take out his pen again, unless it is to sign the new law.
We've all done things in our past we might prefer the general public not talk about, but only the lucky few get to be the targets of whole industries dedicated to digging those things up. <br> Targets like celebrities. <br> Politicians. <br> And apparently CEOs, that is if the abrupt resignation of Mozilla's new chief Brendan Eich is any indication. <br> I don't see it that way. <br> To me, Eich's case is about the power of information, and how -- with technology, 24-hour news and social media- -everyone's past is just a hashtag away from being the present. <br> Sometimes this is a good thing for the public, like the digging up of David Duke's KKK past as he attempted to climb the political ladder. Sometimes the information is significant, but used mainly to score points against a political opponent, as in the GOP's escalation of the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky saga. But more often than not it's about gossip to sell magazines or get clicks on a website. <br> To Eich's credit, he has stuck with his position on same-sex marriage despite a torrent of complaint from inside and outside his company. That the company didn't anticipate the backlash is the real head-scratcher. <br> The country's present attitude regarding same-sex marriage is not top secret. And neither is Eich's past. Mozilla should've had a better strategy than "let's hope nobody notices." <br> Yet the fact that the board caved to the pressure, instead of standing behind its choice, suggested it was completely blindsided by the uproar. This is mind-boggling considering that the controversies surrounding Chick-fil-A and Paula Deen did not happen in an alternate universe. By all accounts Eich, who helped develop some of the Web's most important technologies, was qualified for the job and Mozilla would likely be hurt by his resignation. <br> But Mozilla is an activist organization more than a money-making corporation. The Apples and Googles of the world can lure top young talent with money and perks. Mozilla's recruiting success depends on its ability to sell its mission. Thus the effectiveness of the CEO rests heavily on his or her ability to foster a community, not just make a buck. <br> And generally speaking, discrimination is a community buzzkill. <br> Still, the company's leadership, not Eich, is to blame for this PR nightmare, They're the ones who thought what happened in 2008 stays in 2008.
Recently some friends were discussing whether early detection via screening mammography may not be the key to surviving breast cancer. Several women argued that despite the studies, they believe in mammograms, echoing many women who were treated for a screen-detected breast cancer and are alive to tell the story. Some even support it when screening clearly failed to detect their cancers or prevent the onset of advanced disease. <br> For decades, belief in some version of "early detection cures breast cancer and saves lives" has shaped our view. In the 1970s, when women like Betty Ford and the late Shirley Temple Black were lifting the veil of secrecy and shame surrounding breast cancer, finding the disease "early" meant being alert to symptoms to find a tumor before it got so large it poisoned the body. In this context, it was logical to try to find tumors before they got to this point. <br> Today "early detection" means something very different. Now, "early" has shifted from feeling a lump to relying on a mammogram to detect a microscopic abnormality. Supporting the narrative that "every breast cancer is curable as long as you catch it in time," the focus shifted to the detection of smaller and smaller suspicious conditions by way of radiographic imaging. <br> Focusing on beliefs -- mammograms always save lives -- primes us to rely on opinions that may not be based on reliable evidence. Presenting those beliefs as facts manipulates our emotions. This persuasive strategy is prevalent in health and medical advertising, celebrity spots, and health news. <br> Consider these trusted, but misleading, persuaders: <br> Ignoring the mounting evidence of the limited value of screening for women of average risk, particularly for women in their 40s, the society (and radiology associations) continue to promote early detection via screening. <br> Indeed, no matter how state-of-the-art the mammography machine, technician, and radiologists are, screening mammograms miss at least 10% of invasive breast cancers -- and the worst ones. After 25 years of follow-up, the Canadian study confirmed its earlier findings that the women who received annual screening mammograms died at similar rates as the women who did not -- and far too many got unnecessary overtreatment. Truth in advertising would fully explain these caveats. <br> The surgery was not protocol because it saved lives, as many assumed, but because of Halsted's prestige and certainty. Scrutiny of his studies eventually revealed that Halsted's beliefs about breast cancer lacked evidence to support his claims about treatment, but randomized, controlled trials did not confirm the benefit of alternatives until the 1970s. <br> Eight randomized, controlled trials of mammography screening have found that the benefits are far smaller than early evidence suggested, and the hazards have been largely ignored. <br> Let's not wait 100 years to move beyond belief in the unequivocal power of this screening tool. We need to understand its strengths, risks and limitations and allow that understanding to inform our beliefs and our practices.
Ignorance really isn't bliss. But there are times when the lack of knowledge and expertise about a subject or place can actually serve to clear the mind and lead to some clarity and honesty in the debate on even the most complex matters. <br> I'm certainly no expert on Ukraine. I'm not sure before this crisis that I could even name all of the countries that share its borders. But watching the ticktock of the debate on the issue this past week, I'm stunned by the lack of perspective and breathlessness in the discussion. <br> Sadly, I've grown accustomed to the partisanship. It has become a permanent fixture of our analytical and policy landscape. But here are several things about the recent coverage and discussion on Ukraine that even my lack of expertise won't allow me to accept: <br> 1. We're back in the Cold War <br> Clearly, none of the resets have worked with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Whether it was President George W. Bush looking into his eyes and seeing his soul or Bob Gates finding a stone-cold killer there, Putin isn't Stalin, Khrushchev or Brezhnev. That's hardly a shocker. Nor are we still in that unique period when two superpowers with contrasting ideological systems under the threat of nuclear war clashed and fought by proxy from one end of the globe to the other. <br> There's no doubt that the United States and Russia have major differences. But the issue is no longer ideological. Russian capitalism is here to stay, state-controlled and monitored though it may be. And what ideology exists has more to do with asserting Russian national interests than anything Marx or Lenin would have recognized. And in at least one respect, that's too bad. At least during much of the Cold War, from the 1970s on, there were rules, do's and don'ts that prevented situations like Ukraine. <br> We'll continue to struggle with Putin, to be sure. But the world's too small, the Europeans too dependent on Russia, and the realities of global interdependence too deep to imagine hitting the rewind button and turning the planet into an arena of conflict and competition. Would it make for a good video game? Yes. <br> 2. Putin is Hitler <br> In the past week, I've heard people I admire and respect talk about Crimea as Munich and Putin as Hitler. Twain wrote that history doesn't repeat; it rhymes. But those rhythmic patterns aren't evident here, either. <br> When we can't think of intelligent parallels in analyzing nations who do things America cannot abide, it seems we're drawn irresistibly to the Hitler trope. The same thing happens with Iran. And while I don't for a moment condone the vicious Israel-baiting and hating of the mullahcracy in Tehran (and the anti-Semitism, too) to bring up Hitler not only trivializes the monstrosity of the evil and the magnitude of the crimes in his time, it imposes unrealistic challenges in ours. <br> The unique challenge of Hitler demanded that he be stopped and the Nazi regime destroyed. <br> We don't have to like the Putin government in Russia, or Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's in Iran, to recognize that the magnitude of the threat is different. To compare them to Hitler is to urge the United States into a game that we don't want to play and can't win. <br> As best I can figure, Putin is a clever and easily riled Russian nationalist who presides over what remains of an empire whose time has come and gone. He lives in reality, not in some megalomaniacal world. But he is prepared to assert Russia's interests in spheres where it matters, and to block the West's intrusion into those areas as best he can. Russia is his "ideology." And on Ukraine, history and proximity give him cards to play. <br> This man isn't a fanatic. Money, pleasure and power are too important to him. Any leader who is willing to be photographed shirtless on a horse, like some cover of Men's Health magazine, isn't going to shoot himself in the head or take cyanide in a bunker. This guy is way too hip (Russian style) and attached to the good life to be Hitler. And given Russia's own suffering at the hands of the Nazis, saying he is just makes matters worse. <br> 3. It's all Obama's fault <br> President Barack Obama was never the catastrophic incompetent or Satan's finger on earth that his worst critics imagined nor the redeemer, savior, or great President that his most avid acolytes wanted. And yet the notion that Obama, through weak and feckless foreign policy, was responsible for Putin's move into Ukraine strains credulity to the breaking point. <br> This urban legend that because of Benghazi and the "red line" affair in Syria, Putin was compelled to do something in Ukraine that he wouldn't have done had Obama acted differently, is absurd. The administration's foreign policy has often resembled a blend between a Marx Brothers movie and the Three Stooges. But on this one the charge is absurd, as is the notion that somehow Obama could have stopped him. <br> When the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in 1956, there was no U.S. military response; ditto in 1968 when the Soviets put down Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia. Sometimes, geography really is destiny. Russia believed its vital interests in Ukraine were threatened and it had the means, will, and proximity to act on them. And it's about time we faced up to it. <br> 4. Bombing Syria would have saved Ukraine <br> This notion that Obama's opponents have latched onto is, of course, unknowable. There are no rewind buttons in history. Counterfactuals are prime talking and debating points because they cannot be proven one way or the other. But to argue that launching cruise missiles at Syrian military targets somehow would have deterred Putin from acting on what he perceived to be a Russian vital interest, or emboldened the Europeans to stand tougher against him, really is off base. <br> Syria and Ukraine are like apples and oranges the President's detractors insist on putting in the same basket. Even if Obama thought the U.S. had vital interests that justified an attack on Syria, it is likely it would not have altered Putin's policy toward Ukraine. The country perceived to be in Russia's zone of influence and manipulation was drifting westward. And Putin was determined to stop it. <br> 5. Ukraine can have a 'Hollywood' ending <br> Are there good guys and bad guys in the Ukraine-Russian drama? Sure there are. We have courageous Ukrainian patriots who died in the Maidan for the dignity and freedom they believed in; corrupt and ruthless government officials who were willing to use force against their own citizens; Russian provocateurs eager to stir up trouble; extremist Ukrainian nationalists who are hardly democrats; and a Russian strongman who hosted the Olympics one week and invaded the territory of a sovereign country the next. <br> I suspect that the Ukrainian Spring -- if that's what it is -- may turn out better than its Arab counterpart. But we have to be real. Ukraine may be fractious and troubled for some time to come. <br> Below the morality play there is intense factionalism; regional differences; scores to settle; Russian manipulation; and a tendency to avoid the kind of compromise that would lead to real power sharing and good governance. <br> We like Hollywood endings. But real democratization depends less on a friendly U.S. or EU hand than on the emergence of genuine leaders who are prepared to rise above factional affinities and see a vision for the country as a whole. It also depends on institutions that reflect popular will and some mechanism for accommodating differences peacefully without resorting to violence. <br> There are no easy or happy endings here. And we can only make matters worse, as Henry Kissinger suggested recently, by trying to turn the Ukraine crisis into a Russia vs. the West (or worse, the U.S.) tug-of-war. 
It's easy to dismiss Perkins' sentiment as nothing more than the ill-advised ravings of a cantankerous, thin-skinned old man. But it also illustrates just how bizarre things have gotten for some wealthy people, who find themselves in a new socially constructed category and on the wrong side of a resurgent but elusive political ideal, facing off against mesmerizing populist adversaries. <br> How can the "1%" make the best of the situation they're in and reduce the likelihood of more embarrassing Perkins-like incidents? Here's my advice. <br> First, remember that the 1% is an almost meaningless moniker for a multifarious bunch of people who differ greatly in political leaning, wealth, occupation and ethics. <br> However, as "welfare moms," "urban youth" and "unionized teachers" have long since discovered, resistance is futile once a pejorative new category bursts onto the scene. And you'll only make things worse by trying to introduce something better (Perkins tried "successful 1%," which is even more objectionable because it implies the "unsuccessful 99%"). <br> So you're stuck with the 1% label. But rather than wax nostalgic for the honorific categories of yesteryear - "global elite," "electronic herd" and "mass affluent" -- try to remember that "sticks and stones may break your bones but names will never hurt you" while waiting calmly for the rhetorical storm to pass. And please don't succumb to self-pity for suffering the indignity of guilt by association; name-calling is nothing like stop-and-frisk, job discrimination or profiling. Toughen up! <br> But what makes equality difficult to define philosophically makes it expedient politically, because its vagueness and complexity allow it to be offered as a panacea for almost any problem. Just accept that while it's possible to be pro-gun or pro-choice, it's impossible to be pro-inequality. <br> And when cornered at a cocktail party, please don't ask opponents to tell you what equality really means or to offer a coherent explanation of its causes and effects. Equality is the zeitgeist for a period when many people feel under pressure and shafted by a system that they think you represent. If you sympathize, show it. If you don't, keep your mouth shut. <br> To meet the populist media challenge will take some courage by a younger generation of 1% Democrats with charisma and a willingness to seek common ground with the populists even though by doing so they'll be viewed by many friends and colleagues as traitors to their class. <br> Finally, be invigorated by this moment in the spotlight! You have status to engage politically simply by virtue of your membership in a category - the 1% - that did not even exist until 2011. But political winds are fickle and may soon blow you off the stage. As Oscar Wilde said, "the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about."
We are in the middle of a fight to preserve the dignity and grace that makes all of us Americans. We have big hearts and great souls. I know. I have seen them, felt them and watched them in wonder when my family was lost and unreachable in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. <br> I cried, worrying for those I loved, heartbroken by what happened to our beloved Louisiana. And in the middle of that tough moment, the decency of people shone through in e-mails, phone calls and in person. Everybody was saying the same thing: "How can I help?" <br> This is what we do in times of struggle. We offer our hand and our love to pull someone up who's been knocked down by hard times and despair. It's just a fundamental rule in life and in any fight; you don't kick people when they're down. <br> I am not going to mince words. When the House voted to cut $40 billion to the food stamp program over the next 10 years, that wasn't an example of government tightening its belt or making tough choices. That vote wasn't a philosophy or an ideology about governing. Pure and simple, it was a heartless act. It was cruel. It was kicking millions of our families, neighbors and friends when they are down. And the people who work for a living in this country are down. <br> Let's take a walk through the facts of what's happened to them during the Great Recession and this nonrecovery of the economy. <br> "The Fed (Federal Reserve) found that middle-class families had sustained the largest percentage losses in both wealth and income during the crisis, limiting their ability and willingness to spend," according to The New York Times. <br> For 30 years, wages have flat-lined or declined for most workers, particularly in the past 10 years, as low-paying jobs replace middle-income paying jobs. In 2009, only half of the country had any assets, and those numbers have gotten worse during the last three years. <br> Probably everyone reading this knows someone who is striving mightily, working two jobs and cutting expenses to the bone while barely making ends meet. <br> Ask any worker at Starbucks, Cosi, McDonald's or Walmart, "How many jobs do you have?" and likely he or she will tell you: "Two." I know colleagues who've had breakfast at one store, and gone to lunch in another, only to find the same person waiting on them. <br> One young woman I heard about gets up at 4 a.m. for her first job and ends her day at 10 p.m. at her second job. The average allotment of food stamps is $133 a person a month. Let me tell you something I can pretty much bet my house on -- that woman is not using her food stamp card to buy lobsters and caviar. She's quietly going to the food pantry, checking the sales in the grocery store, spending some time at the kitchen table clipping coupons and making a serious plan to turn that box of pasta, pound of beef, and if she's lucky, some fresh fruits and vegetables, into a meal plan truly worthy of a Gucci belt. <br> Fraud is a piece of grain compared with the millions of families who manage to put food on the table because of this program. And those few bad apples who do commit fraud are no excuse to kick the unemployed and the poor when they are engaged in a mighty battle to get themselves and their families back on their feet. <br> So shame on this Congress for fighting dirty during working people's hour of struggle. <br> Speaking of representatives who would vote to take food from America's tables, she said, "Some of these same members travel to foreign countries under the guise of official business. They dine at lavish restaurants, eating steak, vodka and even caviar." <br> Speier talked about 20 members of Congress who traveled to Ireland and got a daily food allowance of $166. The average amount a family member gets on food stamps is less than $4 a day. <br> Yet our representatives, one after the other, mostly Republicans, stepped onto the House floor to speak and vote in the name of saving money for the taxpayer. They went after the poor, the unemployed, the single mom, the single dad, the grandparents -- all those people who are trying to make it work. <br> Well, they didn't just do wrong; they are wrong. I urge the Senate to restore every single dime to the food stamp program. I applaud the president for saying that he'll veto these cuts. <br> We're lacing up our shoes, too, but we're going to fight these merciless cuts with the golden rule. You know why? "Do unto others" trumps "kick 'em when they're down" every time. The American people are decent and fair. It's time to stand tall for this essential program for millions. It's time and our might will make this right.
Airport transportation security officers are probably the least understood and most maligned of federal employees. Travelers hate them for taking away water bottles and making them take off their shoes. If a story is reported about them, it's along the lines of a little old lady getting groped. They are the victims of unflattering stereotypes that make easy targets for cheap laughs. <br> And when the Government Accountability Office found increased Transportation Security Administration officer misconduct, it just ratcheted up their unpopularity. The report was jarring and disturbing -- rising numbers of absenteeism, theft and intentional security lapses. Obviously, these are red flags that can't be ignored. <br> Unfortunately, instead of taking on the issue of stopping the misconduct, GAO's focus was on how TSA "could strengthen oversight of allegations of employee misconduct," the safe issues of process oversight, management of the accusations and data gathering versus digging into the controversial root causes of the actual misconduct. <br> TSA's response was to assure us it fires those proven to have violated the public trust. In fact, it does. It will be tempting for TSA leaders to rally around solutions involving tougher discipline, deeper investigations and more thorough documentation. <br> That would be exactly the wrong way to fix the real problem. <br> In today's TSA, too many officers switch off their minds in favor of just finishing out the shift without rocking the boat. This may be the root cause of the GAO-identified misdeeds. TSA needs to have its officers switched-on and motivated. <br> The security workforce comprises many who stepped up after 9/11 to stop terror attacks. My experience with transportation security officers is that they are overwhelmingly dedicated, sharp, willing and empathetic to passengers and their problems. <br> Considering that the human brain is the most sophisticated technology on the planet and that the officers have experience with hundreds of thousands of passengers, the question would seem to be: "How do we get the most from this resource that we already pay and have on duty at checkpoints?" It is not through additional rules and a more robust disciplinary process. <br> Security officers are in the best position to use their experience and training and detect a threat not covered in the Standard Operating Procedure. Al Qaeda knows the rules and designs its attacks to comply with it. To stop attacks, officers thinking on their own needs to be encouraged, not disciplined. <br> Once officers are allowed to think for themselves, it opens the door for mistakes and criticism. But people can be taught the fundamentals of risk management, which provides a framework for making informed judgments. The risk strategy must be carefully thought out -- complexity theory, with its network orientation, is the best way to think about transportation security risk -- and risk management tools understood and applied. <br> Armed with substantial intelligence resources, TSA's air marshals, inspectors and security officers need to be nimble in thinking about and applying the principles of risk management. But they also must be empowered to act. <br> TSA needs to make these changes right now to take on the root causes of its public and security issues. It needs to clean up the mind numbing, overly complicated checkpoint "standard operating procedure," which no longer matches our security needs and allow officers to act. What needs to be changed: <br> • The intrusive pat-down needs to be discontinued in favor of a lighter technique supplemented with available technologies. <br> • The "prohibited items" list needs to be radically reduced to ban only real security threats such as explosives and toxins. As far as carrying knives, the FAA should make it a serious federal offense to intimidate a member of the flight crew or another passenger with a blade -- and then TSA can remove blades from the prohibited list. Blades represent virtually no threat to the aircraft at this point. And the baggie rule should be dropped. Current technology allows threat liquids to be detected when they are taken out of the carry-on and scanned in a bin. <br> • Passengers should be chosen randomly for shoes and coat inspections. Precheck programs for frequent fliers that expedite security screening should be applied to all travelers. <br> • Workers need to be retrained in risk management and encouraged to use their own judgment and experience, consulting with team members, to make prudent discretionary security calls. <br> • The pay-for-performance system for transportation security officers needs to be reinstated. When transportation security officers unionized, merit pay was replaced by the seniority system -- essentially, if officers follow the standard operating procedure, they get regular pay raises up till retirement regardless of how well they perform. <br> • We need to allow real private-sector innovation to compete and play a more meaningful role in security. Today, a fig leaf system is in place that calls itself "private sector" but is in reality just personnel outsourcing. These outsourced employees have to follow the TSA process exactly -- the only difference is that they get to charge an 8% markup on all their expenses. We need to get new ideas from outside the TSA that can be tested at our checkpoints. <br> A clear risk management strategy along with these changes, taken together, would energize checkpoint activity, bring the public more on board, drive out the few bad apples, and improve security. 
We already knew that opponents of immigration reform had no good arguments in favor of preserving the status quo. Now we know they have no shame. <br> Some of them are deliberately mixing apples and oranges and trying to use the tragedy of the Boston Marathon bombing to scuttle efforts in Washington to achieve immigration reform. <br> All last week, my friends in the immigration reform community held their collective breath and hoped that -- when investigators finally zeroed in on a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing -- that person would NOT turn out to be foreign-born. Immigrants are blamed for enough in society; they need not be blamed for this tragedy. <br> Besides, from the perspective of the reformers, the timing couldn't be worse. <br> A few days after the bombing, the Senate's "gang of eight" unveiled what is the most significant piece of immigration reform legislation in more than a quarter century. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 is an expertly crafted, bipartisan compromise that has a real shot at improving the lives of millions of people and fixing a broken system. <br> Yet, because of unrelated events, the legislation could wind up hanging by a thread. Why? Because the prime suspects in the Boston bombing are immigrants: 19-year-old Dzhokhar "Jahar" Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. <br> The brothers are from the Russian Caucasus region and moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States. Tamerlan was killed Thursday night in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar escaped and was at large Friday until he was found in Watertown, Massachusetts, and apprehended by police. <br> There's that infamous date again. <br> It's worth noting that Americans started the long and difficult journey toward immigration reform on September 5, 2001, when President George W. Bush welcomed Mexican President Vicente Fox to the White House for a state dinner in his honor. <br> Earlier in the day, both leaders told reporters that they wanted to fix the immigration system and match willing employers in the United States with willing workers in Mexico. The reform was supposed to include a pathway to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants in the United States. <br> Six days later, our country was attacked and the world changed. Immediately, immigration reform was put so far onto the back burner that it eventually fell clear off the stove. <br> Most supporters of immigration reform, including many Latinos, believe that this was immensely unfair. The 19 hijackers were from the Middle East, and they came to the United States legally, many on student visas. So why would their evil acts have the effect of torpedoing the prospect of immigration reform that primarily affects millions of illegal immigrants from Latin America? <br> That is just what happened. Was that a lucky guess? Or is that how this guy's mind works -- that every time something bad happens, an immigrant must be to blame? <br> On Friday, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa jumped into the fray during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. <br> "Given the events of this week, it's important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system," he said. "How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the United States? How do we ensure that people who wish to do us harm are not eligible for benefits under the immigration laws, including this new bill?" <br> "It's too bad Suspect No. 1 won't be able to be legalized by Marco Rubio, now." <br> Again, the Tsarnaev brothers were immigrants, but they didn't need to be "legalized." They were already in the country legally. But, hey, why let facts in the way of a good screed? <br> In response, a spokesman for Rubio said in an e-mail to the Christian Science Monitor: "There are legitimate policy questions to ask and answer about what role our immigration system played, if any, in what happened. Regardless of the circumstances in Boston, immigration reform that strengthens our borders and gives us a better accounting of who is in our country and why will improve our national security. Americans will reject any attempt to tie the terrorists responsible for the attacks in Boston with the millions of decent, law-abiding immigrants currently living in the U.S. and those hoping to immigrate here in the future." <br> Let's hope that's right, and that most Americans do see these tactics for what they are: desperate attempts to thwart reform. <br> Here is the predicament that the nativists and right-wing demagogues find themselves in, whether they realize it or not. They want to opportunistically use the fact that bombing suspects were foreign nationals to once again derail immigration reform. But, in doing so, they walk away from the table and wind up defending the current immigration system. <br> The Rubio spokesman had it right. We have to know who is in this country, and what their intentions are -- whether they came legally or illegally. This is one of the things that immigration reform is about. <br> No reform plan is perfect, but the status quo is flatly not acceptable. We have to keep the debate going. 
All those who are hoping that comprehensive immigration reform is going to happen this year -- Latinos, businesses, churches, agriculture industry, law enforcement and others -- are in for a rude awakening. <br> The trick for politicians will be to look as if they're doing something, when really they're doing nothing. But, regardless of how it looks, it's a long shot that Congress will pass immigration reform this year. <br> That's bad news for those who want to give the undocumented a chance to get right with the law and develop a sensible, fair and efficient policy for future immigrants. But it's good news for those who resist legalizing the undocumented because they're afraid of foreigners -- either because of competition with their work ethic, or that they're changing the culture and complexion of the country. <br> The problem isn't just Republicans, who can't get on the same page about whether they want to be reformers. It's also Democrats, who seem to be playing the immigration reform camp for chumps. <br> Here's what is in the plan: more border security, a requirement that employers use an electronic system to verify if prospective hires are eligible to work, and a long path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. <br> How long? The undocumented could immediately apply for a special protective status to avoid deportation, but it would take them about eight years to get legal permanent residency (a green card) and another four or five years to become a U.S. citizen. <br> The idea would be to bring in a few hundred thousand temporary "guest workers" to do the hard and dirty jobs that Americans won't do at any wage. When the work is done, and the workers have been paid a fair salary, they go home. And another batch is brought in. It's not a perfect solution. But you won't find any of those in the immigration debate. <br> The first U.S. president to push for guest workers was Abraham Lincoln. Industries were facing labor shortages during the Civil War and, with Lincoln's support, Congress in 1864 passed The Act to Encourage Immigration. The bill allowed employers to recruit foreign workers and pay their way to America. There were more guest workers during World War I. But the concept really became popular during World War II and the Cold War. From 1942 to 1964, under the Bracero program (as in "brazo", which is Spanish for arm as in someone who works with his arms and hands), nearly 5 million guest workers came in and out of the United States. <br> Well, maybe not everyone. Many in organized labor hate the concept of guest workers because their leaders are busy peddling the fantasy that the hard and dirty jobs in question are sought after by union members. Sure. Then why aren't they doing them now? Answer: Because they're hard and dirty. <br> It's time for Congress to create a new guest worker program for the agriculture industry where employees can have decent wages, access to health clinics, livable housing, workers comp in case of injury, and legal protection so that they aren't exploited. Of course, there's the catch. If growers have to pay for all that, labor economists say, it might well kill the incentive for them to participate. <br> But it's those same growers who are now complaining that they aren't able to find American workers who are willing to pick a variety of crops that can't be harvested by machine -- peaches, plums, apples, lettuce, tomatoes, avocadoes, nectarines, strawberries, blueberries, apricots, table grapes, etc. So those employers will have to make some tough choices. If they want a reliable labor supply, it'll cost them. That's the way it should be. There is no free lunch. <br> Either way, it's a guest workers program that will make or break the prospects for immigration reform. I'm betting it's the latter. 
I wouldn't normally pay much attention to a sports star, even a Fighting Irish hero. <br> I don't know whether any of the story is true; if some shred holds up, my condolences to all involved. <br> But what I note about it is the flash of winking mirrors, the reflections that stand in for authenticated reality. Yes, here I'm going to say "Mirror, Mirror, on the wall," but the mirror really isn't on the wall, but on the desktop or the portable device. Those fine frangible screens, when dropped, can maintain their structure, though stricken with a jag like lightning. The screens are meant to be our windows to the world, but all too often they are only mirrors, reflecting back what we want to see. Not the great and the good, not even the best and the brightest, but merely the brightest. <br> Somewhere in these flashing mirrors, we mistake the flash-lit celebrity, the lightning-strike story, for confirmed reality. We the readers of online news, and we the readers of e-mails, Twitter and favorite blogs do it, too. We've grown used to living without reality coordinates that can be tested not with further keystrokes but with a good swift kick to the tires. We wouldn't buy a car without test-driving it, and we ought not to rely on the flash of mirrors for our take on reality. There is too little focal depth in staring at a mirror. <br> That's what drove Snow White's old Queen mad. She didn't get out enough. She ought to have stopped texting herself and gone to a football game. She ought to have remembered that real news, even real gossip, begins in what is observed firsthand, not secondhand. She would have said, "Where is this wonderful sick girlfriend?" If Te'o is not an active agent in some cold-blooded scam, she might have met him in his locker room to tell him what she thought of his lady love, or of her absence in the woods. (Not sent a text message.) <br> As a novelist, I'm a professional liar. It's my job to try to make the improbable seem plausible. My chiefest tool is making readers see themselves in the mirror of the tale. If I can pull that off, they're hooked. Can you picture Manti Te'o getting ready for the showers and being accosted by an old hag with a basket of apples? If you can, even for a moment, I've worked a certain spell, and I've hooked you with my flashing mirror, but I haven't told the truth. <br> Maybe you can only see Manti Te'o trying to wipe the steamy mirror over the locker room sink clear of fog so he can say, "Who's the best player of us all?" We should all try wiping away the fog more often. 
Last week, I sat down with colleagues and students to an early Thanksgiving meal prepared by my university's cafeteria. Along with our winter greens, butternut squash, brussels sprouts with apples and bacon, and pumpkin grits, we ate a roasted "heritage breed turkey." <br> Accolades ensued: "To me, all turkeys taste the same—except for this one—I can tell the difference," said William Payne who works in the medical school. The local greens from Georgia farms were "really, really tasty," said a first-year student from the Atlanta area and her friend from Tianjin, China. <br> Genetic variety in our food system is the result of thousands of years of farmer and consumer choices, in itself a precious human heritage. Adapted to local climates and all kinds of diseases and pests, the seeds and breeds that have survived until the present day are often hardier, more resilient—and can be more nutritious as well. <br> Crop uniformity is the enemy of resilience. The hardy traits of older, heirloom varieties provide a safety valve. They allow us to breed new, more resilient crops using traits we don't even know we need until disaster strikes. <br> But can we count on those genetic riches surviving today? Around the world, the loss of species to extinction is progressing faster than ever. And this loss includes our seed varieties. <br> Cary Fowler and Pat Mooney in "Shattering: Food, Politics, and the Loss of Genetic Diversity" report that 93% of our lettuce varieties, 81% of our tomatoes, 93% of our carrots and 91% of watermelon varieties are extinct. To be sure, commercial seed catalogs now list many new hybrid crop varieties. But these hybrid seeds do not contain the range of genetic variability of the older, open-pollinated seeds (that is, plants pollinated by birds, insects or wind that "breed true") that reflect centuries of selection. This is a staggering loss of our precious genetic heritage. <br> The best guarantee of a safe food supply as we head toward an uncertain global future is a large number of diverse food producers growing a wide variety of healthy seeds and breeds. But to save this rich biodiversity—of potatoes or turkeys—there needs to be a market. Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of the importance of heirloom varieties, and local farmers markets and even some grocery stores feature multiple varieties. Savoring distinct flavors in special types of vegetables, fruits and meats encourages us to recognize, enjoy and support farmers who are preserving variety. <br> That's why Cora and her husband, Simon, (who came from the chemistry department to our early Thanksgiving dinner) grow a garden with heirloom vegetable varieties. And they order a heritage breed turkey for Thanksgiving even though it costs more. They are willing to spend extra money because, says Cora, "it's tastier, and we'd rather eat meat less often and not get mass-produced and flavorless turkey." <br> So, as you plan your feasts this holiday season, can you add an heirloom vegetable? Try a local specialty? Seek out a heritage breed? Our food future may depend on it.
The Communist Party leaders inside the Zhongnanhai compound in Beijing may have found solace in the Obama-Romney debates: Though China was mentioned 53 times, both presidential candidates avoided harsh rhetoric toward China. <br> Despite Romney's repeated avowal to label China a "currency manipulator" and Obama's branding of China as "an adversary," both sounded moderate and called China a partner, which leaves the door open for building a good working relationship with China's new leaders. The candidates traded jabs on how they would deal with the trade and currency issue but skipped other major controversial topics such as human rights, Tibet and censorship. To Beijing's relief and to American conservatives' disappointment, the highly anticipated "China bashing" was absent from the debates. <br> Also missing was the big picture -- America's relative decline, China's rapid rise and the ensuing power restructuring in the global system. Is the United States ready to cope with an increasingly powerful, confident and yet non-democratic China? The real issue is not whether China is a currency manipulator or not -- after all, the yuan has appreciated more than 11% since 2010 and more than 30% since 2005. <br> Obama's and Romney's narrow focus on trade and currency when mentioning China, which is understandable due to America's lackluster recovery, and their dodging of other major problems between the two countries may be misinforming Americans who, as a result, do not fully understand the nature of this complex relationship. <br> This is a multifaceted relationship, strong but difficult at times. The biggest challenge the two countries face is the power transition between them, as China continues to gallop ahead and is expected to surpass the United States as the largest economy within a decade. Both countries are struggling to deal with the new power structure in the international system. <br> In fact, China is rising so rapidly that it has difficulty adjusting to its newfound power and sometimes behaves clumsily in international affairs as evidenced in China's perceived forcefulness in the recent Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute and South China Sea controversy. <br> U.S. politicians are used to speaking from a position of dominance. Both Obama and Romney claimed they would push China to "play by the rules." Such a condescending approach will not work with today's more assertive and nationalistic China. <br> The United States must play by the rules first. For example, Huawei was recently singled out by Congress as a company threatening U.S. national interests and was essentially declared unwelcome in the U.S. The telecoms giant has businesses globally, including a recent £1.3bn investment in the United Kingdom which would create 500 jobs. In September, Obama issued a rare presidential order instructing Ralls Corp., whose owners are Chinese, to divest itself of four Oregon wind farm projects near a military base, citing a national security threat. But firms operated by other foreign owners in the same area are apparently conducting business as usual. Where is the level playing field? <br> The United States still maintains some Tiananmen-era sanctions against China, including the ban on exports of high-tech equipment and products to China. One wonders how the United States can narrow its trade deficit with China, if it only sells apples and oranges to China? <br> Is China friend or foe? This often-asked question misses the central point that the United States and China are so interdependent that they no longer have the luxury to make such a choice. <br> The two countries are separated by huge gaps in political systems and cultural values, which can be a major cause of conflict. The two governments still deeply distrust each other. Since the Obama administration's implementation of its "strategic rebalancing" toward Asia in 2010, the U.S. government has failed to convince China and many other countries in Asia that its purpose is not to counter China's growing power. America's deployment of more forces in the Asia-Pacific region and beefing up its alliances with China's neighbors smack of a policy of encircling China. Of course containment will not work in this day and age, and Asian countries do not want to be drawn into a great power conflict. <br> It has become politically incorrect to say anything good about China during America's elections. Candidates tend to compete over who is tougher on China. It has become an accepted norm to blame China for America's domestic woes. Such practices may help a candidate to win an election, but they are very harmful to U.S.-China relations in the long term. The United States is at the risk of creating a resentful China during the Asian power's transition to a more diverse and open society. <br> Nothing is wrong with focusing on economic issues now, but Americans should never lose sight of the big picture. As a global leader, the United States has the moral responsibility to help promote democracy, human rights and rule of law in the world. With China in transition, the United States has a great opportunity to help shape the future of a nation with which it will be politically and economically intertwined for generations to come. 
That is part of it, to be sure. But there are many reasons America's 50th state doesn't vote as much as the other 49, plenty of them specific to Hawaii. <br> And, as if I'm not asking enough already, let me know what you think of this list in the comments section at the bottom of the story. If you have other ideas, I may add them. <br> 1. Surfer apathy: I'll start with the obvious one. It's true that some people are so wrapped up in Hawaii's beaches and waves that they don't care about politics. One woman told me politics don't "flow" in oh-so-laid-back Hawaii. A state representative in Maui said he looks at swell reports before Election Day. If the waves are big, he said, he knows turnout will be low.

Egypt is on the roller-coaster of transition. It's a bumpy and hair-raising ride to a destination unknown. But the country is moving. And in that, there's hope. <br> In Tahrir Square last Friday, I was struck by the carnival atmosphere: Vendors sold candied apples and baked yams; young boys hawked red, white and-black hats and flags; a crowd gathered to watch cartoonists chalk an oversized military general dressed as Santa Claus. Activists of all political shades shouted poetry and enthusiastic speeches, leading crowds in chanting: "The people want the end of the military regime!" "The people want a civilian regime!" "We are all one!" <br> But by Saturday, Tahrir Square had become a battleground. Crowds shrunk to die-hards throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, while security forces volleyed tear gas and rubber bullets. From the 18th floor of the locked-down Intercontinental hotel (a barrage of tear gas having abruptly aborted my attempt to speak to those at the edges of the square), I watched as the square cleared out, battles moved to side streets, and then the atmosphere turned quiet. <br> Briefly. Demonstrators regrouped. Political leaders across the spectrum aired televised condemnation of the police and support for the protesters. And people started streaming again through the streets, across a nearby bridge, and back into the square. It was a sight reminiscent of the nail-biting days of January. <br> With such off-and-on violence, and rising numbers of dead and injured, some may wonder if democracy is worth it -- or even possible. <br> Many Egyptians are no longer as beamingly optimistic as they were last spring. Then, they dreamed of blooming democracy and booming economies. Today, they want stability. <br> Tourism has slowed to a trickle, and taxi drivers, hotel workers and souvenir vendors shake their heads at the demonstrators. Capital is fleeing, and foreign reserves drying up. <br> As people speak their minds, many others -- from liberals to conservatives — feel uneasy. <br> Large numbers of bearded men and covered women, demanding a regime based on Sharia law, frighten Christians and Muslims alike. Clashes between Coptic Christians and Muslims create fear that religious strife will rend Egypt's multireligious society. And women especially worry that their freedoms are at stake. <br> Liberals, far less numerous, can also be intimidating. Many in Egypt believe they do not understand or accept "real" Egyptian society and threaten to corrupt it. Last month, a female blogger posted nude pictures of herself and others in a sensational appeal to expand freedom of expression. It led many to complain that too much freedom would corrupt Egyptian society. <br> Anger against America and Israel also worry many. A 20-something Egyptian, working for a foreign corporation in Egypt, pulled me aside in Tahrir Square to explain that former President Hosni Mubarak had known where to draw the line. These people, he exclaimed, gesturing to those around him, don't understand the hadud, or limits. Like others, he said he worries they would trade Egypt's welfare for the Palestinians' cause. <br> But even amid conflict and uncertainty, there's hope. Egyptians who desperately want to escape from nearly 60 years of military-backed authoritarian rule have what it takes to do so. <br> Egyptian nationalism is strong. Airwaves are filled with nationalist songs, and Egyptian flags abound. Friday's calls to end the military regime mingled with expressions of nationalism. Huge crowds chanted in unison: "Christians and Muslims, we're all Egyptians, we are all one," and, most directly, "Ana Masri!" ("I am Egyptian!") <br> There is also strong respect for elections. At Tahrir Square, parties and candidates took advantage of the gathering to distribute pamphlets and urge demonstrators to vote for pro-revolutionary forces. And even with the descent into violence, forces across the political spectrum have urged elections to begin as scheduled. <br> Debates are intense. Egyptians in the square hotly contested the nature of the Egyptian military and goals for the future. The Salafi Hizb al-Nur ("Party of Light") called for a regime based on Sharia law; the Popular Front appealed to secular nationalism; and the Muslim Brotherhood demanded a civilian, democratic regime with respect and freedoms for all. As one in Friday's crowd argued, many Egyptians may need to develop respect for diverging opinions. Yet this is true in many nascent democracies. <br> Political forces also are well-organized. The Muslim Brothers not only can bring people onto the streets, but also send them home when the time is right. They were critical in rallying crowds last week, where they maintained a space for women to avoid being crushed and jostled by men and a pathway for demonstrators to navigate the crowd. And they were instrumental in returning crowds to Tahrir late Saturday night. <br> Other forces, too, are gaining strength. In fact, Tuesday's crowds -- despite the Brothers' refusal to participate in the demonstrations -- show that others, too, can mobilize forces. <br> With a strong sense of nationalism, hotly contested debates, a belief in electoral democracy and organized political forces, Egypt has what it takes to form democracy. It just won't be easy or fast.
In the Republicans' Las Vegas show this week, the headliner turned out to be Mitt Romney. <br> That was a surprise. Many pundits assumed it would be businessman Herman Cain, a wild card who has recently led the field in polls of Republican voters. While media elites and politicians mock Cain's 9-9-9 tax reform plan, everyday voters give him credit for at least having a plan -- and extra credit for the fact that it is easy to understand. <br> By contrast, Romney's economic plan has 59 points. Should Americans really need to hire a team of accountants to understand a candidate's sales pitch? <br> But Romney's major challenge isn't his communication strategy. Instead, it's the same thing that plagued the former Massachusetts governor in the 2008 election: Many Republican voters don't like him, trust him or relate to him. It's not, as some political observers suggest, that they don't think Romney is sufficiently conservative. Rather, it's that they don't think he's sufficiently anything. What does it matter if they agree with what he espouses about issue X or topic Y if they don't believe a word he says? <br> In the CNN debate in Las Vegas, his opponents tried to draw attention to Romney's character by accusing him -- one after another -- of being inconsistent, dishonest and untrustworthy. <br> -- Cain accused Romney of deceptively "mixing apples and oranges" when Romney, seizing on a point made earlier by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, slammed Cain's 9-9-9 plan as adding a tax burden on Nevadans or anyone else who already pays a sales tax. That state tax has to be paid anyway, Cain explained, regardless of what happens at the federal level. Romney seems to have gotten the better of Cain in that exchange, with his joke about how Americans would have a new tax -- and a bushel of both apples and oranges. But the idea that Cain pushed back against Romney's characterization probably also helped reinforce the accusation that opponents direct at Romney -- that he misleads. <br> -- Newt Gingrich tore into Romney for suggesting he had gotten the idea of an individual mandate to buy health insurance from Gingrich. "That is not true," the former House speaker said in a stern voice. The idea actually came from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. Gingrich forced Romney to walk back his comments, and the former college professor seemed to relish his role in teaching Romney a lesson: Don't exaggerate the facts. Gingrich supported the idea of a mandate, but it wasn't -- as Romney claimed -- his idea originally. Gingrich forced Romney to walk back his comments, and the former college professor seemed to relish his role in teaching Romney a lesson: Don't exaggerate the facts. He even tweaked Romney a little, commending his revised version of events with: "That's a little broader. Keep going." <br> Add it all up and you'll see that some of Romney's fellow presidential hopefuls are frustrated and fed up with his tendency to shade the truth. Most politicians do that, of course, but not all of them are equally good at it. Romney excels at it. What he's not so good at is smoothly shifting from one position to another on controversial issues such as abortion or legalizing undocumented immigrants. <br> Romney's inconsistencies grate on his opponents. They see him up-close, on stage and in their face. Look at the Las Vegas debate again and read the body language. It's clear that Romney's opponents would not buy a used car from this man. <br> While some in the media cling to the narrative that Romney "looks presidential," the message sent by some of his opponents this week was simple and direct: buyer beware. <br> To some of the practitioners in his trade, Romney is the worst kind of politician, the kind who will say anything and pretend to be anything to get elected. Remember, it's the view of many Republicans, from conservative radio talk show hosts to members of the tea party, that the current occupant of the White House is untruthful and inauthentic. Plus, many of these people probably don't see the point in replacing Obama with more of the same. <br> That would go a long way toward explaining why Romney -- despite substantial resources, a first-rate campaign organization, head-start in running for president, and the experience of having done it before -- isn't performing better in the polls. He can't seem to get much beyond 25 percent in most surveys, with three-fourths of Republicans opting for the ABR camp: "Anybody But Romney." <br> If Romney ultimately turns out to be the Republican nominee, before he can even begin to convince the American people that he can be president, he'll first have to convince them that he's authentic and that he can be trusted. <br> Good luck with that, Mitt.
With a super committee focused on cutting $1.5 trillion from the federal budget, you may wonder whether we can afford a 3.6% COLA. Some say the increase is overly generous (more on this in a moment). To understand why this is not so, you need to understand how the COLA works. <br> The Social Security COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. Oddly enough, the CPI-W measures changes in the cost of living for workers, excluding retirees and other Social Security recipients who aren't in the labor force. But this measure doesn't accurately reflect the cost of living for seniors. <br> But rather than increasing the Social Security COLA to keep up with escalating health costs, most inside-the-beltway discussions these days revolve around adopting a lower COLA as a way to help close Social Security's modest projected shortfall. The super committee may be considering such a move. This is a terrible idea for two reasons. First, Americans across the political spectrum prefer to restore balance through revenue increases rather than benefit cuts; and second, a COLA cut has the greatest impact on the oldest old, who also tend to be the poorest old. <br> So what's the appeal of a flatter COLA for beltway budget cutters? It's a stealth benefit cut masquerading as a technical fix. The rationale is that the current price index overstates inflation because it doesn't fully account for the ability of consumers to change their buying habits in response to price changes. In other words, if the price of oranges goes up, people will buy more apples and fewer oranges, and this change isn't fully reflected in the CPI-W even though the consumption "basket" evolves over time to put more weight on apples and less on oranges. 
Mitt Romney walked into Tuesday night's Republican debate as the front-runner and, in my view, walked out in an even stronger position. But in retrospect, he and party leaders might wish they could have invoked the Las Vegas rule: What happens there stays there. <br> Romney has frequently been the best of the candidates as a debater. With the exception of Newt Gingrich, he has the firmest grasp of his arguments and knows better how to deploy his facts. While he doesn't convey much warmth, he does signal competence, especially on the economy. <br> But Tuesday night he showed more: He demonstrated that he could take a punch and then counterpunch with considerable skill. When he and Herman Cain clashed over Cain's 9-9-9 plan, Romney won the argument over state tax increases and stuffed Cain with his apples and oranges line. When Rick Perry launched his personal attack on Romney over illegal immigrants, Romney gave at least as good as he got. And he effectively held off both Perry and Rick Santorum when each of them tried to seize control of the microphone from him. All the while, Romney was better than the others on stage at periodically returning to a central theme: getting America growing again. <br> Perry won top honors Tuesday night as the most improved debater. As John King commented afterward on CNN, another stumbling performance might have knocked him out of contention -- but Perry was far better prepared and energetic. <br> This may be a singular view, but Cain struck me as having one of his weaker nights. As all of his rivals jumped on his tax plan, his defenses seemed only to leave a haze of confusion and uncertainty. Public support for his tax plan probably peaked Tuesday night and with that, his prospects seem even more problematic. <br> One other candidate deserves honorable mention: Michelle Bachmann. Her heartfelt support for women threatened with home foreclosure was far and away the most emotionally connective statement of the evening. Why can't more of these candidates show greater empathy toward people who are hurting in this economy? (By contrast, Romney had his worst moment when he seemed cold toward those in foreclosure troubles.) <br> But for those who watched this debate, what stood out more than the performance of any single candidate was the continual outbreak of fights and personal insults. Democrats are used to brawls, but not Republicans. Long ago, as Gloria Borger pointed out after the debate, Ronald Reagan often invoked what he called the 11th Commandment for the GOP: Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican. <br> The candidates trampled all over that commandment Tuesday night. GOP leaders must have been horrified. Who can remember a debate when a Republican front-runner like Romney has been called a liar at least three times in a party debate? When Reagan ran in 1980, he and George H.W. Bush clashed hard over issues, but it was never personal -- and when it was over, Reagan tapped Bush as his running mate. Can anyone imagine Romney tapping Perry? If there is still a Republican establishment, its members ought to call the candidates and tell them to cool it. Call No. 1 should go to Santorum: For a man so far down in the polls to continue launching personal attacks against the party front-runner is both egotistical and self-indulgent. <br> All in all, another strong night for Mitt Romney. But those chuckles you hear are coming from Obama headquarters. 
In a session that turned fiery at times, Republican candidates for president hurled tough attacks at each other Tuesday during a CNN debate in Las Vegas. CNN Opinion asked contributors for their thoughts. <br> William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor and Republican, is the Washington fellow of the Claremont Institute. He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and was director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush: <br> The Republican candidates took off their gloves and let the punches fly at tonight's CNN debate. The interruptions and barbs were frequent and unsettling. Republican voters want to defeat President Obama, not each other, and you could hear it in the frequent boos tonight. <br> That being said, Herman Cain and Mitt Romney, the current front-runners, are not going to be handed the race easily. Cain held his own with his 9-9-9 plan, but he would help himself going forward to provide more detailed, comprehensive analysis directly to the American people during these debates. <br> Mitt Romney, under fire from all sides, showed that he is not afraid to hit back. He also demonstrated leadership by trying to elevate the conversation on the economy and immigration. <br> Rick Perry hurt himself tonight. His direct attacks on Romney stepped over the line. Voters want leadership and solutions and Perry neglected that for cheap shots aimed at Romney. The remaining candidates performed well, especially Newt Gingrich and Michelle Bachmann, but have a lot of ground to make up. Rick Santorum is still a presence and he may have put some holes in the armor of the front-runners. <br> Last week, we expected a full assault on Herman Cain and his economic plan in his first debate as a front-runner in the Republican presidential primary. We got it tonight, apparently after the other candidates took a week to peruse the plan. Cain ended up on the defensive much of the night, mainly on his 9-9-9 plan and the national sales tax proposed in it. Almost every candidate made substantive attacks on Cain, who fell back to characterizing their arguments as "apples and oranges" over and over again. <br> Far more damaging to Cain was his statement to CNN earlier in the day that he would, as president, give serious consideration to swapping out everyone in Gitmo in exchange for a single American hostage. Cain did his best to back away from this, claiming not to have understood it as a question about al Qaeda, but Michele Bachmann took him to task for being "naive" and for abandoning a cornerstone American policy of not negotiating with terrorists. In an interview with Anderson Cooper after the debate, Cain admitted that he "misspoke" earlier in the day. His foreign-policy weakness was fully exposed in this debate, but it remains to be seen how much damage this does. <br> As for Mitt Romney, for once he spent most of the night on defense. Rick Perry and Rick Santorum went after Romney hard, and Perry's attack on Romney for employing illegal immigrants had the former Massachusetts governor rattled for the first time in this year's debates. Perry didn't have a great night, but for the first time he didn't have a bad night, and he remained energetic and on the attack all through the debate. <br> If anyone actually won this debate, though, it might have been Newt Gingrich. He stayed on an even keel, remained positive, and stayed out of the sniping that erupted for much of the first half of the debate. If Cain starts to stumble, Gingrich might be positioned to take advantage of it. <br> Hilary Rosen, a Democratic political strategist and former chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America: <br> The most interesting moment tonight might have been when Michele Bachmann appealed directly to women. It is the first time in this entire election campaign that this has happened -- and in a race where women make up the majority of voters in both the Republican primary and the general election. <br> Beyond that, Herman Cain remains the most refreshing and biggest change candidate. He is still radically uninformed about major issues, but the other candidates could not kick him off the pedestal. Rick Perry was his most animated tonight and yet he still failed, demonstrating again with his bumbling response on religion and his stilted immigration attack that he is just not a good debater. The other Republicans continued their attacks on Romney on issues from health care to flip flopping. That means he hasn't disposed of those weaknesses yet. Overall the most startling thing about the night was the open hostility these people showed for each other. <br> Barack Obama was the clear winner of the debate tonight. This group may be playing to some faction of the Republican Party with these ideas that we should be sending in Drones to catch illegal aliens, that we should not cut any money from defense spending (Ron Paul disagrees), that anyone who's unemployed suffers by their own hand and that the the middle class should be taxed at the same rate as rich people -- but they sure don't speak to the majority of the American people. President Obama, by contrast, has shown that he does understand the cause of the economic meltdown and is fighting for jobs every day. <br> After seeing seven of the Republican presidential candidates go after each other with gusto, the man who really founded Las Vegas, mobster Bugsy Siegel, would certainly have been proud. <br> All of the candidates knew this debate was important, and it was apparent that Herman Cain trying to rub out Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the previous rising stars in the field. <br> But Perry came out firing in his opening statement, declaring that he was the only "authentic conservative," a pointed critique of Romney. When he gave Romney a rhetorical slap over the hiring of illegal immigrants, Mitt grabbed Perry by the shoulder to keep him from interrupting. Perry clearly wanted to be aggressive, but may have crossed the line, appearing to tick off the audience several times with his remarks. Perry was channeling Sonny Corleone, who was always reminded to not be so hot-headed. We know how that ended! <br> Clearly former Sen. Rick Santorum did his best to whack as many candidates as possible, especially Perry over whether the Texas governor wrote a letter supporting TARP. <br> Who played the consigiliere all night trying to keep the peace? Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. At one point I thought he was going to organize a meeting to keep all of the families from going to war on each other. <br> Bachmann? If there was a mob character she resembled tonight it was Fredo from "The Godfather." If she raised her hand one more time to get noticed, Anderson Cooper was going to send her out on a fishing boat. <br> Rep. Ron Paul continued his libertarian rants, and was pretty much the guy in the room who kept bringing up the family business that no one wanted to talk about. Did he actually sully the reputation of President Ronald Reagan by bringing up the Iran-Contra scandal? I'm sure the GOP wishes Paul would pull a Frank Pentangeli and just go away. Quietly. <br> And after it has all been said and done, Romney is like Don Corleone. He has taken lots of shots, was left for dead politically after 2008, but he is still sitting at the top, in control, poised to make everyone kiss his ring as the leader of the GOP "family." <br> Before Iowa, expect all of the remaining candidates to "go to the mat." But in the end, Romney will still has to be knocked off before someone else gets to sit at the top of the family. <br> Alex Castellanos, a founding partner of National Media Inc., which specializes in Republican political advertising and has served as media consultant to the presidential campaigns of Bob Dole, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, Phil Gramm and Mitt Romney: <br> And now, all the GOP candidates have lost their virginity: Everybody attacked everybody else on stage. Only Anderson Cooper escaped unscathed. <br> Mitt Romney did something no Republican has ever seen: He got the best of Newt Gingrich in an exchange of words. Mitt punked Newt on mandates. Romney won the debate tonight and climbed another few rungs higher on the ladder of inevitability. It wasn't a transformational performance but he distanced himself from the field with his command of the contest. Romney still does not connect with Republicans however. He cannot seem to turn his campaign into a cause, at a moment when the country is yearning to change Washington and renew its greatness. <br> Herman Cain met his moment adequately. It is hard to go into a debate on a roll, with high expectations, and not disappoint. Cain met them and came out as he went in, in the top tier. Cain himself may not be a legitimate contender for president yet, but he has grown. He'll get another chance to become more than his 9-9-9-9 plan. <br> Rick Perry, wearing his grandma's orthopedic shoes, remains where he has slid, at the bottom. He came into the debate with doubts about his abilities. He left, creating doubts about his likeability. Perry's slashing personal attacks on Romney made people wince. Lesson for Perry: You don't become president by making yourself smaller. Dragging politics lower than it already is won't get you elected. <br> John Avlon, a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast: <br> Boxing came back to Les Vegas last night -- if you like political combat, this was the best debate to date. All the candidates came ready to fight, including the previously slumbering and stumbling Rick Perry. After the pack descended on Herman Cain's 9-9-9 Plan they turned their fury on the presumptive front-runner, Mitt Romney -- and for the first time, the normally unflappable candidate seemed a bit rattled. <br> Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich proved that they deserve to still be on the stage by unleashing the most substantive attacks on Romney's health care plan and illegal immigration. There were surreal moments like Ron Paul turning withdrawal from Afghanistan into an applause line from a crowd that would have cheered the Bush doctrine a decade ago. There were epic panders like Rick Perry floating the shopworn prospect of defunding the U.N. and slashing foreign aid, which accounts for less than 1% of the budget. And there were head-scratching moments like Michele Bachmann declaring that President Obama "put us in Libya and now he wants to put us in Africa." <br> Overall, Mitt Romney remains the most responsible candidate in the race, but he didn't make major inroads into being better liked by the base. The debate was packed with enough policy substance and personal attacks that a full recap will require cutting the debate into a dozen different themes. But as a first reaction from the floor of the debate in Vegas, this was a fall classic -- seven candidates getting into their groove with the first primary votes less than 100 days away. <br> Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist, a principal at the Dewey Square Group, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton, and former communications director to the Democratic National Committee: <br> The bottom line that one can draw from tonight's Republican debate is actually quite simple. Every candidate on that stage would put Wall Street before Main Street, letting banks and hedge funds write their own rules once again and repealing all protections for consumers that President Obama and the Democrats put in place. None of the candidates on that stage were able to articulate how they would create one job now, and every candidate, starting with Herman Cain and his 9-9-9 plan, supports policies that would have middle class families and workers pay for tax giveaways for millionaires and billionaires and big corporations. Most candidates (excluding Ron Paul here) prefer that families in foreclosure lose their homes, rather than for banks to renegotiate the terms of their loans. <br> Todd Graham, the director of debate at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. He has analyzed presidential debates for five elections: <br> The debate was downright rude at times. Romney finally lost his cool, Santorum and Perry couldn't stop interrupting people, and Michele Bachmann kept yelling "Anderson, Anderson, Anderson" over other speakers with her hand held up in the air like she wanted to be picked for kickball. <br> Ignoring the distractions, one main difference appeared in this debate. The candidates exhibited a united focus when it came to single, specific issues, and this was effective. Because of this, both Cain and Romney floundered at times. <br> For example, the attacks chipped away at Cain's 9-9-9 plan. Cain needed more depth in this debate on his economic plan. Instead, he brought fruit. His responses were no deeper than, "They are mixing apples and oranges." Cain's lack of depth was disappointing. <br> Similarly, this time Mitt Romney was forced to expand his answers, and often failed to provide specifics. Although Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich hammered away at the former Massachusetts governor, Romney still never explained the difference between his Massachusetts plan and the Obama health care plan. When the other candidates were given time to focus on a single issue in this way, Romney finally showed his vulnerability.
This Sunday, as we all pause to honor the mothers in our lives, I have words of advice for men observing the day with the mother of their children: do more. If you’re debating between a spa gift certificate and flowers, get both. If you were planning to take the kids out in the morning so she could rest, take them out for the afternoon too. Mother’s Day should be the biggest holiday of the year and it’s time moms said so. <br> Think about the great dads you know. Easy, right? You probably could come up with some right away. The ones who stand out because they do drop-off at school or cheer at Little League games. The ones who give baths or read books. Now think of the great moms. Harder, right? It’s not because there are so few great moms it’s because, barring a few bad apples, most moms are pretty great. Most moms do drop-off AND cheer at the games AND give baths AND read books and do about a million other tiny things that dads get so congratulated for doing. The bar is set so high for moms that a “great dad” is a dad who is somewhat involved in their kid’s life but a “great mom” would have to go far beyond that to get her accolades. <br> As a dad, my husband worries that raising them in Brooklyn might lead to them becoming Nets fans instead of his preferred Knicks. The end. <br> I don’t begrudge his lack of worry and if I didn’t exist I’m sure he’d have the burden of thinking about most of the things with which I concern myself. But that means that yes, once a year I expect my husband to bring it and celebrate me as the mother of his children. That means he can’t just wake up on the day of and pick a restaurant, it has to be somewhere special, and while I don’t expect a gift (but it doesn’t hurt), I do expect a nice card with words of appreciation for all I do. It’s not about spending money on me. I’d be just as happy with a nice dinner at home, or other free gestures, but I better see real effort. <br> And that’s not even getting into the physical changes that motherhood has wrought. My husband gets to stay mostly the same man he was and that’s in large part because of me. He’s an amazing dad what with his cheering and bath-giving, but fatherhood is just not as involved as motherhood. If there’s an issue with the kids, he hears about it but the details of our kids’ lives get filtered through me. Of course there are dads out there who are full-time parents in the way that has long been the mom’s role. And they should absolutely be commended for it. But for most men, Father’s Day isn’t so much a celebration of what they do as an encouragement to keep doing it. Mother’s Day is different and it’s ok to say so.
Fridayafternoon I was being my normal obnoxious self around the office, pretending to be a stoned philosopher. <br> Dude, like are you aware the earth is just a rock hurtling through space at thousands of miles an hour....we're all just passengers on this ship we call a planet, I said, doing a terrible Jeff Spicoli impression, for a reason I can’t remember. <br> She wasn’t kidding. I saw it in her eyes. <br> Panic is like a gravitational attraction. That's its power. When my coworker said that she wasn't feeling right, I understood what she meant: my pseudo-observation that we are moving, despite feeling as though we are standing still, creates a disorientation that undermines your being. You begin to get a little lightheaded. Try it, just sitting here now – think about the fact that you’re actually moving thousands of miles an hour without a seat belt. I don’t like it. At all. <br> I bring this up only to point out the frailty of the human mind when up against the persuasive power of panic. For the past few months, during that idle hour in the green room before the Five, some of us have talked about that eerie medical story from Cuba, in which several dozen people working for the U.S. embassy in Cuba fell ill - experiencing dizziness, nausea, headaches. Some reported losing their hearing. These symptoms were, as Slate reports in an excellent piece by Frank Bures, medically confirmed - with abnormalities found in the victim’s white matter in their brains. These illnesses were called evidence of health attacks, and some blamed a sonic device, since a few diplomats reported high-pitched noises where they lived. <br> Maybe. You do see this in classrooms - when a student falls ill, others around him do too. If someone smells something odd in a plane cabin and reports feeling dizzy - it tends to spread up and down the rows. I can throw up, depending on the suggestion (“you should read Paul Krugman” works amazingly fast). <br> My rough translation: maybe it’s in their heads, but you can’t say that. <br> Oddly, that brings me to a fairly recent tweet by retired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who called President Trump a serious threat to U.S. national security, because of his perceived inaction regarding Russia's meddling in our lives. <br> There are people now, who would have leaped for joy over John Bolton becoming NatSec Advisor, but who are now condemning such a choice, because Trump did it. Suddenly it’s another sign that we’re heading for war. What’s going on here? <br> Trump's presidency is a self-perpetuating panic attack: the more you hear people expressing panic about Trump, the more panic about Trump there is. <br> My own panic response is always to run—against panic. I worked in health journalism for a while, so my “Spidey-sense” for illogical overreaction is keen. I’ve resisted panics over additives, recovered memories, apples, bacon, climate apocalypses, pseudo-epidemics. One thing I learned for sure: Paranoia is bad for your health. Seeking it out and nurturing it and spreading it is a real public health issue. <br> Panics all share the same characteristics. They are cheap drama, they are caused by nefarious enemies (like Trump), and they areveryemotional. In a way, they even feel good. And, the strategy most often advocated in the media goes like this: Somebody should do something. Panic may not be much, but itissomething. But is it real? Is it justified? If you want to know whether something is a truly horrible problem, or a crazy panic, read up on the world’s worst calamities: Nazism and Communism. Trace them back to their causes. You’ll notice a lack of a panic among Nazi and Communist leaders. Those guys were just calmly doing evil. <br> How did those panics happen? Were people too busy, panicking about other things? I don’t know. But maybe worrying about climate change in an era of Islamic terror could be like worrying about the dangers of the phonograph during the Hitler era.
Occasionally, I will buy a bag of apples from the local grocery store. Most often one can get through the bag without stumbling upon a sour apple, but occasionally, you’ll get a bad apple. It happens. <br> News this week that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly obtained data of more than 50 million users is troubling, but it’s nothing more than a bad apple. Now there are calls to delete Facebook profiles and turn away from authorizing the respected outlets with our data. To that I say, resist. <br> This, of course, only works if there are enough data points to define correlations and predict human behavior. <br> Some internet-ready appliances can alert you when you’re getting low on milk, eggs or even laundry detergent. <br> In short, we are living in a society that values big data and the conveniences that it affords us. As intelligent consumers, when we use Facebook or a loyalty card, we are making a tradeoff between privacy and the value we obtain. <br> In the Masters in Business Analytics program at Wake Forest University School of Business, the ethics of big data is a concept we have imbedded in our program. In our course Analytics in Society, we discuss data privacy, legal issues around data and ethical frameworks for evaluating ethical challenges in the collection and usage of big data. These important concepts should be a part of an analyst’s education.
Yes, CNN staffers have lost their minds. One year of Donald Trump’s America and he’s defeated them as thoroughly the New England Patriots beat, well, just about anybody. <br> We’re a year into the most-biased U.S. media in history – tracking at 90 percent biased against President Trump. But there appears to be lasting damage to journalists, their professionalism and even their ability to pretend they are rational. <br> Celebrity clown and CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta had repeated run-ins with whoever the Trump administration put at the podium. In each case, they smacked him down and showed the lack of depth of his reporting. <br> Acosta wannabe and CNN Political Analyst Brian Karem didn’t do any better when talking to the president’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn. Karem wondered about how we’ve witnessed, “a litany of – of businesses that are going to give back to the American people, but doesn’t – isn't it unfair to give the president credit for that?” <br> Cohn smashed back, pointing out that business executives “feel better about the U.S. economy … and they feel like the lower tax rate allows them to share more of their potential earnings with their employees.” <br> Last, but never least, CNN embarrassment and Anchor Don Lemon found one more way to blame Trump – for the man who made death threats to CNN. Lemon claimed “there’s nothing random about this. Nothing.” <br> Lemon took umbrage at Trump’s use of “fake news” for CNN, somehow forgetting that four of Trump’s Fake News Awards deservedly went to the network. <br> “Some people might try to tell you that this is an apple. It might even start as a joke. But when they say it over and over and over again, and people start to believe it, it's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt,” the ad warned. Then the screen flashed to “Facts First.” <br> 2. What FBI Memo? What Missing Messages? Journalists love to highlight the 18-minute gap in one of President Richard Nixon’s tapes. Give them 30,000 missing emails or 50,000 missing texts and they are less thrilled. Perhaps because both of those involved are liberal. <br> CBS and NBC tried to spin the story away from the missing texts. But when ABC finally decided to chime in, it went full bore against the GOP. Anchor David Muir echoed Democratic talking points about the FBI text messages: “This is a political battle, and ultimately, the American people will decide whether those personal text messages were appropriate or not.” <br> Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter Michael A. Fuoco wrote up his side of the subsequent controversy for Columbia Journalism Review. One thing to note, he’s also president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh/CWA 38061. According to Fuoco, “negotiations with BCI’s union-busting law firm, King Ballow of Nashville, have become increasingly contentious.” BCI owns the paper. The guild also “filed an Unfair Labor Practice charge against the company” because it changed health-care benefits “in the midst of ongoing, albeit glacial, bargaining.” <br> Fuoco quoted the editorial saying: “Calling someone a racist is the new McCarthyism,” and used the opportunity to bash ownership. The same owners who hadn’t agreed to a new contract. “By any objective measure, the editorial was intellectually dishonest and racist, twisting itself in knots in a colossally failed attempt to defend the indefensible,” he wrote <br> Two quick notes. 1) The mayor is Democrat Bill Peduto. Shocker that his former journalist spokesman is anti-Trump. The last time a Republican ran Pittsburgh was 1934. 2) The guild is part of the Communications Workers of America, which is part of the AFL-CIO. The union endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. <br> 4. You Actually Thought Journalists Were Neutral? Part II: The New York Times actually devoted some opinion space to Trump supporters. Naturally, it caused a firestorm with its lefty readers and journalists who think those readers aren’t left-wing enough. <br> CJR’s attack: “The Times’s pro-Trump editorial page is patronizing and circular” at least admitted that the paper has no pro-Trump voices. “In fact, the Times employs many conservative commentators. It just seems to be a requirement that those commentators are never-Trumpers.” <br> 5. To Infinity and Beyond: OK, this was a ridiculous week for journalism. You could hardly move two steps without finding embarrassing proof of media bias or at least evidence of a crazy leftward tilt. <br> Self-described “photojournalist” Askia Muhammad revealed he had taken an embarrassing photo of then-candidate Barack Obama with notorious bigot and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. Muhammad said he “basically swore secrecy” to protect Obama’s career. Proving once more that neither journalists nor Obama told the truth about who he really was.
In the wake of a Baptist church shooting that left 26 people dead Sunday, Democratic politicians and pundits once again took to social media and cable news to denounce those who they deem to be the true monsters in the entire situation – National Rifle Association members and Christians offering thoughts and prayers. <br> The NRA was denounced a “terrorist organization” that was “drenched in the blood” of the victims of gun violence. <br> But as was revealed Sunday, in what is becoming a common theme in these mass shootings, no amount of background checking would have stopped the shooter in Sutherland Springs, Texas from purchasing his firearms, because the federal government failed to do it’s job properly. It’s not the first time. <br> While serving in the U.S. Air Force, shooter Devin Patrick Kelley was convicted of domestic assault against his wife. He pleaded guilty to multiple charges stemming from incidents including physically striking his wife and choking and kicking her. He also pleaded guilty to assaulting his stepson, severely enough to crack the young child’s skull. <br> “Under Pentagon rules, information about convictions of military personnel in crimes like assault is supposed to be submitted to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. For unspecified reasons, the Air Force did not provide the information about Kelley as required.” <br> Because of a law passed in 1996, it’s illegal for anyone convicted a domestic abuse crime to purchase a firearm, something some of our dutiful lawmakers in Congress seem to not be aware of. <br> This also appears to not just be a bad slip in judgment but a systematic problem. The Trace reported: “… the military has no distinct charge for domestic violence, notes Grover Baxley, a former judge advocate general who now practices military law as a civilian. ‘We see this all the time,’ Baxley said. ‘There is no specific domestic violence article.” Instead, military prosecutors charge abusers with other offenses, like assault. A scan of active records shows that the Department of Defense has just a single misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence on file with the National Criminal Instant Background Check System, or NICS.” <br> But even when the FBI has all the data needed to flag someone from purchasing a gun, there have been examples of gross incompetence as well. <br> Roof was not legally permitted to own a firearm due to an unlawful drug possession charge from earlier that year. Roof’s record listed the wrong arresting agency and because of this error, he was able to legally purchase the weapon he used in the shooting. Victims of family members killed by Roof have filed suit against the U.S. government because of this avoidable error. <br> The justice declared that Cho “presents an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness.” Because Cho was never actually institutionalized, his state records were never sent to the FBI database, and he was able to purchase his weapons. Families of the victims settled with Virginia for $11 million in damages over the lapse. <br> It should not matter if these incidences are occurring because of a political correctness stigma around mental health, or just dumb laziness. If federal employees cannot perform the simplest of tasks of enforcing laws already on the books meant to keep people safe, then those employees need to be released and their agencies eliminated.
It was 1982. That is the first Halloween I remember the hum of petrified parents. It was the first time we didn’t get to go trick or treating, no not even one street over. Instead, we had a makeshift party at a neighbor’s house. The TV news turned on low warned of tainted Tylenol. <br> The next year was the first time we took our candy to the police station to be X-rayed to check for needles and razor blades. We heard the adults whisper: “What is the world coming to?” <br> As an adult with children ranging in age from 3 to 22, I have seen just about everything in the ways of Halloween. From the politically incorrect to the religiously correct to the “yeah, just give us some freaking candy,” everyone has an opinion. <br> As I watched volunteers wander into the haunted house at my daughter’s school, I noted that 35 years ago those costumes would have sent me to counseling. My husband whimpered and covered the eyes of our 5-year-old as a cheerleader with high-def cosmetics entered, carrying what was supposed to be her own head under one arm. <br> Everything is more terrifying now, in make-believe and in real life. <br> In the infamous words of Linus in Charles Schultz’s “The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown”: <br> When it comes to Halloween, there are some who will lock themselves away in fear of what might happen, or to nurse their wounds because of what did happen. There are some who lock themselves away in protest. <br> And in this game called Halloween, all that is necessary for us to have something for us to talk about next year. Some grand opinion, some horrific worry, some hill to die on, or some great offense that rocks us to our core and gets us out of bed to write that letter, so that we might be heard.
The Russian nuclear deal continues to be kept under containment by media fearful that it might contaminate their ability to attack President Trump. <br> In the latest development, The Hill reported that, an FBI informant was cleared to testify on the issue. “The Justice Department on Wednesday night released a former FBI informant from a confidentiality agreement, allowing him to testify before Congress about what he witnessed while undercover about the Russian nuclear industry’s efforts to win favorable decisions during the Obama administration,” the newspaper said. <br> “Face the Nation” moderator John Dickerson did end the network blackout of the story Sunday. His CBS report was the first of ABC, CBS and NBC to note the scandal that other outlets have tried hard to discredit. Those 69 seconds continue to be the only mention of the story. <br> That’s 4 minutes, 11 seconds – or nearly four times as much coverage – for the Loch Ness Monster compared to this scandal. And, even if you don’t like the story, it is notable because of all the other media coverage of Russia – 1,000 minutes on Trump-Russia collusion in 2017. <br> 2. Sex Harassment Claims Increase: Claims of sexual harassment and assault are sweeping through the media. Two major names joined the growing list of those accused – NBC and MSNBC Senior Political Analyst Mark Halperin and prominent liberal and long-time New Republic Literary Editor Leon Wieseltier. <br> The allegations are disturbing. “Three of the women who spoke to CNN described Halperin as, without consent, pressing an erection against their bodies while he was clothed. Halperin denies grabbing a woman's breasts and pressing his genitals against the three women,” according to CNN. <br> New Republic’s Wieseltier was set to head up a new magazine named Idea before sexual harassment allegations surfaced. According to Politico: “Wieseltier was also accused of ‘workplace harassment’ on an anonymous list (of men working in the media) circulating … that’s having reverberations in the industry.” <br> HuffPost also targeted Wieseltier in a story headlined: “‘I Was Blind And Complicit and Just, Like, Did Nothing’: New Republic Staffers Speak Out.” <br> Those are far from the only new incidents in media. Director James Toback has more than 200 accusations against him. Celebrity photographer Terry Richardson and tech blogger Robert Scoble were two of the lesser names to be accused. <br> Oddly, in this time of heightened awareness of harassment, TV host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted a picture of herself ogling the breasts of singer Katy Perry. DeGeneres, who came out as gay 20 years ago, commented above the photo, “Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!” She was much criticized on social media after the posting. <br> News outlets celebrated yet another Trump opponent and used the opportunity to talk about the left’s favorite issue – impeaching or removing Trump from office. “CBS This Morning” co-host Norah O’Donnell asked Flake on air about Trump: “If he is dangerous to democracy, as you say, should he be removed from office?” <br> Preston then went on to treat Flake’s attack on President Trump like Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. “This is the type of speech that, I think, tomorrow that should be shown, should be listened to by every high school civics class, politics class, history class and the reason being is we're at a moment in time right now where there's so much divisiveness in the country,” he urged. <br> 4. CNN, MSNBC and Media Fails: Into every life a little rain must fall. That applies to news outlets as well. Both CNN and MSNBC had thoroughly humorous incidents this week in their quest to lead the anti-Trump resistance. <br> Both Daily Caller and BuzzFeed mightily mocked the commercial with the Caller adding to the CNN “Facts First” tagline: “UNLESS WE ARE REPORTING ON TRUMP.” The Blaze’s Dana Loesch won the Twitter commentary wars by snarking: “But what if it’s an apple that identifies as a banana.” <br> 5. Hurray for Hollywood: It’s a tough battle in Tinseltown this week over which star can say the most idiotic thing. First, there’s sometime comedian Kathy Griffin, fresh from hacking a phony Trump head. Now she’s angry at those who abandoned her, including CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who she called “The Spineless Heiress.” <br> Long-time liberal singer/actor Harry Belafonte made the now-common Trump era comparisons to Nazi Germany, noting that “the country made a mistake and I think the next mistake might very well be the gas chamber and what happened to Jews (under) Hitler is not too far from our door.” <br> The CW’s “Supergirl” continues to show its superpower is propaganda. The latest episode depicted Americans as anti-Mexican and anti-gay. The CW’s other superhero show “Legends of Tomorrow” introduced a Muslim superhero from the future. The character was added in a post-election fit of PC pique.
Editor's note:The following column originally appeared in The Washington Times. <br> How do you know when the liberal media meltdown is approaching an apex? Just look for apples, bananas and a strong smell of smug. <br> What CNN reveals with this abject sanctimony is their contempt for the viewers themselves. “This is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that it’s a banana. They might scream banana, banana, banana, over and over and over again. They might put BANANA in all caps. You might even start to believe that this is a banana. But it’s not. This is an apple.” And then the words “Facts First” appear on screen. <br> They must be feeling very, um, special right around now as sole possessors of the truth, as a Harris Poll in May found that 65 percent of voters feel that fake news in the mainstream news media is a big problem. <br> From May 2017, The Hill reported, “Nearly two-thirds of Americans say the mainstream press is full of fake news, a sentiment that is held by a majority of voters across the ideological spectrum. According to data from the latest Harvard-Harris poll … 65 percent of voters believe there is a lot of fake news in the mainstream media. That number includes 80 percent of Republicans, 60 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats.” <br> Consider some recent headlines: Huffington Post: “CNN mistakes sex toy flag for ISIS Flag at London gay pride.” Daily Mail: “CNN anchor mistakes Star-Spangled Banner for French national anthem.” <br> ” ‘Like we don’t have any big giant proof,’ he said. ‘I think the president is probably right to say, like, “Look, you are witch-hunting me. You have no smoking gun. You have no real proof.” ‘ “ <br> The New York Times referred to CNN as having a “unique role as nemesis forMr. Trump.” Really? Also The New York Times: “3 CNN journalists resign after retracted story onTrumpally.” A story with three reporters and one anonymous source. When the target of the hit piece, Anthony Scaramucci, threatened to sue, only then did the network retract and apologize. <br> National Review: “CNN calls attacked Jerusalem synagogue a mosque; equates terrorists with victims.” <br> The Hill reported on CNN’s bizarre reaction about the hunt for the person who dared to make fun of the network: “He is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.” The story, titled “How CNN found the Reddit user behind the Trump wrestling GIF,” quotes from CNN.com: “CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.” <br> The Federalist reminds us of another CNN banana: “A banana is when you run conspiracy-mongering pieces that assert Republicans want to make rape and domestic violence pre-existing conditions in their Obamacare repeal bill when there is not a single word or action that backs up the allegation.”
In fact - it was no secret at all. <br> Click here for a free subscription to Todd's newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! <br> And if the allegations are true - many prominent Mainstream Media organizations and journalists covered up his sickening behavior. <br> Click here for America’s fastest-growing Conservative podcast! <br> These days, Hollywood makes Sodom and Gomorrah look like a Sunday School picnic. <br> Even more disgusting is the outright hypocrisy of liberal celebrities and politicians. <br> But what about the thousands of dollars he donated to their political campaigns? <br> Two candidates who claimed to be the defender of women's rights took money from an alleged predator and they don't have the decency to send back the money?
Steve Tennes, who owns Country Mill Farms in Charlotte, Michigan, has prevailed so far in his lawsuit against the city of East Lansing after it tossed him and his family out of its farmer’s market. A federal district court ordered the city to allow him back in for now, and there’s a good reason for that: The city is unconstitutionally discriminating against Steve and his orchard, and that’s why I joined the lawsuit to fight for his freedom. <br> A second-generation family business, Country Mill grows apples, blueberries, peaches, cherries, sweet corn, and pumpkins. It hosts numerous community and charitable events. And it has sold its produce at the East Lansing Farmer’s Market for many years. In fact, from 2011 to 2016, the city expressly invited Country Mill to participate in the market as an “invitational vendor” because of its exceptional service. <br> At first, the city instructed Country Mill not to come to the farmer’s market because of possible protests. Having broken no law, Country Mill attended the market anyway. No protest materialized, either that week or the rest of the 2016 season. So the city created a policy to exclude Country Mill by incorporating the city’s ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. Of course, Country Mill does not discriminate based on sexual orientation; customers and employees are welcomed regardless of that. Steve simply expressed his belief in marriage’s meaning as taught by the Church. <br> The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to free speech and to freely exercise his or her religion. Yet East Lansing has denied Steve and Country Mill the ability to participate in the public square solely because the city dislikes Steve’s beliefs and his willingness to make public statements about them. That is why Steve reluctantly chose to sue and ask a federal court for an injunction ordering the city to allow Country Mill to participate once again in the farmer’s market. Reasoning that Steve is likely to prevail in his claims, the court granted the injunction on Sept. 15, meaning he can participate in the market for the remainder of the year while his lawsuit proceeds. <br> The city says it isn’t targeting Steve for his beliefs, but that argument fell flat with the court and fails in general. Steve isn’t breaking any law except for the one the city officials intentionally created to exclude him from the farmer’s market. They did this because he doesn’t live his life and operate his farm—22 miles outside of their jurisdiction—according to their beliefs about marriage rather than his own beliefs, which the First Amendment protects.
At the White House male staffers earn more on average than female staffers. That is not news. <br> However, it is ammunition for those looking to take a shot at President Donald Trump using the charge that this administration doesn’t care about women. But a closer look at the White House wage gap reveals that the Trump Administration – like other recent administrations – pays women fairly. <br> CNN decided to analyze this year’s White House salary data (a curious decision since they had not analyzed the previous administration’s staff data). They found that the average salary among male staff was nearly $104,000 compared to $83,000 for female staff. The Trump White House pays women 80 cents for every dollar they pay men. What’s worse, this is 2 cents bigger than the reported national average pay gap. <br> According to analysis by the Washington Post in 2009, women earned $72,700 on average and men earned $82,000. By 2014, both men and women earned about $6,000 more on average, but a $10,000 gap persisted ($78,400 for women and $88,600 for men). By President Obama’s final year in office, all salaries had declined on average ($76,928 for men and $68,658 for women), and the gap remained. <br> Men earned more working under other Democrats as well. Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, Senate office, and the Clinton Foundation all had gender pay differences. Michelle Obama’s White House office paid men significantly more as well. <br> Calculating averages conceals the nuances of the pay at the White House and in the workforce at large. The White House data don’t show that men and women working in the same jobs are getting unequal pay. They do show that there are more men working in higher-paying positions. An apples-to-apples comparison of positions at the Trump White House confirms what previous White Houses have said: there is equal pay for equal work. <br> When the Department of Labor controlled for other factors such as occupation, the number of hours women and men work, and the time women they take off from the workforce, the difference in pay shrinks to a few cents.
The Tennes family has been farming in Michigan for generations. <br> They grow all sorts of crops at theCountry Mill Farm– organic apples, blueberries, pumpkins, sweet corn. <br> And for the past seven years, Steve Tennes and his family have sold their produce at the farmer’s market owned by the city of East Lansing. <br> Last year, someone posted a message on Country Mill’s Facebook page inquiring about whether they hosted same-sex weddings at the farm. <br> Tennes told the individual they did not permit same-sex marriages on the farm because of the family’s Catholic belief that marriage is a sacramental union between one man and one woman. <br> It was brought to our attention that The Country Mill's general business practices do not comply with East Lansing's Civil Rights ordinances and public policy against discrimination as set forth in Chapter 22 of the City Code and outlined in the 2017 Market Vendor Guidelines, as such, The Country Mill's presence as a vendor his prohibited by the City's Farmer's Market Vendor Guidelines, read a letter the city sent to the family. <br> “We were surprised and we were shocked,” Steve told me. “My wife and I both volunteered to serve in the military – to protect freedom now we come home and the freedom that we worked to protect – we have to defend in our own backyard.” <br> “Whether you are a Jew, Muslim or Christian – people of faith should not be eradicated from the marketplace simply because they don’t share the same thoughts and ideas that the government is choosing to promote,” Steve told me. <br> Alliance Defending Freedomfiled a federal lawsuit Wednesday alleging East Lansing violated the constitutional rights of the Tennes family. <br> I warned you about this kind of attack in my new book,“The Deplorables’ Guide to Making America Great Again.”The attacks on religious liberty did not end just because a Republican is in the White House. <br> I commend the Tennes famly and Alliance Defending Freedom for filing a lawsuit. Don’t let up until every last kernel of sweet corn has been restored to its rightful place in the farmer’s market.
On Monday, hundreds of families, friends, colleagues, and loved ones from every corner of the country gathered at the U.S. Capitol for the 36thAnnual National Peace Officers’ Memorial Day to honor the 394 officers who gave their lives in service to their communities. Their names will forever be etchedin hearts and on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial along with the over 21,000 that came before them. <br> Passersby may not recognize these names, but they are the names ofourbrothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and friends. Some were ambushed and executed; some lost their lives responding to a call to save a life or someone who called for help. These are the men and women who gave their lives sowecould, in many cases, keep ours. <br> Tacoma Police Officer Jake Gutierrez from my home state of Washington is one of the many examples of this cost. He lost his life in the line of duty late last year while protectinga woman from domestic violence. Jake was supposed to exchange wedding vows with his fiance just a few weeks later. Instead, she and his three daughters and granddaughter attended his funeral and tried to picture a life without him. <br> Despite the daily acts of selfless courage and commitment to community we see from our members of law enforcement, whether it’s de-escalating a domestic dispute or holding the hand of a dying man after a vehicle accident, this is not the image of law enforcement much of America has come to be familiar with. <br> Instead, our televisions and newsfeeds are dominated by stories that villainize those who do the most on our behalf and attempt to exploit the few bad apples working in law enforcement as representatives of the entire community. <br> The consequences of supporting or allowing this public distortion of law enforcement to continue are grave. We have already seen the repercussions with targeted attacks against law enforcement and recruiting difficulties in law enforcement agencies across the country.
A recent study completed by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that, on average, it takes six months to a year to remove a permanent civil servant in the federal government. Oftentimes, it takes even longer. <br> President Obama’s former VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson testified at a House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs hearing on the Choice Program that it was too difficult to fire a substandard VA employee. In fact, President Obama himself said, “if you engage in an unethical practice, if you cover up a serious problem, you should be fired. Period. It shouldn’t be that difficult.” <br> In the past several years, VA’s civil service rules have hampered the department’s ability to dismiss an employee who engaged in an armed robbery; to recoup $400,000 in relocation benefits from two senior employees who abused their authority; and hold employees accountable for their failures to manage major construction projects, including the new hospital in Aurora, Colorado, that is now several years and nearly a billion dollars over-budget. <br> This kind of behavior would never be tolerated in the private-sector, and is even more unacceptable coming from the men and women who are paid by taxpayers to serve our nation’s veterans. <br> This important bill, which is being considered by the House this week, would provide Secretary Shulkin the tools he needs to swiftly and effectively discipline employees who fail in their sacred mission to provide world-class healthcare and benefits to the men and women who served. <br> This bill would establish a singular expedited procedure for VA employees to respond and appeal to proposed removals, demotions, and suspensions for misconduct. <br> Currently, it can take up to 264 days for an appeal to move through the process, leaving employees in limbo while their appeals are considered. <br> Whistleblowers are critical to the process of uncovering and addressing issues within the department, and I will always fight to ensure they are protected under the law. Additionally, this legislation will provide the Secretary with the direct hiring authority he has requested to hire medical center directors in a more expedient manner. Currently, it takes upwards of six months to fill a position, and this important provision will help fill the leadership vacancies across VA. <br> Every VA employee I speak with tells me good employees want to work in an environment where they know everyone can be held accountable for their actions. <br> Author's note: You can read more about the bill at veterans.house.gov/accountability.
On February 28, 2017 President Trump, while addressing a Joint Session of Congress, once again identified accountability in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a top priority. The President is right, veterans deserve much better. <br> If there is evidence that an employee has broken the law, caused harm to veterans, or have violated the public trust, they should be terminated immediately. Instead, due to overly cumbersome and lengthy arbitrations as well as extensive bureaucratic red tape, VA has not been able to remove employees as quickly as we would have liked. Some employees, like the former VA pharmacist who was stealing medications, have simply retired before VA was able to fire them – allowing them to avoid accountability all together. This is unacceptable. <br> Just a few days ago, one of our Veterans Integrated Support Network directors proposed the removal of another medical center director. These actions are examples of the strong leadership we need to cultivate in VA. There should be no doubt that VA will seek greater accountability going forward. <br> It is critical for us to set politics aside and tackle these challenges together. We won’t succeed with a bill that only partially solves the problem. <br> Accountability is a two way street. We can’t just make it easier for us to fire people, we must make it easier for us to hire people. <br> The VA must be able to compete effectively with private sector health care organizations to recruit doctors, nurses, administrators, and other key staff. <br> If given direct hiring authority, comparable pay, schedule flexibility and the ability to offer competitive recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives, VA will be able to attract and retain world class talent. <br> I am confident that if Congress grants VA additional authority and flexibility, both veterans and our employees will be better served.
Exactly a year ago I travelled to Havana to visit a Cuban friend. I arrived with the usual tourist expectations: Wonderful weather, beautiful people, dazzling American automobiles circa 1955 and, most of all, a society, long dominated by an oppressive communist regime, now opening to the world. <br> My friend lived in one of the better residential neighborhoods of Havana. People there mostly receive remittances from relatives abroad, and are mostly wealthier than their fellow citizens, who subsist on government “salaries” of twenty-five dollars a month. <br> What the neighborhood lacked in amenities it made up for in supervision. As soon as we arrived, I was taken down to street for a social call on an elderly couple who spoke no English (very few Cubans do). <br> The next morning we went grocery shopping. Ordinary Cuban bodegas, I learned, offer only a single brand of the most basic commodities. We went to a fancy grocery that carried a selection of the most basic commodities. There were even a few luxury items. My host was happily surprised to find apples on sale. There was no other fruit available in the produce section that day. <br> Street life was depressing. I have been places where the people seemed poor but happy. Here they seemed poor, beaten down and resigned. <br> We visited the Museum of the Cuban Revolution, where groups of uniformed school children gazed dutifully at photos of Fidel and Raul and Che and the other founding fathers of the regime. <br> My host, a sophisticated and well-educated person, was, I thought, somewhat embarrassed. But she was disinclined to discuss local politics, and not very well informed about the rest of the world. When I mentioned that two Cuban-Americans, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, were then vying for the Republican presidential nomination, she looked at me blankly. “I haven’t seen anything about that on the news,” she said. <br> In the middle of the visit my host came down with a mild infection. I expected I would get a chance to see one of Cuba’s famous free clinics in action. Instead we went to a private pharmacy where she bought an antibiotic under the counter. She explained that nobody who can afford it would dream of going to a government clinic. The doctors and nurses are good, she said protectively, but the clinics rarely have the right medication. <br> The third was on sale in the airport’s only bookstore which was named, with rare candor, “Propaganda.”
Hillary Clinton claims the economy does better with a Democrat in the White House--that’s simply false. <br> The best recent apples to apples comparison is between the tough situations Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama faced when they assumed high office and how the fortunes of America's families subsequently progressed—with Reagan relying on conservative prescriptions and Obama on activist government to fix things. <br> The Gipper faced tough times too—a bruising recession, double digit interest rates and unemployment reaching 10.8 percent. Subsequently, the economy added more than 19 million jobs and employment increased 22 percent. <br> Obama increased taxes and micromanages businesses through an avalanche of new regulations. To pacify a middle class under siege and Americans underemployed or not working at all, he offers more government giveaways, such as writing down college loans and mortgage debt, and incessant preaching that many ordinary folks are victims of racism, sexism and the evil machinations of the well-off. <br> The 7 million American men between the ages of 25 and 54 who are neither employed nor are looking for work are rewarded with food stamps, the earned income tax credit if their spouse is a low-income worker, and federal health care subsidies—and even virtually free health care through Medicaid in many states. <br> Nowadays, Americans are living longer and healthier lives and work is generally less physically challenging, yet the number of adults ages 16 to 64 certified as permanently incapable of working by the Social Security Disability Insurance program now stands at 5.1 percent—about double the figure in Reagan's day. <br> On the campaign trail, Clinton is offering Americans more of the same—$1 trillion in higher taxes to pay for free college tuition, daycare for pre-K children, bigger ObamaCare subsidies, extending Medicare to Americans as young as 50, and several other initiatives. <br> For hard working families, the difference in results is remarkable. During the Reagan years, annual family incomes rose for white Americans and minorities alike—to about $3,900 overall. <br> The social indicators are terrible, too. -- The middle class is shrinking, suicides and drug abuse are up, fertility is falling precipitously, millions of college graduates are in low paying jobs, and home ownership is at a 48 year low. <br> It's time for change. It's time for a Republican in the White House.
A pair of deputy sheriffs got a hankering for some chicken the other day so they decided to drop by a Zaxby’s in Shelby, North Carolina. <br> Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a must-read for conservatives! <br> Several workers in the back of the kitchen allegedly began hollering at the law enforcement officers and calling them names. And one of the workers allegedly tampered with one deputy’s meal. <br> “It is tough enough to watch my husband put on his uniform and go out into a world full of hate towards cops, all the while I sit home and worry if he will return home safely,” she wrote. <br> “I have pretty much kept my mouth shut, publicly, about the status of our country these days – but enough is enough,” she declared. <br> She went on to describe how the workers did something to her husband’s lunch – making it inedible. <br> Capt. Joel Shores said the department reached out to Zaxby’s and they’re mighty sorry about what happened. <br> The workers were not identified – but it’s safe to say if the allegations are true, their chickens are about to come home to roost. <br> Sounds to me like somebody just got thrown under the chicken coop. <br> The owner of the local franchise told The Shelby Star that they are “very big supporters of the community and law enforcement and all first responders.” <br> The sheriff’s department seems to be satisfied with Zaxby’s handling of the issue. <br> “Zaxby’s cannot be judged on a few bad apples,” he added. <br> But if it’s all the same – the next time the deputies get a hankering for the Gospel Bird – they should consider dropping by Chick-fil-A.
Lisa Belkin, chief national correspondent for Yahoo News and former New York Times correspondent, wrote this week that 29 years ago, Donald Trump made a pass at her at a party in New York. <br> Is this relevant to Trump’s suitability as president, she asks rhetorically, and answers with a resounding, “of course it is. “The argument to the contrary —which comes down to ‘but everyone from Jack Kennedy to Bill Clinton’s 'cherished’ women”— is specious.’” <br> “[Trump’s] I’m-rubber-you’re-glue approach to bad behavior around women has a few weak spots, however. First, two clear wrongs don’t make anything right. Second, Bill Clinton is not running for president. And, finally, times have changed. What Bill Clinton did was clearly unacceptable at the time, but it is even less acceptable now, an ironic legacy of his behavior.” <br> Take a look. <br> We all learned that saying in second grade. At the same time we learned that two rotten apples and an overly fresh orange don’t make three oranges. <br> 2. Bill Clinton isn't running for president. <br> 3. If Belkin's changing times, changing mores argument means anything, it is a defense of Trump, not an indictment. <br> 3.5 Chief correspondent Belkin did not mention, by the way, that when The Donald attempted to hit on her, he was a Democrat. 
If there is one group that best represents the need for high, consistent educational standards in our public schools today, it is the military family. <br> Military families, like others, want their children to have the best education possible. But consider this fact: Military families move an average of six to nine times throughout a child’s K-12 life. That’s a new school every year and a half to two years. <br> Having grown up on a military base, I know this places significant stress on military children. <br> If moving was not bad enough, military families know the quality of the public schools surrounding our bases is extremely uneven. This makes the strain even worse. After all, no one wants to send their kids to a bad school. <br> Fortunately, the military has heard these concerns. Now, the branches are starting to do something about them. <br> For example, say a child receives a passing grade in algebra in Arizona. If the family moves to Georgia, the Compact ensures the student doesn't have to retake the class. The Compact finally went into effect in all 50 states in January 2015. <br> At apressevent with militaryfamilies,Odierno was asked what local politicians could do to keep military bases open. He responded, “[T]hey better start paying attention to the schools thatareoutside and inside our installations. Because as we evaluate and we make decisions on future force structure, that will be one of the criteria.” <br> Thestudy had one major conclusion. Itfound that since every state uses different standards, it was impossible to compare the schools across borders. In short, you couldn't compare Arizona's nine schools with those in Texas or any other state. <br> The Common Core lays out a path that ensures students gain the knowledge and educational skills necessary to succeed in college, career and life. It also allows for apples-to-apples comparisons of school performance across state borders.
Everyone knows the meaning of the word “hypocrite” and no one can claim absolute constancy when it comes to living a life consistent with one’s stated values. But in this election year, hypocrisy is on full display. It is now being practiced with neither shame nor irony by leading Democrats, who once forcefully argued positions they have now abandoned. <br> That seems to fit Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Vice President Joe Biden (hypocrite-Washington), who now take positions opposite ones they previously took with apparent conviction when it comes to hearings and votes on a president’s nominees to the Supreme Court. <br> That speech came 543 days before the 2008 election. Schumer now says the Senate should hold hearings and that the full Senate should be allowed to vote on President Obama’s forthcoming nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, though fewer than 300 days remain before this year’s election. Schumer brushes off charges of hypocrisy, saying any comparison of his position then and his polar opposite position now is “apples and oranges.” <br> Vice President Biden is also caught in a hypocritical trap of his own making. In 1992, while serving as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden said that in the event a vacancy on the Supreme Court should occur during a year when President George H.W. Bush was seeking a second term, Bush should “not name a nominee until after the November election is completed.” Biden also took the exact position then that the current chairman of the committee, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), is taking now. In 1992, Biden said his committee “should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over.” <br> Well, yes. <br> This helps explain why so many people hate Washington and why everyone gets my lecture circuit laugh line: “I’m from Washington, D.C., where the only politicians with convictions are in prison.” <br> It is a label that is commonly and increasingly bipartisan.
Tuesday, February 23marks another important deadline in the struggle between the White House and Congress over closing the detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. <br> President Obama spoke forcefully Tuesday morning, declaring that he is “absolutely committed to closing Gitmo.” Anyone who listened to the president cannot doubt his passion for this issue and his commitment. <br> While Guantanamo got off to a rocky start in 2002, today it’s broadly recognized as one of the world’s best run prisons. I know because I’ve been there dozens of times while a Pentagon spokesman. And it’s kept us safe from another 9/11. Closing it without a better plan to protect Americans is misguided and endangers us all. <br> Why? Because transferring Gitmo detainees to the U.S. mainland would be a public safety nightmare. <br> First, because judges could let the detainees go free. Many of the current detainees are held under indefinite detention status since the United States didn’t have battlefield detectives chasing Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives in Afghanistan and Pakistan.That means we can’t convict them in court. Just like we could not we convict 400,000 Nazi prisoners detained here during World War II. Such a suggestion would have been ridiculous. <br> Don’t believe me? Just Google the name Ali Al-Marri. He went from an Illinois-based Al Qaeda sleeper cell agent trained in poisons, to a detainee held at the Navy’s Charleston Brig, to a free man in Qatar. <br> Second, sending Gitmo detainees to the U.S. mainland would only change the zip code, while putting local communities in places like Colorado, Kansas and South Carolina at elevated risk for violent protests at best, terrorist attacks at worst. Think of a hybrid blend of Ferguson, Baltimore, Chattanooga and San Bernardino. <br> In addition to fighting off Team Obama from just down Pennsylvania Avenue, Congress also must engage the American people on why Gitmo should remain open for business. <br> But we need many more to follow their lead. As they’ll tell you, it’s not easy to block an administration that picked the closure of Gitmo as Priority No. 1, since Day One. And this isn’t exactly a White House that’s famous for compromise, to boot. <br> And our elected representatives should also help to expose the fuzzy math on actual Gitmo costs. The White House intentionally keeps the per detainee figure high through the excessive number of 2,000 troops who are deployed to Guantanamo for less than 100 detainees. Together with satellite TV, four catered Halal meals a day, Wii-Fits and other amenities available to the detainees, Gitmo costs are the biggest fraud, waste and abuse in modern military history. And yet, how many trillions of dollars did the 9/11 attacks eventually cost? <br> Ideally, our current commander in chief would take the hint from Congress and just give it a rest. But since that doesn’t appear likely, we need our Senators and Representatives to hang tough. Ladies and gentlemen of the Congress we’re counting on it.
The holiday season is in full swing. There's already been Black Friday and Cyber-Monday shopping. And now there’s a day to think about giving back: #GivingTuesday. <br> #GivingTuesday invites you to think of yourself as a philanthropist, even if you’re not a millionaire, even if you’re struggling to make ends meet. (The word philanthropist actually comes from the Greek words for “loving” and “people.” At its most basic, it’s about kindness and what we do for others.) <br> This year, national and regional #GivingTuesday campaigns are running in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Kenya, Latin America, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain and the United Kingdom. <br> 1. Volunteer at a local shelter. On the very first #GivingTuesday, there was a contracting company in Philadelphia that volunteered its staff to clean windows at a local homeless shelter. One of the volunteer workers said he had never been asked to be part of the “giving chain,” and he wouldn’t have to be asked again. He would be returning to help on his own next time. So if you’ve never been asked, we are asking now: Get together with friends or colleagues and volunteer your time (and elbow grease!) with a local shelter or food bank. (And if you can’t actually volunteer on #GivingTuesday, make a public pledge to do it when you can.) <br> 3. Give at the office. If you know a co-worker is having a rough time, ask her to take a walk around the block with you at lunchtime; a little fresh air, some pleasant conversation and maybe some window shopping will give her a chance to recharge. Bring in some of the extra apples you picked over the weekend or a bunch of flowers you plucked from your garden — a healthy treat will brighten up the whole office. <br> If you have a personal story about supporting a nonprofit, enter the #MyGivingStory contest at GivingTuesday.org/mygivingstory.
There are moments when the fear center of the brain takes over and all other cognitive functions cease. And this fleeting response can lead us to do exactly the wrong thing, to run into the fire instead of away. That is what we are living through in a policy sense. <br> America is too strong and too great to be frozen in the fear of moment. That makes the governors knee-jerk refusal all the more bewildering and counter-productive. <br> Let us be clear about who these refugees are: the victims of ISIS. These are people who have been violently driven from their homes, threatened with death, with having their daughters and sons taken from them, who have been labelled, sometimes literally, as enemies of the Islamic State. Among them are the Yazidis, victims of ISIS genocide, Christians and Shia Muslims, marked for religious extermination, as well as so many other targeted groups. <br> The United States, in particular, has earned a global reputation as haven for the oppressed. America has stood like a beacon of light for generation after generation of refugees, from the wars of Europe, from anti-Semitic violence in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, from Communism in Cuba and Southeast Asia. And these are only a few of the man-made disasters that washed political refugees onto American shores. <br> There are, of course, reasonable apprehensions that policy-makers might have, but the vetting process for the refugees the United States receives is very careful and comprehensive. It has been used, and honed, over hundreds of thousands of cases. Unlike Turkey and Jordan, where millions of refugees have poured across borders, or even Europe, the United States has the luxury of control and choice. That does not mean that a bad apple might not get through, but, just like we do not stop eating apples out of fear of one bad one, we should not refuse to do what we know, from history, makes America stronger. <br> There are also moral and humanitarian reasons for welcoming these poor, blameless victims of terror. It is the right thing to do, the moral thing. But most of all, it is the smart thing. Accepting the refugees makes us more safe, not less. <br> Alberto Vourvoulias-Bush is former managing editor of foxnewslatino.com and the former executive editor Impremedia and El Diario/La Prensa.

Friday, forecasters expect the Labor Department will report that the economy created 190,000 jobs in October—that’s well below the 260,000 averaged in 2014. <br> So much depends on the circumstances in which each president governs. For example, does his party control one or both houses of Congress and more importantly, what was the state of the economy bequeathed by his predecessor? <br> Obama confronted a terrible financial crisis and endured a punishing recession. Unemployment peaked at 10 percent in his first term, but since the economy has reclaimed and added 12.6 million jobs and employment is up 9.8 percent. <br> The reason Reagan was able to create so many more jobs—in a much smaller economy—is quite simple. It wasn’t just lower taxes and less spending but rather, a reliance on private decisions to guide recovery. He cleared a path for businesses, large and small, to invest as they deemed fit and raise wages as they decided they could afford, and encouraged the unemployed to get out and look for work. <br> Through the first 25 quarters of Obama’s recovery, GDP growth has averaged 2.1 percent, whereas during the comparable period for Reagan, GDP advanced at a 4.6 percent annual pace. <br> The 7 million men between the ages of 25 and 54 who are neither employed nor are looking for work are rewarded with food stamps, the earned income tax credit if their spouse is a low-income worker and federal healthcare subsidies—and even virtually free health care through Medicaid in many states. <br> Despite the fact that Americans are living healthier and longer lives and work is generally less physically challenging, the percentage of adults ages 16 to 64 certified as permanently incapable of working by the Social Security Disability Insurance program now stands at 5.1 percent—about double the figure in Reagan’s day. <br> For hard working families, the results are predictable—annual family incomes have declined about $1650 during the Obama years, whereas those increased $3900 during Reagan’s tenure.
As a non-Muslim, I have great empathy and respect for Muslims in the Western World. The overwhelming majority are good, decent people with a firm grasp of right and wrong.They care about their children, they strive to be responsible citizens, and they have absolutely no desire to harm anyone else.Pockets of bad apples exist among all groups, but the truth is, the Muslim community doesn’t deserve to be maligned, smeared or have their patriotism questioned. <br> But this “truth” is clouded by the smoke billowing from the ashes of the Twin Towers, the barbarism of ISIS,the smoldering pyre of caged victims burnt alive, the fanaticism of Al Qaeda, the carnage of Charlie Hebdo, the butchery of Boko Haram and the ongoing plague of Islamic terrorism. <br> By definition, “Islamophobia” refers to an irrational fear of Islam. For many non-Muslims, a fear of Islam seems very rational, because thousands of terrorists are committing unspeakable acts of evil, and they are doing so in the name of Islam. <br> Public Relations is strictly outcome-based, meaning it’s independent from true and false. In a perfect world, perception and reality would perfectly overlap, but this world is far from perfect.Whether or not a perception is true (or untrue) doesn’t matter; the reality of the perception is what matters, and PR is an outcome-based endeavor.Think of it like this: Your actual character is what God/Allah knows about you; your reputation is how people perceive you.Ultimate truth is the province of the Almighty; public perception is the province of all of us. <br> Public perception matters because how you’re perceived impacts professional opportunities, social interactions and your quality of life. Positive PR diminishes unfair stereotypes, removes obstacles and fosters goodwill – and that’s in everyone’s best interest. With this in mind, here’s common sense P.R. advice for Western Muslims: <br> 2. Differentiate mainstream Islam from radical Islam, and publicly “excommunicate” radicals from your religion. In explicit terms that are utterly impossible to misconstrue, demonstrably “divorce” the radicals from any connection to mainstream Islam – with no qualifiers, exceptions or equivocations. Explain that you love your faith because it helps you be a humbler person, a more loving parent and a better citizen. Then declare that you wholeheartedly reject the radicalized interpretations espoused by the terrorists, because slaughtering innocent people, stripping citizens of their civil liberties and trying to force your views on everyone else is the antithesis of true Islam. It’s arrogant, destructive and evil – and as a Muslim, you deplore it. <br> 4.Vow to fight Islamic-inspired terrorism to the best of your ability. Other Westerners want to be reassured that this fight matters deeply to you – that you have no desire to be subjected to a fanatical interpretation of Sharia law.You value religious freedom, love your neighbors and think it’s absurd that fanatics are battling to the death because they disagree about what happens after we die.The primary victims of radical Islam are Muslims, and we must all stay unified in the West to banish this scourge from the face of the earth. <br> Harper Lee wrote inTo Kill a Mockingbird, “Sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of [another].” The same could surely be said of the Torah, the Koran or any Book of Scripture. Evil can be committed in the name of any faith or any cause, but when it’s committed in the name of your specific faith, you have a specific obligation to specifically condemn it. It’s the right thing to do.
At Walmart, our purpose is saving people money so they can live better; because saving money means that families have more for what really matters: new clothes for school, healthy meals for the family and savings for a rainy day. <br> This mission has been true from the day Sam Walton opened his first store in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962, and it remains true as we have grown into a company with more than 11,000 retail locations in 27 markets. Lowering the cost of products we purchase and investing those savings into everyday low prices for our customers so that everyday needs are affordable and simple joys accessible is also why we support free trade. <br> Trade agreements lower the price of goods for our customers by removing tariffs and other barriers that add additional costs to the products on our shelves. Unfortunately, around the world the highest tariffs are often on the products our customers need most—food, clothing and shoes—with the highest tariffs on every-day products. For example, in the United States, high-end Italian loafers are charged a 12 percent duty whereas kids’ sneakers can face up to a 48 percent duty. <br> In Japan, we operate 374 stores and have over 18,000 associates under our Seiyu brand and export a number of products like pork, beef, cheese, ice cream and french fries directly to those markets. Unfortunately, these U.S. products face very high tariffs -- up to 38% for beef and 27% for ice cream -- which make them more costly for our customers. <br> Opening these markets is not just good for our customers, it’s vitally important for our suppliers, many of whom are looking overseas to find new markets for their products. <br> For example, U.S. exports of fresh apples to the TPP countries face tariffs as high as 17 percent. Under the TPP agreement these tariffs will be cut, offering new market access opportunities to U.S. apple producers and exporters. Walmart alone exported about $73 million dollars of produce such as apples, pears, grape and cherries to our retail markets abroad last year. <br> TPA is a procedural tool that streamlines the process for Congress and the administration to work together on trade deals. Through TPA, Congress sets the negotiating priorities for trade agreements. This enables the United States to speak with one voice on trade, with clear, defined objectives. TPA also provides confidence to our negotiating partners that the agreements we negotiate won’t be changed when they are considered by Congress. <br> The bottom line is trade is good for our customers here and abroad and for our suppliers who want to crack open new markets. While it is procedural, TPA is crucial to new trade deals and the sooner we pass it, the sooner we can help everyone save money so they can live better.
Whether we like it or not, the law requires that we pay taxes. Unfortunately, a significant number of federal workers have failed to do so and are responsible for $1 billion in unpaid taxes. Those charged with the stewardship of our federal resources and programs should not be among the most delinquent taxpayers. <br> This week the House of Representatives will consider two bills to hold federal employees and federal contractors accountable for their tax delinquent status. The bills provide that individuals with seriously delinquent tax debts would be ineligible for federal employment or federal contracts. Those who are in the process of making a good faith effort to fulfill their tax obligations will not be affected by the legislation. <br> Even more troubling is the growth of the problem. In the last ten years, the dollar amount of past-due taxes owed by federal government employees has nearly doubled. Meanwhile, bonuses have flowed freely. From October 2010 to December 2012, 2800 federal employees who had disciplinary issues received more than $2.8 million in bonuses. Of those, more than 1,100 did not pay their own taxes and were still awarded with over $1 million in bonuses. It’s clear that consequences for tax delinquency are needed. <br> In addition to tax delinquency rates in the federal workforce, we also have a problem among federal contractors. A July 2014 GAO Report indicated federal contractors in the Department of Defense alone owe more than $350 million in back taxes. Given that the federal government spends more on contract employees than on public employees, this is a significant problem. <br> It is an honor and a privilege to serve in the federal workforce and it is disheartening that so many federal workers are behind on taxes. These employees are not exempt from their civic responsibility to fulfill tax obligations and those who refuse to pay what they owe should be held accountable.
Much is being made of HGTV’s decision to cancel a previously announced new series, Flip it Forward, because its stars, twin brothers David and Jason Benham, had expressed their faith-based, pro-life values and belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman. <br> Look… HGTV is a private entity that can make whatever decision it chooses regarding its network and business operations, however, it has become extremely disturbing to me that media personalities and social groups have equated the Benham brother’s support for traditional marriage to racism. <br> The same race/gay comparisons were made after the firing of Mozilla CEO, Brendan Eich, who supported California’s Proposition 8 campaign to not redefine marriage. <br> I am a registered Democrat, I love gays, I have gays in my family, and I value tolerance and inclusion, but the national dialogue regarding gay rights, abortion, and free speech have gone way overboard. <br> There are millions of religious Americans, like me, who love gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, and love women who’ve had abortions, but believe that heterosexual relationships are biologically, physiologically, and spiritually unique and therefore should be reserved for the union identification of marriage and that life begins at conception. <br> Societal structures exist throughout our culture and I believe heterosexual unions should be one of those structures that are preserved for marriage between a man and woman. <br> The argument that race and sexual orientation are the same is like comparing apples and oranges. Just because civil rights for gays and ethnic cultures have been debated in public policy doesn’t make them the same. <br> However, sexuality, including homosexuality and heterosexuality, refers to intimate personal behaviors. <br> Thankfully, our nation has moved away from its hateful past regarding slavery, and we rightly speak out against discrimination. But holding to traditional marriage is not discriminatory, it is respectful of an important societal structure that has been recognized throughout our world’s entire history. For example, I’m not allowed to use the women’s restroom… that rule isn’t discriminatory, it is respectful of a societal system and structure. <br> America’s First Amendment gives us the right to disagree on marriage and abortion, so we should learn to coexist and live together in harmony. <br> I’d personally like for everyone to be a Christian, but that doesn’t mean that I criticize those who don’t agree with me. <br> It is my First Amendment right to live out my faith-based conviction on marriage and abortion, and I would ask the media and the nation to be tolerant of me and the millions of other Christians who share my belief.
Editor's note: The following column by Ben Velderman's column originally appeared on EAGnews.com, the website of the Education Action Group. <br> Bush was a charter school advocate years before most Americans had even heard about the alternative public schools. Through the work of Bush and other leaders, there are more than 5,200 charter schools in the U.S. that serve an estimated 1.7 million students. The schools can be found in 41 states, including Florida, where Bush helped establish the very first charter back in 1996. <br> [pullquote] <br> And to benefit those students who stay in the traditional system, Bush has been a champion for tougher teacher evaluations and merit pay plans to ensure that government-run schools are being staffed by the best individuals possible. <br> However … Bush is jeopardizing 20 years’ worth of hard-won school choice successes by stubbornly promoting and defending the Common Core math and English learning standards. He doesn’t seem to realize that the one-size-fits-all standards are likely to have the practical effect of making instruction in all types of schools – public, public charter, private and even home schools – depressingly similar and mediocre. <br> A high price to pay <br> They’re also convinced Common Core will lead to more “rigorous” instruction, which will produce high school graduates with better “critical thinking” skills. Those better-prepared graduates, the theory goes, will boost the struggling American economy. <br> Common Core supporters spend much less time talking about the other, larger goal of the nationalized learning standards, which is to create a uniform K-12 system that synchronizes grade-level instruction among the states. <br> According to this theory, public education is just a few years away from historic possibilities that could finally restore America’s K-12 greatness. <br> Meanwhile, implementation of the standards throughout the nation has not gone well. Teachers don’t understand much of the material, so students have little chance of grasping it. Standardized test scores have dropped significantly in early Common Core states. Millions of concerned people, including teachers, union officials, school administrators and parents have become highly critical of Common Core over the past year or two, and numerous state legislatures are debating the idea of dumping the standards altogether. <br> As writer James Pethokoukis put it last summer, “In a startling turnabout, an education record that has looked to be an unvarnished plus for Bush may now be a liability. Long viewed as a potential contender in the 2016 presidential race, Bush has taken considerable heat from activists on the right in recent months for his support of the Common Core. <br> And even if Common Core were to prove ultimately successful, it will come at a huge cost. <br> Creating carbon copy schools <br> Hillsdale College professor Terrence Moore argues the Common Core could conceivably lead to the creation of fewer “classical” charter schools – those steeped in the classics of Western thought – throughout the U.S. <br> Moore also warned existing classical schools might become so consumed with trying to meet the expectations of the Common Core-aligned state assessments that they might have to “stop what they’re doing and have to teach to the test in order to prepare students.” <br> That reality is already settling in for at least one charter school leader. <br> “PARCC (a Common Core-aligned test) is truly the enforcement mechanism that will coerce schools into adopting the Common Core curriculum,” Anderson wrote in an email to conservative columnist Michelle Malkin. “We cannot do this. It is entirely against the mission and philosophy of our school.” <br> Schools will be pressured to cooperate <br> “Students in every state take the high-stakes college admissions exams, the SAT and the ACT, as well as the newly designed GED, the high school equivalency test used as an alternative way to get a high school diploma. And all of those exams are going to be aligned to the Common Core standards, at least that is what their respective owners say.” <br> The unavoidable effect of Common Core on all types of schools is obvious: Any institution worth its salt will do whatever is necessary to help students continue their education at a college or university. And according to the new rules of the game, that means making students fluent in Common Core, if for no other reason than to pass the ACT and SAT tests. <br> The bottom line is this: Jeb Bush has spent a career extolling the right of families to send their children to the school that best meets their needs. <br> What’s the point? <br> We suppose that’s true. You can’t harm something that no longer exists.
The advent of a New Year typically signals renewal — the portent of spring. But the promise of a “new start” is diminished for many, as millions across America are scrimping to make ends meet. <br> We must become that America again that welcomed those yearning to be free, those seeking opportunity and those who believed in themselves. <br> There are signs of more serious trouble ahead; the business creation rate, which climbed or stayed stable throughout the recession and into the “recovery,” has fallen the last two years. This suggests America is no longer creating the new small businesses that will employ the workers of tomorrow. America’s great companies and biggest employers – the Apples, Walmarts, and others – all began as small startups. Blocking those small businesses from getting started will hurt badly down the road. <br> In its ill-calculated actions this administration has advanced a variety of laws, dictates and regulations that have increased government’s power, but made the governed powerless; allowed bureaucrats to have increased control, but made we the people the controlled; and endowed Washington and Wall Street with taxpayer money to flourish, while making those of us in Main Street suffer under increased taxation and the imposition of Obamacare. <br> What’s happening to the land of opportunity — to a land where hard work was rewarded, and where anyone could build a better future for the next generation? What has happened to the American Dream? <br> I’m saying we need a comeback, a real one – one sustained on self-responsibility, rugged individualism and the spirit of market capitalism that typified America’s most industrious, most prosperous epochs. It’s time for an agenda that renews and restores the American Dream. <br> Reforms like this will make it easier to start and grow small businesses — without crushing taxes and regulation to cope with. Today, costly mandates prevent many entrepreneurs from pursuing their dreams, and make it harder for low-skilled workers to find jobs. New industries, processes and technologies make it easier for people to innovate and take control of their lives — if Washington will get out of the way. Washington needs to recognize that and empower people to do so. <br> We must become that America again that welcomed those yearning to be free, those seeking opportunity and those who believed in themselves. We must not rise up against the immigrant seeking opportunity, but rise up against a government that would stifle opportunity. <br> Share the dream. To do that, we must be a free people and a free nation — a government of the people, by the people and for the people, again. <br> Daniel Garza is president and chairman of The LIBRE Institute.

Are you afraid of the Obama White House? If you challenge the president’s beloved health care plan, maybe you should be. Consider the fate of William White, the Washington, D.C. Insurance Commissioner, who voiced skepticism about President Obama’s hastily assembled “fix” for the millions losing their insurance policies. <br> Telling the truth about ObamaCare is risky. <br> [pullquote] <br> Not long after, budget chief Peter Orszag issued a further warning to the CBO, saying it should guard against “exaggerating costs and underestimating savings.” <br> Pity the poor insurance companies (if you can.) Hauled into the White House only after the president decided to live up to his promise that Americans could keep their existing insurance, they were effectively thrown under the ObamaCare bus. <br> They have seen how this White House functions. Early in ObamaCare ’s sorrowful struggle, insurers like Anthem Blue Cross in California dared whisper the truth – that they were forced to raise rates because of the ACA mandates. The company found itself targeted by the president on a “60 Minutes” segment, and then required to justify its rate-setting by HHS head Kathleen Sibelius, who also demanded the firm explain where the increased revenues would be spent – an unheard-of intrusion. <br> Insurers must be scared to death. They’ve seen what can happen when a collaborator – like one-time golden boy Jamie Dimon – turns foe. The president once called JP Morgan CEO Dimon “one of the country’s smartest bankers” – but that was before the former Obama supporter went public in his disdain for what he called the White House’s “constant attack on business.” <br> Now the bank – one of the few that didn’t need TARP but was required to take it -- is the subject of numerous wide-ranging investigations and has been hit with unprecedented fines and demands for admission of wrong-doing. Lost in the witch-hunt has been the reality that the government’s charges of mortgage misbehavior mainly stem from the activities of Washington Mutual, the largest bank ever to fail in the U.S. <br> You don’t have to be a large corporation – or be located in Washington – to be scared of the Obama administration. The tone set by the White House has percolated down, spreading fear throughout the country. The IRS targeting of conservatives came out of Cincinnati, though it appears to have received the blessing of the White House. Any place where the Obama liberal pro-union agenda meets opposition – such as in Wisconsin – is fair game. <br> But - the White House is especially quick to chase down those critical of the president’s signature healthcare bill. Even Edie Sundby, the stage-four cancer patient who dared to recount in an op-ed how she lost her insurance, courtesy of the ACA, came under attack. Instead of the stage props usually positioned behind the president as he invokes the wonders of ObamaCare , here was a real person with a real ailment whose prospects were seriously threatened by the new insurance mandates. <br> Pretty small beans to attract the attention of the White House. But, when your signature law is a colossal failure, doesn’t make economic sense and threatens your much ballyhooed “legacy,” silencing the critics becomes a full-time job. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

We are so programmed by our history with race in America that reaction to the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murdering Trayvon Martin depends largely upon one's individual, even group experience. <br> If you are white, or Hispanic, you could possibly see the trial as something whipped up by the always racially conscious media and rhetorical bomb-throwers like Rev. Al Sharpton. <br> [pullquote] <br> Your view would be reinforced by a case in Georgia in which four African-American teenagers beat a 36-year-old white man as he emerged from a gas station convenience store. While trying to escape, the man stumbled into the middle lane of a highway where he was struck by a car and killed. The Marietta Daily Journal reported that the four are charged with felony murder, aggravated assault and violation of the Georgia Street Gang Act. The incident occurred two weeks ago, but I have seen no national media coverage. <br> The Justice Department says it will look into the shooting death of Martin to determine if evidence in the case reveals a prosecutable violation. That may turn out to be more of a political decision than one based on facts. It would likely perpetuate the media narrative of blacks as victims and whites (one CNN reporter ludicrously called Zimmerman a white Hispanic) as descendants of slave masters. <br> Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Trayvon Martin's family, compared Trayvon's death to those of Emmett Till and Medgar Evers. Any attempt to turn Trayvon into a civil rights martyr similar to Till and Evers goes well beyond the apples and oranges analogy. <br> Probably quite a few, given our never-ending racial double standard. As both sides have noted, there are no winners in this case.
Last week senators announced an agreement that would double the number of boots on the ground, greatly expand drone surveillance and build hundreds more miles of border fences, barriers and walls in an effort to generate consensus on immigration reform. This is precisely the wrong approach. I suppose this shouldn’t be too much of a surprise given that Congress, with their focus on security and refusal to work collaboratively with Mexico, got us into this mess in the first place. <br> If we think fences can prevent people from seeking a better life for their families, we are fools who deeply underestimate the human conditions that drive immigration. <br> Farm workers who once followed the migrant stream, picking lettuce, broccoli and carrots and then heading north to pick cherries, apples and peaches and then back across to Texas and the South to pick cotton on their way back to Mexico, now no longer crossed the border back to their families. Congress, quite simply, created crisis. <br> The last time that Washington dealt seriously with immigration was in 2001. At that time, George W. Bush, the last president to seriously attempt to reverse the blunders that created the immigration crisis, was recently elected. He moved quickly to deal with the issue of immigration. In a refreshing twist, his approach was to work collaboratively with Mexico’s President, Vicente Fox. The two former governors shared a ranching background, an affinity for Stetson hats and cowboy boots and understanding that, without real reform, the immigration situation would only worsen. The two worked secretly with a group of lawyers, diplomats and academics to create a plan that began with a path to green cards, would remove Mexico and Canada from the global quota system and revive a guest worker program that would have allowed as many as 300,000 Mexicans to work in the United States and then return home. <br> And now, the Senate has doubled down on this misguided path. As a longtime Senator and commentator for a daily Spanish-language talk show in Arizona, I saw a steady stream of crossers that were migrating between Mexico and the United States. They brought in found IDs or wallets with family photos in the hopes of connecting searching families with a small bit of information about a lost loved one or begged me to announce the last known location of their sons or daughters so that listeners with information could call. My experience with those distraught family members reinforces an undeniable truth: The current focus on border security defies common sense. If we think fences can prevent people from seeking a better life for their families, we are fools who deeply underestimate the human conditions that drive immigration. Quotas didn’t work 40 years ago, and they won’t work now. Fences weren’t a solution 20 years ago, and they aren’t one now. <br> Alfredo Gutierrez is a progressive immigration advocate who spent 14 years in the Arizona Senate. He recently released a memoir, "To Sin Against Hope: How America Has Failed Its Immigrants; A Personal History."
The initial reports of the crime were hideous and unbelievable, three teenage sex slaves held shackled and imprisoned apparently by three grubby, seedy, horribly abusive middle-aged brothers. The kidnapping and decade-long captivity of those young women in a boarded-up hell house in Cleveland is bad enough. How could they rob those girls of their freedom, their youth and this substantial hunk of their lives? <br> Every time Castros picture is shown, ugly and disheveled, I cringe. His admitted cruelty will fuel the negative stereotypes and clichs about Latinos, and for a time even add fuel to efforts to derail progress we have made on many important issues, including immigration. <br> As the wretched extent of Cleveland’s notorious crime becomes known, there will be necessary scrutiny of the heartless, wicked, perpetrator. And from my point of view, making Ariel Castro’s terrible crimes even harder to bear is the fact that he is Puerto Rican. <br> His reasoning was simple. During that period a half century ago, many Puerto Ricans were recent arrivals having a hard time fitting in. Yes, they were American citizens, but they were still strangers in a strange land, often with English-language difficulties, poverty and worse. And my dad’s thinking was that every time one from our community did wrong, it added another hurdle we had to jump to become “real” Americans, accepted as equals by our neighbors. <br> Every time Castro’s picture is shown, ugly and disheveled, I cringe. His admitted cruelty will fuel the negative stereotypes and clichs about Latinos, and for a time even add fuel to efforts to derail progress we have made on many important issues, including immigration. Thursday morning on my nationally syndicated radio show I started getting the calls. Some guy named Mark from the Florida Panhandle calling to taunt me, “Well, how about all those hard-working immigrants you’re always talking about now? Ha ha.” <br> I hope he is right. I was further reassured by Cleveland’s City Prosecutor Victor Perez, who said during Castro's arraignment that he too was born in Puerto Rico. Perez added, “I want everyone to know that the acts of the defendant are not a reflection of the Puerto Rican community here or in Puerto Rico.”
Apples, celery, and bell peppers may be hazardous to your health, according to some environmental activists. At least that's the impression you might get reading the Environmental Working Group's Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce. But their guide is nothing more than an annual recycling of hogwash. <br> In fact, USDA explains its findings in a May 2012 press statement: “Similar to previous years, the 2010 report shows that overall pesticide residues found on foods tested are at levels well below the tolerances set by the EPA. The report does show that residues exceeding the tolerance were detected in 0.25 percent of the samples tested. For baby food–included for the first time in this report – the data showed that no residues were found that exceeded the tolerance levels.” <br> What about the 0.25 percent that had levels above EPA standards?Consumers need not fear even those. Such slight exceedances have no public health impact because EPA standards are exceedingly stringent so that even a child could be exposed at levels thousands of times higher without ill effect. <br> Not surprisingly, after reviewing the USDA data, EPA concluded: “The very small amounts of pesticide residues found in the baby food samples were well below levels that are harmful to children.” Nonetheless EWG lists 12 fruits and vegetables on a dirty dozen list, suggesting they contain unsafe levels of pesticide residues. Apples, according, to EWG are the biggest offender. Yet, USDA reports one apple out of 744 tested that contained residues above EPA tolerance levels—and by only a tiny amount (2.4 parts per million). <br> Unfortunately, EWG’s Shopper’s Guide may discourage consumption of many healthy fruits and vegetables. EWG acknowledges: “The health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure.” Still, they suggest consumers can lower “pesticide intake substantially by avoiding the 12 most contaminated fruits and vegetables and eating the least contaminated produce.” <br> The Mayo Clinic lists apples as one of “10 great health foods for eating well” noting they are a great source of the soluble fiber pectin, which aids in healthy blood pressure, lowering of cholesterol, and management of glucose levels. Apples are also an excellent source of Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant with a wide range of health benefits. Indeed, there is good reason to recommend an apple a day! <br> As a partial solution, EWG suggests buying organic food, but organic food is often more expensive and not necessarily a reasonable option for consumers on fixed budgets. Never mind that there isn’t any compelling body of evidence demonstrating that organic food is any safer. <br> Angela Logomasini is a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
Ron Paul has stopped actively campaigning in forthcoming primary contests, and after Texas everyone agrees that Romney has the nomination effectively locked up. But Ron Paul’s people are still striving to rack up as many delegates as he can at state Republican Party conventions before the Tampa . <br> This past weekend in a chaotic and divided state GOP convention in Louisiana, in which two Paul activists were injured by police, it appears likely that he controls the delegation in that state too. (Since the convention literally split in two, the national party will have to eventually decide between two competing delegations, but the Paulite convention had the majority.) <br> Still, Paul’s campaign admits they know Romney will win the Republican Party's presidential nomination. This has led many to wonder exactly what Paul’s trying to accomplish at the August GOP convention in Tampa. Prominent speaking slot? Platform influence? Sway over the vice presidential slot? <br> Paul himself will likely not be a political player past 2013, when he leaves the House seat he’s held since 1997. But his supporters skew so young, they’ll be shaping the Party’s future far longer than Romney’s fans will. <br> Why are they so passionate about this unlikely political champion? And why is their energy so hard to contain even by Paul’s own campaign, who talk of their desire for more “decorum” on the part of their often rowdy and contentious supporters? <br> He tells us American foreign policy is misguided and understandably earns us enemies. He sees America not on the rise, but in decline because of Federal Reserve-primed booms and busts and a crushing debt burden. <br> Unfortunately for Paul’s fans, the radical solutions the Paul worldview demands—an end to overseas military adventurism, ending government’s ability to manipulate paper currency, severe cuts in spending on all the myriad income-shifting promises Washington makes -- don’t register as “practical solutions” to those who helped create the crises those policies have led us to. And that’s both the Democrats and Paul’s own Republican Party. <br> Because if Ron Paul is right about the dangers of government overextension both at home and abroad, it means the GOP has to actually be serious about this limited government, living-within-our-means stuff that is supposed to be the very marrow of conservatism. <br> Paul’s people have given money and rallied in amounts and numbers far exceeding such other GOP hopefuls as Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Paul’s fans gave nearly as much money to his campaign as those other two candidates combined. <br> The religious right during the 1988 Pat Robertson campaign was seen as an overly loud and pushy minority. <br> Brian Doherty is a senior editor of Reason magazine and author of the new book Ron Paul’s Revolution: The Man and the Movement He Inspired (HarperCollins/Broadside).
Look at recent polls asking American voters about the 2012 the presidential race. They are all over the place. Some have President Obama ahead of Mitt Romney out beyond the margin of error– Fox News, AP and Reuters. Other pollsters – Rasmussen and CBS/New York Times – have Romney slightly ahead but within the margin of error. <br> Well, some polls, like Gallup, survey only registered voters. Some, like Rasmussen, poll only likely voters. <br> And then there is the issue of whether pollsters have access to cell phone numbers. Gallup polls by reaching out to Americans using cell phone numbers as well as landlines. <br> Rasmussen polls only using landlines. <br> All these problems are minor in comparison to one larger uncertainty for pollsters working on the 2012 election. <br> Those are big questions and the pollsters have no definite answers. <br> Frey created three models for polling based on three different sets of possible voters in this year’s election. <br> For Hispanics the yield is even lower, as only 44 eligible voters can be found for every 100. Among whites, however, there are 78 eligible voters out of every 100. <br> These new factors born of the changing demographics of the country have to be considered in order to do accurate polling this year. <br> One important note —Frey stayed away from voter turnout data for the 2010 mid-term elections. He decided it would be an apples and orange scenario to compare a high profile presidential election campaign with a mid-term congressional election. <br> Here is what he found: <br> In the second scenario — let’s call it “B” — Frey applies 2004 turnout and voting patterns to the 2012 electorate. Under this assumption, Romney beats Obama with 286 electoral votes in 30 states. The model assumes stronger white support for the GOP than in scenario “A.” Lower minority turnout dooms the Obama campaign. <br> Under this model, 230 votes come from 14 states where minorities are responsible for an Obama victory. Frey says that under this scenario four-fifths of Obama’s electoral votes will be in states won by minorities. <br> It just so happens these are five states where voters have rejected gay marriage when it has been put to a referendum – North Carolina being the most recent to do so. <br> If demography is destiny, then Mitt Romney and the GOP are destined for an uphill battle as they try to retake the White House. Still, 1 out of 3 is not bad odds for a presidential contest. <br> This column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.
This week, the nine Justices of the Supreme Court have been listening to oral arguments about the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. <br> How’s about, instead, we look at some facts:1. Millions of Americans have already benefited from ObamaCareIn 2011, an estimated 86 million Americans used provisions in the Affordable Care Act to get preventative care through their insurance plans, care that insurance companies previously subjected to co-pays or deductibles but now must provide for free. Over 2.5 million seniors have saved an estimated $1.5 billion thanks to prescription drug discounts included in health care reform. <br> The controversial “individual mandate” at the center of the Supreme Court arguments this week doesn’t kick in until 2014. What this means is that the cost containment provisions in the Affordable Care Act haven’t gone into effect yet either, and meanwhile critics are attacking the law based largely on hypothetical future predictions. <br> 3. The individual mandate was originally a Republican idea.Recently, President Obama’s senior adviser David Plouffe called Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney “the godfather of the individual mandate.” At a GOP primary debate in 2011, Romney said, “We got the idea of an individual mandate…from [Newt Gingrich], and [Newt] got it from the Heritage Foundation.” <br> In 1989, Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation shifted the conservative frame from an employer mandate to an individual mandate, writing: <br> Incidentally, Butler has recently tried to renounce his invention of the individual mandate, but it appears to me that his reasoning reads something like, “I was for it when it was a Republican idea and am against it now that Democrats embraced it.” <br> In fact, the CBO adjusted its estimates to say the Affordable Care Act will cost less than originally projected. Moreover, the CBO has said that repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase the deficit by $210 billion. <br> President Obama had a plan. <br> Still today, the president is trying to adapt and confirm the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to meet the needs of all Americans while keeping costs down. Republicans are simply putting forward another budget that slashes Medicare and middle class benefits while giving more tax breaks to the rich. <br> This suggests that the president has a messaging problem, not a policy problem --- whereas the Republicans simply lack any substantive alternative, let alone a popular one. <br> Never mind the fact that the law already shows promising and valuable impact even before it’s fully in effect. Never mind the fact that cost estimates are dropping and, starting in 2014, the law will contain overall health care costs that are crippling our household budgets. <br> Sally Kohn is a Fox News contributor and grassroots strategist.

TV news loves a health scare. Think deadly Tylenol. Killer tomatoes. Mad Cow Disease. Alar in apples. And lots more. Sometimes, as with Tylenol, they are legit and important. Other times, like Alar, they are entirely bogus. <br> This time, however, ABC News has turned that idea on its head in its usual quest for tabloid headlines. It’s going after a company, Beef Products, Inc., for making a product that's not only already safe, it's one we’ve all been eating for years. <br> The meat, often called lean finely textured beef, is made up of beef that is just harder to get at, so the meat isn’t lost. It’s treated to get rid of the fat and included with the rest of the ground beef. The USDA declares it healthy, but it is less expensive. As an added bonus, it is treated tiny amounts of ammonium hydroxide to make it safer to eat. <br> That, editors will tell you, is headline material. Slimy journalists might add that it’s the path to winning journalistic awards – facts be damned. <br> Predictably ABC News has hyped its reports by using the term “pink slime” 52 times in just a two-week span (making it harder than usual not to associate Avila’s activist reporting with the word “slime”but that's another story.) <br> According to David Muir of ABC, the network’s “reporting on pink slime” has “sparked a grassroots movement.” Diane Sawyer crowed “Jim’s story prompted a public outcry.” <br> It’s a reality that mom Nancy Donley knows all too well. She lost her only son to the disease when he ate “contaminated ground beef back in 1993 when he was only 6 years old.” Donley wrote recently to defend the company against ABC’s attacks, saying the firm’s “use of ammonia hydroxide in minute amounts during processing improves the safety of the product and is routinely used throughout the food industry.” <br> Topps Meat Co is now out of business. <br> But then again this is ABC, which has its own awful record of covering food stories. <br> So you know to be suspicious when ABC claimed “USDA officials with links to the beef industry labeled 'pink slime' meat.” Actually, USDA officials labeled meat as meat. <br> Most of the ABC stories didn’t mention the company’s argument. You know, the basics of journalism, like the fact that the product is actually meat, not some foreign substance. <br> In ABC’s case, it’s clear they care more about headlines than health, never even mentioning the dangers of E. coli that the company, and industry, both fight against. What’s next for ABC and Avila? A war on companies that fight ebola? <br> Dan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture.

Politicians and talking heads are doing their best to make us confused about gasoline prices. Here’s a little clarity. <br> “Supply” is the willingness to sell at a given gasoline price--which is determined by the ability to make a profit at a given price. “Demand” is the willingness of consumers to buy at a given gasoline price. <br> Secret 2: We get a great deal on gasoline. <br> But the reason gas prices can go up more rapidly than other prices is this: when demand for other goods goes up or supply goes down, it’s easy to substitute--you can buy apples if the price of oranges goes up. <br> Instead of being angry, why not be thankful we’re getting such a great deal? <br> Since oil companies are producing the best portable fuel on the market, without them we would have much higher transportation prices. <br> Secret 4: “Windfall” profits mean windfall savings in the future. <br> If gasoline was barely profitable at current prices, that would mean less investment and higher prices in the future. <br> The most promising substitute for gasoline may well be natural gas--whether compressed, liquefied, or diesel-ized natural gas--since gas is at incredibly low prices right now. <br> Why? Because you can't run from competition if the market is free. <br> Those speculators who “drive up” prices are really just fellow buyers and sellers of oil. <br> Good for them. The rising price is a signal that our government needs to end its interventionist ways. Why are we shooting the messenger instead of criticizing our government's policies? <br> There is no right price for portable fuel. There is only the price that reflects supply and demand. <br> In other words, 70s-style shortages. That means delays on moving everything, from food to medical supplies. Cheaper gasoline would be far more expensive in its consequences than today’s gasoline. <br> The only thing the government should do about gasoline prices is liberate energy production of every kind as quickly as possible, to maximize competition and lower prices. Instead, it is holding up drilling projects on the grounds that they will not immediately bring $2.50 gasoline. <br> Alex Epstein is the founder of the Center for Industrial Progress.
Despite some bad apples, the United States is not a corrupt country. Among more than 180 other nations, the U.S. ranks in the top 15 percent of government cleanliness, according to the 2011 Corruption Perception survey. <br> So we have the absurd case of members from the Federal Communications Commission trying to meet their counterparts from Canada, Europe and Asia by standing outside the perimeter of our cocktail party so they do not violate the president’s order. Silly but true. <br> President Obama rails against lobbyists, except of course union lobbyists. True to his word, I have not been in the White House since the waning days of President Bush. Yet, a recent report notes that those with relatives in the White House formed a new trade association so business members could access Obama officials. How is that advancing ethical government?These examples cry out for some common sense in ethics laws.On the state level, Virginia is a great example of a government that has found the right balance. It tops several surveys as a business-friendly environment, has low unemployment and has almost no recent cases of corruption. <br> Meanwhile, other countries continue to foster a healthy relationship between government and business, one where each side learns from the other.
Did you see President Obama's new 2013 budget? It's filled with $1.5 trillion in tax increases for the rich. <br> The reality is taxes are not low at all. If you think they are, you've either been brainwashed, or you aren't paying taxes. The truth is: The taxes are too damn high.We do have a serious problem in this country. But it's not a tax problem. It is a spending problem. <br> Government is a spending addict and needs rehab. If you don't believe me, look at Europe. <br> Yet President Obama continues to claim in every speech that taxes on the rich are too low and we therefore desperately need to raise taxes. <br> Let’s examine the bold faced lies of Obama and the left, who try to justify tax increases on the rich on a daily basis:First, Obama quotes the dollars earned by the top 1% of income earners to prove that “the rich” are making too much and being taxed too little. That’s sleight of hand. <br> How can you use billion dollar stock gains, or $100 million hedge fund incomes, or $20 million Wall Street bonuses, to justify raising taxes on a small businessman who makes $250,000 to $500,000 per year by working 16 hours a day? <br> President Obama is comparing these individuals to billionaires who share the same tax bracket. Mr. Obama claims that everyone in the top 1% tax bracket is making too much, and paying too little in taxes. <br> Separate from federal income tax rates, U.S. taxpayers now pay the highest FICA and Medicare tax rates ever; the highest state, local and property taxes ever; the highest sales taxes ever; and the second highest business income taxes in the industrialized world. <br> Therefore quoting higher rates is a distortion of the truth. A tax rate of 70% from decades ago might actually be lower than today's rates once you include these factors. <br> Fourth, Obama constantly reports that tax rates were once much higher. Another distortion. <br> Only one man in the entire United States of America paid a penny at that rate in 1935: John D. Rockefeller. <br> But he quotes robber baron” rates to sell his bait and switch scheme. In the private sector you face civil or criminal charges for misleading investors like that.President Obama also purposely leaves out a very important fact -- that only in the last 30 years have we moved away from a cash economy. <br> Does anyone- including President Obama -- believe that restaurant owners, bar owners, or retailers paid huge taxes on their cash incomes 30 years ago? <br> If President Obama got his way federal income taxes would hit 40% or higher. And he'd take the cap off FICA taxes. And he'd dramatically reduce or eliminate mortgage, charitable and business deductions. And then just for fun, he'd add a national VAT tax. Now add in the new taxes for ObamaCare. Add it up. <br> Our government is heavily in debt, and Obama needs to find targets of opportunity (i.e. victims) to pay the bills, so America doesn’t go bankrupt on his watch. <br> Third, by targeting, demonizing and punishing small business owners and high-income earners (the people who make almost all the contributions to conservative causes and candidates), Mr. Obama can starve his political opposition. If taxes are higher on the rich, then the president's opposition has no money left to give to conservative candidates. <br> Mr. Obama's plan is is the polar opposite: to raise taxes dramatically on the rich, so he can feed the beast of big government, and at the same time, starve his political opposition.
We all know the New Year is the time for reflection and resolutions.President Obamacould afford to do some reflection of his own, both on the policies his administration has pursued that have hurt our economy, andwhathe can do tostart to reversethat damage in the coming election year. <br> First, he should resolve todo away with rules and proposed rules that will handcuff innovators. <br> The first part of Obama’s New Year’s resolution should be to roll back existing rules and abandon proposed rules that stifle innovation. Whether it’sburdensome visa requirementsthat negatively impact our travel industry or cumbersome Food and Drug Administrationpolicies, regulation is smothering innovation and our economy.The Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies haveproposed and issued scores of new rules and proposalsthat most businesses have trouble simply tracking, much less observing. <br> And this summer, the NLRB released new rules that are designed to make unionization easier by dismissing the privacy rights, internal policies and IT systems of U.S. employers. Earlier, NLRB blocked Boeing from opening a factory in South Carolina, supposedly because Boeing built the facility to spite union workers in Washington. <br> The PROTECT IP Act in the Senate (S.968) and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House (H.R.3261) are supposedly aimed at countering foreign piracy websites that steal and distribute copyrighted content. No one disagrees with that goal. But PROTECT IP and SOPA reach far over that goal by requiring Internet service providers to blacklist any website that even links to a piracy site or advertises a product the rights holders view as enabling infringement. This could spell disaster for video sharing sites like YouTube, or search engine sites like Google. <br> As the second part of Obama’s 2012 resolution, apro-active innovation agendawould free business and markets up to inject new life into the American economy by creating new products and new jobs. <br> Congress could also authorize the Federal Communications Commission to make more spectrumavailable for broadband Internet use. A spectrum auction would raise an estimated $33 billion for the federal government and empower telecommunications companies to continue innovating in handheld devices. <br> As the president and his team regroup for 2012and try to figure out how to market an unpopular president in an election year, they should focus on improving the economy by resolving to make decisions and enact policies that allow businesses to continue innovating.Given what we’ve seen in the previous three years, the business community has its doubts. <br> Gary Shapiro is president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the U.S. trade association representing more than 2,000 consumer electronics companies, and author of the New York Times bestselling book,“The Comeback: How Innovation Will Restore the American Dream.”
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, begins Wednesday, September 28 at sundown. Like most religious celebrations, the holiday is about many things, some better known than others, and many of them quite interesting for all people, Jewish or otherwise. <br> Rosh Hashanah begins what are called the Ten Days of Repentance, a period which concludes with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. So not surprisingly, themes of introspection, forgiveness, and hope for a year in which we do better than we did in the past all figure largely in the prayers and practices of the holiday. <br> The Bible describes the day observed as Rosh Hashanah, literally the head or first of the year, as being the first day of the seventh month, the Hebrew month of Tishrei. What kind of New Year’s celebration comes at the beginning of the seventh month instead of the first? In this case the Jewish kind. <br> In biblical times, the Israelites measured the passage of time only by reference to the exodus from Egypt and the birth of their nation. That is why, according to the Bible, Passover falls in the first month. Over time however, the sages, who came to lead the Jewish people, decided that the turning of the calendar year, or Rosh Hashanah as we know it, would be celebrated on the day when, according to tradition, the first humans were created – the first day of the biblical seventh month. <br> It’s a lesson I learned early on from my parents, people who were, and remain, fiercely proud of being Jewish, fiercely proud of being American and passionately committed to the larger world in which they live. <br> Contrary to what we often hear, issues of identity and community are not zero-sum unless the respective competing identities are so small and offer so little that all they can do is beg for allegiance. When they are rich resources for living more meaningful, ethical, creative and engaged lives, there is little or no fear of dilution or disappearance. <br> Ethical exceptionalism, whether Jewish or American, is all about celebrating what makes us uniquely us, while also celebrating that we are simultaneously part of other bigger “us’es.” <br> Rabbi Brad Hirschfield is the author of You Don’t Have to Be Wrong for Me to Be Right: Finding Faith Without Fanaticism, and president of Clal-The National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership.
Editor's note: This piece originally appeared on the Human Right’s Campaign Back Story blog. <br> Apparently perturbed by the announcement that Chaz Bono would dance with a woman partner on television’s Dancing with the Stars, he warned parents to keep kids from watching the show. His reason: protecting children who might be struggling with gender confusion from unwanted influences. <br> Although this “monkey see, monkey do” warning might come across as common sense advice, this is another instance where “common sense” does not square with science. While science has yet to explain what causes gender dysphoria, as my colleague, APA President, Dr. John Oldham affirms, “There is no evidence that viewing a television game show with a transgender contestant would induce Gender Identity Disorder in young people.” <br> Wouldn’t it be more helpful to offer scientific data rather than sensationalized, detailed descriptions of sex reassignment surgery or metaphors about double amputees to support the views Dr. Ablow “believes to be true?” <br> GIDC is relatively rare, and children whose gender dysphoria persists into adulthood even rarer. Existing research indicates that children with GIDC grow out of gender dysphoria, do not grow up to be transgender, and most of them grow up to be gay! Again, no one knows why. <br> The adolescents and their families who elect to go this route are not the ones Dr. Ablow describes: “tomboyish girls and sensitive, less stereotypically ‘masculine’ boys” or children who recently lost a parent and are “wondering who they are absent their deceased mothers or fathers.” His views on gender confusion mix apples with oranges and have little basis in current clinical practices. <br> Dr. Ablow, seeing Chaz Bono’s life as a tragedy, wants others to agree and his “prescription” is scaring people away from tuning in and seeing for themselves. Yet parents should not be afraid to learn something new. Tuning out uncomfortable information and maintaining silence only makes children (who cannot be shielded from this information in the modern age) more anxious. Children sensing parental anxiety become anxious as well. <br> If he ends up watching it, perhaps Dr. Ablow will learn something as well.
Here's a look at the intersection of the business of sports and business by Rick Horrow and Brian Finkel of Horrow Sports Ventures. <br> As NFL fans eagerly flocked back to their big screen TVs on yesterday, so too did advertisers. The league is seeing some of the heaviest activation around NFL football in many seasons, with ESPN providing one of its biggest platforms. <br> NBC, the NFL’s partner for “Football Night in America” every Sunday, is certainly not left out in the cold. The network announced that it has just five spots left for February’s Super Bowl broadcast, despite a record price tag of $3.5 million on average for a 30-second spot. Last season’s game on Fox averaged $3.0 million per spot, but did not sell out until late October. <br> We know the U.S. Open means millions of dollars for the greater New York economy, but how much might shock you. According to a study a commissioned and released by the USTA, the U.S. Open generates $750 million in annual economic impact for New York. The total dwarfs the projected $550 million the 2014 Super Bowl could bring to the region, though it isn’t exactly apples-to-apples when comparing a two-week tournament to a one-night game. The Open’s economic impact was last measured at $420 million in 2001. <br> League TV Networks <br> NFL Network grew to 60 million subscribers this summer signing a carriage agreement with Charter Communications. The network now is on seven of the top eight U.S. TV providers. League officials continue negotiating with Time Warner Cable, which could increase NFL Network’s carriage by another 12.5 million households. <br> League Sponsorship Deals <br> In the NBA, the league signed Sprint Nextel to a four-year, $250 million sponsorship deal despite the ongoing lockout. Sprint reportedly is paying 15-20% more than the league’s previous wireless sponsor T-Mobile did. Sprint subsidiary Boost Mobile recently signed a big sponsorship with the WNBA. <br> Rick Horrow is the Sports Professor, and is the Sports Business Analyst for Fox Sports.

Actor Matt Damon is a walking public-service reminder to immunize your children early and often against La-La Land disease.In Damon’s world, all public-school teachers are selfless angels. Government workers and Hollywood entertainers are impervious to economic incentives. Anyone who disagrees is a know-nothing, “corporate reformer” ingrate who hates education. <br> What Damon’s superficial tirade lacked, however, was any real-world understanding of the deterioration of core-curricular learning in America. Students can’t master simple division or fractions because today’s teachers -- churned out through lowest-common-denominator grad schools and shielded from competition -- have barely mastered those skills themselves. Un-educators have abandoned “drill-and-kill” computation for multicultural claptrap and fuzzy math, traded in grammar fundamentals for “creative spelling” and dropped standard civics for save-the-earth propaganda. <br> Out: Reading is fundamental. <br> After his drippy pep talk absolving teachers of any responsibility for America's educational morass, Damon lashed out at a young reporter who had the audacity to ask him about the negative impact of lifetime teacher tenure. “In acting, there isn’t job security, right,” Reason.tv's Michelle Fields asked Damon. “There is an incentive to work hard and be a better actor because you want to have a job. So why isn't it like that for teachers?” <br> “You think job insecurity makes me work hard?” he retorted. “That's like saying a teacher is going to get lazy when she has tenure.” Damon unleashed crude profanities on Fields. “A teacher wants to teach,” Damon fumed with his mother next to him. “Why else would you take a sh- -ty” salary and really long hours and do that job unless you really loved to do it? <br> Damon went on to deride standard, mainstream behavioral economic principles as “intrinsically paternalistic” and “MBA-style thinking.” And when the young reporter's cameraman pointed out that there are bad apples in the teaching profession as in any profession, Damon called him “sh--ty,” too. <br> Interminable teacher tenure in America's largest school districts, from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles, has produced a rotten corps of incompetent (at best) and dangerous (at worst) educators coddled by Big Labor. As the DC-based Center for Union reports, “In many major cities, only one out of 1,000 teachers is fired for performance-related reasons. . . . In 10 years, only about 47 out of 100,000 teachers were actually terminated from New Jersey's schools.” <br> In Los Angeles, it’s not just meanie Tea Partiers making the case for abolishing teacher tenure. When the Los Angeles Times exposed how the city's tenure evaluation system rubber-stamped approvals and ignored actual performance, the district superintendent admitted: “Too many ineffective teachers are falling into tenured positions -- the equivalent of jobs for life.” USC education professor Julie Slayton acknowledged: “It's ridiculous and should be changed.” <br> Michelle Malkin is a New York Post columnist and Fox News contributor.
Long before the intervention in Libya -- before Afghanistan or Iraq, or even Vietnam -- the United States found itself involved in a peculiar operation on the southern coast of Cuba, at a place called the Bay of Pigs. <br> Sunday is the 50th anniversary of the invasion of Cuba, and it arrives with Kennedy’s question still begging for an answer. Not just regarding the Bay of Pigs, but a host of other entanglements that followed. The United States went on to engage in no fewer than two dozen forceful foreign interventions after 1961, from Southeast Asia to the Middle East and Central America. And that was just the 20th century. Then came the 21st, and 9/11, and Iraq and Afghanistan. And now, Libya. <br> Given the variety of American interventions -- some small, others massive; some covert, others overt; some undertaken for humanitarian goals, others for self-interest or self-defense -- it may be misleading to lump apples and oranges and draw conclusions about the fruits they bear. Nonetheless, if there is one element that nearly all U.S. interventions have shared since the Bay of Pigs -- the elephant, as it were, in the Situation Room -- it is their tendency to merit the observation Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. made in his journal after the 1961 debacle: “We not only look like imperialists; we look like ineffectual imperialists, which is worse,” wrote the presidential adviser; “and we look like stupid, ineffectual imperialists, which is worst of all.” <br> Regarding the current intervention in Libya, President Obama has assured us we will not be there long this spring. But Obama, born four months after the Bay of Pigs, has lived through enough of these interventions to know that reality has its own way of intervening on even the best laid plans. Already, the days have turned into weeks, and soon will become months. <br> By the same token, when a president tells the American people that an intervention will be quick and painless, he should be greeted with no less skepticism than you’d give a home-improvement contractor bidding to renovate your kitchen. You can be pretty sure the job’s going to cost twice as much and last twice as long as promised.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Thursday released an estimate of the House Republican bill to fully repeal Obamacare. It found that doing so would increase the deficit by $230 billion. <br> 1. It reminds us of what we already knew. The health care law is full of budget gimmicks, and even if CBO is right about its fiscal impact, we can’t afford it because Uncle Sam is broke. <br> We can compare apples to apples by looking only look at the 2010-19 period in both estimates. Doing so, we see the new savings figure is almost identical to the old one: $145 billion, compared to $143 billion. <br> 4. CBO has warned us not to over-rely on its numbers for Obamacare. Back in March, the agency was extremely tentative in its prediction that passing Obamacare would produce any savings, and refused to make any specific prediction beyond the law’s first decade. In today’s estimate, CBO says, “The projections of the bill’s budgetary impact are quite uncertain and have a roughly equal chance of turning out to be too high or too low. <br> • CBO assumes only 19 million workers will be dumped by their employers into the government exchanges in 2019, when there will be 111 million workers in the pool of potential “dumpees.” Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former CBO director, thinks that’s way too optimistic. He predicts 35 million workers will be dumped. If so, it would add another trillion dollars to the law’s costs. <br> • Britain's National Health Service cost 38 percent more than projected in its first year. <br> • Medicare's kidney dialysis program, created in 1972, cost 2.3 times as much as projected in its first year. <br> (Source: Joint Economic Committee, Republican Staff, Are Health Care Reform Cost Estimates Reliable? July 31, 2009.) <br> If we did, we’d have a first-10-year cost of not $1.3 trillion but $9.1 trillion. Ah, you say, 700 percent seems outlandishly high (even though that’s what actually happened with Medicare). OK, fine, let’s assume the program will only cost twice the official estimate (200 percent). That would be a cost of $2.6 trillion, or an over-run of $1.3 trillion. Still seem too high? How about a 50-percent over-run ($1.95 trillion, $650 billion over budget). Still too high? <br> That, of course, would eliminate almost all of CBO's $145 billion in estimated savings. <br> Does anybody really believe Obamacare cost estimates will turn out to have been too high? <br> Dean Clancy Legislative Counsel and Vice President, Health Care Policy for the grassroots organization FreedomWorks
It's not what we don't know that causes us trouble. It's what we know that isn't so. Whichever famous writer said that (it's been attributed to many), what he said carries truth. <br> Michael Pollan, the prolific food author and activist, wrote in The New York Times that what was once a solar-powered ruminant [a grass-fed steer] [has been turned] into the very last thing we need: another fossil-fuel machine. How so? Farmers burn fossil fuels to ship corn to feed cows instead of letting them eat what's naturally under their feet. <br> People believe. -- Nobody likes the idea of cattle jammed into feed lots. <br> Free roaming. <br> Free-roaming grass-fed cows, because you've got happy cows. <br> It's logical to think that grass-fed steers might be better for the environment, but so often, what sounds logical is just wrong. <br> Capper said: There's a perception out there that grass- fed animals are frolicking in the sunshine, kicking their heels up full of joy and pleasure. What we actually found was from the land-use basis, from the energy, from water, and, particularly, based on the carbon footprints, grass-fed is far worse than corn-fed. <br> Simply because they have a far lower efficiency, far lower productivity. The animals take 23 months to grow. (Corn-fed cattle need only 15.) That's extra eight extra months of feed, of water, land use, obviously, and also an awful lot of waste. If we have a grass-fed animal, compared to a corn-fed animal, that's like adding almost one car to the road for every single animal. That's a huge increase in carbon footprints. <br> Absolutely right, Capper said. Every single day, they need feed, they need water, and they give off methane nitrous oxide -- very potent greenhouse gases that do damage. <br> There is absolutely no scientific evidence based on that. <br> But what about those hormones the cows are given? Surely that cannot be good for us. <br> So the next time you reach for that package of beef in the grocery store tagged with all the latest grass-fed, free-range lingo, remember: Not only does it often cost twice as much, but there's no evidence it's better for the environment or better for you. <br> John Stossel is host of Stossel on the Fox Business Network.

The current inflation rate of 2 percent is too low. That is at least if you believe Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. With the economy growing too slowly to bring down unemployment, Mr. Bernanke's solution is to increase inflation.The Federal Reserve last week started printing up $600 billion to buy U.S. Treasury Bonds and another almost $300 billion to buy mortgages. The printing more dollars will reduce the value of the dollar just as doubling the number of apples will reduce the price of apples. <br> With the next election no more than two years away, few politicians other than Reagan have been willing to bear the short-run electoral costs of reducing inflation. Let the next president face the higher unemployment rate from reducing inflation, they seem to say.Besides only artificial short term gains on unemployment, the value of the dollar took a big hit on Mr. Bernanke's announcement. More inflation means that the value of dollar is lower, and foreigners immediately reduced how much they were willing to pay for them. Higher inflation also means that interest rates will rise, lowering bond and stock prices. One cost of higher inflation is the threat that it poses to Americans’ investments.There might be another unstated explanation for increasing inflation -- more inflation will devalue the awful levels of our government debt, including the debt held by foreign countries such as China. If China bought Treasury bonds paying 3 percent interest and we can raise the inflation rate to 4 percent, the U.S. government will effectively make the Chinese pay us 1 percent per year for borrowing our money. <br> John R.

On the same day President Obama spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., The Washington Post published a curious story by Anne E. Kornblut on the role religion plays in the Obama White House. <br> Some aide sends the president religious passages every morning on his BlackBerry, that come from, according to an unnamed official, “a variety of sources.” <br> More unnamed advisers insist he prays privately. <br> There you have it, case closed. The president is, like, totally holy. <br> And nothing complements a good populist screed like a few shout-outs to the Almighty. After all, in times of struggle, what do all those common folk in the square states do? They git out thar’ guns and thar’ religion! So after months of virtual silence about the man upstairs, the president’s spin doctors have undoubtedly assured him it’s time to get back on the God bandwagon. <br> Like today. During his speech at the Prayer Breakfast the president was sure to point out – again – that not everyone in America believes in God. He’s right, of course, but wouldn’t you think that at a prayer breakfast, he’d direct his remarks primarily to the population that prays? The humanist salute to solstice does not, in fact, count as a “prayer.” <br> Uh, no it isn't -- unless my definition of atheism is different than his. Most atheists insist that God’s grace most certainly is not expressed through them, and that there are no “higher” purposes. While we may all come together for “a purpose” – like relief work in Haiti, poverty, AIDS, or world hunger – no atheist I know would consider this God's work. <br> But wait, there were other bizarre moments today: <br> God and war: Obama said that God’s grace is expressed through the efforts of our armed forces. Really? Sarah Palin was publicly flayed for suggesting just this when she asked her congregation to pray for the military. <br> Dissing evangelicals: In throwing a bone to the religious right, Obama doesn’t miss a chance to also insult them. “We see that in many conservative pastors who are helping lead the way to fix our broken immigration system. It’s not what would be expected from them, and yet they recognize, in those immigrant families, the face of God.” He may as well have just called them xenophobic nativists. <br> All in all, it was actually fairly predictable – if you’ve ever heard this president discuss faith you know that he is incredibly uneasy with the themes and constructs of American belief, and often manages to slight the faithful just as he’s awkwardly trying to address them. <br> S.E. Cupp is a writer and author. Her forthcoming book “Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media’s Attack on Christianity,” will be in bookstores in April.
Beheadings and amputations. Iraqi-style brutality, bribery, extortion, kidnapping, and murder. More than 7,200 dead—almost double last year’s tally—in shoot-outs between federales and often better-armed drug cartels. This is modern Mexico, whose president, Felipe Caldern, has been struggling since 2006 to wrest his country from the grip of four powerful cartels and their estimated 100,000 foot soldiers. <br> Corruption indictments and convictions linked to drug-trafficking organizations, known in police parlance as DTOs, are popping up in FBI press releases with disturbing frequency. In April, for instance, the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of Texas announced that Sergio Lopez Hernandez, a 40-year-old Customs and Border Protection inspector, had been convicted of drug trafficking, alien smuggling, and bribery. Hernandez pleaded guilty to accepting over $150,000 in bribes and to conspiring to sell cocaine and bring illegal aliens into the country. <br> Another year of surveillance uncovered evidence of Crispin’s drug-cartel connections. Though she lived simply in El Paso, she socialized with known drug traffickers in Mexico and had bought two expensive homes and several luxury vehicles there through straw purchasers. Crispin was then arrested. After pleading guilty in 2008 to conspiring to import drugs and abusing the public trust, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $5 million in assets she was estimated to have stolen. <br> Abbott says that the Crispin case is atypical. But the potential damage, he stresses, is huge. “You have the mule: an illegal immigrant who carries five pounds of marijuana in his backpack across the border through the desert. Compare that with the border inspector who waves through five completely loaded vans, as she did.” <br> But Jason Ackleson, an associate professor of government at New Mexico State University, disagrees. “U.S. Customs and Border Protection is very alert to the problem,” he tells me. “Their internal investigations caseload is going up, and there are other cases that are not being publicized.” While corruption is not widespread, “if you increase the overall number of law enforcement officers as dramatically as we have”—from 9,000 border agents and inspectors prior to 9/11 to a planned 20,000 by the end of 2009—“you increase the possibility of corruption due to the larger number of people exposed to it and tempted by it.” Note, too, that Drug Enforcement Agency data suggest that Mexican cartels are operating in at least 230 American cities. <br> And David Shirk, director of the San Diego–based Trans-Border Institute and a political scientist at the University of San Diego, says that recent years have seen an “alarming” increase in the number of Department of Homeland Security personnel being investigated for possible corruption. “The number of cases filed against DHS agents in recent years is in the hundreds,” says Shirk. “And that, obviously, is a potentially huge problem.” An August 2009 investigation by the Associated Press supports his assessment. Based on records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, court records, and interviews with sentenced agents, the AP concluded that more than 80 federal, state, and local border-control officials had been convicted of corruption-related crimes since 2007, soon after President Caldern launched his war on the cartels. Over the previous ten months, the AP data showed, 20 Customs and Border Protection agents alone had been charged with a corruption-related crime. If that pace continued, the reporters concluded, “the organization will set a new record for in-house corruption.” <br> Back in 1994, Ken Christesen was a detective in the Four Corners, the region where the borders of Colorado, Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico meet. That was the year that one Miguel Tarango was convicted of murdering a member of a rival drug gang in a territorial dispute. The conviction made Christesen realize that the Tarango family was “far more significant than we had initially thought” in the local drug trade, he tells me over coffee at Donna Kay’s, a popular caf in Bloomfield, New Mexico. <br> By 2002, Christesen had become a lieutenant in the San Juan County sheriff’s office, where he participated in Operation Farmland, an effort run by a federal, state, and local alliance called the Region II Narcotics Task Force. The operation, which targeted meth sales in the Four Corners, ended in 2003 with 250 people charged, among them Mike Marshall, a former sheriff’s deputy sentenced to five years in federal prison for distributing drugs. Christesen happened to know that Marshall and Danny Tarango had often been seen together. If Tarango had befriended Marshall, Christesen reasoned, might he also be trying to get inside information from active cops about the task force itself? <br> Christesen concluded that Danny Tarango and Levi Countryman were working together—that “we made the arrests, Levi became a hero, and Danny got rich by eliminating his competition,” Christesen recalls. But he had no proof. Nevertheless, when he took over the Narcotics Task Force in October 2004, he quietly put Levi Countryman at the top of his target list. <br> But sensitive task-force information kept leaking out to the Tarangos, much to Christesen’s frustration. Every time Christesen got close to persuading someone to talk or testify in a drug-related case, the inquiry would fall apart. A parade of witnesses who had agreed to testify would suddenly change their minds. One potential witness in a drug case against Josh Tarango, Danny’s younger brother, refused to testify in 2006 after her daughter’s car was burned on her front lawn. <br> In January 2007, the FBI finally responded to Christesen’s repeated appeals and quietly opened an investigation into whether the task force’s operations were being compromised from within. Because everyone on the task force was potentially a suspect, the FBI agents told no one in local law enforcement—not even Christesen—precisely what they were doing and whom they were targeting. But after wiretapping Danny Tarango’s cell-phone calls, they discovered that information about the task force was still being provided by Countryman. Christesen’s suspicions were all too true: Countryman was getting his information from a state police officer named Keith Salazar, one of the unit’s most trusted, experienced members. Countryman and Tarango even referred to Salazar by the code name “Candy” because the information he provided was so “sweet.” <br> For his part, Countryman was the perfect middleman. As soon as he got sensitive information from “Candy,” he would call Tarango and pass it along. As a result, Salazar never had to talk to Tarango or meet with him, insulating him from scrutiny. All three men used cell phones specifically dedicated to their double-dealing, creating what Swainston called in his indictment a “compartmentalized line of communication.” But Countryman was more than a go-between; he also distributed some of the methamphetamine he received from Tarango, street profits from which supplemented the $8,000 a month that Tarango routinely paid him. <br> Tarango vetoed the proposal, but the FBI had heard enough. Arrest warrants for all three men were promptly issued. But before Tarango could be served, he escaped to Mexico. When the police arrested Countryman at a Denny’s restaurant in Farmington, the county seat, they found a handgun in his truck. In a safe at his home were 13 more firearms, $18,000 in cash, and almost eight pounds of marijuana. <br> Christesen, who is now running for sheriff in San Juan County, still fears that Danny Tarango’s web of corruption may have been far broader than the public has been told. In the wake of the Countryman and Salazar arrests, the New Mexico state police’s narcotics division was quietly disbanded and reorganized. The fact that the state said so little about its actions leads Christesen and others to believe that the conspiracy may have involved other, still-unnamed, corrupt cops, border patrol agents, and public officials. <br> “Cops hate these cases, hate to investigate and prosecute them, because it shows we’re not perfect, that we’re vulnerable to corruption like other human beings,” Christesen says. “A Salazar looks bad for all of us. But how many other counties like ours are there in the Southwest? How can we be sure that our law enforcement system isn’t being Mexicanized? I’m worried that they’ll start with bribes, and end as they have in Mexico, with intimidation and murder.” <br> Last year, FBI officials tell me, the Bureau worked on nearly 2,500 public corruption cases and convicted more than 700 dishonest public servants throughout the nation. Most of them were unrelated to the cartels, and Special Agent Abbott, of the FBI’s criminal branch in El Paso, says that only 15 to 30 of his region’s cases so far have involved drug-related corruption among law enforcement officials. “But given the damage that can be done by just one corrupt officer or inspector,” he adds, “this is an important vulnerability. We know it.”
Thu, 11 Jun 2009 20:42:28 +0000 By Glenn BeckHost Glenn Beck <br> ------------ <br> ------------- <br> Before I bring Stu into the conversation, let me make one thing clear. Since Mayor Bloomberg started this program of paying public school kids to get good grades, it's been working. I can't argue with the results, but just because the program is having success doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do. I believe that free public education in America is a gift, and you shouldn't have to pay anyone to accept it. Now let's see what Stu had to say about it: <br> The difference here is that families work together to take care of the business of the family. With chores, you don't just live in the house for free. So really Stu, it's not the same thing at all. It's comparing apples to oranges, so let's move on. <br> The problem is that public education is one of America's greatest gifts. Imagine if I gave you a birthday present, but you said you'd only accept it if I also paid you to do so. If that sounds absurd, that's because it is, and it's a perfect analogy. Gifts are to be accepted or declined. Those who choose to accept the gift of free education perform better in college and the workforce...in life--they prosper and excel. That's the reward for their work. Those who decline the gift and don't take full advantage of a public school education that is the envy of the world over...they enjoy less success and fewer opportunities in life. <br> STU: But here if they do apply themselves, they get rewarded. That's a principle that is taught. <br> STU: But if you are talking about results, I mean, again no one would ever propose this. But if you are talking about results and you paid the people living in public housing to take care of it, you can be sure that they probably would. <br> STU: But isn't there a possibility that you actually are teaching a kid a capitalist principle? <br> OK, fine--I'll give Stu this point. But...while they are in fact teaching a capitalist principle, they're not making an effort to tell these kids that by participating in this program, they're teaching them a capitalist principle! It's a little abstract, so it's likely that the only kids who'll getthat this is a capitalist principle are the kids who are smart and taking full advantage of their free education and thus not partaking in this application of a capitalist principle! Oh boy, I can feel the blood welling up and getting ready to shoot straight out of my eyes, and the cleanup after that takes forever. I better wrap this up. <br> The old saying goes that you shouldn't look a gift horse ion the mouth. Well, too many of New York City's public school kids are looking that gift horse in the mouth, and they're hoping to find some extra cash in there as well. It's got to stop--we owe our children and our countrymore..
Sat, 25 Apr 2009 01:48:23 +0000 By Peter RoffFellow, Institue for Liberty/Former Senior Political Writer, United Press International <br> Blackwell's observation speaks a great truth about American government. Since no one man or woman can do it all, alone, we have followed the French in the development of bureaucratic systems that allow for power and authority to be delegated to subordinates who are responsible, on a daily basis, for the administration of public policy. It is these people, even more than the president, who directly impact the way policies are developed and carried out. <br> Throughout the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama presented himself to the American people as a change-oriented centrist, slightly to the left of the middle of the road. The way he has governed over his first 100 days, however, shows him to be anything but the image he projected, particularly where many of his appointments are concerned. And it is these appointments that will determine the direction of policy in his administration over the next four years. <br> Then there is Attorney General Eric Holder, who prior to his appointment may have been best known for helping fugitive financier Marc Rich obtain a pardon in the waning days of the Clinton administration. Since coming into office, however, he shocked the nation when, during a presentation to mark Black History month, he called America a nation of cowards on the issue of race. Writer Joe Klein, who is generally sympathetic to the liberal point of view, denounced Holder for his remarks, saying they provided absolutely no acknowledgement of the incredible progress that has been made over the last 40 or 50 years. <br> But it's not just the apples at the top of the barrel that are reason to be suspicious that a leftward drift is underway. There are plenty of secondary appointments, not all of which are subject to the Senate's advice and consent, which make up the new administration's gallery of liberal rogues. <br> More recently, in 2006, Holdren suggested that global sea levels could rise by 13 feet by the end of this century. The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report suggests a potential sea level rise of just 13 inches. <br> Koh is, as columnist Andy McCarthy has written, a radical trans-nationalist. His view is that the United States is not, in essence, an independent nation with a natural right to govern its own national security. Rather Koh's view is this country should be governed by a trans-national jurisprudence that assumes America's political and economic interdependence with other nations operating within the international legal system. In Koh's world, U.S. law should be subordinate to some kind of international code. <br> Hardly the calm, rational and reasoned approach one has every right to expect from a senior Pentagon adviser. <br> And then there's Dawn Johnson, who was nominated to be assistant attorney general and head of DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, who has written that abortion restrictions reduce pregnant women to no more than fetal containers and who has opposed the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold a ban on partial birth abortion.
(TomDispatch) "PTSD is going to color everything you write," came the warning from a stepmother of a Marine, a woman who keeps track of such things. That was in 2005, when post-traumatic stress disorder, a.k.a. PTSD, wasn't getting much attention, but soon it was pretty much all anyone wrote about. Story upon story about the damage done to our guys in uniform -- drinking, divorce, depression, destitution -- a laundry list of miseries and victimhood. When it comes to veterans, it seems like the only response we can imagine is to feel sorry for them. <br> (TomDispatch) "PTSD is going to color everything you write," came the warning from a stepmother of a Marine, a woman who keeps track of such things. That was in 2005, when post-traumatic stress disorder, a.k.a. PTSD, wasn't getting much attention, but soon it was pretty much all anyone wrote about. Story upon story about the damage done to our guys in uniform -- drinking, divorce, depression, destitution -- a laundry list of miseries and victimhood. When it comes to veterans, it seems like the only response we can imagine is to feel sorry for them. <br> Victim is one of the two roles we allow our soldiers and veterans (the other is, of course, hero), but most don't have PTSD, and this isn't one of those stories. <br> Civilian to the core, I've escaped any firsthand experience of war, but I've spent the past seven years talking with current GIs and recent veterans, and among the many things they've taught me is that nobody gets out of war unmarked. That's especially true when your war turns out to be a shadowy, relentless occupation of a distant land, which requires you to do things that you regret and that continue to haunt you. <br> Theoretically, whole countries go to war, not just their soldiers, but not this time. Civilian sympathy for "the troops" may be just one more way for us to avoid a real reckoning with our last decade-plus of war, when the hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown up on the average American's radar only if somebody screws up or noticeable numbers of Americans get killed. The veterans at the heart of this story -- victims, heroes, it doesn't matter -- struggle to reconcile what they did in those countries with the "service" we keep thanking them for. We can see them as sick, with all the stigma, neediness, and expense that entails, or we can recognize them as human beings, confronting the morality of what they've done in our name and what they've seen and come to know -- even as they try to move on. <br> Sacred Wounds, Moral Injuries <br> Former Army staff sergeant Andy Sapp spent a year at Forward Operating Base Speicher near Tikrit, Iraq, and has lived for the past six years with PTSD. Seven if you count the year he refused to admit that he had it because he never left the base or fired his weapon, and who was he to suffer when others had it so much worse? Nearly 50 when he deployed, he was much older than most of his National Guard unit. He had put in 17 years in various branches of the military, had a stable family, strong religious ties, a good education, and a satisfying career as a high-school English teacher. He expected all that to insulate him, so it took a while to realize that the whole time he was in Iraq, he was numb. In the end, he would be diagnosed with PTSD and given an 80% disability rating, which, among other benefits, entitles him to sessions with a Veterans Administration psychologist, whom he credits with saving his life. <br> Andy recalls a 1985 BBC series called "Soldiers" in which a Marine commander says, "It's not that we can't take a man who's 45 years old and turn him into a good soldier. It's that we can't make him love it." Like many soldiers, Andy had assumed that his role would be to protect his country when it was threatened. Instead, he now considers himself part of "something evil." So at a point when his therapy stalled and his therapist suggested that his spiritual pain was exacerbating his psychological pain, it suddenly clicked. The spiritual part he now calls his sacred wound. Others call it "moral injury." <br> It's a concept in progress, defined as the result of taking part in or witnessing something of consequence that you find wrong, something which violates your deeply held beliefs about yourself and your role in the world. For a moment, at least, you become what you never wanted to be. While the symptoms and causes may overlap with PTSD, moral injury arises from what you did or failed to do, rather than from what was done to you. It's a sickness of the heart more than the head. Or, possibly, moral injury is what comes first and, if left unattended, can congeal into PTSD. <br> What we now call PTSD goes way back. In "Odysseus in America," psychiatrist (and MacArthur "genius" grantee) Jonathan Shay has traced similar symptoms to Homer's account of Odysseus's homecoming from the Trojan War. The idea that a soldier may continue to be haunted by his wartime life has had a name since at least the Civil War. It was called "soldier's heart" then, a lovely name for a terrible affliction. <br> Click here to continue reading <br> Nan Levinson, a Boston-based journalist, reports on civil liberties, politics, and culture.

(The New Republic) This year's Super Tuesday will be "super" in the most obvious way: Ten states with a total of 437 delegates will make their decisions on the same day. What will be the upshot of all these contests? Below, a guide to what is likely to happen and how to interpret the results: <br> (The New Republic) This year's Super Tuesday will be "super" in the most obvious way: Ten states with a total of 437 delegates will make their decisions on the same day. What will be the upshot of all these contests? Below, a guide to what is likely to happen and how to interpret the results: <br> Special Section: Election 2012Why a win isn't a winRomney picks up big-name endorsements <br> Super Tuesday won't prove decisive. This is true for two reasons. First, all ten states are using some variant of a proportional system to award delegates. Some are looking to statewide vote totals, while others focus on the results within congressional districts. (Ohio uses a hybrid system: About a quarter of the delegates are allocated proportional to the statewide vote above a 20 percent threshold, unless one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, in which case he gets all the statewide delegates. The remaining three quarters go to the victor in each congressional district on a winner-take-all basis.) Whatever the details, these proportional allocation schemes virtually ensure that no candidate will score the kind of knockout blow that John McCain did on Super Tuesday four years ago. <br> Second, the mix of states on March 6 makes it very unlikely that any candidate will pull off anything like a clean sweep. In 2008, Mitt Romney didn't win a single primary in the Deep South, and almost half his victories came in states that share a border with Canada. With that track record, he's not likely to prevail in Georgia, or Tennessee, or Oklahoma on Tuesday, though he should win comfortable victories in Massachusetts and Vermont. And because neither Newt Gingrich nor Rick Santorum managed to get on the Virginia ballot, Romney should prevail there as well, barring a shocking last-minute surge in support for Ron Paul. And then there are three smaller states (Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota) where libertarian support for Paul could make a difference -- who knows how much, and to whose ultimate advantage? <br> The biggest prize is Ohio -- and it's still up for grabs. Ohio is the most important state that is voting on Tuesday not because it awards the most delegates (it doesn't; Georgia is larger in that respect), but because it's the most significant politically. Since the founding of the GOP more than a century and a half ago, no Republican has ever won the presidency without carrying Ohio, which is the closest thing we have to a microcosm of the country. Granted, the state's Republican primary electorate is far from a representative sample of voters in Ohio. But it is large and diverse, and unlike Georgia and Michigan, it's no one's home base. In short, it's a fair fight for high stakes. <br> So what's happening in the Buckeye state? Two weeks ago, Santorum had moved out to a eighteen point lead, 42-24, over Romney. As of March 2, that edge had shrunk to only two points, 33-31. (Both findings are from Rasmussen, so it's an apples-to-apples comparison.) The most recent Quinnipiac survey as of March 2 closely tracks Rasmussen, with Santorum enjoying a 35-31 advantage over Romney. (The next survey from that organization comes out Monday morning.) <br> The internals of the Q-poll offer some insight into the dynamics of the race. As has been the case in other states, Romney does well among older and better-educated voters, while Santorum is strong among white evangelicals and Tea Party supporters. 69 percent of Santorum's supporters say they've made up their minds. But so have 65 percent of Romney's. Notably, 48 percent of the voters backing Gingrich say they might change, and those who do are more likely to shift toward Santorum than toward Romney. And the demographics tend to work in Santorum's favor. Compared to Michigan, Ohio has more evangelicals, more voters with no college education, and a larger share of its population in rural areas. On the other hand, as we saw in Michigan, voters still know less about Santorum than they do about Romney, who has run a national race before. So new information via negative advertising can influence their opinion of Santorum, and we can be sure that the Romney campaign will spend whatever they have in an effort to impugn Santorum's conservative credentials. These countervailing forces point to a close contest down to the wire. <br> For Santorum, the difference between success and failure rests on two states. The best outcome for Santorum would be to win Oklahoma and Tennessee by healthy margins, hold on to beat Romney in Ohio, and squeeze by Gingrich in Georgia (unlikely but not out of the question). If that were to happen, Santorum would be declared the evening's winner, regardless of the delegate count, and the Republican race would continue without a clear front-runner. The worst outcome for Santorum: winning only Oklahoma and Tennessee, fueling the narrative that he can't expand his base of support much beyond social conservatives and intensifying the effort of those outside that base to rally around Romney. <br> Gingrich is almost certainly finished. It's hard to see how he wins anything outside of Georgia and restores his credibility as the leading movement-conservative alternative to Romney. He'll probably keep on going as long as the cash flows from Las Vegas. But Sheldon Adelson didn't get to be one of the richest men in America by pouring his money down rat holes. If nothing else, March 6 may be remembered as Gingrich's Waterloo. <br> William Galston is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a contributing editor for The New Republic.

Tom Engelhardt, co-founder of the American Empire Project, runs the Nation Institute's TomDispatch.com. His latest book is The American Way of War: How Bush's Wars Became Obama's (Haymarket Books). This piece first appeared on TomDispatch.You can't turn on the TV news or pick up a paper these days without stumbling across the latest political poll and the pros explaining how to parse it, or some set of commentators, pundits, and reporters placing their bets on the midterm elections. The media, of course, loves a political horse race and, as those 2010 midterms grow ever closer, you can easily feel like you're not catching the news but visiting an Off-Track Betting parlor. <br> Fortified by rounds of new polls and all those talking heads calibrating and recalibrating prospective winners and losers, seats "leaning Democratic" and "leaning Republican," the election season has essentially become an endless handicapping session. This is how American politics is now framed -- as a months or years-long serial election for which November 2nd is a kind of hangover. Then, only weeks after the results are in, the next set of polls will be out and election 2012, the Big Show, will be on the agenda with all the regular handicappers starting to gather at all the usual places. <br> Doesn't it strike you as odd, though, that this mania for handicapping remains so parochially electoral? After all, it could be applied to so many things, including the state of the world at large as seen from Washington. So consider this my one-man tip sheet on what you could think of as the global midterms, focused on prospective winners and losers, as well as those "on the cusp," including crucial countries and key personalities. <br> Prospective Winners <br> Osama bin Laden: <br> Who woulda thunk it? More than nine years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden and his number two compadre, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are believed to be alive, well, and living comfortably in the Pakistani borderlands with not a cave in sight, according to the best guesstimate of a "NATO official who has day-to-day responsibility for the war in Afghanistan." With the globe's "sole superpower" eternally on his trail -- admittedly, the Bush administration took a few years off from the "hunt" to crash and burn in Iraq -- he's a prospective global winner just for staying alive. But before we close the books on him, he gets extra points for a singular accomplishment: with modest funds and a few thousand ragtag masked recruits, swinging on monkey bars and clambering over obstacles in "camps" in Afghanistan, he managed to lure the United States into two financially disastrous, inconclusive wars, one in its eighth year, the other in its tenth. To give credit where it's due, he had help from the Bush administration with its dominatrix-like global fantasies. Still, it's not often that someone can make his dreams your nightmares on such a scale. <br> The Taliban: <br> Here's another crew heading toward the winner's circle after yet another typically fraud-wracked Afghan parliamentary election conferring even less legitimacy on President Hamid Karzai's toothless government in Kabul. Think of the Taliban as the miracle story of the global backlands, the phoenix of extreme Islamic fundamentalist movements. After all, in November 2001, when the Taliban were swept out of Kabul, the movement couldn't have been more thoroughly discredited. Afghans were generally sick of their harsh rule and abusive ways and, if reports can be believed, relieved, even overjoyed, to be rid of them (whatever Afghans thought about their country being invaded). But when night fell in perhaps 2005-2006, they were back, retooled and remarkably effective. <br> And it's only gotten worse (or, from the Taliban point of view, better) ever since. Yes, they are now getting pounded by a heightened American bombing campaign, a Special Operations night-raids-and-assassination campaign, and pressure from newly surging U.S. forces in the southern part of the country. Nonetheless, as the Wall Street Journal reported recently, they are achieving some remarkable successes in northern Afghanistan. After all, the Taliban had always been considered a Pashtun tribal movement and while there are Pashtuns in the north, they are a distinct minority. The Journal nonetheless reports: "[T]he insurgency is now drawing ethnic Uzbeks, Tajiks, and other minorities previously seen as unsympathetic to the rebel cause." <br> If, more than nine years later, the Taliban -- the Taliban! -- is attracting groups that theoretically loath it, have few cultural affinities with it, and long fought or opposed it, then you know that the American campaign in Afghanistan has hit its nadir. Thanks to us and our man in Kabul, the Taliban is increasingly the fallback position, the lesser of two disasters, for Afghan nationalists. This helps explain why more than $27 billion dollars in American training funds hasn't produced an Afghan military or police force capable of or willing to fight, while Taliban guerrillas, lacking such aid, fight fiercely anyway. <br> Iran (in Iraq): <br> Remember that old witticism of the neocons of the ascendant Bush moment back in 2003: "Everyone wants to go to Baghdad. Real men want to go to Tehran"? Well, it's turned out to be truer than they ever imagined. Just recently, for instance, Iraqi caretaker prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, went to Tehran to try to hammer out a deal to keep his position (see Sadr, Muqtada al-, below). It's undeniable that Iran, a moderate-sized regional power the Bush administration expected to crush and instead found itself struggling with by proxy in Iraq for years, now has a preponderant position of influence there. Despite so many billions of dollars and American lives, not to speak of years of covert destabilization campaigns aimed at Iran, Tehran seems to have outmaneuvered Washington in Baghdad (and perhaps in Lebanon as well). Call that an on-going win against the odds. <br> Here's the bad news when it comes to China -- a weak third quarter dropped the growth rate of its gross domestic product to 9.6%. Yep, you read that right: only 9.6% (down from 10.3% in the second quarter). For comparison, the U.S rate of growth leaped from 1.7% in the second quarter to 2.3% in the third quarter, with some experts predicting no growth or even shrinkage by year's end. Make no mistake, China has its lurking problems, including an overheating urban real-estate market verging on bubbledom (which, post-2008, should cause any leadership to shudder) and tens of millions of peasants left in dismal poverty in the long decades when "to get rich" was "glorious." <br> Still, the country has managed to pass Japan for number-two-global-economic-power status, to corner a startling range of future global energy reserves so that its economy can drink deep for decades to come, and to forge a front-running position in various renewable-energy fields. Its leaders have accomplished all this thanks to economic muscle, diplomacy, and cash (think: bribes) without sending its soldiers abroad or fighting a war (or even a skirmish) overseas. They have even learned how to be thoroughly belligerent while relying only on economic power. Check out, for instance, the over-the-top way they crushed Japan in a recent stand-off over a Chinese trawler captain in Japanese custody, wielding only the threat to withhold rare earth metals (necessary to various advanced industrial processes), 95%-97% of which are, at the moment, produced by China. We're definitely talking global winner here. <br> Drone Makers: <br> If America's wars are eternal field laboratories for new weaponry, then the grand winners of the latest round of wars are the drone makers. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, the jewel in the crown of Southern California's drone industry, now employs 10,000 workers and runs double shifts in, as W.J. Hennigan of the Los Angeles Times writes, a "fast-growing business fueled by Pentagon spending -- at least $20 billion since 2001 -- and billions more chipped in by the CIA and Congress." Washington has been plunking down more than $5 billion a year for its drone purchases, the development of future drone technology, and the carrying out of 24/7 robot assassination campaigns as well as a full-scale Terminator war in the Pakistani borderlands. <br> These "precision" weapons are capable of taking out people, including civilians in the vicinity, from thousands of miles away. The drones themselves -- termed by CIA Director Leon Panetta "the only game in town" when it comes to stopping al-Qaeda -- turn out to be capable of settling nothing. For every bad guy they kill, they kill civilians as well, seeding new enemies in what is essentially a war to create future terrorists. But that hardly matters. Terminator wars are hot and the drone, as a product, is definitely a global winner. Not only are American companies starting to export the craft to allies willing to pay in global hotspots, but other countries are lining up to create drone industries of their own. Expect the friendly skies to continue to fill. <br> Muqtada al-Sadr: Here's a heartwarming winner's circle story about a highly experienced political operator, still known in the U.S. press as the "anti-American cleric," who just couldn't be kept down. Sadr led an armed Shiite movement of the poor in Iraq that, in 2004, actively fought U.S. forces to a draw in the old city of Najaf. <br> He himself was hunted by the U.S. military and, at one point during the years when Washington ruled in Baghdad, warrants were even put out for his arrest in a murder case. Still, the guy survived, as did his movement, armed and then un- (or less) armed. In 2007, he packed his bags and moved to the safety of neighboring Iran to "study" and move up in Shia clerical ranks. In the most recent Iraqi elections, now seven months past, for a parliament that has yet to meet, his movement won more than 10% of the vote and with that he was declared a "kingmaker." He has always unwaveringly called for a full American withdrawal from his country. Now, with the potential power to return Nouri al-Maliki (for whom he has no love) to the prime ministership, he is evidently insisting that Washington retain not a single future base in Iraq -- and the Obama administration is twitching with discomfort. <br> General Stanley McChrystal: And here's another heartwarming winner's circle story. Once upon a time, McChrystal was essentially the U.S. military's assassin-in-chief. For five years he commanded the Pentagon's super-secret Joint Special Operations Command which, among other things, ran what Seymour Hersh called an "executive assassination wing" out of Vice President Dick Cheney's office. Then, the general was appointed Afghan War commander by Barack Obama and, under the worst of circumstances, tried to implement his boss's textbook version of counterinsurgency doctrine (see COIN and Petraeus, General David, below). He actually cut back radically on the U.S. air war in Afghanistan in an attempt to kill far less of the civilians he was supposed to "protect" and have a better shot at winning "hearts and minds." <br> The result: utter frustration. The Taliban grew, Afghans remained miserably unhappy, and American troops hated his new war-fighting policy which meant they couldn't call in air support when they wanted it. He and his circle of former Special Ops types flew to Paris to greet NATO allies (for whom, it seems, he had nothing but contempt), drank hard, and vented their feelings toward the Obama administration, all in the presence of a Rolling Stone reporter. Next thing you know, the president has canned his war commander, putting him momentarily in the loser's circle -- and that was his good fortune. He was shown the door out of Afghanistan before the going got worse. He is now in the process of retooling himself via a teaching position at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University as a budding leadership guru and inspirational speaker. ("Few people can speak about leadership, teamwork, and international affairs with as much insight as General Stanley McChrystal...") <br> If you're a typical American of a certain age laid off in today's bad times, the likelihood of getting a half-decent job is next to nil (and retraining isn't going to help much either). On the other hand, if you begin high enough and, say, the president of the United States axes you, all's well with the world.On the Cusp <br> General David Petraeus: The Great Surgifier of Baghdad and the Seer of Kabul is now, it seems, in something of a rush. For one thing, his fabulous 2006-2008 surge in Iraq turns out to have been for the benefit of Iran, not Washington (see Iran in Iraq above). In addition, as members of the Sunni Awakening Movement reportedly peel off in disillusionment or disgust with the present largely Shiite government and rejoin the insurgency in significant numbers, his modest success is threatening to unravel behind him -- and so is American support for the Afghan War he now commands, according to the opinion polls. <br> As a result, according to Washington pundit (and Petraeus-lover) David Ignatius, he's making a "strategic pivot" -- a decorous phrase -- in Afghanistan. Give him credit for daring -- or desperation. He may be known as the progenitor of the Army's present counterinsurgency strategy, or COIN, the man who dusted off that failed, long discarded doctrine from the Vietnam era, made it thrillingly sexy, complete with new manual, and elevated it to a central position in Army planning for years to come, but he's not a man to let consistency stand in his way. Seeing the need for quick signs of "progress" in Afghanistan (where the war has been going desperately badly), both for a December Obama administration policy review and to keep any U.S. troop drawdowns to a minimum in 2011, he has countermanded former war commander McChrystal's COIN-ish attempt to radically scale back U.S. air strikes. Instead, he's loosed the U.S. Air Force on the Taliban, opted to try to pound them with anything available, pushed for escalation in the form of "hot pursuit" across the Pakistani border, upped Special Operations "capture or kill" raids, and generally left COIN in a ditch. Think of his new tactics as BKJ for bomb-kill-jaw -- the jawing being about "peace talks" and aimed at influential sectors of the U.S. media, among others, part of a rising drumbeat of "progress" propaganda from the general's headquarters. <br> Well-connected, savvy, and willing to shift tactics on a moment's notice, Petraeus is a figure to contend with in Washington, our most political general since I don't know when. Like Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, he may be playing a cagey hand to extend matters through 2012, when a president ready to fight on till hell freezes over could take office. He's a man on the cusp, destined for success, but only a few hops, skips, and jumps ahead of failure.(By the way, keep an eye on another Bush-era holdover, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, if you want to gauge what Washington thinks of the war's "progress." Just a month ago, he was publicly muttering about retirement early next year. He's not a man who will want to preside over disaster in Afghanistan. If he does leave early in 2011, just assume that the war is headed for the toilet and, having supported his war commanders in their surge strategy through 2009 and 2010, he's getting out while the going is still good and his reputation intact.) <br> Pakistan: Only recently 20% underwater, Pakistan is in a protracted military, intelligence, and policy dance with the U.S., the Afghans, the Taliban, India, and god knows who else so intricate that only a contortionist could appreciate it. For Washington, Pakistan is an enigma curled in a conundrum wrapped in a roti and sprinkled with hot pepper. <br> With the Obama administration schizophrenically poised between partnership and poison -- policies of "hot pursuit" across the Pakistani border and placation, showering the Pakistani military with yet more weaponry and cutting off some units from any aid at all -- anything is possible. Armed to the teeth, clobbered by nature, beset by fundamentalist guerrillas, surrounded by potential enemies, and unraveling, democratic and ever at the edge of military rule, Pakistan is the greatest unknown of the Greater Middle East (even if it is in South Asia). If it's on the cusp of hell, then, like it or not, Washington will be, too. <br> Israel: The question here is straightforward enough: Just how badly can Prime Minister Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu and his government treat the Obama administration (and the president himself) and get away with it? Right now, the answer seems to be, as badly as it wants. After all, Washington put almost all its global diplomatic apples in one ill-woven negotiating basket, named it making progress on a two-state solution to the Israel/Palestine problem, started talks, and then offered Israel a package of goodies of a sort that would normally only be given away deep into negotiations, if at all, for nothing more than a two-month extension of the Israeli settlement-construction freeze. <br> The result: Israeli settlers are again building up a storm on the West Bank while the Netanyahu government plays even harder to get. If the Obama administration can't do better than this, then at the next TomDispatch handicapping session Israel has a reasonable shot at being elevated into the winner's circle. If Obama and his team ever get tired of being kicked around by Netanyahu Co., especially with the U.S. midterms behind them, life could get tougher for Bibi. <br> The real question is: Can the prime minister play out this version of the game until 2012 in hopes that Obama will lose out and a new U.S. president will be ready to give away the store?Iran (not in Iraq): Nasty government, shaky economy beset by international sanctions, poor choices and poor planning, irritated population, enemies with malice aforethought, and an embattled peaceful nuclear program that could be headed for "breakout" capacity versus fabulous reserves of oil and natural gas and integration into the great Eurasian energy grid as well as into the energy-eager plans of China, Russia, Pakistan, and India. It's anybody's bet. <br> The Global Economy: I wouldn't even think about handicapping this one or guessing what it might be on the cusp of. After all, Asian economies (minus Japan) are heating up, as are a number of developing ones like Brazil's (with capital flowing to such places in problematic amounts); meanwhile, the American economy is cold as a tomb, and Europe is teetering at the edge of who knows what. If this isn't the definition of a jerry-built Rube-Goldberg-version of a global system, what is? Put your money down if you want, but you'll get no odds here.
Jean-Louis Gasse is a Silicon Valley veteran and currently general partner for the venture capital firm Allegis Capital in Palo Alto..The short version: <br> Who in his right mind expects Steve Jobs to let Adobe (and other) cross-platform application development tools control his (I mean, the iPhone OS's) future? Cross-platform tools dangle the old "write once, run everywhere" promise. But, by being cross-platform, they don't use, they erase "uncommon" features. To Apple, this is anathema as it wants application developers to use and promote its differentiation. It's that simple. Losing differentiation is death by low margins. It's business. Apple is right to keep control of its platform's future. <br> The longer version: <br> The upcoming 4.0 release of the iPhone OS will come with licensing language that prohibits the use of Adobe's Flash-to-iPhone compiler. The compiler is a clever way around the absence of a Flash interpreter on Apple's smartphone OS. It takes Flash code in and outputs iPhone OS code, allowing Flash content and apps to run on the iPhone (and iPad). Problem solved. <br> Not so fast, says Apple; we'll only allow applications that are written "natively" with our tools. No cross-platform tools, no Flash-to-iPhone compiler, no Flash. <br> Less than 24 hours later, an Adobe employee, Lee Brimelow, posts a virulent critique of Apple's latest prohibition, titled "Apple Slaps Developers In The Face". He concludes with a vigorous 'Go screw yourself Apple' and then adds a postscript: 'Comments disabled as I'm not interested in hearing from the Cupertino Comment SPAM bots.' Ah, yes. The one-way mirror <br> [What the irate gentleman fails to say is this: The only developers slapped in the face are those who don't use Apple development tools because they want to write a cross-platform app that may or may not use the particular features of the iPhone OS.] <br> He's not alone in condemning Apple. In his blog, called "Why does everything suck?," Hank Williams asks if "Steve Jobs Has Just Gone Mad" and wonders about "Insane Restraint of Trade". <br> Adobe appears to be worried. <br> In its latest SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock market regulator) filing, the company admits that its 'business could be harmed'. If Apple succeeds in turning developers away from Adobe's tools, a new version of which, CS5, is about to be announced, well, the money pump will stutter.There are calmer minds, however. In his highly-recommended blog, Daring Fireball, John Gruber explains why Apple changed the iPhone OS licensing agreement. It's strategic, really: Apple doesn't want anyone else to have control over which OS features the applications have or don't have access to. I'll explain in a moment why it's rational for Apple to fend off cross-compilers, and why it's not too rational for Adobe employees and others to criticize Apple for keeping control of its future. But first, a bit of history. <br> Apple and Adobe are an old couple, going all the way back to the early Mac days. Adobe had created beautiful fonts, a PostScript interpreter, and had absorbed Aldus for its seminal program, PageMaker. That's how the LaserWriter was born and the era of desktop publishing began. Besides being crucial to the Macintosh by creating so much desktop publishing software, Adobe also acquired and published Photoshop in 1990, at first exclusively on the Macintosh. <br> One is tempted to say that without Adobe there would be no Macintosh and no Apple. Steve Jobs and John Warnock, one of Adobe's founders, were close, even if things didn't always go swimmingly. An Apple engineer, Gifford Calenda, began to develop TrueType, an alternative to Adobe's "mathematical" fonts. I was at Apple when we had to make the buy-or-create decision. The basic set of Adobe fonts cost about $30, if memory serves. If Gifford and his colleagues succeeded, which they eventually did, we could get our fonts for "free". To make sure the fonts got industry-wide adoption, Apple licensed the TrueType technology to Microsoft for free. The business model wasn't font revenue but Adobe license fee avoidance. Adobe, understandably, wasn't too pleased with this.
This column was written by Evan Schuman, the editor of StorefrontBacktalk, a site that tracks retail technology, e-commerce and security issues. Retail Realities appears every Friday. Evan can be reached at E-mail and on Twitter.With Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn leading the way, many retailers are experimenting with a wide range of approaches for creating common-interest communities for their customers, especially online. Of course, such actions start to shift some of the power away from the chains and to the consumer. Amazon last month made its first defensive move in trying to control that type of community. <br> What Amazon did was change how it handles E-mail. Before, comments to a discussion forum would include a customer's real E-mail address. No more."Real buyer and seller E-mail addresses will be hidden by our systems. All sellers and buyers will be assigned an Amazon E-mail alias," said an Amazon statement. "This will enable both parties to continue communicating as they do today with standard E-mail providers (such as Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.). However, that communication will happen via their new E-mail aliases instead of their real E-mail addresses. All communication will be stored and available for review in case of disputes." <br> This move is very interesting. From a brand-building perspective, there are few things better than sitting back and creating a huge room for tons of your customers to gather and talk about you. In the meantime, you sit back and take notes, capturing all of the exchanges for later analysis-for both general trends and any individual situations that you can address with individual customers. That last part has become a Twitter specialty. <br> E-mail strategies have become crucial among major retailers these days, sitting right alongside of SMS, mobile and the Web. Best Buy, for example, recently slashed its E-mail list down to 2 million, only to discover that it immediately had to build it back up to 27 million names.. <br> But even more than E-mail strategies, retailers are trying to figure out how to bridge the ever-popular virtual forums and bring them into their physical stores. Apple is stirring up a lot of retail excitement with an application for a patent for a concept called iGroups, where iPhone users could privately share information with others on their groups who happen to be in a very specific place, such as a music concert, a tradeshow, a rally or a wedding. But merchants think it could also work in shopping malls. Instant virtual discussion forum in a very non-virtual building. <br> The struggle, though, is to make this work for younger consumers (the so-called Gen Y consumers), whose feelings about virtual discussions is still evolving. One recent study has challenged the assumption that teen girls, for example, would love to share shopping ideas within large groups. Turns out that they don't, but that they will share just about everything within a very small group. <br> The E-mail problem that Amazon is now addressing is, "What happens when customers try to continue the discussions outside your room?" You quickly lose control, both in the sense of policing the room (no obscenities, SPAM, personal attacks or drug deals. I'm cutting you and you off) and being able to monitor all of the exchanges for the referenced general and specific feedback. And, yes, some of that policing might-for the short-sided among us-include deleting nice comments about your rivals and bad things said about your brand. <br> In an E-Commerce space, though, these exchanges can get even more dangerous. By allowing the E-mails in the open, you're offering an easy way for your rivals to talk with your customers. Customers can talk with each other privately, complaining about a perceived plight. One person can post an unhappy experience on Amazon, and it has limited damage potential. Someone has to search for it and find it. <br> But with E-mail, one disgruntled customer-who may or may not have a legitimate point-can place his or her concern in the Inbox of thousands of other customers. It may be time-consuming, but with the right software, it's not that time-consuming. Besides, angry customers (especially the crazier ones) tend to find the time. <br> In this specific Amazon situation, the grouping is not solely customers; it's an exchange of buyers and sellers. You can now creep into the "if one person cuts a break for one customer and drops the price another 8 percent, do they really want that screamed to every other potential customer?" <br> Amazon listed four reasons for its effort: increasing "privacy and security of buyer-to-seller communication"; resolving "disputes faster and better by ensuring that reviewers have access to all buyer/seller communications"; reducing "the number of A-Z claims filed by encouraging and verifying pre-claim buyer/seller communication"; and eliminating "unnecessary contacts during claims investigations." <br> Those points are all legitimate, and you'll note that Amazon neglects to note the treasure trove of additional CRM data it will gather. Consumers tend to speak more freely when it's point-to-point rather than when their comments are posted in a public forum, even if they know-but will probably forget-that the retailer is monitoring and capturing the exchanges.The "unnecessary contacts" point is especially intriguing. Is that "unnecessary" in the sense of "you're saying things to each other that we don't want said about our brand" or "we can't police against SPAM, obscenity, death threats or anything else if it's happening outside our earshot"? To be fair, it's clearly both. <br> As chain executives accelerate efforts by joining social sites, setting up their own pages on those established sites and even creating their own forums, they need to think through little things such as E-mail access. <br> Setting up a community to help with brand building and making sales is fabulous. But even a friendly community needs a police force. The question is: Where to draw the line between a "protect and serve" group of guardians and a 1984-style group of monitor-everything overseers for the good of the public? Amazon seems to have made the right choice here. It understands that protecting its citizens and learning a lot more about them don't have to be mutually exclusive. That's true as long as the residents don't object and opt to move to a less gated community.By Evan SchumanSpecial to CBSNews.com
Michelle Cottle is a senior editor of The New Republic.Adults love to obsess about how the perils of modernity are ruining the younger generations. (They can't help themselves. It's how they keep their minds off all the gray hair, crows feet, and erectile dysfunction that stalk the land of the middle aged.) Nowadays, a favorite fixation is whether youth can be taught to responsibly navigate our wired world. Can immature minds grasp the privacy issues that become more complicated with each new networking tool? How can we make teens understand the foolishness of putting drunken, naked spring break pics on Facebook for the entire world (and future potential employers) to ogle? Is social networking creating a generation of scorching narcissists? Will sexting turn our youth into a pack of mindless, drooling sociopaths? <br> I'm sorry, but from where I sit, it ain't the young'uns having notable trouble setting barriers and using technology with any level of discretion, reserve, or common sense. Rather, every time you turn around, an ostensible grown-up has done something monumentally stupid like sexting his mistress, sending filthy instant messages to strapping young House pages, or tweeting about his congressional delegation's classified landing in Iraq. And how about that moron in North Carolina who googled the many and varied ways to kill a person in the days before killing his wife? Now there's a guy in need of a lesson on the dangers of interconnectivity. This is not to say that younger users don't do plenty of stupid stuff as well. But, as often as not, it's the older generations that clearly can't be trusted to navigate even basic media and networking tools. <br> Just last week, two unrelated news stories drove this point home for me. The first and more respectable involved a new Pew study showing that most American teens, usually early adapters of tech innovations, have no use for Twitter. And within the slim 8 percent of "online teens" who do use Twitter, most are tracking the goings-on of celebrities. (A related question found that 19 percent of online adults "use Twitter or similar services," although the different wording of the question makes an apples-to-apples comparison impossible.) <br> The WaPo's article on the Pew report cited similar findings from other researchers. In a survey of college freshmen last year, Eszter Hargittai of Northwestern University found that 10 percent had used Twitter once and never gone back, while only 4 percent used it regularly. "They're more interested in friends and not keeping in touch with the world more broadly," she explained. And while adults often assume teens are desperate for the spotlight, privacy is a big concern, said Lynn Schofield Clark of the University of Denver. "Twitter seems to take away the control they want," she observed. "There is a growing awareness of privacy levels." Overwhelmingly, members of the younger generation prefer friend-focused tools like Facebook, where they have more control over their info and interactions. <br> How's that for irony? It turns out that all those middle-aged goobers tweeting about their sock drawers in a scramble to prove they're one of the cool kids are in fact proving how uncool they really are: Tech's true early adapters are more discriminating and have little interest in blasting their every thought to a vast cloud of strangers. So explain to me again which demographic group is the more attention-starved and narcissistic? <br> I was still pondering teens' underappreciated level of tech maturity when I was smacked in the face by the latest installment of the John-Edwards-Is-a-Pig-and-an-Idiot drama. As it turns out, not only does an Edwards-Rielle Hunter sex tape exist, it is the focus of a legal battle between Hunter and Edwards dogsbody turned sex-scribbler Andrew Young. On February 5, Young was scheduled to appear in a North Carolina court to contest an injunction filed by Hunter, who seeks to prevent dissemination and to regain possession of "a personal video recording that depicted matters of a very private and personal nature." Depending on who tells it, the tape was either stolen by Young from a hatbox full of Hunter's very important personal effects or discarded by Hunter when she fled the North Carolina home the Youngs had been renting for her in late 2007. Either way, Young somehow found himself in possession of a home movie of the sort that drives the tabloids to stuff filthy wads of cash into one's trousers. He is willing to fight Hunter for it (perhaps even eager, seeing as how he has a book to promote), and, at this point, there's not much Edwards can do but sit back and watch his once-golden image gather even more layers of slime. <br> Now, admittedly, allowing oneself to be videotaped banging one's pregnant mistress (Hunter is reportedly heavy with child in the tape) while in the thick of a presidential campaign may not be as cutting edge as emailing a mistress photos of one's penis. (Go Tiger!) But it is no less jaw-droppingly stupid, not to mention nave about where even marginally interesting footage tends to wind up these days. (I'm now taking bets on how long before bits of this masterwork hit YouTube.) So unless Edwards expects us to believe his romp was recorded without his knowledge (one of the few claims of innocence he hasn't yet attempted), we must assume he is a complete fool. At least when young hotties like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian make sex tapes, they manage a career boost from it. <br> My sense is that many grown-ups grab for media toys and new technologies to feel hip and to display how cutting-edge and non-obsolete they are. But adults clearly can't handle their tech, be it tweets, texts, emails, or even relatively old-fashioned video. It's not really their fault: They didn't grow up in a wired world and so lack the basic feel for where limits should be drawn. The resulting awkwardness is a little like allowing a bunch of folks who've never seen a gun before to dash off into the woods with a Bushmaster semi-automatic. Without responsible, non-adult supervision, someone is going to get hurt. By Michelle Cottle: Reprinted with permission from The New Republic.
Jonathan V. Last is a senior writer at The Weekly Standard.The conventional wisdom is that Barack Obama's decline in the polls represents a new, unexpected turn against him. But an examination of the results of the recent elections in Virginia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts suggests that what we might really be seeing is a return to the skepticism that significant portions of the electorate have showed about Obama from the beginning of his national career. <br> For six months during the 2008 primaries, Obama and Hillary Clinton crisscrossed the country wooing voters. Obama consistently failed to win over important parts of the Democratic base, even after it became clear that he was going to be his party's nominee. <br> On February 5-Super Tuesday- Obama did poorly in both New Jersey and Massachusetts, losing to Clinton by 10 and 15 points, respectively. The exit polls were in line with Obama's performance throughout the primary race: He did very well with blacks, wealthy voters, highly educated voters, and very young voters. He did poorly with working-class whites and older voters. In New Jersey, Obama was +20 among voters under the age of 29, but about -26 among voters over 50. In Massachusetts, he ran even with young voters, and -31 among those over 65. As for education, Obama was -41 among voters with only a high school degree, but ran even, or just ahead, among voters possessing postgraduate degrees. And then there was gender and race. In New Jersey, Obama was -19 among white men; in Massachusetts he was +1. <br> In addition to the demography, there was geography. Obama ran well in urban enclaves. He also did well in college towns and state capitals. But he did poorly in the suburbs and in smaller industrial towns. <br> A week after Super Tuesday, Obama won the Virginia primary. He performed somewhat better in all categories, even winning white men by 18 points. But his victory came largely from blacks (who made up 30 percent of the vote, and whom he won 90 to 10) and the upscale Northern Virginia suburbs, increasingly home to a highly educated class of government and technology workers. <br> Reviewing the primary fight, Michael Barone noted that Obama got majorities "from whites only in his home state (Illinois), in states where the white Democratic primary electorate is unusually upscale and non-Jewish (Virginia, Vermont), and in mountain states where the cultural divide is not black-white." This racial divide, Barone explained, was part of a larger, cultural divide between Jacksonians and academics. "In state after state, we have seen Obama do extraordinarily well in academic and state capital enclaves. In state after state, we have seen Clinton do extraordinarily well in enclaves dominated by Jacksonians." <br> The Jacksonian Democrats tended to be white and working-class; the academics tended to be highly educated, and often government employees. This divide is often attributed to latent racism in the Jacksonians. But a suspicion of Barack Obama shouldn't make you a racist. Consider the case of Buchanan County, a Jacksonian stronghold on the Virginia border next to both West Virginia and Kentucky. Obama lost Buchanan County to Hillary Clinton by a margin of 90 to 9. Which might make one view Buchananites with some suspicion-except that in the 1989 gubernatorial race, Douglas Wilder won Buchanan County by 18 points over his (white) Republican rival. <br> In the general election, Obama was finally able to convert some of the voters who had resisted him. Massachusetts doesn't have many Jacksonians, but it does have white ethnic enclaves. Obama went +7 among white Massachusetts men, and his share of white Democrats was nearly the same as his share of all Democrats, meaning that he brought home most of the Clinton voters. In New Jersey, he did less well in this conversion: His white Democratic share ran 4 points behind his overall Democratic share. In Virginia, the Jacksonians warmed to him. After getting shellacked in Buchanan County by Clinton, he lost to McCain there by only 5 points.The question, then, is how these various coalition groups-the white ethnic enclaves, the Jacksonians, the suburban and industrial town voters-have reacted to Democrats since Obama took office. And the answer is: Without enthusiasm. <br> In Virginia, Republican Bob McDonnell won an 18-point victory in a state Obama carried by 6 points. Obama had been -24 among white men in 2008; McDonnell was +43. Obama had carried every income bracket under $75,000 by at least double-digit margins. McDonnell was -8 among those making between $15,000 and $30,000 a year. He was +6 from there up to $50,000 and +28 among those making between $50,000 and $75,000. Where Obama had lost whites without college degrees by a big margin-34 percent-McDonnell did even better than McCain had, rolling up a 51-point advantage. Buchanan County? McDonnell won it by 26 points, a 21-point swing against the Democrats. <br> In New Jersey, it was worse. Chris Christie was outspent by a millionaire incumbent in a state Obama won by 15 points. Christie won by 5 points, and the exit polls showed defections among the same groups who had been against Obama in the presidential primaries. Where Obama had been only -3 among white men, Christie was +34; where Obama had run even with older whites, Christie was +25; where Obama had been competitive among non-college educated whites (he was only -4 in the general election), Christie was +34. In the rural south, Obama had won Gloucester and Salem counties easily. A year later, they went for Christie. In heavily industrialized Passaic County, Obama had won by 21 points; Christie came within 8. <br> Which leaves Massachusetts. There were no exit polls for the January special election. One approximation comes from a Public Policy Polling survey conducted a few days before the election, which concluded with Scott Brown ahead by 5 points. Brown was +12 among white voters (Obama had been +20), and the poll suggested that Brown did very well among middle-aged voters: He was +14 among those age 30 to 44 and +3 from age 45 to 64. Among these groups Obama had been +18 and +20. The town and county results tell the same story. Plymouth and Worcester counties are two ethnic, blue-collar strongholds that went heavily for Clinton in the primaries, by 21 and 25 points, respectively. Brown won them by similar margins: +26 in Plymouth and +23 in Worcester. <br> Caveats abound, of course. This is an exercise in apples and oranges, comparing Democratic primary voters with general election voters. It artificially claims three distinct Democratic candidates as generic proxies for Obama-and even uses a preelection poll sample in lieu of actual exit poll data. This can't count for science, even on the Internet.But if we accept that the comparisons are at least marginally valid, then Obama is not encountering some new, unanticipated resistance from the electorate. Instead, it may be that his general election triumph was the aberration-that his coalition was never as strong as the financial panic of September 2008 made it seem. It would mean that he is now returning to his natural base of support and that the Jacksonians and others who resisted him in the primaries have turned away once again from his charms. <br> But it also suggests something more, that the Democratic party is now the party of Obama, for good and for ill. While the president is no Jacksonian, his party has many in its ranks. Democratic officeholders should be concerned about their voters fleeing not just from Obama but from their party as well. The president may be in the process of trimming the Democratic base back into something that looks an awful lot like his own primary base. <br> A few weeks ago Representative Marion Berry, a Jacksonian from Arkansas's First District, recounted an exchange he had with the president. Asked how he was going to prevent a midterm disaster on the scale of 1994, Obama replied, "Well, the big difference here and in '94 was you've got me." Which may be precisely the problem. <br> By Jonathan Last: Reprinted with permission from The Weekly Standard
The Monday Note covers the intersection between media and technology and the shift of business models. It is jointly edited by Frdric Filloux, a Paris-based journalist and Jean-Louis Gasse, a Silicon Valley veteran currently general partner for the venture capital firm Allegis Capital in Palo Alto. Their column appears on CBS News.com each Monday.Everybody wants to go local. Internet-wise, it sounds like the new flavor of the month. Going local is a digital and idealistic version of Mao Zedong's "hundred flowers blossom," (The Chinese dictator did actually encourage the expression of dissenting opinions but this turned out to have unpleasant consequences for those who took Dear Leader at his word). So, fine. Let's see thousands of European and U.S cities generate a flurry of local Web sites covering city councils, local controversies, urban planning, etc. Every committed citizen will be able to monitor the community's pulse just by clicking on a URL; it will be easy and efficient to launch (or to join) grassroots campaigns against the construction of an ugly overpass or press for the clean-up a hazardous landfill. All of this is real. <br> As I write this, I am listening to NYU professor Clair Shirky's lecture delivered last September at the Harvard University Shorentsein Center (transcript and video here.) Always brilliant and convincing, Shirky revisited the 1992 pedophile priest scandal in Boston, one that was heavily covered by the Boston Globe, but died out due to a lack of resonance in the public. This was in the pre-Internet era. He believes the story would had a much bigger impact differently today because of the Internet. I agree that there is a useful future for local digital media but having said this, allow me to express a slightly skeptical view. <br> First, people tend to celebrate the hyperlocal Web for the wrong reasons, that is, the depletion of local coverage by traditional media. Last Thursday, I was at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston (United Kingdom) for its 12th Digital Editors Network. There, the British news agency Press Association presented a "Public Service Reporting" project. The PA would recruit legions of citizen journalists, they would be asked to comply with the agency's ethics standards as they report on local issues. As for now, the PA is building several pilots and is looking for funding. Tony Johnston, The PA's training chief who presented the case, stated its ambition: a network of 500 to 800 journalists costing 15m to 18m a year. In a preamble, he explained that the British newspapers' shrinking local coverage paved the way for such an initiative (you can find the full details in Journalism.co.uk ) <br> Well. There are two ways of considering such a move. One is to say: Great, community members take over the coverage that matters to them, they use all available tools - social network, live blogging, Flip-camera produced videos - to give local stuff the exposure it needs. <br> Here's another view: Doing local journalism is as complicated as any other kind of reporting. Poring over local financial records requires the same amount of time, dedication and expertise as digging into a national political party's finances. Yes, citizen journalists will do fine reporting on "lighter" issues such as the state of schools or of the sewage system. But uncovering and preventing what really matters, such as the misuse of public funding, rigged bidding procedures for large projects and so on, is a very different story. <br> More broadly, a professional journalist is required to avoid take sides in doing his or her job. Leaving such coverage to self-appointed journalists opens a Pandora's Box to all kinds of agenda-driven reporting. The Internet already suffers from a blogosphere that is largely infected by brand-induced spinning (see our story, Rotten Apples in the Reviews Barrel), with merchants taking advantage of bloggers' lack of training and precarious finances to blend advertisement with reviews. Chances are the same will happen with local coverage provided by brave citizen reporters who will have a hard time remaining independent. <br> As I write this, the situation in the South of France (the Provence-Cte d'Azur region) comes to mind. Down there, not a single large public infrastructure bid is adjudicated in a fair and transparent way. Big utility companies conspire, divvying-up markets, price-fixing multimillion deals. They do this in an increasingly sophisticated way, to the point where the judicial system has mostly given up (OK, regional governments also threw their hands up too; reasons are part incompetence, part business, ahem, pragmatism). Plus, thanks to skilled PR firms, these conglomerates became increasingly better at spinning the tale in the "right" direction. <br> Point is: no brigade of well-intentioned citizen journalists will have the resources to unveil what really "counts." It doesn't mean we have to give up the concept of public reporting; I'm merely emphasizing it won't replace true, professional (and expensive) journalism. <br> When it comes to the Holy Grail of local news on the Internet, the other reason for my skepticism has to do with economic sustainability. If you rely on volunteers, you get what you pay for. Should you compensate bloggers, costs will climb fast. The advertising market? Well, chances are that your independence will collide with your business needs. Plus, local ads are hopelessly cheap. In the French market, for instance, multi-local newspapers know that the ratio between national ads and local ones is roughly 10:1. Apply this to the Web economy, it's unlikely you'd build a decent revenue stream. <br> Paid-for services? Maybe, but they require a different model. People are unlikely to pay for local news; they might, possibly, pay for data-rich packages but the free supply is already abundant. Just consider EveryBlock.com, which aggregates tons of public records (crimes, building permits, restaurant inspections, and all sorts of statistics) into a cleverly arranged interface. Covering 15 American cities, it collects a small audience (445,000 unique visitors in October according to Quantcast - and no growth). Aside of an acquisition by MSNBC last summer, we don't see a business model, even though EveryBlock is just a six person operation (see the article in the NY Times). <br> Some pundits remain bullish on hyperlocal coverage by bloggers. In The Guardian, Jeff Jarvis recently defended (romanticized?) the idea of building "an ecosystem around hyperlocal bloggers". He mentioned "some" (how many? 30 or 3000?) hyperlocal bloggers "serving" (what does he means by this? "Reporting", "covering" is fine, but "serving") markets of 50,000 people making $200,000 in advertising revenue. With no further specifics, it sounds more like wishful thinking than facts. <br> Large newspapers are thinking hard about local or hyperlocal coverage and they closely monitor the "ecosystem" (see The Guardian's topic page on Hyperlocal Media). Many, such as the New York Times, seem concerned with missing the local train (in Chicago for instance). This is actually a smart move for brand consolidation. But as far as the beef is concerned, they better get ready for a vegetarian meal. <br> By Jean-Louis Gasse and Frederic FillouxSpecial to CBSNews.com
Attorney Andrew Cohen analyzes legal issues for CBS News and CBSNews.com.The more things change the more they stay the same. The long-awaited military trial of terror suspect Salim Hamdan, currently underway at the euphemistically-named "Camp Justice" at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, looks from the outside to be a carbon copy of criminal conspiracy trials we see every day here in civilian courts on the mainland. <br> The prosecutors (here, military lawyers) are trying to pretend that Hamdan was a significant cog in the al Qaeda machine just as federal prosecutors would try to portray any organized crime foot soldier as a major player in the mob. Enzo the Baker becomes a capo. The defense, meanwhile, wants military jurors (here, military officers) to believe that Hamdan was little more than a cabbie, a guy just trying to make a buck chauffeuring clients around. Enzo the Baker in this scenario is just a baker. <br> The plot line so far, four days into the trial, is straight from outtakes of "The Godfather" or "Law and Order." We are not witnessing an epochal "war crimes" trial - the first since the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001. We are not unwinding the al Qaeda stem. We are not at the heart of the matter. We are, instead, watching penny-ante stuff, a trial the dramatic moments of which have come mostly because Hamdan apparently doesn't like his attorney and spars with him at the defense table. <br> From Hamdan's own mouth - courtesy of interrogations that likely wouldn't be permitted in our own justice system and which ultimately may reverse a conviction here - his jurors have learned that he identified key al Qaeda suspects and drew maps of camps and compounds. He had knowledge, clearly, but just as clearly no great urge to fight. FBI Agent Craig Donnachie told the panel Thursday that when Hamdan's time in a "terror camp" was up, he "just wanted to return back to the guest house and work there and be with his family." <br> I am no expert, of course, and supporting terrorists is supporting terrorists no matter how long you do it, but this testimony does not strike me as emblematic of the sentiments and actions of a dangerous jihadist. Speaking of which, the only true news to have emerged so far from the trial is a colossal embarrassment to the government and has nothing to do with Hamdan. Evidently, Hamdan told his interrogators years ago that they had released from Gitmo (back to Morocco) a "hard guy" terror suspect named Abdellah Tabarak. Oops. Bet the Administration would rather have Tabarak on trial than Hamdan. <br> But, to paraphrase the architect of the War in Iraq, you go to trial with the defendant you have, not the one you wish you had. This is why historians will note the Hamdan trial only because it was the first full-on military tribunal since the end of World War II. They will note it because of the procedural wrangling that proceeded it (Hamdan took his cause up to the U.S. Supreme Court and won) and the lengthy appellate process that is sure to follow it. Put another way, whatever role Hamdan played in the legal history of the war on terror has already been mostly played. <br> Still it's mildly interesting to see whether and to what extent intelligence-gathering operations can co-exist with evolving criminal and/or military justice. The reason that the charges against Hamdan are built almost entirely from his own words, uttered in countless interrogation sessions, is that Hamdan was never advised that anything he said to his captors could be used against him. A wise policy, right? After all, the primary purpose behind such interrogations is to discover information not to build a future lawsuit. <br> But that policy was put in place before the Supreme Court announced last month that detainees like Hamdan will get a full appellate review following their convictions at Gitmo. It was put into place before the Court forced the White House to mesh military procedures with civilian due process rights. Apples now meet oranges and the big questions are: will the federal courts look upon the Hamdan interrogations at Gitmo as "coercive" and, if so, what will those courts do about it? <br> The answers don't really matter much in Hamdan's case. Whether he serves a life sentence or is deported back to the Middle East probably won't make a difference in the outcome of the war on terror. But the future interrogation questions for our federal courts are hugely important in the upcoming trials of true al Qaeda leaders like Ramzi Binalshibh and Khalid Sheik Mohammed. If their cases are overturned because of the way they were interrogated well, then, that would be quite a story. <br> I don't think that's going to happen. I don't think that any judge in America is going to toss out a conviction of an Al Qaeda terror boss. But I also didn't think that Hamdan's presiding judge, Captain Keith Allred, would have dismissed from the trial evidence of "coercive" interrogation sessions of Hamdan conducted in Afghanistan in 2001. Mohammed and Binalshibh were subject, remember, to certain interrogation methods in the secret prisons at which they were kept after their capture. And that's just one reason why the government is watching the Hamdan trial far more closely than you are.
This column was written by Patrick Cockburn.Government officials in Baghdad make two contradictory points about the state of Iraq. On one hand, they say the government is much stronger, having largely crushed the Sunni insurgents last year and severely weakened the Mahdi Army Shia militia in the past six months. They claim journalists like myself do not give them enough credit for these successes. But when I suggest to them that if the government is really so strong, maybe it can do without American support, they immediately look worried. "We cannot really stand on our own," one official told me. "What would happen if there was a Mahdi Army uprising in Basra, or an army brigade mutinied in Anbar, or the Kurds unilaterally moved to annex Kirkuk?" <br> In theory, the Iraqi state is becoming strong again. It has security forces numbering a half-million men. Its oil revenues might touch $150 billion next year. It has apparently extended its authority to Basra, Sadr City and Amara province. Sunni Arab states like Jordan and Saudi Arabia, which had previously hoped that the Shia-Kurdish government in Baghdad was only a passing phase, accept that it is here to stay and are talking of sending ambassadors and reopening their embassies. <br> But nobody here knows whether this rebirth of the Iraqi state machine is a mirage. The supposed military victories against the Mahdi Army in the first half of the year would not have happened without the support of American firepower. The Iraqi army itself, though more confident than before, wonders what would happen if Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of the Mahdi Army, were to end his ceasefire or the Iranians were to reverse their support for the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Two powerful tribal sheiks from Sadr City told me firmly that the Mahdi Army was on the run. But when I asked if they would oppose it in public, they replied: "Certainly not. We would be shot down next time when we went to the mosque." <br> On his visit to Baghdad Barack Obama received the usual encouraging accounts from American generals and Iraqi government officials about how far security has improved and how normality is returning to Iraq. But in the great majority of cases, he will be speaking to people who do not personally set foot in the streets of the Iraqi capital without an armed escort. In one sense Iraq is "better," but the improvement is only in contrast to the previous bloodbath. In June, 554 Iraqi civilians and security were killed, compared with 1,642 a year earlier. The sectarian civil war between Sunni and Shia, which was at its height between the end of 2005 and the first half of 2007, has ebbed. This is not so much because of the Surge, but because there is nobody left to kill. Baghdad has become a largely Shia city. There are few mixed areas remaining. <br> It is safer driving around Baghdad, but the city is divided up into fortified sectarian ghettoes. Shia and Sunni do not visit each other's districts if they can help it. Above all, the 4 million Iraqis who have fled to Jordan or Syria or moved inside the country are not going back to their homes. When a Shia family went to look at their old house in the al-Mekanik neighborhood in Dora in south Baghdad, which had been taken over by Sunnis, the husband and wife were immediately killed and their driver's headless body was found lying in the street next morning. Visitors to Baghdad like Obama may not quite understand what Iraqis mean by "improved security," because the outside world never fully took on board the extent of the previous slaughter. <br> For instance, in east Baghdad there is a large wholesale market for spare car parts called al-Siniq, which used to supply the whole city. But in 2006 the wholly Shia police commandos raided the market and arrested seventy-seven people, released the Shia and killed some forty Sunnis. Until very recently no Sunni would go back, but they are now nervously venturing to al-Siniq once again. For Baghdad this is progress, but it still leaves the city as the most dangerous place in the world. <br> Outside the Green Zone, Iraqis did not pay great attention to the Obama visit, any more than they did to the six visits of John McCain over the past few years. These highly restricted tours have little to do with their daily lives. The main topic of conversation in Baghdad this summer is not about the American presidential election, but the lack of electricity. The Mesopotamian plain is one of the hottest places on earth, and this year there is less electricity than ever to power air conditioning or air coolers. It is also more difficult to get visas to visit Syria and spend the sweltering summer months in the cooler climate of Damascus. Food is expensive, and almost none of it is grown in Iraq. Watermelons are imported from Iran and apples and tomatoes from the Jordan Valley. There are signs that fundamentalist Islamic gunmen no longer control the streets: shops selling alcohol are reopening, as are hair salons, both of which closed in early 2007. But most Iraqis do not drink alcohol, and they have their hair cut at home. <br> The Iraqi government knows that its claims of success that it is making to Obama are overstated. It has become used to being defended by American troops and fears what would happen to it without them. But in fact Obama could give the Iraqi government no better gift than a timetable for withdrawal, because so long as the US occupation continues, the Iraqi government will be deemed illegitimate by its own people.By Patrick Cockburn Reprinted with permission from The Nation
This column was written by the editors of The Nation.One day in January 2005, an elderly couple was driving down a road in Mosul, Iraq, when without realizing it they passed through a makeshift US military checkpoint. The checkpoint, recalled a sergeant who came upon the scene, was "very poorly marked." Yet, he said, the soldiers "got spooked" and opened fire. The bodies of the couple sat in the car for three days, the sergeant said, "while we drove by them day after day." <br> That incident was no Haditha or Abu Ghraib. It was a fairly typical day for Iraqis under U.S. occupation. As Chris Hedges and Laila Al-Arian make clear in their exhaustive investigation in this issue, the degradation and killing of civilians by U.S. troops have become commonplace in Iraq. At tense checkpoints, in futile house-to-house searches, as convoys and patrols hurtle down the roads, the official rules of engagement and unofficial day-to-day practices of the occupation often add up to shoot first and ask questions never. The results make for tough reading: a family's dog gunned down for barking, a 2-year-old shot in a spray of gunfire, the terrified scream of a father awakened in a midnight raid. Few such incidents were reported, according to most of those interviewed; even fewer resulted in discipline. <br> This Nation investigation, based on interviews with 50 soldiers, sailors and marines, marks the first time so many veterans have spoken on the record about civilian casualties at the hands of U.S. troops in Iraq. They have shown notable courage in speaking out about the horrors they witnessed. Most insisted that only a minority in their ranks have killed civilians indiscriminately. Yet such abuses are common enough that many veterans have returned home with deep emotional scars. <br> It is time to reckon with the weight of evidence that American forces regularly kill Iraqi noncombatants. Occupying armies with little knowledge of the local culture, fighting guerrillas who mingle among the population, have usually meant disaster for civilians. In Iraq, the impossible mission, poor training and inconsistent and irresponsible rules of engagement have compounded the problem, leading many American soldiers to conclude that endangering civilians is simply the cost of staying safe; to consider all Iraqis the enemy; or, under extreme stress, to lash out in revenge after insurgent attacks. <br> As described by these veterans, the occupation of Iraq has become a classic example of what psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton calls an "atrocity-producing situation." Their testimony of eroding moral constraint, a direct consequence of the untenable position in which they've found themselves, was confirmed recently by the Pentagon. A May survey by the U.S. Army Medical Command that should disturb every American found that just 47 percent of soldiers and 38 percent of marines agreed that civilians should be treated with dignity and respect. <br> Veterans of conscience deserve encouragement for speaking up. Instead they face a Congress that has been willfully blind to civilian casualties and has tolerated virtually no reporting on this matter from the Pentagon. It is time for a Congressional inquiry into these daily attacks on Iraqi civilians, one that traces responsibility up the chain of command. Most important, we need to wake up to the true costs of this war. If the President and his aides lie about the war with no consequence, if troops are deployed again and again to prop up a deteriorating occupation, if the rules of engagement guarantee frequent brutalization of noncombatants, then it is no wonder some soldiers conclude that their conduct has few limits. And it should come as no surprise that an occupation of this sort continues to inflame anti-American sentiment throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds. The problem is not a few "bad apples" (Bush's phrase after Abu Ghraib) but the occupation itself. It needs to end. By the editors of The NationReprinted with permission from the The Nation
Sometimes I forget where I put my glasses. Sometimes I forget to phone someone I said I'd call. But if I had leaked the identity of a CIA agent or if I had decided to fire some United States attorneys because their politics were different from mine, I wouldn't forget about those things. And I don't think most people would, either. So when public figures keep claiming selective amnesia, we tend not to believe them. This is a serious situation. I'm not just talking about truth becoming more and more rare. I also feel these "forgetful" people are messing things up for the rest of us. If we're going to give less and less credibility to politicians who say "I forgot," pretty soon people will stop believing those of us who sometimes really forget things. It's not fair that a few rotten apples are giving forgetfulness a bad name. <br> In the Scooter Libby case, Libby's defense team wanted to have a "memory expert" testify in front of the jury. They asserted that she would demonstrate that Libby's flip-flopping on the facts was not a result of his lying, but was because of a faulty memory. However, when the expert, Elizabeth F. Loftus, testified in a pre-trial hearing, she admitted that her studies were not scientific. And at one point, referring to her own writings, she said, "I don't know how I let that line slip by." I guess the memory expert forgot to proofread her work. <br> The judge ruled that the jurors were capable of distinguishing between lying and forgetfulness without hearing from a memory expert. Obviously, because of their eventual verdict, the jury thought the claims of faulty memory were bunk. <br> In the recent firing of the eight United States attorneys, the "I don't remember" monster raised its ugly head again. According to White House Press Secretary Tony Snow, "At this juncture, people have hazy memories." This is from the guy who's supposed to spin things to make his bosses look as good as possible, and the best he could come up with was "hazy memories?" <br> Snow went on to say, "We know that Karl [Rove] recollects Harriet [Miers] having raised it [firing U.S. attorneys], and his recollection is that he dismissed it as not a good idea." Snow added that as far as ordering the firings himself, President Bush "certainly has no recollection" of doing so. <br> Notice he didn't say that anybody denies anything. They just don't remember. I'm not saying I know that these people did something wrong. But I know that with all these claims of cloudy memories, they are definitely losing credibility about what they did and why. <br> And there is another "red flag" about their claims. It's the word, "recollect." When I hear that word, I get suspicious. Who uses "recollect" today besides people who have just talked to their lawyers? We don't hear things like, "You'll have to drive today. I didn't recollect to bring my car keys." <br> As I said before, politicians overusing the "I can't remember" excuse are blowing it for the rest of us. Pretty soon, if we say things like, "I completely forgot that we were having an 8 o'clock meeting this morning," what boss is going to believe that? Now if we say, "Sorry, I forgot to pick up the milk on my way home," we may get a rolling of the eyes from our spouse. But soon, we'll be called a liar for making a claim like that. And I wouldn't advise anyone to say something like, "I forgot that tonight was supposed to be a special night just for the two of us." <br> Let me make it clear that I don't think claiming bad memory is strictly a Republican maneuver. If the Democrats had been in power for the last several years and been involved in some shady things, they probably would be using the "I can't remember" excuse today. At least I think they would. It's been so long since they were running the country that I really can't recollect what they were like. <br> By Lloyd Garver
Sometimes I forget where I put my glasses. Sometimes I forget to phone someone I said I'd call. But if I had leaked the identity of a CIA agent or if I had decided to fire some United States attorneys because their politics were different from mine, I wouldn't forget about those things. And I don't think most people would, either. So when public figures keep claiming selective amnesia, we tend not to believe them. This is a serious situation. I'm not just talking about truth becoming more and more rare. I also feel these "forgetful" people are messing things up for the rest of us. If we're going to give less and less credibility to politicians who say "I forgot," pretty soon people will stop believing those of us who sometimes really forget things. It's not fair that a few rotten apples are giving forgetfulness a bad name. <br> In the Scooter Libby case, Libby's defense team wanted to have a "memory expert" testify in front of the jury. They asserted that she would demonstrate that Libby's flip-flopping on the facts was not a result of his lying, but was because of a faulty memory. However, when the expert, Elizabeth F. Loftus, testified in a pre-trial hearing, she admitted that her studies were not scientific. And at one point, referring to her own writings, she said, "I don't know how I let that line slip by." I guess the memory expert forgot to proofread her work. <br> The judge ruled that the jurors were capable of distinguishing between lying and forgetfulness without hearing from a memory expert. Obviously, because of their eventual verdict, the jury thought the claims of faulty memory were bunk. <br> In the recent firing of the eight United States attorneys, the "I don't remember" monster raised its ugly head again. According to White House Press Secretary Tony Snow, "At this juncture, people have hazy memories." This is from the guy who's supposed to spin things to make his bosses look as good as possible, and the best he could come up with was "hazy memories?" <br> Snow went on to say, "We know that Karl [Rove] recollects Harriet [Miers] having raised it [firing U.S. attorneys], and his recollection is that he dismissed it as not a good idea." Snow added that as far as ordering the firings himself, President Bush "certainly has no recollection" of doing so. <br> Notice he didn't say that anybody denies anything. They just don't remember. I'm not saying I know that these people did something wrong. But I know that with all these claims of cloudy memories, they are definitely losing credibility about what they did and why. <br> And there is another "red flag" about their claims. It's the word, "recollect." When I hear that word, I get suspicious. Who uses "recollect" today besides people who have just talked to their lawyers? We don't hear things like, "You'll have to drive today. I didn't recollect to bring my car keys." <br> As I said before, politicians overusing the "I can't remember" excuse are blowing it for the rest of us. Pretty soon, if we say things like, "I completely forgot that we were having an 8 o'clock meeting this morning," what boss is going to believe that? Now if we say, "Sorry, I forgot to pick up the milk on my way home," we may get a rolling of the eyes from our spouse. But soon, we'll be called a liar for making a claim like that. And I wouldn't advise anyone to say something like, "I forgot that tonight was supposed to be a special night just for the two of us." <br> Let me make it clear that I don't think claiming bad memory is strictly a Republican maneuver. If the Democrats had been in power for the last several years and been involved in some shady things, they probably would be using the "I can't remember" excuse today. At least I think they would.

This column was written by Kevin Tillman.Editor's Note: This article was originally published on TruthDig.comIt is Pat Tillman's birthday November 6, and elections are the day after. It gets me thinking about a conversation I had with Pat before we joined the military. He spoke about the risks with signing the papers. How once we committed, we were at the mercy of the American leadership and the American people. How we could be thrown in a direction not of our volition. How fighting as a soldier would leave us without a voice.... until we get out. <br> Much has happened since we handed over our voice: <br> Somehow we were sent to invade a nation because it was a direct threat to the American people, or to the world, or harbored terrorists, or was involved in the September 11 attacks, or received weapons-grade uranium from Niger, or had mobile weapons labs, or WMD, or had a need to be liberated, or we needed to establish a democracy, or stop an insurgency, or stop a civil war we created that can't be called a civil war even though it is. Something like that. <br> Somehow our elected leaders were subverting international law and humanity by setting up secret prisons around the world, secretly kidnapping people, secretly holding them indefinitely, secretly not charging them with anything, secretly torturing them. Somehow that overt policy of torture became the fault of a few "bad apples" in the military. <br> Somehow back at home, support for the soldiers meant having a five-year-old kindergartener scribble a picture with crayons and send it overseas, or slapping stickers on cars, or lobbying Congress for an extra pad in a helmet. It's interesting that a soldier on his third or fourth tour should care about a drawing from a five-year-old; or a faded sticker on a car as his friends die around him; or an extra pad in a helmet, as if it will protect him when an IED throws his vehicle 50 feet into the air as his body comes apart and his skin melts to the seat. <br> Somehow the more soldiers who die, the more legitimate the illegal invasion becomes. <br> Somehow American leadership, whose only credit is lying to its people and illegally invading a nation, has been allowed to steal the courage, virtue and honor of its soldiers on the ground. <br> Somehow those afraid to fight an illegal invasion decades ago are allowed to send soldiers to die for an illegal invasion they started. <br> Somehow faking character, virtue and strength is tolerated. <br> Somehow profiting from tragedy and horror is tolerated. <br> Somehow the death of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people is tolerated. <br> Somehow subversion of the Bill of Rights and The Constitution is tolerated. <br> Somehow suspension of Habeas Corpus is supposed to keep this country safe. <br> Somehow torture is tolerated. <br> Somehow lying is tolerated. <br> Somehow reason is being discarded for faith, dogma, and nonsense. <br> Somehow American leadership managed to create a more dangerous world. <br> Somehow a narrative is more important than reality. <br> Somehow America has become a country that projects everything that it is not and condemns everything that it is. <br> Somehow the most reasonable, trusted and respected country in the world has become one of the most irrational, belligerent, feared, and distrusted countries in the world. <br> Somehow being politically informed, diligent, and skeptical has been replaced by apathy through active ignorance. <br> Somehow the same incompetent, narcissistic, virtueless, vacuous, malicious criminals are still in charge of this country. <br> Somehow this is tolerated. <br> Somehow nobody is accountable for this. <br> In a democracy, the policy of the leaders is the policy of the people. So don't be shocked when our grandkids bury much of this generation as traitors to the nation, to the world and to humanity. Most likely, they will come to know that "somehow" was nurtured by fear, insecurity and indifference, leaving the country vulnerable to unchecked, unchallenged parasites. <br> Luckily this country is still a democracy. People still have a voice. People still can take action. It can start after Pat's birthday. <br> Former Major League Baseball player Kevin Tillman joined the Army with his brother Pat, a former National Football League star in 2002, and they served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.

This column was written by Jonathan Last. <br> The discovery and interception of the London air plots was a reminder that, while our intelligence capabilities have improved since September 11, 2001, our airport-security apparatus remains antiquated. Had the terrorists executed their plan, they would have had a high probability of success. Airport security cannot possibly hope to stop similar terrorist operations in the future unless it changes dramatically. <br> Two options lie before us. The first and more disruptive course is to take commercial carriers out of the baggage business. Passenger tickets would include travelers and the clothes on their backs--no luggage, no carry-ons. In theory, this would lower ticket prices. Passengers could then use that savings to ship their bags ahead of them. (It's not as crazy as it sounds; some people already use FedEx for their luggage.) Today, it would cost you about $120 to send a 40-pound suitcase from a home in Philadelphia to a hotel in Los Angeles by second-day air. This price would almost certainly fall if luggage shipping became big business. <br> The second option is more practical, although just as radical: adopting the Israeli model of airport security. The Israelis are generally regarded as having the safest air travel in the world because, instead of searching for weapons, they use profiling to search for terrorists. <br> It isn't as controversial as it sounds. We're talking behavioral profiling here, not racial profiling. Israeli-style profiling first came to the United States after September 11, when Boston's Logan International Airport hired Rafi Ron as a security consultant. Before joining New Age Security Solutions, Ron had been director of security at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, which has now gone more than 30 years without a serious terrorist incident. <br> There are differences between Israel and America. Ben Gurion, for instance, handles 6 million to 10 million passengers per year. Logan handles 25 million to 30 million. And the United States has more than 400 commercial airports. But despite the difference in scale, the principles of the Israeli program translate surprisingly well.
This column was written by Adele M. Stan.Before I get started here, let me make one thing perfectly clear: I am not, nor have I ever been, a member of the Jewish faith. No members of my family are known to be Jews. Okay, so some of my best friends are Jews, but whattaya want? I'm in the liberal media biz, and you know who's in charge here. Call it a matter of professional development. But me, I'm a holy card-carrying, Blessed Mother-lovin' member of the Church of Rome. <br> My opening declaration is necessitated by the subject of this treatise: the fallout from the meltdown of Mel Gibson, Traditionalist Catholic, and his drunken tirade against the "f#@*ing Jews." I feel for Mr. Gibson, I really do; as a recovering alcoholic myself, I know too well the shame the drunk so easily brings upon herself when the tongue is loosened and the fists unleashed by the fruit of the vine, brewery, and/or distillery. And I know firsthand the pain inflicted on earnest Catholics at the hands of dismissive Jews: When I was in the 10th grade, I was dating a really cool guy named Mark Weiss until his mother got in the middle of it on account of my religion. How do ya like them apples? <br> But to those who contend that Mel really didn't mean what he said while under the influence, my personal experience suggests otherwise. For instance, when I was drunk, if you said something against my family, I would have just decked you. (There's at least one sucker-punched guy in Jersey who can attest to this fact.) Now that I'm sober, if you say something against my family, I will want to deck you but, instead, I'll just verbally threaten you. Or, I'll count to 10, go home and come back with my four brothers. The sentiment is consistent even if the actions differ. <br> In the case of Gibson, let's examine the words of drunk Mel alongside those of (presumably) non-drunk Mel: <br> I say, Mel, just own your rage, brother. The sentiments here are hardly very distinct. Why not stand up for your beliefs? And that goes for the rest of those right-wing Catholics and Protestants who have resorted to some tortured code to assert their true feelings about the Jewish people. I call it the Shylock code. <br> Take, for example, these words from a statement by Bill Donohue of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights: <br> Or take this one, from the Rev. Jesse Lee Paterson, author of "Scam: How the Black Leadership Exploits Black America," who has earned the Heritage Foundation seal of approval: <br> (NOTE: Other commerce-related code "retailers," "department stores;" see "War on Christmas") <br> Which brings me back to my opening disclaimer. For reasons that remain a mystery to me, I once had the experience of having the code deployed against me, leaving the impression that I am a "leftist writer," possibly of Jewish origin. (Perish the thought!) Those in the know are aware that "leftist" equals socialist or communist, and you know who those folks are. Me, I'm a simple, mild-mannered liberal Catholic with an Ellis Island-style last name. (In the old country, it was Stackiewicz.) Just want to set the record straight. <br> So, to Mel, Bill and Jesse, I say, why all the dancing around? Why go crypto in a free country? As they often say in Alcoholics Anonymous, "To thine own self be true." <br> Adele M. Stan is the author of the weblog, AddieStan.com, and the book, "Debating Sexual Correctness." By Adele M.

With millions of sites floating through the blogosphere, who really has time to peek at even a fraction of them? Blogophile reads them for you and presents a weekly roundup of the buzz on must-read blogs. Blogophile appears new each Wednesday, and is written by CBSNews.com's Melissa P. McNamara. <br> Are bloggers good fact-checkers? This week, a prominent scientist made a speech about population that bloggers loudly booed. But were they right? Plus, the war between Apple and Microsoft has come to an end and bloggers couldn't be happier. And what's a Blooker, you ask? Find out below. <br> And That's How Rumors Get Started <br> Forrest Mims wrote on his blog that "a few hundred members of the Texas Academy of Science rose to their feet and gave a standing ovation to a speech that enthusiastically advocated the elimination of 90 percent of Earth's population by airborne Ebola." Dr. Eric R. Pianka, a University of Texas professor who the Academy named the 2006 Distinguished Texas Scientist, gave the speech. <br> Within days, the story catapulted through the blogosphere, making Pianka one of the week's most blogged about people. <br> But, the story isn't quite true, according to bloggers who have read Pianka's work. <br> As Jason on Evolutionblog notes, "what he actually believes is that it is inevitable that overpopulation and overexploitation of the Earth's resources will lead to a catastrophic event for humanity, probably via a major outbreak of some disease." Not exactly uplifting news, but the scientist isn't advocating mass destruction, either. He explains his views in an essay, "What noboday wants to hear." <br> Some bloggers say politics is at play in the misinterpretation of Pianka's comments, pointing out that Mims, chairman of the Environmental Sciences section of the Texas Academy of Science, is a creationist who took issue with Pianka's evolution work. <br> "Mims then spread this misleading summary to other creationists, from which point it spread into the right-wing community in general," Daylight Atheism writes. Although the slightest modicum of fact-checking would have made it obvious that Mims' accusations were completely false, this modicum was, as usual, not performed, and the predictable torrent of rage and invective followed in utter ignorance of Pianka's actual beliefs. <br> But the blogosphere is a powerful force, and many bloggers say they have no doubt about "Dr. Doom's" beliefs. <br> "The lizard man PREACHS that 90% of humanity should be falling down in agony with blood pouring from every orifice of their body," Mickey at New York Blog Of Mine writes. "What I am bit confused about is how the nut bag came to be a respected member of the scientific community, then again all I really have is the word of a few Texans. But his students seem to love him..." <br> Over at Watchblog, Eric Simonson writes, "Be-a-u-ti-ful. Pianka is sort of the David Koresh of biologists wouldn't you say? It warms my heart to find another dedicated and committed academic hard at work teaching our best and brightest the skills they need to compete in the 21st century, it really does." <br> A blogger at This Was America is also worried about Dr. Pianka's students. "Must now we worry that a Pianka-worshipping former student might someday become a professional biologist or physician with access to the most deadly strains of viruses and bacteria?," the blogger asks. <br> Protecting Children From Homeland Employees <br> While lawmakers last week questioned the commitment of the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to halting the online exploitation of children, bloggers were questioning how the Department of Homeland Security handles this issue among its own employees. <br> The media was covering the resignation of Brian Doyle, the deputy press secretary of Homeland Security caught chatting online with someone he believed was a 14-year-old girl, but bloggers were talking about another Homeland Security official. <br> Think Progress alerts readers that Frank Figueroa, the former head of the Department of Homeland Security's program to stop child predators (Operation Predator), pleaded no contest last week to charges he exposed himself to a 16-year-old girl in a mall food court in Orlando and ran away from security officers. <br> "I'm not sure what's going on at the Department of Homeland Security, but significant background checks certainly are not," Ed at Captain's Quarters writes. "Voters may not remember who Jack Abramoff is come November, but they will certainly remember who hired the Dirty Old Man of the DHS." <br> Tim at Balloon Juice writes, "Put two and two and two together. Increasing government power, decreasing oversight, lax hiring policies. What kind of person do you think that is going to attract?" <br> Many bloggers question who Homeland Security is actually protecting. Pete at Disturbing the Comfortable asks if Homeland Security has "predators protecting children from predators?" He says, "Now it appears that the agency in charge of our domestic security is the place to be, if you're a predator. Homeland Security needs to either be totally reorganized or disbanded: the unthinkable has become commonplace." <br> And Jonathan at Past Peak writes, "Who is going to start protecting us from the Department of Homeland Security? It kind of makes you long for the good old wholesome days of the Clinton administration."
This column was written by Jeremy Brecher and Brendan Smith.Anyone who sees the photographs of the victims of the Nazi concentration camps must wonder how human beings could ever have allowed such things to happen. They must wonder how people of good will could have stood by while their government committed atrocities in their name. In the wake of that nightmarish era, people often asked, "Where were the good Germans?" <br> After the publication of the long-suppressed pictures of Abu Ghraib victims and the United Nations finding that torture and abuse are still taking place at the US prison in Guantnamo Bay, America has fashioned its own nightmare. We now must ask ourselves, "Where are the good Americans?" <br> After an eighteen-month study, five independent experts appointed by the UN Commission on Human Rights have just concluded that practices currently conducted at the US prison in Guantnamo amount to torture: excessive violence, force-feeding of hunger-striking detainees and arbitrary detention of prisoners that violates their right under international law to challenge the legality of their captivity before an independent judicial body. <br> The Bush Administration has condemned the publication of the Abu Ghraib photos and has rejected the UN report as "fundamentally flawed." But Americans should be grateful that people in the rest of the world are helping us discover what the Administration is trying to conceal from its own citizens: It is conducting war crimes in our name. <br> The UN report makes recommendations that are simple and obvious: <br> The demand to close Guantnamo was quickly seconded by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. And the European Union Parliament voted 80 to 1 to ask the United States to close Guantnamo and give every prisoner "a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent, impartial tribunal" without delay. <br> The Bush Administration has placed the responsibility for prisoner abuse in Abu Ghraib and elsewhere on a few "bad apples" in the lowest ranks. But since the Nuremberg Tribunal of Nazi war criminals, international law has maintained the principle of "command responsibility," which makes top officials who ordered the crimes or failed to prevent them accountable. <br> It's not just a question of international law. Administration officials are well aware that the US War Crimes Act makes it a serious crime for any American including top government officials to commit any "grave breach" of the Geneva Conventions, including "willful killing, torture, or inhuman treatment" of detainees. Perhaps that has something to do with the Administration's eagerness to discredit the UN report. <br> If President Bush won't halt the abuse of US captives, Congress stands next in line for responsibility. Last December, it passed the so-called McCain amendment, which supposedly abolished all torture by US forces anywhere in the world. But the UN report makes clear that torture is continuing at Guantnamo. <br> The law's sponsor, Senator John McCain, promised that Congress would establish oversight over Guantnamo and other US prisons abroad to assure enforcement. But where's Senator McCain now? If he really wants to stop torture, why doesn't he fly to Guantnamo immediately and make sure no one is being abused? Isn't that what McCain would have wanted US senators to do when he was being tortured in a prison cell in Vietnam? <br> If Congress won't act, then it is up to the people. We must make every family dining table, every house of worship and every town meeting a place to stand up and speak out. <br> Only then will those who come after us know where the "good Americans" were. <br> By Jeremy Brecher and Brendan Smith.

Like to read other people's mail? Well, have at it. The Against the Grain inbox is open for your perusal. And by the way, this is not a blog.Bringing Guns To Work <br> A great many readers took me to task for my column on guns in the workplace, saying I was treading on the 2nd Amendment. And it appears a lot of people go hunting after work. However, I stand by what I said. <br> Our laws should be to protect our citizens, not punish them. What Ted Kennedy and your correct "spineless democrats" should stop their agenda of back door entry to have gun control by any method. The 2nd Amendment has guaranteed my right since its writing and once you change or re-write out constitution we will not be free men anymore. What would the liberal press do if we didn't have the 1st Amendment? <br> Paul Bartos <br> Joseph K. Smith (no relation) <br> Russel Rodeback <br> Gun control? It's the best thing you can do for crooks and gangsters. I want you to have nothing. If I'm a bad guy, I'm always gonna have a gun. Safety locks? You will pull the trigger with a lock on, and I'll pull the trigger. We'll see who wins. <br> Sammy "The Bull" Gravano, whose testimony convicted John Gotti. <br> Other than the snide cynicism, this is a good discussion to get into about individual rights (both first and second amendment) on private property. Indeed a gray area. <br> An inaccuracy, however. <br> There is more than pollsters telling the Democrats 'the smart thing to do is not address gun control'. The voting populace in the southern states traditionally supported conservative Southern Democrats in the house and senate until 1994, when in a backlash to Brady, they converted to conservative Republicans. Just this last election, 4 out of 5 open slots went to the Republicans. The one remaining Democrat said the reason Democrats are losing is they were 'not representing their constituency', so she decided to and won. <br> Dean's (new DNC head) take on this was that the Democratic Party must do better to 'educate their constituency'. <br> That's a big disconnect. <br> Robert A. Sutherland <br> Luckily we have a "no guns at work" policy so we're safe, right? <br> Frank Clarke <br> Since governments rule by fear, I'm sure that the thought of all those nasty guns in the hands of the citizens scare all of the liberals who, after all, know what is good for the entire population. Why don't some of these hanky-stomping, take-a-punk-to-lunch liberals leave everybody alone? <br> Lee Salmon
This column was written by Paul Mirengoff.What a pleasure it has been to read the excerpts from the Reagan-era memos of John Roberts served up by the mainstream media. <br> First, they confirm Roberts' status as a solid conservative. Insisting, for example, that civil rights laws are about promoting a colorblind society, Roberts opposed racial quotas in hiring and promotion, court ordered busing of students, and congressional redistricting intended to create a pre-ordained number of "safe" seats for minority politicians. <br> He denounced a legal theory propounded by radical feminists that would have allowed judges or bureaucrats to raise the pay rates for jobs held mostly by women on the pretext that these jobs were "worth" as much as totally different jobs held mostly by men. <br> He agreed that Roe v. Wade constitutes a "tragedy," and that the free-floating right to privacy upon which the decision relies lacks constitutional grounding. <br> He was upset by the extent to which unelected judges were attempting to remake society in accordance with their personal preferences, and willing to entertain the use of the Constitution's remedies for such judicial usurpation. <br> Substance aside, his memo excerpts read like an unusually perceptive and pithy blog. At times, they contain snark worthy of Roberts' most persistent conservative critic, Ann Coulter. A pompous congressman wants to convene a conference on power sharing between the executive and legislative branches? Roberts notes that such a conference occurred in Philadelphia in 1787, and suggests that someone show the congressman the "memo" this meeting produced. <br> Feminists want to empower judges or bureaucrats to set wage rates for jobs throughout the economy? Roberts offers them a slogan: "From each according to his ability, to each according to her gender." And, like most good bloggers, Roberts provides more than just trenchant political commentary. <br> He treats readers to his views on Michael Jackson (could be supplanted by Prince; Reagan shouldn't pander to him in any case) and Pete Rose (his .410 slugging percentage leaves him well short of true slugger status). Roberts even cracks a good lawyer joke. <br> Best of all, Roberts's memo excerpts remind conservatives of how much the landscape has changed since the early 1980s. In attempting to put Roberts' memos into context, the Washington Post labeled him "part of the vanguard of a conservative political revolution." In a sense this is true. Just as Reagan's foreign policy team sought to roll back, and ultimately topple, the Communist empire, his legal team hoped to overturn many of the doctrines established by the liberal Warren-era Court, and to appoint conservative judges who would pay more attention to the words of the Constitution and less to considerations of public policy. <br> It is quite misleading, however, to suggest that there was anything truly radical about what Roberts and his fellow insurgents attempted to accomplish. When Roberts wrote his memos, Republicans had won landslide victories in two of the previous three presidential elections based, in part, on denunciations of the liberal activism of the Supreme Court. And they were on their way to a third such triumph. <br> Roberts' insistence on a colorblind society, his unhappiness with judicial short-circuiting of the political processes, his disagreement with Roe v. Wade, to cite just three examples, all placed him well within the political mainstream. If they made him an insurgent within the legal community, that's only because the legal culture (as defined by liberal law professors and judges appointed years earlier) was grossly out of step with the political culture. <br> Part of the mission of the brilliant young lawyers in the Reagan administration, along with the nascent Federalist Society on college campuses, consisted of showing that this gap stemmed not from a superior understanding of the law by the legal elite, but from a power grab ungrounded in the words of the Constitution and the intentions of its framers.
This column was written by CBS News Early Show Co-Anchor Harry Smith.There is a front page piece in today's Washington Post about the demise of the red delicious apple. You know, the big red bulletproof apples that come complete with little nubs on the bottom to help them stand up and look pretty. <br> The article chronicles the apple's journey from an Iowa farmyard to the "king" of Washington State. The design changes that once made it popular and now, the backlash. <br> I will confess that I haven't eaten a red delicious in years. I remember a skin that was tough and waxy. The meat was too sweet. It wasn't a fruit, more of a model of an apple masquerading as a piece of fruit. <br> The apple morphed into its current state to meet the demands of stores which wanted the apple to have a better shelf life and eye appeal. Lo and behold, after all of these years, this demand is finally starting to fall off. <br> While the state of the American apple concerns me, of even greater concern is tomatoes. <br> I cannot tell you the last time that I bought a tomato in a store that tasted anything like the tomatoes that I used to pick at my uncle's farm. They don't smell the same, and the flavor isn't even close. <br> I was in an Italian restaurant this week and before I ordered the Caprese Salad, I asked the waiter about the tomatoes. <br> "Are they good?" <br> "They are fresh." <br> "No, are they good? Do they taste like homegrown?" <br> He just shook his head. <br> Beauty is only skin deep, especially with apples and tomatoes.
This commentary was written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer.Approximately seven inches of 16 millimeter film were missing. A crude Scotch tape splice barely disguised the gap. The missing film had been ditched in a ravine. There was a cover-up. I knew about it. <br> The place was 243 Walden Drive, Glencoe, Illinois. The ravine was actually on Crescent Lane, maybe 500 yards away. The year was 1966. Or maybe 1965, I can't quite remember. I was seven or eight and in a jam. <br> It was my birthday. In that pre-video, perhaps pre-color TV, era, my mother had rented real cartoons to play on a real film projector for my birthday party. The man in charge of the projector was my older brother, Jimmy, a crack member of the A-V Club at his junior high. It all went fine until after the party. During the crucial rewind process, the film -- the precious rented, high tech strip -- tore. <br> This was a potential disaster. Broken stuff meant trouble; broken stuff that wasn't yours could easily mean punishment. Dad might even get involved. It seemed like a scandal. <br> Jimmy made the splice and I followed him to the ravine -- our secret, kids only domain-- and he dumped the evidence. He swore me to secrecy. He was five years older than I, very strong and he hit. I took the oath. <br> By dinnertime, I had ratted him out to our parents. I was Deep Throat and I sang like a bird. Knowing me, I probably asked them not to tell Jimmy who narced on him. I wasn't a bright boy. <br> Today, Jimmy is a model citizen, a pillar of his community and a fine American. I am a journalist. Anything else you care to know? <br> Not all whistleblowers and leakers are altruistic, well-intentioned or remotely useful to society. Many, perhaps most, are like I was -- a weasel snitching on someone in a cowardly way for revenge. Anonymity and secrets are tricky business. <br> Many capital J-Journalists have portrayed the unveiling of Deep Throat this week as divine intervention intended to remind American society that it needs anonymous sources and whistle-blowers. It's miraculous timing as some reporters (Mathew Cooper and Judith Miller in the Valerie Plame/Joseph Wilson leak case) face jail time because they won't give up their sources and when some organizations such as CBS News and Newsweek have made high-profile errors using anonymous sources. <br> We'll largely leave that argument to others, except for this point: it is a great confusion to lump the Deep Throats of the world, the true whistle-blowers who truly risk their livelihoods and reputations over important issues, with petty leakers and hacks that are cast as anonymous sources in news stories day in and day out. That's comparing rotten apples to curative oranges. 
This column was written by Sabrina Leigh Schaeffer.There is no such thing as a free lunch. Then why are so many parents upset that school cafeterias are serving junk food instead of healthy meals? <br> Kids are overweight and parents are pointing fingers at school cafeterias that allow students to (over)indulge daily in Pizza Hut, Chick-fil-A, and Taco Bell. A recent report on NPR's Morning Edition included testimonials from Virginia middle-school students who celebrated their lunch likes of pizza, ketchup packets, and strawberry milk and their dislikes of fresh fruits and vegetables. <br> NPR related federal and state government efforts to curb bad eating habits by eliminating soda machines and reducing the amount of pizza served. They profiled a radio-station campaign aimed at teaching kids that fruits and vegetables are "cool," and they highlighted a local business eager to educate students in healthy eating. <br> Missing from the report? Parents. <br> Since when has it been the full responsibility of schools not only to provide students with lunch, but also to teach them "one-size-fits-all" nutritional education? While popular belief suggests children adopt their parent's values -- religion, respect for others, support for education -- the role of parents in what children eat is absent from public discourse. <br> School lunches are notorious for serving slop -- by this I mean anything from Sloppy Joes to French-toast sticks with sausage patties. Parents have always had the opportunity to circumvent this nutritional void by packing lunches -- tuna sandwich, apples, maybe a cookie for dessert? Doesn't anyone miss Capri Sun? <br> Let's not delude ourselves that there was a time when school cafeterias actually served healthy lunches. 1950s-style meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy does not leave ten-year-olds feeling agile and energetic for after-school baseball practice. Certainly, there is something to be said for the rigidity of our parent's generation's school lunches. The school was less concerned with what the children ate than that they received a hot meal. <br> That "take-it-or-leave it" mentality, however, no longer exists. Today, choosing what to eat for lunch is a form of self-expression that only the most repressed traditionalist would consider revoking from children. Today, schools and administrators are more concerned that students will be hungry than that they eat anything approximating a healthy lunch. <br> Americans frequently clash on educational standards -- evolution vs. creationism, the arts vs. sports, and support for sex education. Central to all these debates are the values parents believe are appropriate for their children. The same should be the case with what students eat. Why should we leave something as important (and personal) as a child's nutrition up to government bureaucrats, school administrators, radio hosts, or local businesses? <br> My response to this hubbub about school cafeterias: Bring back brown-bag lunches! <br> You know, the brown-paper bags boys would forget to take out of their backpacks before putting in their science textbook. And the pretty bags the girls used to bring that had cartoons or flowers on them. What happened to brown-bag lunches where mom would slip a little note in saying "I love you" or "Remember your orthodontist appointment at 4:00 o'clock." 
This column was written by Chris Mooney.Last year, when a profound schism erupted between the American scientific community and the Bush administration, a key point of contention concerned the alteration of sexual health information on several government Web sites. A National Cancer Institute fact sheet temporarily suggested the possibility of a link between abortion and breast cancer (scientists say with near unanimity that there isn't one). A statement explaining why educating teens about how to use condoms does not increase sexual activity was deleted from a Centers for Disease Control fact sheet. And so forth. <br> If science defenders were angry about these actions, they ought to be on an absolute rampage over a new Web site, www.4parents.gov, sponsored by three separate branches of the Department of Health and Human Services: the Office of Public Health and Science, the Office of Population Affairs, and the Public Health Service. The site is described as "part of a new national public education campaign" to help parents help their teenagers make "the healthiest choices." "Part of a new misinformation campaign" would be more accurate. A massive list of sexual health research and advocacy groups and other organizations have slammed the site, arguing that it amounts to a thinly veiled brief for pro-life moral values and abstinence education. An analysis of the site's content shows that their complaints are more than justified. <br> As the sexual health organizations complain, 4parents.gov delivers a stealth dose of pro-life advocacy. The site defines pregnancy, for instance, as a process "that begins when an egg cell and a sperm cell unite." Actually, not every fertilized egg implants in the wall of the uterus, meaning that a better definition of pregnancy would probably emphasize implantation, not fertilization. The site also refers to a fertilized egg shortly after implantation as an "unborn child," a phrase that appears repeatedly on 4parents.gov. <br> In order to make its pro-abstinence case, 4parents.gov also presents selective or distorted information about the effectiveness of condoms, a common tick on the religious right. The site takes every opportunity to downplay condom efficacy, with passages such as the following: <br> Studies suggest that condoms, when used consistently and correctly, offer significant risk reduction (80-87 percent) for HIV/AIDS. Condoms provide less risk reduction for other sexually transmitted diseases. Research indicates significant risk reduction for HIV to almost none for others (e.g., HPV). <br> Here, 4parents.gov appears to be relying exclusively on published studies that positively prove condom effectiveness for certain diseases, while conveniently ignoring basic common sense. What the site neglects to tell American parents is the following: According to the National Institutes of Health, condoms "provide a highly effective barrier to transmission of particles of similar size to those of the smallest STD viruses." Because of this characteristic, continues the NIH, there is "a strong probability of condom effectiveness when used correctly" both for diseases spread by discharges (including gonorrhea and chlamydia), and for diseases spread by skin-to-skin contact (including herpes, syphilis, and HPV), so long as the condom covers the infected area. <br> In short, even though the effectiveness of condoms may not have been proven in rigorous studies for all conditions, we nevertheless know that condoms provide a strong barrier against STD transmission. <br> And even as 4parents.gov demands rigorous proof of condom effectiveness for every individual sexually transmitted disease, it simultaneously celebrates abstinence on completely idealized grounds. Cynthia Dailard of The Alan Guttmacher Institute has observed that abstinence advocates frequently contrast theoretically perfect use of abstinence with actual real life condom failure rates, thus comparing "apples and oranges." 4parents.gov is no exception. The site refers to abstinence as "without question, the healthiest choice for adolescents." But as a method of disease prevention, abstinence -- just like condoms -- only works if you actually use it properly. And there's abundant evidence that despite the best of intentions, "abstinence" fails because many teens just don't stick to it. <br> For instance, 4parents.gov lists a "pledge of virginity" as a "protective factor" against risky sexual behaviors. It does not bother to cite actual research on how virginity pledgers behave. In a recent study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, Yale sociologist Hannah Bruckner and Columbia sociologist Peter Bearman found that teenagers who took these pledges -- promising to abstain from sex until marriage -- delayed having sex for longer but did not have correspondingly diminished STD infection rates. That's because most pledgers didn't actually keep their oaths all the way to marriage, and those breaking them were less likely to use condoms the first time they had sex. Moreover, the minority of pledgers who actually managed to abstain from vaginal sex until marriage were more likely to get it on in other ways -- such as trying out oral or anal sex -- in the meantime. <br> With more space, we could catalogue more distortions on 4parents.gov. But a more interesting question is: Where are they coming from? Part of the explanation may arise from the fact that in the site's creation, the government partnered with a nonprofit group called the National Physicians Center for Family Resources. This organization has previously teamed up with the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists to oppose the so-called abortion pill RU-486, and has promoted the dubious notion, popular on the religious right, of a link between abortion and breast cancer. <br> It is a sad day, but we can no longer doubt that it has arrived. At least in the area of sexual health, Americans can no longer rely on their own government for balanced, objective information. <br> Chris Mooney is a Prospect senior correspondent whose TAP Online column appears each week. <br> By Chris MooneyReprinted with permission from The American Prospect, 5 Broad Street, Boston, MA 02109.

This column from The Nation was written by Robert Scheer.What does it mean that a whopping 70 percent of Americans, according to a recent "New York Times"-CBS News poll, believe that mass culture is responsible for debasing our moral values? It means, if the poll is accurate, that we are a nation of lascivious hypocrites. In fact, the lure of sin, as represented by Hollywood and the entertainment industry, is as tempting to Americans today as apples ever were to Adam and Eve. <br> Whether in Utah, Georgia or New York, the TV ratings show that we are choosing the equivalent of fast-food entertainment over quality programming. Sex and violence sell well everywhere; high culture does not. So the entertainment titans keep dishing up more of the same. <br> The top two shows in the nation right now are a grisly crime serial and a cynical and sex-soaked demolition of life in the suburbs, and both are beloved in both red states and blue. <br> In the Atlanta market, for example, "Desperate Housewives" is the No. 1 show, while in Salt Lake City, the gory "CSI" franchise dominates local TV sets, with "Housewives" placing a respectable fourth. Both regions backed President Bush solidly, giving him 58 percent and 72 percent of the vote, respectively. In other words, we have met the enemy and it is us. If anything is to blame for what appears on our screens it is the free market, a deregulated and hypercompetitive mediascape where a right-wing mega-capitalist like Rupert Murdoch can simultaneously make millions off satires like "Married With Children" and "The Simpsons" and a right-wing news channel that wraps itself in the very "God, country, family" tropes that those satires so crassly yet cleverly spoof. <br> Yet even some liberals have apparently bought the Big Lie, spewed with a vengeance throughout this election year, that a liberal, permissive, secular, coastal culture has perverted the otherwise pristine heartland of our nation. In reality, what we have here is Econ 101: supply and demand. Adam Smith's invisible hand, combined with mass media technology, now allows the best that humanity has to offer to compete with the lowest common denominator. And guess what is winning. <br> On rare occasions, the good triumphs. Religious censors, for example, would have killed D.H. Lawrence's exquisite depiction of Lady Chatterley's affair with her gamekeeper if he hadn't been able to find printers who valued cash over the church's approval. Today, however, the admixture of greed and art allows "Desperate Housewives" to cash in on the same sex-with-a-hireling story line, with more cleavage and far less sincerity. Catering to our base desires also finds us eagerly paying for video games in which one can spend the afternoon slaughtering innocents and monsters alike, while our prime-time television is dominated by "Survivor"-style shows whose logical conclusion seems to be Piggy's execution by the mob in "Lord of the Flies." <br> But hey, to each his own, right? Personally, I could do without ever again hearing jingoistic country songs like Toby Keith's hit that warned the world: "You'll be sorry that you messed with the U S of A/ 'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass / It's the American way." But I'd never ask for such drivel to be banned. <br> The bottom line of capitalism is that if somebody will buy it, somebody will make it. Yet instead of insisting that cultural consumers take personal responsibility for the choices they make -- or, better yet, providing new resources for public education and nonprofit media -- the professional tsk-tskers feign outrage at the sullying of televised football with Janet Jackson's breast or a naked Desperate Housewife jumping into the arms of an NFL player. <br> Worse, these national moralists -- dominated these days by evangelical Christians -- politicize the issue by blaming "liberal Hollywood" for what deregulation and the free market have wrought. Never mind that Arnold Schwarzenegger made all those violent movies, it is the Democrats and their ilk who are corrupting youth by promulgating our "relativistic" morality. But that's just bunk. The real engine at work here, for better or worse, is the profit motive. If this patently obvious point is absent from the complaints of social conservatives, it is because the truth of the matter is inconvenient to their agenda. <br> It's much easier for them to politicize the moral decay of our culture than to admit that its wellspring is the domination of media corporations, along with the rampant consumerism that has led us deep into personal debt. Let's face it: There's not much money to be made off children's piano recitals, songs sung around the campfire or performances by your local orchestra, but the choice to consume such fare is always there. <br> So if you're upset with what's on the boob tube tonight, just ask yourself: What would Jesus watch? My guess is PBS. <br> Robert Scheer, a Nation contributing editor, is also a contributing editor and columnist for the "Los Angeles Times" and the author, with Christopher Scheer and Lakshmi Chaudhry, of "The Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq." <br> By Robert ScheerReprinted with permission from The Nation
By Kathleen Frankovic, Sarah Dutton and Jennifer De Pinto of the CBS News Election and Survey Unit.Those who follow the polls may be wondering how to make sense of all the information they contain. That's especially true for the "horse race" -- the polling question that asks participants which candidate they would vote for if the election were held today. <br> Right after the Republican Convention, polls released within days of one another ranged from a double-digit lead for President Bush to a tied race. CBS News' most recent poll had Mr. Bush leading John Kerry by eight percentage points among registered voters (with likely voters not much different). <br> Why are these polls, conducted by reputable pollsters with many years experience in the polling business, showing such different results? There are a number of reasons why the polls differ. <br> For example, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (which regularly polls on current events, politics and the media) first asks respondents how much attention they have been paying to a number of recent news topics before asking whether people are registered or how they will vote. While in theory this should not affect how people vote, it may focus attention on certain issues and mentioning Iraq, the economy, and the ad campaign by the "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" can affect the responses of less committed voters. <br> Some organizations ask only one question. On the other hand, The Gallup Organization uses a series of questions that were first developed to be used in the last weeks of a campaign. Applying that series for the entire year before the election may have some unintended consequences and as we've seen, the Gallup Polls of likely voters have shown greater swings than many other polls. <br> Additionally, some polling organizations limit the number of voters included in their "likely voter" group, not letting the number exceed their expectations for what turnout will be. That can exclude some voters who would fit another polling organization's definition of likely voters. <br> In fact, right now the polls are fairly consistent. Taking a look at the most recent major pre-election polls among registered voters shows similar results. All of these polls at least for now -- report a lead for Mr. Bush over John Kerry. <br> RECENT POLLS (among registered voters) <br> The dates over which the two polls were conducted are fairly close. Numbers from both polls are among registered voters. But the NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll asks quite a few questions that CBS News does not ask before asking respondents for whom they would vote. <br> CBS News asks respondents whether they are registered to vote, how likely they are to vote in November, and how much attention they are paying to the election before asking the vote question. <br> The NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll asks registered to vote, interest in the elections, whether the country is headed in the right direction, approval of the job Mr. Bush is doing (as president, handling the economy, handling foreign policy and dealing with terrorism) and whether Mr. Bush deserves to be re-elected before asking for whom they would vote. <br> Each organization has its reasons for structuring questionnaires as it does. Nevertheless, differences in question order could well account for disparities in the horse race results.
This column from the National Review Online was written by Victor Davis Hanson.Chechen Islamicists burn up Russian airliners and shoot schoolgirls -- and say they are victims, deprived of the chance for their own autonomous theocracy. Beheaders in Iraq decapitate Americans, Pakistanis, Koreans, Japanese, and Nepalese -- only to claim that these are infidels guilty of trying to build roads and bridges. Italian humanitarians and charity workers are kidnapped by Islamicists. In the "holy" city of Najaf, religious extremists bomb innocents, not only without gratitude for those who freed them from Saddam, but full of hatred for those who would bring them consensual government. <br> Islamic terrorists kidnap French journalists and threaten them with execution, demanding that a sovereign nation previously known for its appeasement of radical Middle Eastern rogue regimes overturn a law protecting secular life in its schools. Hamas "freedom fighters" blow up buses inside Israel and call the dead children Zionists who belong in the sea. <br> Islamic fascists incinerate dozens in Madrid, and claim they have a right to do so because of the Spanish role in ridding the world of the Hussein clan -- or was the real rub the Reconquista? Australians in Bali are engulfed in flame by car bombers for the felony of being Western visitors in an Islamic enclave. <br> Meanwhile, back in the United States, as in the major capitals of Europe, Islamic terrorists are arrested periodically, seeking to trump the foul work of September 11. Theocrats blew apart General Massoud in Afghanistan, attempted to kill President Musharraf of Pakistan, and now claim that they plan to do the same to our own leaders here in the United States. A few thousand Islamic males made an entire nation take off their shoes at their airports and changed forever the daily routine of 300 million Americans -- and promise they are not done yet. <br> Ask yourself: What do a Russian ten-year-old, a poor black farmer in Darfur, an elderly pensioner in Israel, a stockbroker in New York, and a U.N. aid worker in Afghanistan have in common? In the last three years, they have all died in similar ways: Unarmed and civilian, they were murdered by a common cowardly method fueled by a fascist ideology. <br> The recent slaughters in Russia were the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back of excusing or explaining away radical Islamic terror. If the Estonians can break away from post-Soviet oppression and free themselves from Russian authoritarianism without slaughtering schoolchildren and blowing up airplanes, then the Chechens can as well -- but only if they wish to create democracy rather than an Islamic fascist state. <br> But there is something else going on here besides the cloak of so-called Chechen nationalism. The perversion not of religion per se, but of Islam; the singular method of suicide bombing rarely found elsewhere; the frequent resort to the unique grotesquery of beheading; the now-common display of abject incompetence on the battlefield coupled with craven slaughter of the noncombatant and civilian aid worker. <br> At some point, the leaders of the Western world (if there are any left besides George W. Bush and Tony Blair) are going to look at all this madness worldwide and come to the bitter conclusion that there is a disgusting pattern: Not every Muslim is a fascist terrorist, but almost every fascist terrorist is a Muslim. Killers are not screaming "Hail Mary" when they machine gun children in the back, slit the throat of airline stewardesses, or blow pregnant women up on buses across the globe. And they are not the subjects of condemnatory fatwas in Iran or Saudi Arabia.Their grievance is not really Russian imperialism, or the five to ten percent of the West Bank under dispute, or black African encroachment on Arab land, or purported French insensitivity to legitimate Islamic pride, much less an American "crusade" to harm Muslims. <br> All these issues and the hundreds of others -- from the right to build a reactor in Iran to the desire for a semi-autonomous Chechnya -- in theory could be discussed, argued about, and adjudicated through democratic dialogue. <br> But that is impossible. For you see, the real problem is the democratic dialogue itself -- unknown in the Arab Middle East and much of the Islamic world, and a hindrance to both sharia and the pan-Arabist thug with epaulettes and sunglasses. Yet consensual government alone is the key to ending failed statist economies, gender apartheid, religious intolerance, state-controlled media, and tribalism. It alone might stop the self-induced misery and with it the tedious scapegoating of "the Jews and America." <br> Much of the Islamic Middle East continues to blame others for its own induced catastrophe, apparently unaware -- thanks to the lever of oil it didn't discover, doesn't know how to develop, and uses to intensify rather than alleviate its poverty -- that its entire culture is becoming an international pariah. Islamic young men on European flights are looked at with distrust; they are not welcome in Russia. China wants none of them. They are wary of visiting India. Australia learned from Bali. The whole world is watching -- in disgust. <br> In short, the suicide bomber, the improvised explosive device, the car bomb, the televised beheading, the wacko fatwa, the sleazy propaganda streamer on the Internet, the new cult of death -- all cowardly and lethal phenomena -- these are now the innovations that the world associates with the Middle East in lieu of gene research, car production, or computer breakthroughs. If you look for gender equity in the Middle East, you won't find it in Arab Olympic delegations, Saudi schools, or the Iranian government, but in the opportunity for young women to blow themselves up right beside men. Indeed, killing infidels is the nascent women's-liberation movement of the radical Muslim world. <br> It won't do to fault a few bad apples -- as if when Ziad Jarrah in his red bandanna yelled out "Allah is the greatest" as he crashed United Flight 93 on September 11, he did so alone, to the horror and disgust of the Arab Street, and without a shared ideology. <br> Yet if we look for change from within, the Arab League offers instead the tired victimization from colonialism of some 50 years past or retro European-Zionist conspiracies of the 1940s. It remains mostly silent about past American efforts to free Kuwait, save Bosnians and Kosovars, topple murderers such as Saddam and the Taliban -- and is completely mute about the ongoing Arab genocide of black Africans in Darfur. <br> The last three decades have taught Americans that extending aid or help to the Islamic world is almost as bad as warring with it, inasmuch as the Middle East apparently admires strength of any sort but despises magnanimity as decadence. Here at home there will always be a retired Clintonian diplomat or Council on Foreign Relations grandee to assure us that "the Bush foreign policy" is what stirred up the previously sober Middle East or alienated those once courageous French and Germans -- as if the last decade did not lead logically to September 11. <br> But there is a problem here that makes our struggle more than just a war against the "terror" of newfound stealthy cells. Libya came clean not out of principle but out of fear. Saudi Arabia is not quite the Saudi Arabia of September 11, thanks to American pressure. There is a reason Dr. Khan was exposed and Pakistan is suddenly doing more to harm than help al Qaeda. The cause of all of this ongoing change is not fear of a windsurfing John Kerry as the next president threatening a more "sensitive" war. <br> True, this war can be lost if we fail to address the hearts and minds of the Arab people -- if we fail to offer something better than the false choice between jihad and autocracy. Chechnya of the 1990s proves that perhaps. But it cannot be won by aid and diplomacy alone -- any more than the Kaiser, Mussolini, Hitler, Tojo, and Stalin and his successors could be talked or bought out of their extremism. <br> The U.S. military -- not NATO, the U.N., or the EU -- shut down the al Qaeda sanctuary in Afghanistan and the nightmare of Saddam's Iraq. It is the only protector of the effort to jumpstart reform in Iraq. Appreciation of that power impressed both Pakistan and Libya. Threat of that force keeps terrorist killers in Lebanon, Syria, and Iran careful not to leave visible tracks among their compliant, but also apprehensive, hosts. India understands that; so does China. Russia also grasps that there is now no appeasement possible with Islamic killers. How the Arab-Islamic world managed to unite over 3 billion nuclear Anglo Americans, Indians, Chinese, and Russians in their suspicions of it will be a case-study in imbecility for diplomatic historians for decades to come. <br> Only the Europeans, in their fear and impotence, still pray that obsequiousness might fend off Islamofascism, as if a Madrid is an aberration rather than a harbinger of worse to come. Only the elite radical American Left is either too timid or too morally bankrupt to condemn the new fascism in the Middle East or the Arab genocide in Sudan, preferring instead to whine about Bush's "lies" and all the other non-issues that the most secure and leisured people on the planet protest about for an hour or two before calling it a day. <br> Some insist that this war is only against a few "crazy" extremists and that it cannot be won by force. That is half true. In fact, millions of young Middle Easterners are watching Islamic fascists to learn whether to applaud or condemn them -- and that decision in places like Najaf, Fallujah, Kandahar, Madrid, Grozny, and Ramallah sadly hinges as much on resolute force as it does on "sensitive" understanding. There are millions we must help, but there are also thousands of wannabe Osama bin Ladens and Mohammed Attas who have neither minds nor hearts that anyone would want to win over. <br> In a war against such killers, it is the proverbial "Them or Us." Islamic fascists are not crazy -- however crazy they sound -- but evil, as their evil work confirms. We do not need more lectures about the impossibility of winning a postmodern conflict, about al Qaeda's not following the laws of Clausewitz or being immune to our way of war. In fact, we can and have defeated them. Keep doing that and the "hearts and minds" of others in the region, whom we are already helping, will mysteriously prove more open to dialogue. <br> Fail again like we did on September 11 -- and the entire United States Treasury could not buy the good will of an Islamic Street once more gone mad with delight for having felled the Great Satan. <br> Victor Davis Hanson is a visiting professor for the month of September and a fellow of Hillsdale College. <br> By Victor Davis Hanson Reprinted with permission from National Review Online
This Against the Grain commentary is written by CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer. There is one proud and satisfied place where the pictures and accounts of the abuse endured by some prisoners at Abu Ghraib cause no consternation and no outrage: Rush Limbaugh's America, pop. 20 million. <br> Here's Rush's take, from his Website: <br> "I'm sorry, folks. I'm sorry. Somebody has to provide a little levity here. This is not as serious as everybody is making it out to be. My gosh, we're all wringing our hands here. We act like, 'Okay let's just die,' you know? 'Let's just give up. What can we do to make these people feel better? Let's just pull out of there, and let's just go. Let's just become a neutral country. Let's just do that.' I mean, it's ridiculous. It's outrageous what's happening here, and it's not -- and it's not because I'm out of touch; it's because I am in touch, folks, that I can understand. This is a pure, media-generated story. I'm not saying it didn't happen; I'm [not] saying the pictures aren't there, but this is being given more life than the Waco invasion got. This is being given more life than almost -- it's almost become an Oklahoma City-type thing. One more Bush sound bite, and the president continued explaining how real democracy works here." <br> Here's Rush's sociological evaluation of what really happened at Abu Ghraib, as quoted in a piece in The New Republic on Limbaughism: <br> "This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release? You [ever] heard of need to blow some steam off?" <br> Now, don't you feel like a dopey dittohead for letting a little outbreak of prisoner sadism bug you? These were just boys and girls blowing off steam during a stressful situation. Let's not make an international incident out of it, for crying out loud. <br> In Rush's world, this is essentially geopolitical spilled milk: <br> "I don't understand what we're so worried about. These are the people that are trying to kill us. What do we care what is the most humiliating thing in the world for them? There's also this business of them all wearing hoods and how that's also very humiliating. You can see more guys wearing hoods at a [Sen.] Robert Byrd birthday party 40 years ago than we've seen in these prisoner photos." <br> So what's the moral of the story, for Rush? <br> "There's only one thing to do here, folks, and that's achieve victory over people who have targeted us for loooong, long time, well over 15, 20 years. It's the only way to deal with this, and that's why obsessing about a single incident or two of so-called abuse in a prison is nothing more than a giant distraction and could up being something that will really ties [sic] our hands and handcuffs us in what the real objective is here, which is the preservation of our way of life and our country." <br> "And that's why I'm not going to sit here and obsess and join the rest of the media with this and turn this into a campaign issue, try to convince as many people that George Bush is incompetent and needs to be thrown out of office -- because that's all this is. But in the process, what all that does is weaken the resolve of the people of this country" <br> Now, don't you feel like a dopey dittohead for wasting time worrying about how this incident was preventable fuel for anti-American hate? For worrying that soldiers under our flag did something profoundly wrong by our own measures? For feeling anything remotely like what Limbaugh diagnoses as liberal sniveling? <br> President Bush, however, has not been comforted by the Limbaugh analysis. "It's a stain on our country's honor and our country's reputation," President Bush said. "I am sickened by what I saw and sickened that people got the wrong impression." <br> There has been a good deal of attention in the U.S. to how the Abu Ghraib episode has been covered and perceived around the world. I present these passages of America's most listened to political theorist, Rush Limbaugh, in that spirit. Many, many Americans seem to share the views Limbaugh expresses in these quotes -- a fact that people who don't share those views had better understand loud and clear. <br> I admit to finding several points of agreement in Rush's rush of pronouncements about this saga. (For the record, I'll get more hate mail for that admission than I'll get from Rush's backers, though that too will be voluminous.) <br> "There are probably some good people in the bad guys and some rotten apples in the good guys, and these people that did this so-called torture may in fact be the rotten apples of the good guy group. But it's like I said: it doesn't taint the whole military effort and it doesn't taint us, but the world is joining in now trying to taint us as a nation, as a people, and as a culture by virtue of these pictures on the basis that we have humiliated these people. What is hijacking our own airplanes and flying them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon? How humiliating is it to blow up American civilians in a convoy and have their charred bodies dragged from the car and dragged through it streets? There seems to be no sensitivity, concern or outrage for any of this anywhere in the world. So pardon me if my patience is a little short." <br> I think Rush is right: the world was not properly outraged when jubilant Iraqis desecrated the mutilated corpses of Americans. <br> And Rush is right: this is not who "we" are. Some of "us," like some of all peoples, are capable of great cruelty and great evil, in some circumstances. "We" are probably no more or no less susceptible than other groups. What is different about "us" from so many others is the institutions, the laws, the habits, the openness and the idealism that we have developed. All that broke down at Abu Ghraib and in the bureaucracy that managed it. <br> It is precisely the rebellion and repugnance at such failures that makes us vigilant against them in the future. An it is precisely the skilled sophistry, the chauvinism and the fear mongering of Limbaughism that corrodes the vigilance we should be proud of and that we need to ever cultivate. <br> Dick Meyer, the Editorial Director of CBSNews.com, has covered politics and government in Washington for 20 years and has won the Investigative Reporters and Editors, Alfred I.

CBS News Reporter Charles Wolfson, a former Tel Aviv bureau chief for CBS News, now covers the State Department. He welcomes feedback. Six months after President George W. Bush declared an end to the regime of Saddam Hussein, the Bush administration has taken another step forward in the rebuilding of Iraq. <br> Thirty-three billion dollars was pledged at the international donors conference in Madrid to put Iraq back together again. <br> It's an effort some see as cleaning up the mess America made while others label it an example of early 21st century nation building. It is, many argue, the right thing to do for a people brutalized by a terrible regime. <br> For administration foreign policymakers the tens of billions put on the table represents (as so often is the case in matters related to Iraq) another chance to see the glass half full. For critics at home and abroad, however, the glass half-empty scenario will be noted as the legacy of Madrid. <br> The international community is used to such exercises. Raising money to rebuild the Balkans, Haiti or Afghanistan can all be used as models to one degree or another. A few nations take the lead, cajoling and squeezing millions or billions out of capitals from Tokyo to Riyadh to Ottawa. International financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund step up to the challenge pledging to guarantee loans and account for the spending of huge sums and the letting of contracts. <br> And the United Nations puts the "international" stamp of approval on the exercise, claiming for itself a role in the process and, at the same time, providing enough political cover for many governments who do not want to be seen as simply taking orders from Washington. <br> In this case some headlines will tell us $10-$20 billion was pledged at Madrid. Combine that with Washington's $20 billion (the amount the Bush administration is hoping to get from Congress for immediate use) and you've got more than enough to claim a good start, even to call it a success, which the Bush administration has. <br> Others noting the results will lead with fact that the international community did not pledge enough even to meet the needs of Iraq as estimated by the World Bank, some $56 billion over four years. Thus we have the glass half-full, half-empty prism through which the results of Madrid will be seen. <br> One of the complicating factors in assessing this or similar conferences is figuring out who's actually helping Iraq, in what ways and over what period of time. There are apples, oranges, pears, tangerines plums in this fruit bowl of donations. <br> Some countries make outright grants, gifts of cash (Japan pledged $1.5 billion for 2004); others do it with credits or loans (the World Bank will loan Iraq $3-$5 billion over five years); and some do it with both (Japan will also loan Iraq $3.5 billion for 2005-2007). <br> Other countries put forgiveness of previous debt into their calculations (it's estimated Iraq's debt may be as high as $120 billion), and some talk in terms of encouraging private investment in Iraq as a way of helping the Iraqi peopleand their own companies. <br> Asked if there was any country Washington would single out as being disappointed with the size of its contribution at Madrid, a senior State department official said, "nothe souk is still open. Why would you badmouth somebodywho you're looking to have a change of heart." <br> So Washington is looking at Madrid as a first step. "The door is still open," the senior official said. No unkind words directed at France, Germany or Russia, or even at the 15-member European Union, which, as an organization, pledged less to rebuild Iraq$812 million in 2004than it gave to help Afghanistan last year, $931 million. <br> Virtually every step the Bush administration has taken in its Iraq policy has been a mine field unto itself: the military buildup and lack of support from neighboring Turkey; the diplomatic attempts to build a meaningful and effective coalition through the U N; the appointment of a Governing Council which presumed to represent all factions of Iraqis; and, now, the attempt to encourage the world community to share the cost burden of rebuilding Iraq. Of course there are the deadly hazards American troops face on a daily basis in the form of booby traps, RPG rocket attacks and roadside ambushes. <br> The United States is stuck for the foreseeable future in Iraq and, although many countries are not happy about why or how the international community has come to this point, almost every political leader recognizes they will have to play some part in support of Iraq in the coming years. It may serve some short-term political needs to see Washington squirm, but it's in no one's long term interest to have the U.S. bogged down in Baghdad. <br> By Charles Wolfson
Attorney Andrew Cohen analyzes legal issues for CBSNews.com and CBS News.It's a fairly sure bet that Kobe Bryant is paying a fortune to his defense lawyers to save him from jail and ruin on sex assault charges. It's also pretty clear that, so far, he is getting his money's worth, if not in tangible results than certainly in creativity and aggressiveness. <br> With a pair of court filings late Friday, Team Kobe now has made clear its legal strategy in advance of the Oct. 9 preliminary hearing in the case. <br> The defense wants to close the preliminary hearing to the public and the press and, failing that, may waive the hearing altogether rather than risk giving prosecutors the opportunity to make their evidentiary spin the first such in-court spin that takes hold in the case. <br> You never get a second chance to make a first impression, remember, so although Bryant told the judge last month that he wanted a preliminary hearing, he may be preparing to change his mind unless he gets his way. <br> If you were really cynical, you might say that the defense is setting itself up to fail so that it then can blame a series of bad judicial rulings for the decision to back away from the Oct. 9 court date. <br> If you weren't cynical at all, you might say that Team Kobe is simply trying to ensure that if there is a preliminary hearing it is going to be as favorable to the defense as is humanly and legally possible. <br> Either way, it's the kind of tactical set-up you'd expect from good defense attorneys who also are experienced in dealing with high-profile cases. Bryant cannot win or lose the case depending upon how this matter gets resolved. However, even if it gets resolved against him, his attorneys already have insulated him somewhat from a public relations' hit that surely would follow if the judge were to find, as he likely would find, that "probable cause" exists to believe that Bryant committed sexual assault. <br> Bryant's attorneys late last week asked Eagle County Court Judge Frederick Gannett to close the preliminary hearing "to the public and the media." The defense doesn't want potential jurors, or journalists who will report back to potential jurors, viewing what is almost always a prosecution show a preliminary hearing that permits the government to introduce all sorts of evidence that might not be admissible at trial. <br> In support of this request, the defense mostly cited Judge Gannett himself, specifically the judge's August 21 order sealing the details of the arrest warrant and search warrant materials. Since the district attorney has promised to present much of the same information at the preliminary hearing that was part of this documentary evidence, the defense argues, the judge should go ahead and "seal" the hearing, too. <br> It's not a case of apples and oranges, the defense asserts, since a public airing of the allegedly sordid details at a preliminary hearing would have the same prejudicial effect on Bryant's constitutional fair trial rights as the public release of the allegedly sordid details of the search warrant materials would have had. By quoting the judge's August sealing order so extensively throughout their motion pages 2, 3, 4, 10 and 11 have a distinctly Gannettian tone the defense attorneys are daring the judge to come up with some legal rationale for why Bryant should be protected from sordid documents but not from sordid testimony. <br> I think the judge will find that rationale in the simple fact that no one is forcing Bryant to endure the vicissitudes of a preliminary hearing. He's free to simply waive it and get right to the arraignment in district court. <br> But the defense didn't just throw the judge's own words back at him. Bryant's lawyers also noted that another judge had sealed the 911 dispatch records of the case because of fear of undue prejudicial publicity; that prosecutors themselves had moved earlier in the case to seal records based upon the same arguments the defense now uses; and even that the alleged victim would benefit from a closed hearing by avoiding the "anxiety" she says she would endure if forced to testify. <br> It is as if the defense wants the judge and the rest of us to think not only that it is in everyone's interests to close the hearing to the public and the media but also that all sides in the case already have essentially agreed to do so, including the media, which desperately wants the hearing open, and the alleged victim, who desperately wants to be anywhere else in the world but in Eagle, Colorado, on Oct. 9. <br> It is a perception that is not likely to take hold with prosecutors, who almost certainly will file a sharp response in the next few days, or the media's attorneys, who almost certainly will howl at how the defense has overreacted to a simple request for an overflow-seating courtroom, or the victim, who no doubt will find it galling that Bryant is complaining about a public hearing while at the same time forcing her out into the open with a subpoena. <br> But Bryant's accuser at least or her attorneys, anyway already have started playing the mind game as well. <br> She filed an important and interesting motion late Friday herself. Through her attorneys, she says she is not needed at the preliminary hearing since she already has agreed to testify for prosecutors at trial. <br> Telling the judge that he "knows of no Eagle County case where a sex assault victim was forced to testify at the preliminary hearing over his or her objection," attorney John Clune then did a clever thing you don't see enough of in the law. He attached as an exhibit to his motion to quash the subpoena another motion to quash a subpoena filed last year by the law firm now representing Bryant. If you don't think I'm making a good argument to keep the alleged victim out of court at this time, Clune is telling the judge, then listen to the arguments made just last year by the defendant's own lawyers. If moving to quash was good enough for them then, Clune implies, it ought to be good enough for us now. <br> I know what you are thinking: lawyers are priceless, right? Right.By Andrew Cohen
Attorney Andrew Cohen analyzes legal issues for CBS News and CBSNews.com.Don't think for a second that Secretary of State Colin Powell brings with him to the United Nations the same burdens of proof and persuasion that a prosecutor brings to court. It's true that Secretary Powell will lay on the Security Counsel table America's case against Iraq over the issue of weapons of mass destruction. But that case is a political, diplomatic, military or even psychological one. It is by no means a legal one. <br> So pay no attention to those silly stories you might have glanced at over the past few days, the ones in which legal experts have opined about the strength of the government's evidence against Saddam Hussein using domestic American law as the parameter. Those evaluations aren't worth the computer paper they were generated on. Holding Secretary Powell to a prosecutor's standard is like timing a racehorse at a NASCAR event. At least apples and oranges are both fruit. <br> Forget, then, about the "reasonable doubt" standard or the "clear and convincing" test or the need for Secretary Powell even to prove the US case by a mere "preponderance of the evidence." Forget about hearsay or circumstantial evidence, for that matter, and all the other substantive and procedural rules we all get familiar with from time to time when a domestic case captures our fancy. They simply don't apply. The United Nations doesn't run by constitutional mandate and the Security Counsel itself isn't exactly a jury of anyone's peers. <br> Actually, the notion of a jury is a good way to begin to explain how and why Secretary Powell's task Wednesday is different than a prosecutor's task might be during closing argument. Imagine a jury where every single juror's own biases, prejudices, perspectives and agenda is encouraged instead of discouraged and you begin to understand what kind of listeners the Secretary of State will be talking to when he addresses the Security Counsel. <br> Then imagine those jurors present in a courtroom where there is no judge to preside over matters weighty and small. Wait. Imagine those jurors qua Security Counsel members as judges since that's essentially what they are. And then imagine that there are no appeals built into the process. How'd you like to be a defendant then? <br> Now that you have some sense of how much a Kangaroo Court the United Nations would be if we were to hold it to the standards of our criminal justice system, it's worth talking about what kind of tactical questions arise when people try to compare Secretary Powell's mission to one of a lawyer. First, imagine a closing argument that comes before there has been a trial. Makes no sense, right? Of course, right. <br> But most every fact upon which our government will rely in making its case against Saddam Hussein has never been tested in the fire of a legal contest. No cross-examination. No chain-of-custody. And when the Iraqis offer their "rebuttal," as they surely will in the coming days, it, too, will be a summation without a beginning, a closing argument without a trial. <br> This legal disconnect doesn't mean that America has her facts wrong or that we cannot prove a convincing case against Hussein and his regime. Nor does it mean that the Iraqis might not have some compelling points of their own to make. It just means that there is no agreed-upon notion of what has and has not been- or what can and cannot be-- proven to the biased, self-motivated, political "jurors" we call Security Counsel members. And please don't tell me that UN Resolution 1441 or its predecessors or successors represent the factual findings upon which the American "case" rests. As near as I can tell, none of those Resolutions would hold up in court. <br> So the structure of the Security Counsel is hardly "legal" and neither is the format through which the Secretary will make his remarks. What's left? The substance of the law. If we are to turn the United Nations into a court and the Security Counsel chamber into a courtroom we have to have some substantive law to apply. <br> Never mind that we already have international courts that fumble with this problem on a regular basis, or that international law itself almost always stumbles over the practical problem of which country gets to enforce it, what standards of proof and persuasion should Powell be held to? America's standards? Or Iraq's? Or perhaps some ginned-up standard that the international community has agreed to, except when it applies to certain countries that aren't crazy about it? <br> I know this is hard for people to understand in an age where lawyers seem to be everywhere and where every dispute seems ultimately to end up in court. And I know that America's beef with Iraq -- the free world's beef with Iraq --foundationally is rooted in reasonable and necessary international law and norms. But some events just have no legal analogy. <br> This is one of those events. No matter what the Secretary says, there will be no unanimous verdict in the court of public opinion. No matter what he proves, the other side will say that there is no proof. No matter what the final outcome will be when the Security Counsel decides, this dispute will be resolved on the ground or in some back room somewhere in Baghdad. Those realities alone ought to have dissuaded even the most creative reporters and talk show hosts from trying to tar the Secretary of State with an attorney's brush. <br> When Secretary Powell talks to his colleagues Wednesday -- when he speaks to an anxious planet -- he'll have to be convincing and persuasive and passionate and logical. He'll have to weave together the facts at his disposal with the analysis that ties it all together. He will have to sense the rhythm of the room and adjust his pace and tempo to match it. But he will have to do all those things as a politician, diplomat and soldier -- not as a lawyer. <br> By Andrew Cohen
 From Mississippi to Manhattan, the business boondoggles keep making the headlines. In his latest Against the Grain commentary, CBSNews.com's Dick Meyer discovers it's worse that he thought. <br> The WorldCom con is just the latest caper in what Ralph Nader is rightly calling a "corporate crime wave." And it's a big one. <br> But the list of big ones is growing frighteningly long: Adelphia, Computer Associates, Dynegy, Global Crossing, ImClone, Kmart, Lucent, MicroStrategy, Merrill Lynch, Network Associates, Qwest Communications, Tyco International, to name a round dozen. <br> And I wasn't even counting Enron and Arthur Andersen. <br> The first query for the coroner's inquest here is this: is this a case of a relatively few bad apples falling to the ground after a jumbo stock market bubble, or is it tree rot, a systemic infection of the corporate world and the police assigned to it? <br> Fortune Magazine offers a fine example of the latter view in "System Failure" by veteran financial writer Joseph Nocera. He writes: <br> "Phony earnings, inflated revenues, conflicted Wall Street analysts, directors asleep at the switch this isn't just a few bad apples we're talking about here. This, my friends, is a systemic breakdown. Nearly every known check on corporate behavior moral, regulatory, you name it fell by the wayside, replaced by the stupendous greed that marked the end of the bubble. And that has created a crisis of investor confidence the likes of which hasn't been seen since well, since the Great Depression." <br> A confident exposition of the bad apple theory came from Newsweek economic columnist Robert J. Samuelson in his essay, "The Search for Scapegoats." In his view: <br> "Since its peak in March 2000, the stock market has lost about a third of its value, or almost $6 trillion, according to Wilshire Associates. Everyone would like to think that these immense losses painful to individual investors and possibly threatening to the economy are someone else's fault. And now, suitable culprits seem to have emerged: Wall Street and corporate America, whose greed and dishonesty allegedly rigged the market. <br> "Hardly a day passes without some new scandal, whether of dubious accounting practices, illegal (or unethical) trading by insiders or dishonest stock advice. Americans were, it seems, duped. Companies overstated profits. Brokerage houses issued misleading reports. The wealthy played small investors for suckers ... Alas, this is mostly myth-making. Every financial mania ends with a search for a scapegoat. But finding a scapegoat and discovering the truth are often two different things." <br> I am an agnostic in this debate. And, frankly, I am not well qualified to weigh in. But I know one surprising convert to the "systemic" view and he's very well positioned to opine. My father. <br> It would be tough to find a bigger booster of American capitalism than Dad (something that drove me nuts in high school and college, of course). He runs a small manufacturing business in the Midwest that was founded in the 1880's. He's been there since the 1940's and is there right now. He's been an enthusiastic and adept stock investor for more than five decades. <br> And he's scared stiff to be in the market because he thinks the books are cooked and players are crooks. <br> This is not an unsophisticated investor. Or a Democrat. Or a conspiracy theorist. Or a man who believes in government regulation. I know plenty of people in all those categories who think the fix is in too. <br> So at this point, it may not much matter rather it's the tree or the apples. When my Dad and Ralph Nader agree, well, something is really rotten. It's not clear if President Bush is ready to declare war on corporate terrorism. It is clear that a lot of people are terrorized. <br> E-mail your questions and comments to Against the Grain <br> By Dick Meyer
In previewing the obstruction of justice trial of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, CBSNews.com Legal Analyst Andrew Cohen explains why a plea deal couldn't be reached.The most important thing to remember about the obstruction of justice trial beginning Monday against the beleaguered accounting firm Arthur Andersen is that no one will go to jail if the partnership is convicted of the federal charge against it. <br> Life and liberty aren't at stake; property and the financial survival of Andersen are. <br> That's why there has been no plea deal in a case that at first glance screams out for one. No one in the defense camp faces the prospect of a few years in prison. <br> And no prosecutor ever will be accused of pushing too hard to imprison some poor mail-room guy who was just doing what his boss told him to do when he shoved a few thousands pieces of paper through the company shredder while a federal investigation into the contents of those papers happened to be underway. <br> From a purely personal point of view, there is almost too little at stake for there to be a deal. <br> But, in some ways, there's also too much at stake for a pre-trial deal when you consider what an admission of guilt would mean for Andersen's future. In many ways, it would be worse than a conviction after trial, since a conviction could be appealed for years to come and challenged in the court of public opinion for all time <br> Whatever chance there is that a Houston jury will acquit the firm, either because of the evidence or because of sympathy, it's greater than the chance that the partnership could admit guilt and still operate the way it has for so many years. Given these circumstances, wouldn't you roll the dice if you were running Andersen right now? <br> I would, if only because the only chance Andersen has of easing out of its global legal troubles -- the federal criminal trial in Houston is only a big tip of the iceberg -- is to gain an acquittal in this case and then use the momentum from that favorable verdict to settle the other suits against it. <br> Andersen's turnaround, if it is going to come at all, has to start somewhere and I suspect the firm's lawyers and executives figure the criminal trial is as good a place as any to make that start -- to make their stand. <br> So what does Andersen have going for it in this case? A little. <br> First, former Andersen executive-turned-government witness David Duncan cannot prove everything the feds need to prove against the firm in order to gain a conviction. And Andersen's lawyers can and will turn whatever Duncan can prove against him, arguing to jurors that he was one of a few "bad apples" out of hundreds of executives who decided to authorize the shredding and deletion of e-mails even after the investigation had begun. <br> Legally speaking, that shouldn't be enough for an acquittal since the knowledge and actions of one partner typically under the law are imputed to the firm as a whole. But it's an angle that just might resonate with jurors anyway since jurors don't always follow the niceties of corporate law. <br> Another argument Andersen has going for it is the equity argument which I suspect we'll hear over and over again from the firm's lawyers: why punish thousands of innocent Andersen employees by dramatically jeopardizing their jobs over a crime perpetrated by a few individuals? <br> If the jury thinks broadly about the facts and the law, Andersen has a chance for its acquittal. <br> What does Andersen have going against it? Plenty. <br> Even if Duncan can't deliver all the goods for the government, he'll deliver plenty. And certainly he won't be the only witness who'll testify that there was shredding and deletion going on at Arthur Andersen when there shouldn't have been. <br> The firm itself reported its improper conduct to the authorities and then confirmed it to Congress. And don't forget that this is the post-Sept. 11th world, where juries across the country seem to be more inclined than ever to offer very little or no sympathy to any defendant in any criminal context. <br> Add to that new reality the notion that regular people are furious about Enron and it's not exactly a recipe that ought to have Andersen lawyers optimistic. <br> If Andersen is convicted, the penalty will be more than just a fine and probation. A conviction likely will preclude Andersen from auditing the financial statements of public companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and you don't need to be a Wall Street wiz to comprehend just how devastating that limitation would be on Andersen's ability to continue or rebound. <br> That's why we are likely to see this trial through to its end. <br> And even if Andersen is acquitted, the government will have sent the message it wants to send to all those other companies out there who are being investigated or who may one day face the prospect of an investigation: you've got to know when to hold your documents and know when to fold them and when you know you are the subject of an investigation, it's usually time to hold them.
CBSNews.com Special Contributor Lloyd Garver wants to know how a case involving a teacher asking students to grade their fellow pupils' papers in class ever made it all the way to the Supreme Court.Last year, when the Supreme Court decided who should be president, I assumed that they would never make a more important decision in their lives. I was wrong. Last week, the highest court in the land unanimously ruled that schoolteachers may continue to ask students to grade their fellow pupils' papers in class. <br> I'm not a lawyer, but I watch a lot of law shows on TV. So, I think that qualifies me to ask one big question: how did this thing ever get to the United States Supreme Court? White-collar crimes involving hundreds of millions of dollars have been turned away. Citizens who have been exonerated and want to clear their names are told to go elsewhere. Men on death row have been denied access to the Court. But this august body decided to hear the Elementary School Kids Grading Each Other's Papers case. <br> There are some legitimate concerns here. We are all familiar with teachers giving their classes tests, and then asking them to hand their tests to their "neighbors" to grade them. But what was especially upsetting to the parent who brought the complaint was that after the kids graded each other's papers, they were asked to call out the grades. So then everybody knew how everybody else did. Maybe some kids got teased. Maybe some kids bragged. Maybe some kids ran out the door and never returned to school and someday will be described by neighbors on the news as, "He was very quiet and never bothered anybody." Let's face it. Kids grading kids might not be the best thing, but is it something that the Supreme Court should decide? <br> In the decision, the Court said that even though the grades were announced out loud, this practice was not an invasion of privacy. It wasn't considered the same thing as publishing a child's academic record. The justices went on to say that if they outlawed "peer grading," then they would have to outlaw things that nobody would like to get rid of like a gold star or "a happy face." <br> This last item got my attention. I was shocked to learn that the Supreme Court was in favor of "happy faces." The highest court in the land now officially condones these annoying, cutesy things that people attach to messages and notes! Next, are the Justices going to weigh in on whether it's okay to sign a high school yearbook with, "Luv Ya?" Now that they have come out in favor of happy faces, we are bound to see a proliferation of those things. They are already everywhere. Sometimes people send them to you in emails by going like this :-) Don't be surprised if your next tax bill comes with a little yellow smiley face. Next you'll see them on the sides of police cars. Forget about foreign policy and the economy. In the next election, politicians will be debating the merits of the happy face. <br> Now that the Supreme Court has opened the schoolhouse door, there will be precedent for dealing with other school issues. Apples and other obvious bribes will be forbidden. Hopscotch and dodge ball rules will be codified. "Court TV" will bring us cases like, "Felonious Assault on the Donkey's Tail," "My Kid Deserves a B-," and "Ryan D. Didn't Share." Parents and students will be suing teachers and school districts all over the place. The Supreme Court will be swamped with school cases. They'll be so busy dealing with these things that they won't have time to do anything else. Of course, when I think about it that way, it doesn't sound like a bad thing at all. <br> E-mail your questions and comments to Lloyd Garver <br> Lloyd Garver has written for many television shows, ranging from "Sesame Street" to "Family Ties" to "Frasier."

There is only one question to ask on this manic Monday: Is the global market turmoil that has now spread to Wall Street a summer squall—a painful but ultimately transitory surge in volatility—or is it the first crack in a shaky global edifice that is about to crumble? <br> Let us, first, give the doom-sayers their due. The argument that we should be very, very worried about what lies ahead is serious and deserves serious attention. The Dow Jones index has suffered its steepest losses since 2008. On Thursday and Friday alone, U.S. listed stocks lost more than $1 trillion; in the first minutes of trading on Monday morning, they lost even more than that. Global markets have been equally dismal. In the past month, another $1 trillion has flowed out of emerging markets, while China’s indices have seen double-digit sell-offs. Shares on the Shanghai exchange, not a real proxy for the China economy but real nonetheless, lost nearly 9 percent on Sunday night. German and French shares also lost 7 percent last week, and another 4 percent on Monday. <br> For some time, pundits and professionals in marketland have been on edge, unsure about when the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates and uncertain about whether the general global economic landscape is conducive to further increase in corporate profits and stock prices. As a result, the sudden sell-off combined with the continued collapse of oil prices and the still remarkably low yield on bonds has brought all sorts of pessimists once again out of the shadows and onto center stage. <br> And yet. And yet. <br> The world has muddled through much better than the grim reapers of the market world have thought possible over the past years, and today, the global situation is unarguably better than at any point in the past few years. The United States has managed steady growth, steady improvement of employment and even some signs of modest wage growth (for instance, Walmart raising wages along with several cities passing minimum wage laws). Europe not only hasn’t imploded, but aside from Greece is showing many signs of a nascent recovery, albeit with untenably high unemployment in countries such as Italy and Spain. <br> China is a wildcard, but is still growing at a robust pace and the composition of that growth is likely much higher quality than in the past, with more coming from a real middle class and domestic activity rather than export markets and government spending. On Monday morning, the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, made a bold statement about the strength of Apple’s business in China as a countersignal to the widespread belief that the Chinese economy is on the verge of implosion. And those emerging market economies suffering from sagging oil and commodity prices used their flush years to invest in education and infrastructure and are for the most part ruled by democratic governments accountable for continued reform, even if those governments are facing a glare of questions about past errors (such as the massive corruption scandals surrounding Dilma Roussef in Brazil). <br> And then there is the fact that larger companies remain immensely profitable and continue to grow well above the rate of most national economies. While that slowed in recent months largely because of the drag of energy companies, it remains true that companies are – for better or worse – the most dynamic elements in the global economy. If there is any marginal rationality to the investing world, it makes sense that money would flow to those and that the future of those investments is at least not bleak. <br> This sell-off may not be over, and it would hardly be a surprise if there is further downside. But what matters for the economic future is whether this portends all sorts of other pain as well as a long period of low or negative returns. <br> Ever since 2008 and the global financial crisis, professionals in the financial world have been prone to bouts of hyperbole and overreaction just as extreme as the dramatic bounceback of the Dow Monday morning after its 1,000-point opening plunge. To some degree, that was probably always the case. Money, sex and religion (along with politics) tend to bring out the irrational, and sharp market movements have rarely been greeted with anything resembling sangfroid. The surge in selling in global markets the past week has brought those voices to the fore. <br> They have arguments to make that this is merely the first crack, the tremor before the big one. One analyst wrote a long and thoughtful piece with the headline of “Dow 5,000? Yes it could happen.” Such a decline would be 70 percent and assuredly be part of a wider global sell-off that would obliterate tens of trillions of dollars of paper wealth. That would also be a steeper drop off than what happened in late 2008 into March of 2009. But the ingredients are there: Valuations are higher than 20 th century norms; emerging markets that have depended on a hungry China consuming raw materials are in a deep bind as that appetite diminishes and prices collapse; Europe and Japan are caught in a deflationary growth trap with shrinking populations and expanding safety net costs; China may be trying to transition from a manufacturing economy to a consumer economy but for now the only thing clear is that the export engine has stalled and nothing has yet replaced it fully; and the United States is eking out low level growth based on fewer workers, technology and accommodative central banks. <br> But this bleak picture is also not the only picture. Cup half empty or cup half full will largely determine how you interpret what is an admittedly opaque global picture. Opacity does not play well on TV or in the world of financial punditry. It’s just too … opaque. But the very uncertainty of the global system augurs against such clear warnings of major trouble. <br> The bottom line is that for the past few years, financial markets have outperformed real-world economies. This year, many national economies are doing well while financial markets are flat to down. The universe can certainly handle such a year, as should investors. The noisome negatively that pervades financial commentary should not obscure the fact that net-net, we have been in a rather stable period in much of the developed world and indeed much of the world overall outside of notable and egregious exceptions such as Syria and Yemen and Venezuela. <br> Financial markets are not an exact proxy of those trends, but nor are they completely detached. It may be painful for a while, but that does not mean we should suddenly heed the Cassandras in our midst. The world has been growing more stable and more affluent, random market declines and occasional acts of violence notwithstanding. That is the most powerful trend in the world today, and until it is dented beyond recognition, it is likely to continue. 
Many Americans believe that someone, somewhere in Washington, must be in charge of tracking who is and who isn’t a citizen of the United States. Apparently, so does the U.S. Supreme Court, which just accepted a voting rights case that turns on the government’s ability to count the number of citizens in each voting district. But despite all the talk these days about government and Big Data, the justices, like the rest of us, might be surprised to learn that the most basic information as to who is an American citizen cannot actually be found in any publicly available government data set — anywhere. <br> The case, Evenwel v. Abbott, poses a question: whether the Constitution’s long-standing “one person, one vote” principle requires equal numbers of voters per district instead of equal numbers of people, as is current practice. Most commentary on the case has focused on its implications for political parties and racial groups. But focusing on the politics, or even on the merits of the constitutional argument, ultimately distracts from a much bigger problem: The data necessary to draw districts with equal numbers of eligible voters does not exist. We have no national citizen database that tells us how many citizens live in each district around the country. <br> “What about the U.S. Census?” you might be wondering. It’s true that the census releases a data set that provides the building blocks of redistricting plans for Congress, state legislatures, city councils and school boards. But that data set counts just two things: the total number of people, and the number of people over the age of 18, in every community in the country. The data file has no information about which of those people are citizens and which are not. Voter registration lists, another alternative, are notoriously unreliable and highly variable depending on whether an election is coming up — and some states don’t keep track of voter registration at all. <br> For centuries, unequal districts were as American as apple pie. But in 1964, Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren began striking down maps of electoral districts that had radically different numbers of people than others. Warren was drawing on his experience as governor of California, where a sparsely populated rural county and densely populated Los Angeles each received only one seat in the California state Senate. Warren viewed “one person, one vote” as a critical move to ensure equal political representation. In fact, he considered the redistricting cases to be the most important of his tenure on the Court — even more significant than Brown v. Board of Education. Give people equal representation, he argued, and they will be able to defend themselves and protect their civil rights in the political process. <br> But while the Court instituted the rule of equality in redistricting over 50 years ago, it has never specified equal numbers of “what” or “whom.” That’s what the Evenwel case is about. Does the Constitution require the use of one statistic — citizens — instead of another — residents — in determining how districts should be drawn? <br> The Evenwel plaintiffs make a hardly radical argument that ensuring equal voting rights for all must mean that districts should have equal numbers of eligible voters — not just residents. Otherwise, they argue, voters in an area with large noncitizen communities are given an unfair advantage. They point out that certain Texas state Senate districts have roughly twice the number of eligible voters as others, despite having equal numbers of residents. In their view, some Texas voters, particularly Latino voters who live in districts with large noncitizen populations, have much greater power to elect their representative than those in other districts. “One person, one vote,” they argue, should really mean “one voter, one vote.” <br> As appealing as the logic may be, that transformation in constitutional law would be based on data that simply doesn’t exist. Of course, the census does make available certain estimates of the total number of citizens and noncitizens for states and localities — just as it also estimates the size of the labor force or the total number of bathrooms per household. But the high court is mistaken if it believes these numbers can be used for redistricting. <br> These census citizenship estimates come from one survey — the American Community Survey — that is based on reporting from just 2 percent of American households. The census releases these estimates for each year, plus averages for the preceding three- and five-year periods. Sometimes the surveys dating from these different years contradict one another, revealing quite different citizenship rates — either because of population migration, or because the survey design isn’t fine-tuned enough to accurately count citizens at the local level. And even when the ACS data remain consistent, they are accompanied sometimes by a large margin of error, just like any public opinion poll based on a small sample set. <br> What does the Constitution say on the matter? Well, the 14th Amendment explains that apportionment of Congress — that is, the number of members each state gets for the U.S. House of Representatives — is to be determined “according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State.” Persons — not citizens or voters. Now, the Texas case is not about Congress. It concerns districts for the state Legislature, and the Constitution is conspicuously silent on districting for state legislatures. (In fact, the whole notion of districting — for Congress or state legislatures — never appears in the Constitution at all, but that is another matter.) <br> In general, the court has deferred to the states on which statistics to use to count people. Unsurprisingly, virtually everybody uses the official U.S. Census data — data that count residents, not voters. After all, although the data have their flaws, like omitting many hard-to-count populations, they are far and away more accurate than the ACS numbers. The ACS surveys are also discretionary — they could be defunded and terminated by Congress at any time (the census, on the other hand, is mandated in the Constitution). <br> Legitimate philosophical arguments can be made in favor of using one set of statistics over another — just as one could argue that some concerns in redistricting, such as keeping counties or communities intact, should override the concern for precise equality. A redistricting plan based on equal numbers of people, the system we have now, also ensures that the workload and constituent-related burdens of representatives are roughly equal. In effect, equal representation may be more important than equal voting power itself. <br> But the question that confronts the court as it prepares to hear the Evenwel case in the fall is whether the Constitution mandates the use of one statistic to the exclusion of all else. The fact that no accurate count of citizens exists should be the end of the matter. Unless the justices are prepared to mandate a new kind of citizen census — one never contemplated by the Constitution — then they should leave it to the states to draw their districts using the most accurate data available. The one person, one vote rule isn't broken, and the Supreme Court shouldn't try to fix it. 
As hundreds of thousands congregate in Louisville this weekend for a classic American ritual, the 140thrunning of the Kentucky Derby, they will find it hard not to notice of one of the most prominent local sponsors of the event, Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC, known to the world as “Kentucky Fried Chicken.” <br> Yum and KFC are staples of Louisville and long-time sponsors of the Derby. Yet the American company was recently tempted to move away from Kentucky to Irvine, Calif. Why? Because its business is increasingly detached not just from the American heartland but from America in general. Yum and its brands KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell (based in Irvine), are still powerful, but less because of continued success in the United States than because of stunning growth in China. <br> Indeed, without tens of millions of Chinese buying fried food conjured up by a Kentucky colonel named Harlan Sanders, Louisville might no longer have one of its larger employers, and the Derby itself might be a smaller, sadder affair. Kentucky Fried Chicken is increasingly a Chinese fast-food restaurant chain that happens to be headquartered in Louisville.So raise a julep, and give a toast of thanks to the multitudes of Chinese who are making it all possible. (Recently the new CEO of the company, Greg Creed, announced that after some consideration, the company would keep its global headquarters in Louisville along with its more than 1,000 workers.) <br> The threat of China surpassing the United States as a manufacturing powerhouse has been a theme in American life and politics for more than a decade. <br> Less understood, however, is that this isn’t a one-way street. The story of KFC over the past twenty-five years shows that China has also seen American goods and brands become part and parcel of everyday life in the Middle Kingdom. As China makes its cumbersome uncertain shift away from an economy that rests on the production of low-cost exports, its billion plus consumers are increasingly consuming goods that if not technically made in America are still, at heart, American made. <br> KFC first set up shop in China in the late 1980s at a time when the company’s U.S. operations were starting to founder. Soon enough, with some helpful tweaks to the brand and skilled Taiwanese managers in Mainland China, KFC was outstripping McDonald’s in China and most domestic Chinese competitors, opening up hundreds of new locations a year and showing much greater profitability per store than comparable franchises in the United States. Fried chicken, especially fried chicken associated with capitalism and wealth, became not a cheap meal-on-the-go but an aspirational brand with a high price tag. Eating at KFC in America may have come to signal a need or craving for greasy calories; in China dining at KFC was a sign of making it in the making class. <br> By 2008, on the eve of the global financial crisis, less than 7 percent of KFC outlets were in China but those accounted for 20 percent of the entire global profits of Yum! Brands. Then troubles began, with tainted chicken supplies in China leading to a sharp drop in business. Meanwhile, though Taco Bell held up, Pizza Hut fell far behind Dominos, while Kentucky Fried Chicken in the United States lost even more luster, and saw ailing franchises and mediocre profits. <br> In the past couple of years, however, Yum has resumed its stellar growth in China. There are now 7,000 KFC and Pizza Huts spread across 1,000 cities in China. They account for nearly 35 percent of the company’s global business and that percentage is growing in both absolute and relative terms. Americans tend to focus on China when there is fear: fear of low-cost Chinese goods or fear of China’s regional ambitions in the Pacific. But for the vast Chinese middle class, American represents not just wealth for desirable–and trusted–brands. Even when those brands have safety issues, they are often more trusted to address them than comparable Chinese companies. <br> As the Chinese government works assiduously to build up its domestic market and reduce its dependence on exports and state-sponsored infrastructure products, it has become an ever-more robust and vital market for American companies that are selling goods and services to that emerging world. KFC, Nike, Ford, GM, Coach, Starbucks, Apple, all of those and hundreds more populate Chinese daily life, and shape it intimately. <br> The fact that KFC appeals to Chinese consumers says nothing about whether the food is healthy or whether such consumerism is ultimately a boon. But it does say that the story of us-vs-them, especially notable now during the acrimonious debates over expanded Pacific trade pacts, misses the larger fact that it is us and them, and that the health and future fate of some of the beacons of American capitalism depend on the willingness of Chinese consumers to buy their products. <br> Yum managed to save a flailing American business by plunging into China. So did countless other companies. We might think about that as we celebrate a proud American traditionthis weekend. 
Just what does a federal employee have to do to get fired? <br> At the Environmental Protection Agency, a federal employee who does no work is paid a full salary plus a performance award. This despite having no building pass, no computer connected to the EPA network and no evidence of having completed any work in at least five years. In addition to being paid roughly $600,000 by the American taxpayers during this time period, this employee was allowed to retire with a full pension. <br> In Phoenix, 40 veterans died waiting for lifesaving care. Instead of addressing the urgent health care needs of our nation’s heroes, Veterans Affairs employees spent their time manipulating records to qualify for bonuses. As a result, more than $10 million in performance bonuses were distributed to VA workers. <br> Another EPA employee, who reportedly had been viewing pornography from a government computer, was caught doing just that at the moment investigators entered that person’s office. The high-ranking employee subsequently was found to have had 7,000 pornography files stored on an EPA computer and a history of spending two to six hours a day viewing pornography. Astonishingly, that employee continues working at EPA today as the agency continues its years-long administrative process to fire that person. <br> Given the reluctance of executive branch agencies to hold themselves accountable — and the reluctance of the Justice Department to do it for them, House Oversight investigations are a critical check and balance on executive power. This week, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing to investigate mismanagement at the EPA. Unfortunately, these problems are systemic across many federal agencies. But for the efforts of House investigators to expose abuses, many would never be known except by those willing to pore through thousands of pages of audit reports. As we’ve seen in the case of the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of conservative groups, we can’t count on the IRS or DOJ to prosecute abuses. <br> Investigations alone are not enough. Legislative fixes are needed. Among those being proposed is one by my colleague on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.), who has proposed the Senior Executive Service Accountability Act. This bill would give agencies tools to remove executives for performance issues. Under this law, federal agencies no longer would be required to place employees in a new position earning a full executive salary. This is one sensible reform. <br> Another needed reform is a proposal by fellow committee member Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) that extends the probationary period for federal employees. Extending the period beyond the current one-year mark (which typically expires during training) to include time when an employee is at his or her duty station and under the supervision of a manager, would further ensure that the federal government is hiring qualified and suitable workers. <br> Other reforms are in the works as our committee continues to examine the systemic problems that impact employee morale, hinder success and eliminate accountability. This week’s hearing on EPA mismanagement will delve into some of those concerns. But we are just getting started. <br> We must impose reforms to remove the bureaucratic red tape that is preventing agency managers from removing bad apples and rewarding hard workers. If we are to create a culture of excellence in the federal workforce, we have to be able to penalize poor performance and reward merit. <br> Private-sector companies would never tolerate such egregious personnel issues as those that plague federal agencies. Hamstringing managers with a multiyear termination process while allowing bonuses to be distributed like participation trophies only serves to reward the recalcitrant and incentivize the inept. <br> Successful companies operate efficiently because they are nimble and lean. Our investigative work has revealed that in too many cases, the rules prevent the federal workforce from being either. 
If you start to think of a presidential campaign kickoff as an Apple product launch, well, the column almost writes itself. In both cases, any real suspense about the candidate (let’s call her Hillary) or the new product (let’s call it the Apple Watch) has been vacated by non-stop press coverage, calculated leaks and common sense weeks before the actual announcement finally arrives. <br> Candidates and product launches, therefore, must depend on the artifice of theater to stimulate interest in their offering. Stages must be built, clever lighting must be strung from the rafters, dramatic sight-lines must be chosen, an audience conscripted, the press cultivated and a script written. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton dispensed with the messiness of the real-time, live campaign kickoff by shooting a very slick two-minute-plus commercial for online audiences in which she played only a supporting role. <br> You can imagine Steve Jobs smiling from the hereafter. <br> A Cupertino-staged Apple product hullabaloo can precede the arrival of the product in stores by a month. In the case of Clinton’s launch, she won’t be available in genuine ballot boxes for 10 months. The softness of the launch reflects the fact that the Clinton product is still in beta, with existing bugs to be killed and new features to be added or dropped as circumstances dictate. Like the Apple Watch, the Clinton candidacy must carefully ration its excitement so that the supply-and-demand curves meet at the highest yielding point on the graph. Hence, complaints like those of Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic, about the lack of substance and corporate-quality of the Clinton announcement, misses the point of her launch, much as the gripes after an Apple launch miss the point of an Apple launch. The announcement is for the fanboys and girls! It’s an appetizer, not a meal! It’s the starting point, not the finish line! <br> The point of launches is to put on a good show, to produce pleasing images, convey competence and power and introduce new catchphrases like Clinton’s “Everyday Americans.” “I admired the theatricality of it,” the New York Times quotes CBS CEO (and former actor) Les Moonves in today’s edition. “It made the announcement more important. It was show business.” Moonves wasn’t praising the Clinton launch, he was giving a five-star-review to HBO’s CEO Richard Plepler for his Apple-style presentation of the Apple-friend HBO Now service. <br> The Republican candidates, none of whom have the public profile of Clinton (or Apple!), have been staging their launches more conventionally. Instead of squeezing out videos that are indistinguishable from insurance company ads, they’ve been ballyhooing their candidacies by staging their announcement in big venues, as if they are one-man auto shows, to emphasize the scale of their visions. As the same time, they’re aping Clinton’s example with extended teases about the when and where of their announcements. There is no easier way to boost interest in a candidacy or a product than to play hide-the-announcement with the press and the public. If the pressies who cover Apple couldn’t speculate about the next round of products, what would they have to write about on slow days? Campaign launches and product announcement always seek to quarantine the press so it can be more easily manipulated. <br> Ted Cruz went for the indoor Nuremberg Rally approach, crowding as many of the faithful as possible into Liberty University’s basketball arena to cheer his sermon. Rand Paul wallpapered a Kentucky hotel background with American flags for his announcement last week, while Marco Rubio has conscripted the symbolism of Miami’s Freedom Tower for his. <br> Presidential campaigns reach their theatrical peaks at the national political conventions. Conventions are not staged to announce a candidate—all that business is finished before the convention commences—but to sell the candidate to the voters in a four-day presentation. In a 2012 piece for NPR, Bob Mondello noted the similarities between the conventions and lavish Broadway shows, citing the brighter lighting, on higher platforms. Lesser characters can walk onstage; stars make an entrance, preferably at the top of a staircase with the rest of the cast looking up while the band plays on. Conventions, Mondello continues, are a campaign’s most controlled public space, the one spot where everything can be made to serve the message. <br> Never mind all the political analysis of the campaign kick-off. Look, instead, at how the message binds the candidate to the voters. If it moves them into the candidate’s reality distortion field, to borrow a phrase used at Apple to describe Steve Jobs’ powers of persuasion, it has done its business. <br> Dig those wild campaign logos! Paul and Cruz have burnt flames into theirs, while Clinton has gone completely right-angle corporate. Are logos like gangster graffiti, designed to mark territory and display organizational loyalty?

There is a poison pill inside the Republican Party and if its presidential hopefuls keep swallowing it, they are going to choke off their chances for the White House. <br> The religious right has managed to convince some potential candidates that it is extremely powerful. It has convinced the more gullible ones that they must grovel, kowtow and genuflect before it. <br> This is nonsense. As I have written before, the religious right has not gotten the nominee it has wanted since Ronald Reagan. It is a paper tiger. <br> And by taking the poison pill that the religious right offers, the potential candidates risk alienating the rest of the nation. <br> Witness the events of the past few days: Indiana’s Legislature had passed a “religious freedom” law on March 25. It was signed into law by Indiana’s governor, Mike Pence, the next day. <br> While the actual language of the bill was so dense it read like assembly instructions from IKEA, the purpose was simple: The law would allow businesses to discriminate against homosexuals. <br> The law was necessary, the religious right said, because Christians are an embattled minority in this country and need special protection to practice their religion. <br> In that Christians make up about 80 percent of all Americans, they seem like a pretty “muscular” minority, however, and, in reality, only a tiny number of far right conservatives feel embattled, discriminated against or put upon when it comes to the free practice of their religion. <br> In America today, if you serve the public, you have to serve all the public. <br> You can’t put up a sign at your lunch counter that says “Whites Only” because it is your personal or religious belief that the races should be separate. <br> But if you believe the Bible says homosexuality is a sin, should you be able to refuse service to homosexuals? <br> Eric Miller, a powerful conservative lobbyist in Indiana, backed the “religious freedom” law. “Christian bakers, florists and photographers would now be forced by the government to participate in a homosexual wedding or else they would be punished by the government,” he said. “That’s not right.” <br> And a beaming Miller stood behind Pence as the governor signed the bill into law. <br> Pence had been a congressman from 2003 to 2013. He had very conservative views on homosexuality as well as many other subjects. He returned to Indiana to become governor and get executive leadership as a springboard to the presidency. <br> But Pence failed to appreciate that the almighty dollar was going to be more important to Indiana than the religious right’s view of the Almighty. <br> Indianapolis, the state’s capital and largest city, mockingly used to be called Indian-no-place. Over the years, however, the city very consciously transformed itself into an international sports hub. <br> The NCAA is headquartered in Indianapolis, and it threatened to move future events out of the city because of the new law. It wanted the law changed and changed immediately — which is to say, before the Final Four took place there this past weekend. <br> And the president and chief executive of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce called the law “entirely unnecessary.” <br> All sorts of giant corporations, including Apple, the Gap, Levi Strauss and Subaru, opposed the law. <br> But the one that really hurt was Eli Lilly and Company. <br> Eli Lilly is a $20 billion pharmaceutical behemoth that has been headquartered in Indianapolis since the company was founded in 1876. It employs 11,000 people in the state. And when Eli Lilly is unhappy, Indiana can get downright morose. <br> “Discriminatory legislation is bad for Indiana and for business,” Eli Lilly’s spokesperson said. “That’s one key reason we worked with the Indiana Chamber and other businesses in an attempt to defeat the legislation.” <br> But you know who was just pleased as punch with the new law? Top-tier Republican presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, as well as other potential candidates like Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal and Carly Fiorina. <br> Cruz, the only announced candidate, said Indiana was “giving voice to millions of courageous conservatives across this country who are deeply concerned about the ongoing attacks upon our personal liberties.” <br> At first, Pence was emboldened by such nonsense. He went on ABC’s “This Week” and told George Stephanopoulos: “We’re not going to change the law, OK?” <br> That was Sunday, March 29. <br> By Tuesday, March 31, Pence had learned that hardly anybody in Indiana cared what a bunch of Republican presidential yahoos believed. <br> Hoosiers cared that thousands of people were threatening to boycott their state. Social injustice turns out to be bad for business. And so Pence said he wanted the law changed. Fast. <br> Thursday, April 2, the Legislature changed the law, and Pence signed the new law the same day. <br> “In the midst of this furious debate, I have prayed earnestly for wisdom and compassion,” Pence said. <br> I don’t know if Pence got either, but he did get a kick in the teeth to his presidential hopes. <br> Where did this leave Bush, Cruz, Rubio and the others? Looking craven and foolish, that’s where. <br> No doubt they will get several chances to redeem themselves in the months ahead. <br> But if they are still searching for Bible verses with which to woo the religious right, I suggest they start with: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” <br> And if someone asks them to pop another poison pill, they should just say no. <br> Roger Simon is POLITICO’s chief political columnist. 
Hysteria works. That’s the lesson of the debate, such as it is, over Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. <br> Nothing so captured the spirit of the discussion as an exchange Tuesday on MSNBC’s “The Ed Show.” That is, of course, the eponymous program hosted by Ed Schultz, who is the Edward R. Murrow of poorly informed bombast. For him, “Shut up, he explained,” is a high-toned argument. <br> Schultz proved it when his guest Ryan Anderson of The Heritage Foundation badly overmatched him by saying knowledgeable things about RFRA, and, unable to handle it, the host had Anderson’s mic cut off. Ah, yes, #debate. <br> Rarely has one side had so few facts on its side and gotten such results through sheer repetition of the word “discrimination” and through lurid, fantastical denunciations. <br> Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has been on the run. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has sent an RFRA passed by his state legislature back for amendment. And future Republican governors may conclude, with former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who vetoed an RFRA last year, that preemptive surrender is the best option. <br> As anyone who has been paying attention should know (but most still don’t), the Indiana law says that the state can’t substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion unless there is a compelling governmental interest at stake and it is pursued by the least restrictive means. <br> In this, it is just like RFRAs at the federal level and in other states. Much is made of the fact that the Indiana law arguably goes beyond the federal version by including private suits to which the government is not party — although a number of circuit courts have interpreted the federal law that way, as well. <br> RFRAs aren’t often successfully invoked, but sometimes a religious petitioner — say, a Native American who uses eagle feathers in a ceremony — can prevail against a government regulation. It is possible that RFRA could be used by a baker or florist who objects to providing services to a gay wedding to protect against a fine or a lawsuit, although it hasn’t happened anywhere yet. <br> But let’s not dwell on facts or reality. No one else does. <br> Apple CEO Tim Cook was the pacesetter when it came to ignorant denunciations of the Indiana law. In a Washington Post op-ed, he wrote that the law “would allow people to discriminate against their neighbors.” <br> One wonders what crisis of neighborliness Cook imagines happening in the dystopian world of post-RFRA Indiana: <br> Neighbor #1: “Can I borrow your pruning shears?” <br> Neighbor #2: “No, I don’t like your kind around here. Please see SENATE ENROLLED ACT No. 101, Section 7.” <br> Since Indianapolis is hosting the Final Four, NCAA President Mark Emmert opined, “We are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.” A man of action, he vowed that the NCAA will “work diligently” to see that basketball players at the Final Four are not “negatively impacted by this bill.” <br> I’m going to go out on a limb and say Emmert will succeed, given that it’s impossible to imagine what the potential negative impact might be. Perhaps if two so-called student-athletes playing for the University of Kentucky decide to get married at midcourt and are turned away by the Christian florist they were hoping to provide boutonnieres for the team? <br> Gay former NBA player Jason Collins raised the prospect of suffering discrimination immediately upon setting foot at the Final Four — as if every Uber driver, hotel receptionist, waiter and Lucas Oil Stadium beer vendor is now anxiously awaiting for the opportunity to discriminate on avowed religious grounds against the first very tall, semifamous gay guy they encounter. 
The press scrutinizes every utterance from the House of Clinton, parsing the couple’s words for new or hidden meanings—and for good reason. The two have a devious way with words. Bill Clinton, whose verbal cunning dwarfs that of almost anyone on the public stage, cemented his trickster reputation in 1998 when he claimed he did “not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,” and offered, “It depends on what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is.” In some universe, Bill was on the level in his remarks. Unfortunately for him, it was not this one. <br> So when Hillary Clinton, a veteran crisis manager in her own right, spoke twice about “not saving” her personal emails at her press conference Tuesday instead of picking the more direct and active “deleted,” newsroom ears pricked up, scanning for the lie or the omission or the message manipulation. “Not saving” sounds like the sensible and casual abandonment of something that has lost its value, like the gray water that gushes from your washer during a rinse cycle. “Deleted,” on the other hand, sounds purposeful, almost sinister if you have reason to suspect that the speaker is not being candid with you—and who among us, even her fans, thinks that Hillary Clinton is ever candid? <br> Clinton may have anticipated that if she was stupid enough to use the D-word in her press conference, The Daily Show would have ridiculed her by running the clip in a continuous loop and her political opponents would have spliced it into their attack videos. A confession about deleting rather than not saving emails would have prompted much more vocal accusations that she had shredded “evidence.” Still, using the phrase “not saving” has come with its own costs, inviting the press to tweeze her press conference transcript for new clues of wrongdoing or perfidy. <br> Still, isn’t changing the subject what crisis management is all about? By that measure, Clinton’s press conference must be counted as a minor success. Especially effective—at least in the moment—was the obviously scripted line she used four times, in which she said that, “Looking back,” using two phones and two email accounts would have been wiser. To sympathetic ears, “looking back” sounded like an apology. But it wasn’t, any more than saying, “Looking back, I wish I had purchased Apple stock in March 2000 when it was $5 a share” constitutes an apology to your children now that you’re broke. <br> As crisis managers know, changing the subject can backfire when it moves the discussion to a fresh hot zone. Already, the press has changed its focus from the deleted—I mean, not saved—emails to the security of her private email server. This question, which the press can probably keep aloft for weeks, can’t be finessed away in a future Hillary Clinton press conference because it is largely speculative. Given the Internet’s capacity to remember everything, perhaps server logs detailing who corresponded with Clinton on her private account exist somewhere even if the emails themselves have been destroyed, as Clinton implies. At some point, Clinton will have to volunteer the techs who set up the server to address the security question because if they don’t, the House Select Committee on Benghazi will steal a march and subpoena them. The quest for clues also has the Benghazi committee promising to bring Clinton in for more testimony and demanding the emails of her inner circle at the State Department. <br> If Clinton did succeed in destroying the emails, she will have denied her opponents the pleasure of using them against her. But that act of crisis management has a cost, too. If they don’t exist, Clinton can’t use them to exonerate herself from the charges—real and fanciful—that her foes issue. Some may think that it’s a rotten deal that Clinton has to prove herself innocent rather than her foes having to prove that she’s guilty. But the analogy isn’t perfect. Clinton isn’t a citizen who stands accused of wrongdoing; she’s a former public servant (who expects to be president this time in 2017) who acted as judge and jury in the disposition of her emails. We wouldn’t look the other way if a Richard Nixon acted like this, so we can’t look the other way for Clinton. <br> Having spent four airborne years as secretary of state, Clinton intended to run for president as a cool, decisive, above-it-all diplomat. Instead, she finds herself back on the ground, muddied and bruised, and tangled up in an email kerfuffle that magnifies all of the weaknesses of the House of Clinton. No knockout punch was landed Tuesday, but the match did presage a long campaign in which Clinton is bled and bled again by jabs from the press and the opposition. It’s hard to win if you’re constantly on the defensive. <br> Send your emails about emails to my email address: Shafer.Politico@gmail.com . My Twitter is heavyweight, my email alerts is welterweight, and my RSS feed is strawweight. <br> Correction: An earlier version of this story said Clinton expects to be president this time in 2016. The start date of the next president's tenure would be in 2017. 
We are surrounded by “Buy Now” buttons — small clickable icons on the Internet that prompt us to “buy” this song or that, this book or that. But what most of us don’t know is that we are no more buying those products than we are buying library books. And in many cases, their sellers retain the right to snatch them back from us anytime they like. <br> Not long ago, I participated in a forum sponsored by the Commerce Department and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office about buying online content. You wouldn’t believe the ideas the big media companies were trying to sell: They want us to give up our most basic freedom — to own what we purchase. It may take government to protect that right, although I hope not. <br> From the conversation in that forum, which was convened to discuss the relevance and scope of ownership in the digital environment, we were led to believe that if these content industries had their way, none of us would ever own anything again. We could only “license” books, movies, music — anything, really — on their terms and at their discretion. By not “owning” these items, we would therefore be subject to every corporate whim, rising costs and the business failure of these companies for the rest of our lives. I spoke against this then. I am speaking against it now because many of us don’t know how our rights are being siphoned off — and how much worse it could get. <br> It’s already pretty bad. We all think we purchase MP3s online, download e-books and stream movies. In the intellectual-property circles in which I travel, there has been a great deal of discussion about the realities of ownership of digital goods. With the general public, not so much. <br> We are attracted — and have become accustomed — to the convenience of rapid purchases and on-demand content. When it comes time to move our online MP3 collection or transfer digital content to another device, then we face a surprising reality: We do not really own our electronic music, books and movies in the same way we do when we purchase physical books, CDs, records or DVDs. This disconnect strikes even the most technically savvy consumer, and invariably we realize the true frustration of our state of non-ownership. “Didn’t I click a ‘Buy’ button when I purchased this?” we ask. <br> At the heart of this disconnect is the intersection of copyright law and contract law in the digital consumer space, where consumers’ expectations are nullified by a four-page license agreement from an online music vendor (such as iTunes) to buy a 99-cent song that no one reads. When Amazon, iTunes or any digital retailer explicitly says “Buy Now” and the consumer clicks that “buy” button, there is a definite presumption of purchase, and, with that purchase, ownership. That presumption, however, is not reflected in reality. <br> In fact, clicking a “Buy Now” button means we are entering a contract governing a long-term relationship. Retailers can delete consumer content without warning. Under their setup, we can’t resell music tracks we’ve tired of or give them to a local charity, as you can with used books and records. Sometimes we can’t even transfer it between our own phones, tablets or computers. <br> Some people are in on the secret. Lawyers and media retailers know that we don’t own the e-content we purchase. And they also know that many consumers will not take the time to read a four-page agreement for a 99-cent song. They treat our digital music and e-books like the software industry treats its products, whether we like it or not. Not one consumer has “owned” a copy of MS Word, PowerPoint and other programs on our computers since the 1990s. We are all renters; we simply lease this software. The big media companies don’t want us to own it, which is why they are trying to sue a small company called ReDigi — which believes we should own our digital material — out of existence. 
What the Democrats wouldn’t give to swap this year’s Senate map for the one coming up in 2016. This year’s Senate class, filled with Democratic incumbents in hostile territory, would be difficult to defend any year—it’s especially so when there’s an unpopular Democratic president in the White House. But the next Senate map, coming in 2016, is filled with Democratic targets and Republican vulnerabilities. Simply switch them—leaving all else the same—and the 2014 midterm takes on a completely different character. <br> That’s obviously impossible, but it does get at an essential truth of American politics: For all the plaudits heaped on the winners and derision dumped on the losers after an election, structural factors controlled by neither side dictate the results to a significant degree.Big gains one year lead to big losses another; races won in certain environments would be defeats in others. Due to the mix of seats up for election this year, just 2 million voters across six states—0.6 percent of the U.S. population—could end up deciding the fate of the Senate. <br> What follows is an attempt to illustrate the structure of the current state of American congressional politics through a series of maps, some explaining the Senate, some explaining the House and some explaining where certain key races will be won and lost. <br> 1. 2012 presidential election results <br> In 2012, President Obama won 26 states while Mitt Romney, his Republican rival, took 24. That’s relevant in any discussion of the Senate—this year’s main electoral event—because the upper chamber treats all states the same: Each gets two senators no matter how big or small it is. Based on the presidential results alone, Democrats should currently have a 52-48 edge in the Senate, but they actually have a 55-45 seat majority. This is because, over the past few election cycles, Democratic senators have done a better job than Republicans of winning in states where their presidential candidates lose. <br> 2. Current occupants of U.S. Senate by state <br> Democrats hold 12 seats in states Mitt Romney won: two apiece in Montana and West Virginia, and one each in Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota and South Dakota. Republicans hold nine seats in Obama 2012 states: Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. <br> That Democratic advantage becomes starker when looking only at the heavily Republican states where Democrats currently hold Senate seats—the places where Obama didn’t even get 45 percent of the vote. All but one of the Democratic seats listed above qualify. Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) is the only Democratic senator from a Romney state where Obama surpassed 45 percent. In contrast, there are only two Republicans who represent really blue states, places where Romney got less than 45 percent: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois. <br> In this cycle, Democrats argue they can localize their tough races, focusing on individual elections rather than disseminating a national message. They hope to prompt voters to choose entrenched, resourceful incumbents such as Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana over their respective, likely challengers, Dan Sullivan, Tom Cotton and Bill Cassidy, whom Democrats are relentlessly painting as far-right extremists. <br> It’s true that, for whatever combination of reasons, Democrats have been better at “localizing” than the Republicans. But this time, Republicans aren’t trying to localize—they’re trying to nationalize, making a simple argument to voters: If you don’t like the president and you don’t like the Affordable Care Act, why would you vote for a Democrat? And given President Obama’s middling approval ratings, that approach makes particular sense in the red-state races. <br> 3. The GOP-friendly 2014 Senate map <br> About one-third of the Senate gets elected every two years, and not every Senate “class” is created equal. <br> This year ought to be a good one for the GOP, because Senate Class 2, the most Republican-leaning of the three Senate classes, is up. (The University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball ratings for each race are pictured above.) Over the past four presidential elections, the Democratic presidential nominee has won an average of 51.2 percent of the national two-party presidential vote, while the Republican nominee has taken 48.8 percent. Yet in the Class 2 batch of Senate states, over the same time frame, the Democratic nominee has taken an average of 46.6 percent of the vote. <br> Compare that to 2012’s Senate Class 1, where Democratic presidential nominees won 50.7 percent of the two-party vote the last four elections, and 2010’s Class 3, where they took 48.2 percent. <br> Plus, six of the 11 Democrats from places where Obama won less than 45 percent in 2012 are on the ballot this year, which also happens to be the number of seats Republicans must net to win the Senate. <br> 4. This year’s Senate races on the political map of the United States <br> This map shows the 2014 Senate races in blue and red, with the states sized according to their population and colored based on their current occupant. (The gray states are those with no regular Senate election this year.) <br> Senate Class 2, the one contested this year, is far less representative of the nation as a whole than the two other classes. Its 33 states contain slightly more than half (51.8 percent) of the nation’s population. Class 1 (the 2012 class) also features 33 states, but those states host three-quarters (75.2 percent) of the population; Class 3, coming in 2016 with 34 states, is similar to Class 1, with 72.6 percent of the population. <br> One big reason the 2014 Senate class is so unrepresentative is that California, with its 38 million residents (about an eighth of the country’s population), has no Senate election this year. Neither do New York, Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, respectively the nation’s third, fourth, sixth and seventh biggest states. No Senate election is ever a national election—but this year’s least of all. <br> Republicans, as mentioned, need to net six seats to win the Senate, and there are six Democratic-held seats on this map where Obama got less than 45 percent of the vote in 2012. Let’s assume the GOP nets those six seats, but everything else remains the same, which is a perfectly plausible scenario. Those states—Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia—represent just 3.8 percent of the U.S. population. <br> Of course, the actual number of residents who are eligible to vote, who show up to vote and who cast a ballot for the GOP candidate is an even smaller share. Assuming turnout in line with the most recent midterm, control of the Senate could end up being switched by 2 million Republican voters, or less—just 0.6 percent of the American population. That would hardly be a national mandate, though Republicans would assuredly claim one anyway. <br> 5. This year’s most important county <br> Just kidding. Waukesha County, a big, suburban Milwaukee county in Wisconsin (pictured above), has become an in-joke among political reporters on Twitter during election nights. “It’ll all come down to crucial Waukesha County,” they say, no matter the state or the race. Waukesha is actually an overwhelmingly Republican county that gave two-thirds of its votes to Mitt Romney in 2012. A few years ago, Democrats thought they had won a state Supreme Court seat before the now-notorious county belatedly reported votes that delivered the race to the Republicans. <br> 6. This year’s actual most important county <br> Perhaps the key Senate race in the country is in North Carolina, a Republican-leaning swing state that both sides suspect could decide the Senate majority. <br> Adjust your eyes when looking at the maps above, which feature, on the left, Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan’s victory over Republican Elizabeth Dole in 2008 and, on the right, Republican Sen. Richard Burr’s victory over Democrat Elaine Marshall two years later. In this case, blue is for Republicans, and red is for Democrats. (These maps are from Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections, a first-rate resource for election watchers.) <br> Hagan took slightly more than 54 percent of the two-party vote against Dole in 2008, four points better than Obama performed on the same ballot. Two years later, incumbent Burr performed a bit better than Hagan in his reelection bid, winning 56 percent of the two-party vote. <br> In each of these elections, the winner of the state also won Raleigh’s Wake County. Hagan took the county by 15 points in 2008; Burr won it by a point in 2010. Wake is North Carolina’s second-biggest county, but it consistently casts more votes than the biggest—Mecklenburg, home to Charlotte. <br> Because Florida and Ohio, with their famous, key counties like Hillsborough (Tampa) and Hamilton (Cincinnati), don’t feature Senate races this year, Wake might very well be the key county this year. Hagan needs to win it again, and not just by a few points, which will be a challenge given the significant turnout problems Democrats face in North Carolina midterms. <br> 7. The GOP’s Rocky Mountain climb <br> Part of the reason Republicans don’t currently control the Senate is that they kicked away a highly winnable race in Colorado in 2010 by running a bad candidate, Ken Buck, whom Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) beat by less than two points. (Democrats also credit a sophisticated and pricey get-out-the-vote operation for their victory there.) The results of that race by county are above. Democrats are back to blue, Republicans to red. <br> The Republican nominee this year, Rep. Cory Gardner, is a better candidate than Buck, whom Gardner recently bigfooted out of the race. But Sen. Mark Udall, the Democratic incumbent, is arguably a better candidate than Bennet. Polls here are very close, and if Republicans are to win any Obama-state Senate seats this year, Colorado might be the one (other contenders are Iowa, Michigan and New Hampshire). <br> One key Colorado county to watch is Jefferson, the sliver of light blue just west of Denver and south of Boulder. The last four Senate races in Colorado have all been competitive (Udall’s 10-point win in 2008 was the biggest during that period), and the winner has carried Jefferson County each time. The county and state both backed George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and Obama in 2008 and 2012. <br> Jefferson also has the most active voters of any Colorado county. Gardner was right when he said recently: “As Jefferson County goes, so goes the state.” <br> Jefferson would also be a good choice for most important county in this year’s Senate races instead of the Tar Heel State’s Wake, but North Carolina has a slightly better chance than Colorado of being the Senate’s tipping point. <br> 8. Appalachia: The No-Dems Zone <br> Anyone who has driven on West Virginia’s pristine highways over the past several years (RIP, Sen. Robert Byrd) has seen the pro-coal, “Obama’s NO JOB ZONE” billboards that dot the interstates. The billboards all feature a rough outline of Appalachia, which has become poisonous terrain for Democrats. <br> The federal Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 428 counties and independent cities as Appalachian, stretching from southwestern New York all the way to northern Alabama and Mississippi. West Virginia is the only state that is wholly included in Appalachia. (It’s doubtful that residents of Youngstown, Ohio, really think of themselves as Appalachian, but it helps in getting federal largesse.) <br> More than five dozen House districts contain at least one Appalachian county, and Republicans control all but 10 of them (52 of 62). While redistricting last cycle makes an apples-to-apples comparison impossible, Democrats have lost at least a dozen of these districts over the last two cycles. <br> The GOP is nearly tapped out here, having defeated all the Democrats they can, with the exception of Rep. Nick Rahall, West Virginia’s lone remaining House Democrat—and probably the most endangered Democratic incumbent in the country. <br> A national redistricting disadvantage for Democrats and a tight packing of Democratic voters in urban areas are two reasons Republicans have a firm grip on the House. But another is the tarnished star of the working-class party in the country’s historic working-class region. <br> 9. The Democratic House bunkers <br> Speaking of redistricting, Democrats rightly complain about the Republican gerrymandering that has limited their House opportunities in many states, including several places that twice voted for Obama but are run by Republicans at the state level, such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. <br> But Democrats have also benefited from redistricting in some places. They made their own luck in Illinois, where the Democratic state government drew the map, and they hit the jackpot in California, when a nonpartisan map was drawn in their favor. Democrats netted eight seats in the House from these two states in 2012, which accounted for their entire national net gain that year. More than a quarter of the current House Democratic caucus (50 of 199) hails from just these two states. <br> Politico’s Alex Isenstadt recently reported that Democrats are resigned to be mostly playing defense in the House this cycle, which squares with the expectation from most prognosticators that the Republicans are better positioned to net House seats and thus add to their House majority. After all, the president’s party almost always loses House seats in midterms. So playing to a draw in the House this cycle would be a Democratic win, and that likely requires holding or even adding to their delegations in these two blue states. <br> Democrats are in good shape to take California’s open 31st district and have a chance to beat Rep. Rodney Davis in Illinois’ 13th. Republicans, meanwhile, can credibly target a few Democratic seats in each state, most notably Rep. Scott Peters’ in California’s 52nd and Rep. Brad Schneider’s in Illinois’ 10th. <br> 10. The long game <br> The Senate script shifts in 2016, when the Republicans elected in 2010 will have to stand for reelection during a presidential year. Far-sighted Republicans know that to maintain a durable Senate majority, they’ll have to pad their numbers this year because they could lose at least a few seats in 2016. The map above shows the seats coming up next time, along with their current occupants. <br> Of the nine Senate Republicans who represent states Obama took in 2012, seven will be on the ballot in 2016. Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin will likely start the cycle with their odds of winning reelection no better than 50/50. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa could easily get another term if he wanted it, but he’ll be 83 on Election Day 2016 and might retire, triggering a highly competitive race. Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Rob Portman of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida will probably start as favorites by a small margin, assuming they run for reelection. Additionally, Democrats could credibly target seats in less conservative red states—places like Arizona, Georgia, Indiana and North Carolina—particularly if some incumbents, such as the 77-year-old John McCain, retire. <br> The only viable Republican targets on this map are Colorado and Nevada, two places where poor GOP primary choices snatched defeat from the jaws of victory four years ago. <br> Given that the 2015-2016 Congress is going to be full of posturing in advance of the presidential election—churning out an ill-fitting jumble of culture war manifestos and tissue-paper budgets that have no hope of becoming law—each side should look at 2014 as a bridge to the next main event in 2016, when both should have at least some chance of emerging with a unified government. <br> So here’s some advice to those waiting for action on major national issues: Just wait until after the next election. The next presidential election, that is. <br> Correction: An earlier version of map 2 incorrectly identified New Hampshire as having two Democratic senators. New Hampshire has one Republican and one Democratic senator. 
Wonders never cease: I agree with Phyllis Schlafly. Reading the arch-conservative lawyer’s controversial, much discussed April column in the Christian Post made me nearly drop my coffee when this jumped out from the page: “Women with children earn less…” <br> Finally someone said it. <br> The elephant in the room—that American moms experience intense wage discrimination—was front and center in Schlafly’s article. (“Elephant” because 81 percent of women in the United States have children by the time they are 44 years old, so this is a problem that affects most of us.) <br> Never would I have imagined it would be an anti-feminist icon like Schlafly speaking truth to power, any kind of truth, even accidentally, about unequal pay. <br> Unfortunately and predictably, Schlafly is quick to blame moms for their own wage discrimination, saying their “choices contribute to the pay gap.” Still: At least she admits the pay gap is real. Let’s take a moment to recognize that bit of progress. <br> Now here’s a stunner: Maternal status, i.e. being a mom, is a greater predictor of wage and hiring discrimination than gender. However, Schlafly’s erroneous claim that the wage discrimination that women—and particularly moms—face is somehow their fault is just plain wrong. <br> And Schlafly is only one of many recent examples of this blame game. Another is just how widely Claire Shipman and Katty Kay’s April article in The Atlantic, “The Confidence Gap,” has been used—whether Shipman and Kay intended it or not—to argue that women’s lack of confidence is responsible for gender barriers in the workforce. One recent Forbes article put the blame squarely on women’s shoulders for not reaching top management positions, saying, “Women, we aren’t taking action often enough and that’s crucial. We don’t have to be perfect. Men are confident about their ability at 60%.” <br> This, of course, blames the victim again, but let’s start with the facts that bust these myths: Studies using equal resumes and job experiences found that moms were hired 80 percent less of the time than women without children and were offered starting salaries that were $11,000 lower than those given to non-moms. Dads with equal resumes were offered $6,000 more than non-dads. <br> Wage differences within the same occupation make up most of the pay gap between men and women, another recent study found. Claudia Goldin, a labor economist at Harvard University, calculated that after controlling for age, race, hours and education, women who are doctors and surgeons, for example, earn 71 percent of men’s wages; women who are financial specialists make 66 percent of what male financial specialists earn. <br> What we’re seeing is flat-out discrimination, not a result of women’s lack of confidence or bad choices—and it’s certainly not a reflection of men being “more motivated by money” than women, as New Hampshire State Rep. Will Infantine (R) said last week in a House speech as he argued against the New Hampshire Paycheck Equality Act. <br> Wage discrimination is real, and it particularly affects moms and women of color. <br> More facts: Women without children make 90 cents to a man’s dollar, moms make 73 cents, single moms make about 60 cents and women of color make as low as 54 cents. On average, women working full-time, year-round, earn 77 cents to every dollar that men earn. <br> Yet Schlafly wrote, in a line that rightfully caused outrage: “The pay gap between men and women is not all bad because it helps to promote and sustain marriages.” <br> That’s one of the worst excuses for unfair pay yet. 
KABUL —In the minds of most Americans—and perhaps most members of Congress, too—the war in Afghanistan is already long since lost. Spasms of violence like Thursday’s attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul, a popular haunt for Western expatriates, only seem to underscore the country’s ongoing fragility after more than 12 years of frustrating, grinding conflict. And periodic anti-American eruptions from Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan’s often difficult president, have made it harder still to persuade the U.S. public that things here are better than they seem from afar. <br> The bottom line is this: There are some areas of particular concern in Afghanistan—no question. I’ve just spent a week there, on a trip sponsored by the U.S. military, after many previous such trips in the past, and it’s still very much a land at war. But the overall military picture is fairly good. Afghan forces now constitute 85 percent of all coalition forces, lead 95 percent of all operations and take more than 95 percent of all coalition casualties, according to U.S. and NATO figures—yet the enemy is not gaining momentum. And as Afghans prepare to go to the polls to elect Karzai’s successor in coming weeks, and as a new fighting season begins, with NATO forces two-thirds of the way through their drawdown, Afghanistan is doing far better than most critics imagine. A clockwise sweep of the country, starting with Kabul in the country’s central/eastern region, shows why. <br> Kabul: The Afghan capital, far and away its largest city, is safer than ever by most measures. Of course, not all is well. In addition to the Serena attack, a popular Lebanese restaurant was bombed this past winter and many expatriates killed; a Norwegian journalist was recently murdered in cold blood on a street by a fringe insurgent group. But for the local population, the danger posed by insurgents is not the major worry in their lives. Traffic is teeming; the city has never been barricaded the way Baghdad was; violence rates are down by roughly half over the last couple years. Most “spectacular” attacks that grab international media attention amount to a few insurgents firing a rocket-propelled grenade someplace or brutally murdering a few innocents before getting themselves killed by Afghan forces—as just happened at the Serena. These can be tragic, to be sure, but fears that the Taliban would be storming Kabul’s gates have proven overblown. <br> Jalalabad and the northeast: Going east from Kabul toward Peshawar, Pakistan, via the famous Khyber Pass, the situation is mixed. There were positive developments during the U.S.-led surge but criminality and some degree of Taliban activity have picked up a bit of late. In the mountainous zones of Kunar and Nuristan, small terrorist redoubts persist (though with no more than a few dozen estimated al Qaeda core fighters). This area bears watching over the 2014 military campaign, as the modestly negative trend line of 2013 will need to be checked, given the importance of Jalalabad and the main road to the nation’s economy. <br> Khost and the southeast: This area is holding fairly steady. It is still violent, still plagued by the operations of the Haqqani network operating from bases just across the border in the mountainous tribal areas of Pakistan. Khost and its surroundings have never been cleared of insurgents as thoroughly as parts of the south have been, due to a smaller density of coalition forces during the surge of 2010-2012. But Afghan forces have built up layered defenses from Khost toward Kabul, and the ring road going from Kabul to Kandahar through this region as well as the major regional road to Khost are generally usable. 
Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has won his epic battle with the state’s Republican Party chairman, A.J. Spiker, who announced his resignation over the weekend after months of open warfare between the moderate GOP governor and Spiker’s legions of Rand Paul supporters. <br> Spiker, a staunch libertarian, took over the party amid the fervor of the 2012 campaign, and since then, he’s clashed repeatedly with the state’s GOP establishment over Iowa’s famous straw poll and general management of party affairs. Now, the center-right is back in charge. <br> We’ve seen this sort of thing in both parties in Iowa before: The caucus process energizes the true believers and the activists who turn out in droves at caucuses and county conventions. More moderate, centrist elements figure they have better things to do than sit through endless debates on platform resolutions and stay away. The zealots win these races for party positions and delegates. <br> But then activists, like a dog chasing a car, face the problem of what to when they catch it. If they can’t convert that energy into campaign money, organization and consensus-building management, they lose support from more traditional elements in the party — and centrist voters (essential in a closely fought state like Iowa). <br> A good example of that is what happened to the Iowa Democratic Party after George McGovern’s showing in 1972. The party took a beating in the November election. <br> In this case, some Republicans have problems with the activists being too extreme on issues. This can turn off centrist voters in general elections and, in a state like Iowa — which is routinely one of the closest states in a presidential election and in party registrations — that can cost Republicans in general election. (It’s not lost on Iowa Republicans what happened to Indiana Republicans and Missouri Republicans in recent U.S. Senate races, where far-right primary challengers committed hugely embarrassing gaffes. <br> The second problem is simple political organizing and management. It’s pretty boring stuff, running party machinery, but when people can’t get that job done, well, the car sometimes runs over them. In this case, the insurgents just didn’t look very good at it. <br> Things got so bad that Branstad and his fellow centrist Republicans had to step in and fix things, putting supporters in local party organizations in a bid to raise more money, recruit electable candidates and hone the get-out-the-vote operation. There was probably also a little test of manhood going on here about who was running the show — top elected Republicans or the newbies. So the establishment is reclaiming the machinery. That’s happening in other places too, where Republicans aren’t keen about being Akinized again. 
As presidential primary debates go, the January 2008 MSNBC showdown between Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards was standard fare: sharp exchanges on nuclear policy, a call for cleaner campaigns and the inevitable question about the candidates' own strengths and weaknesses. <br> This is the part of the debate where the moderator asks each candidate to describe their best and worst traits. There are many right answers on the subject of one's strengths but only one correct answer to the weakness question. “Well, Tim, gosh darn it, it embarrasses me to admit here in front of a crowded room like this that sometimes I’m impatient and probably obsess a little too much about getting things just right! <br> Clinton listed her strength as a “passionate commitment to this country and what it stands for.” Her weakness? “I am impatient.” She said that she gets concerned sometimes about “pushing further and faster than perhaps people are ready to go.” <br> Obama told viewers that his greatest strength was an ability “to bring people together from different perspectives to recognize what they have in common and to move people in a different direction. Obama surprised many long-time debate watchers when addressing his greatest weakness – by telling the truth. <br> The then-Illinois senator walked himself into this unique position because of an editorial board interview with the Reno Gazette-Journal the day before where he said, “I don’t think there is anybody in this race who can inspire the American people better than I can. And I don’t think there is anybody in this race who can bridge differences ... better than I can. But I’m not an operating officer. Some in this debate around experience seem to think the job of the president is to go in and run some bureaucracy. Well, that’s not my job. My job is to set a vision of ‘here’s where the bureaucracy needs to go.’” <br> The late, great Tim Russert asked the right question as usual and pushed Obama to elaborate on his statement – “Do the American people want someone in the Oval Office who is an operating officer?” <br> “Well, I think what I was describing was how I view the presidency. Now, being president is not making sure that schedules are being run properly or the paperwork is being shuffled effectively, Obama answered. It involves having a vision for where the country needs to go. It involves having the capacity to bring together the best people and being able to spark the kind of debate about how we're going to solve health care; how we're going to solve energy; how we are going to deliver good jobs and good wages ... and then being able to mobilize and inspire the American people to get behind that agenda for change. <br> Six years later, Washington and the world has learned that simply having a vision for the future is worthless if there is not a president in the White House who knows how to run the place like that operating officer Candidate Obama had so little use for in 2008. <br> The idea that a county store, let alone the most powerful country in the world, can survive on little more than a hope for change and a gauzy vision of the future is preposterous. The fact that Republicans were such a dysfunctional party that they lost two successive elections to such a flimsy promise is depressing. What is even more depressing is the fact that six years in, the president still has no idea how to become that operating officer who can turn grand visions into concrete actions. <br> The greatest American visionary over the past quarter century figured out early in his business career that ideas that could not be implemented would never change the world. <br> Steve Jobs once spoke of the very serious disease that overtook Apple when John Scully ran the company. Jobs called it the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the work. And if you just tell all these other people 'here’s this great idea,' then, of course, they can go off and make it happen. <br> The Apple founder explained that such a mindset ignores the tremendous amount of craftsmanship that takes place between the emergence of a great idea and the creation of a great product. And as you evolve that great idea, it changes and grows. It never comes out like it starts because you learn a lot more as you get into the subtleties of it. And you also find there are tremendous tradeoffs that you have to make. There are just certain things you can’t make electrons do. There are certain things you can’t make plastic do. Or glass do. Or factories do. Or robots do. <br> There are also certain things you can't make Washington do. But Obama has yet to figure out how to make those tremendous tradeoffs that Jobs said all great leaders have to make. As one Obama aide told me, the greatest frustration in working for the man is the fact that he comes up with a position and then waits for Washington to come to him. He still hasn't figured out that it just doesn't work that way. 
President Obama has a problem: One day he’s talking about economic inequality, the next day school reform, or immigration reform, or something else entirely. At a time when the political system is so gridlocked, it seems crazy to flit from issue to issue in this way—and it’s no way to run a parade, either. <br> This presidential attention deficit disorder is bad politics because it’s bound to result in disappointment: There’s no way Obama, or his chief of staff Denis McDonough, for that matter, can juggle all of these priorities successfully. And if you look at his poll numbers, it seems the American people think so too. <br> I’m not trying to make a partisan point here. This is a problem I see routinely with the leaders I advise in Silicon Valley. It is a problem many of us feel on a daily basis, whether we’re the high-flying CEO of a Fortune 500 company or just a regular working stiff trying to make ends meet. So here are my suggestions for how Obama can stop sweating the distractions and start focusing on what’s most essential. <br> First, ask, “If we only get one thing done in 2014, what should it be?” In Obama’s reelection video, “ The Road We’ve Travelled,” his team sought to put his first term in the most positive light possible, in the same spirit as Bill Clinton’s “A Man from Hope” or Ronald Reagan’s “It’s Morning in America.” In it, Obama’s former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, recalls asking Obama which of all of the problems they should take on and Obama said, “All of them!” Emanuel saw this as an evidence of inspiring leadership. Me, not so much. When leaders believe they can take on every problem, they are ignoring the ruthless reality of tradeoffs. Not even the most powerful person in the world can escape this principle: When you try to make everything a priority, nothing will be. <br> As I write in my new book, Essentialism, the word priority came into the English language in the 1400s. It was singular. It meant the very first or prior thing. It stayed singular for the next 500 years. Only in the 1900s did we pluralize the term and start talking about priorities. Illogically, we reasoned that by changing the word we could bend reality. Somehow we would now be able to have multiple “first” things. People—and presidents—routinely try to do just that. One leader told me of his experience where the chief executive often talked of “Pri-1, Pri-2, Pri-3, Pri-4, and Pri-5.” <br> I am not suggesting for one moment that this is easy. To define the priority is hard. It takes debate, disagreement and really tough conversations—and that’s just within a leader’s inner circle. Still, it goes to the very essence of leadership. Obama needs to debate and answer this question, “If we only get one thing done in 2014, what should it be?” <br> I won’t presume to tell him which of the many competing agenda items, from jobs to health care to immigration, he should pick. But he has to pick one and stick with it. That’s how the most effective leaders get things done. <br> Second, ask, “What important initiatives should we say no to in 2014?” Identifying the priority is necessary but not sufficient. Talk is cheap when it comes to prioritization. The test comes when a leader decides what to say no to. <br> Indeed, the Latin root of the word decision— cis or cid—literally means “to cut” or “to kill.” You can see this in words like scissors, homicide or fratricide. Leaders often think a decision means saying yes to something, but the core of the idea is what we’re willing to reject. As I wrote here, Steve Jobs, the late Apple founder, said in an interview with Fortune’s Betsy Morris in 2008, “People think focus means saying ‘yes’ to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying ‘no’ to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things we have done.” 
When he is sworn into office on Jan. 1, Bill de Blasio, who won last fall’s election promising to shrink New York City’s income inequality gap, will enter into a long tradition of progressive NYC mayors reaching back more than a century to Seth Low, Fiorello La Guardia and John Lindsay. The spiritual forefather of all of them, however, is a man who never held the office: Theodore Roosevelt. <br> Despite Roosevelt’s cowboy image, the 26th U.S. president was born and raised in Manhattan and got his start in New York City politics, where he first tested elements of the reform agenda that would define much of his political career. Roosevelt and de Blasio might be from two different moments in history and two different political parties, but they share a commitment to progressive policies—including attention to housing and policing—and a similar set of economic circumstances afflicting New Yorkers. As de Blasio takes office, now is the perfect time to reexamine Roosevelt’s history in the Big Apple and the policies he backed to uplift the poor and victimized. De Blasio has evinced similar aspirations for New York; the question is how he can learn from Roosevelt’s successes. <br> There’s no doubt Roosevelt’s legacy in New York, where he spent three decades of his career pursuing reforms, is a progressive one. Although he ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1886 and then turned down the Republican nomination for the office in 1894, Roosevelt served for three years in New York’s state legislature, where he wrote laws investigating and governing graft and corruption in New York City. Even later in his career—as member of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, governor of New York and, finally, president—he continued to promote progressive policies in the city of his birth. <br> When it comes to housing, from his time in the New York Assembly until his governorship, Roosevelt backed bills banning hazardous cigar making in tenements and transferring tenement reform from the hands of landlords and builders to the government. The result of the latter was the landmark New York State Tenement Housing Act of 1901, one of the first laws requiring new buildings to have outward-facing windows in every room, as well as indoor toilets and fire safeguards. In Roosevelt’s time, corruption was also rampant in the New York Police Department, with officers organizing widespread protection rackets that netted tens of thousands of dollars. When he became president of the New York City Board of Police Commissioners in the mid-1890s, Roosevelt began to clean house, forcing the chief of police and other corrupt officers to resign, ensuring that police enforce the law fairly and instituting both firearm training and midnight inspection tours to make sure officers were on duty. <br> De Blasio has demonstrated a similar belief in housing equity and fair policing. In the 1990s, while he was President Bill Clinton’s regional director for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, he increased federal funding for affordable homes and expanded housing services for senior citizens. And as New York City’s public advocate, he created a “Worst Landlords Watch List” in 2012 as a way of pressuring hundreds of landlords to address problems from lead paint to rodent infestations. While de Blasio does not face the same herculean task Roosevelt did in reforming the NYPD, a centerpiece of his mayoral campaign was ending the “overuse and abuse” of stop-and-frisk—a tactic of stopping people on the street for questioning or searches—especially given that a study he commissioned as public advocate strongly suggested the policy amounts to racial profiling. <br> Roosevelt’s New York and de Blasio’s face similar economic challenges, too. In his campaign, De Blasio highlighted the “tale of two cities” effect in what some have called New York’s “Second Gilded Age,” with the top 5 percent of earners in the city making nearly 50 times as much as the bottom 20 percent. In the original Gilded Age of Roosevelt’s time, when the top 1 percent of families in the country owned more than half of the nation’s wealth, he noted in his 1891 history of New York City that “as colossal fortunes grow up on the one hand”—think the Astors, Morgans and Waldorfs—“there grows up on the other a large tenement-house population, partly-composed of wage-earners who never save anything, and partly of those who never earn quite enough to give their families even the necessities of life.” No contemporary advocate of New York’s poor and middle classes could put it better. <br> But if de Blasio is to bridge the divide between the “two” New Yorks today, he should take a cue from not just Roosevelt’s progressive principles but also his shrewd politicking, which in the end was what made for his policy successes. For one thing, the new mayor must avoid self-righteousness and be willing to work with political opponents. Liberal or progressive groups in New York—from the Citizens’ Union of Roosevelt’s time, which backed reformers for political office, to today’s New York Communities for Change, a coalition working for social and economic justice—have tended to adopt a shrill tone of moral superiority that played poorly to a wide audience. But Roosevelt was willing to compromise and build alliances beyond his base, including with the New York Republican political machine, which controlled everything from nominations to legislation. Even when he targeted trusts as president, Roosevelt didn’t wage war on American big business. “The captains of industry,” he said in a 1901 address to Congress, “have on the whole done a great good to our people.” Praising your opponents before hauling them before the Supreme Court was classic Roosevelt. 
When former U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr. of Virginia died in “Courtfield,” his hilltop mansion in Winchester, Va., last January, a dynasty went with him. <br> Byrd, 98, was a charter member of the FFVs (First Families of Virginia), which in his case was a clan dating back to William Byrd II, who was born in Virginia in 1674, accumulated 180,000 acres and founded the city of Richmond. The senator’s ancestors traced their lineage to Pocahontas and Chief Justice John Marshall, as well as a host of famous Byrds, among them Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr., the North Pole explorer. (The Virginia Byrds were not related to the late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd.) <br> In the 20 th century the Byrd brand became best known as conservative segregationists who practically invented Virginia’s infamous Massive Resistance to school integration. Byrd’s father and beneficiary, Harry Flood Byrd Sr., was its architect, and “Young Harry,” by which junior was known much of his life, did his part as a member of the Virginia state Senate in the 1950s, helping pass a group of laws, later ruled unconstitutional, designed to deprive African-Americans of full citizenship. <br> After holding his father’s seat in the state Senate for 18 years, “Young Harry” graduated to the U.S. Senate seat in 1965 when his father retired in ill health. Then-Gov. Albertis Harrison Jr., a loyal lieutenant in the Byrd Organization—don’t call it a “machine” like those in New York and Chicago—appointed him to fill the vacancy. <br> Byrd went on to win a special election and then two full terms. The second time Republicans didn’t bother to field a nominee, and he easily defeated a liberal Democrat, becoming the first independent to be elected and reelected to a Senate seat. <br> The Byrds were archetypal Southern Democrats, more like today’s Southern Republicans—conservative on social and fiscal issues. Senator Byrd Jr. quit the Democratic Party in 1970, refusing to sign a loyalty oath as the party was swinging left. It proved to be a wise political decision as a changing, growing Virginia electorate, including large numbers of blacks, was moderating its views, just as Byrd announced in 1972 that he would run as an independent. <br> Although he voted overwhelmingly with the Republicans, Byrd still caucused with the Democrats, who rewarded him by retaining his seniority on two major committees, Armed Services and Finance. Even so, he took little advantage of his power, seldom attending committee hearings. But he was diligent in voting on the floor, casting 6,270 votes—96 percent of roll calls—by his retirement in 1982. <br> He was so opposed to federal spending, except for the military, that, like his father, he authored virtually no legislation during his time in Washington. He once explained, “We have too many bills, too much legislation that we just don’t need.” He practiced what he preached, refusing some pay raises and returning funds for his office to the Treasury. One of his few forays into legislating, requiring a balanced federal budget, was adopted but never implemented. Because of their single-mindedness about federal spending, both father and son were largely ignored by colleagues on both sides of the aisle during the half-century they served in Washington. 
Talk about access. As a budding reporter for the Christian Science Monitor, Godfrey Sperling Jr. spent an entire day in 1959 with John F. Kennedy, sitting next to him on his private plane as he darted around the Midwest, preparing to run for president. Sperling interviewed Harry Truman in Independence, Mo., after Truman left the White House. There was also a post-White House visit with Ike Eisenhower at his home in Gettysburg, Penn. And in 1966, Sperling rode in the back seat of Ron and Nancy Reagan’s Chevrolet in California as Reagan was weighing a run for governor. <br> But Sperling, who died in September, two weeks short of his 98th birthday, will not be remembered for those journalistic coups. He will be remembered for hosting 3,241 breakfasts, at which Washington reporters would courteously probe politicians for news. The breakfasts, usually held at what is now the St. Regis Hotel, not far from the White House, began in 1966 and ran nearly four decades. <br> I was at Sperling’s last breakfast on Dec. 21, 2001. The guest was Tom Daschle, then Senate majority leader, but Sperling was the real newsmaker. Reporting for the New York Times, I knew the event was already a throwback, but looking back today, that last breakfast seems to belong to a more bygone era even than I could have imagined. <br> Sperling (whom everyone called “Budge,” a childhood nickname) and his breakfasts represented a more civil and unhurried period of Washington journalism that seems unfathomable in this age of tweets, in-the-moment analysis and unyielding news cycles. Much of it was probably for show, but reporters and pols behaved at those breakfasts as if they actually respected each other. And assembling everyone in a hotel banquet room was no easy feat, especially after the national traumas of the Vietnam War and Watergate, which severely tested relationships between the media and politicians. <br> Part of Sperling’s success was that, in contrast to so many of the partisan bloviators of today who call themselves journalists, he was fervently nonpartisan. He grew up in Urbana, Ill., and was not a man of artifice or snooty intellect. Rather than soundbites, he was in search of, dare I say, thoughtful conversation. <br> When I first started attending Sperling’s breakfasts, in the late 1980s, I felt like I was being given entry to a private club (a men’s club, in those days). At what then seemed the ungodly hour of 8 a.m. (there were no Mike Allens to get the online conversation started before dawn), reporters would assemble around the guest, notebooks and tape recorders in hand. Of course, there was no one texting or tweeting. No cell phones. A reporter sitting still for an hour? No distractions? Hard to fathom these days. <br> The first questions, always friendly and often rambling, would be asked by Sperling, whom the writer Nora Ephron once described as “a pleasant, fussy man who looks like Elmer Fudd and indeed occasionally gives the impression of being thoroughly befuddled.” <br> Sperling was not known for the prose in his columns; indeed, most of us never even read the Monitor. But he knew how to draw a quorum of the big honcho journalists of the day: David Broder, Peter Lisagor, Phil Potter, Jack Germond, Robert Novak, Hedrick Smith, Andy Glass and Jules Witcover were among the regulars over the years who would consume heaps of eggs and bacon and sausage. (Fruit was introduced in later years.) The breakfasts were probably most beneficial for those regional reporters in the capital who would not otherwise have access to big-name political figures. Another frequent attendee was Alan Emory, who ran the one-man bureau of the Watertown, N.Y., Daily Times from 1951 to 2000. (Thankfully, that’s one local paper that still exists, though it has shuttered its D.C. bureau.) <br> There were rules: Photographers were forbidden. Television journalists were forbidden. Wire service reporters were forbidden. The sessions were on the record, and while you weren’t supposed to say “Sperling breakfast” in your story, you could quote a politician speaking at “a breakfast with reporters.” <br> Stories didn’t “go viral” in those days, but on occasion the breakfasts did make news. Big news. Not necessarily because of pointed and probing questions from Sperling, but because he fostered an environment where politicians were relaxed enough to sometimes speak more truthfully than they intended. 
When a former hard-hitting news anchor’s daytime talk show suffers dangerously slipping ratings, what’s the next step? If it’s Katie Couric, the answer is to trade a history of responsible reporting for irresponsible scaremongering. In her segment last week on the HPV vaccine, Couric delivered a blow to both public health and her image. The question now is what Couric– if she’s willing –can do to repair the damage. <br> It’s a sad turn of events for Couric, once known for drawing attention to public health issues such as colon cancer, which killed her husband. The former CBS anchor, soon headed for Yahoo! News, is now scaring the public away from a vaccine that actually prevents other kinds of cancer. <br> Last Wednesday’s segment focused on Gardasil, a vaccine licensed by the FDA to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), the sexually transmitted infection responsible for 26,000 cases of cervical, oral, penile and anal cancers a year. Almost a decade of data, covering 50 million administrated doses, supports the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness. The handful of reports of serious events happening after vaccination (including death and severe disability) have been investigated and determined to be unrelated to the vaccine. But you wouldn’t think as much if you watched the show. <br> Couric unwittingly captured the core problem with her episode when she prefaced a question to a guest with this gem: “We’ve obviously heard two different sides about the HPV vaccine, and I think for parents watching, it’s probably still rather confusing when you hear these heartbreaking stories that these families have endured.” The irony lay in the fact that Couric herself exacerbated the confusion, abdicating her responsibility as a journalist to present the facts about the vaccine unambiguously to her audience. <br> On one hand, the episode may be precisely what “ Katie insiders” had in mind when they complained in the Hollywood Reporter back in October that she had “refused to shape shows with softer features to appeal to daytime’s key 25-to-54-year-old female demo, insisting instead on the kind of harder-edged interviews she enjoyed on Today and her stint as anchor of CBS Evening News.” Indeed, the show boasted Oprah-worthy heartbreaking stories of girls who were supposedly killed or seriously injured by the vaccine. And Couric certainly went softer, leaving her guests’ dubious claims unchallenged. <br> On the other hand, Couric may have irreparably damaged her image along with the harm she visited on public health. Time’s Alexandra Sifferlin asked if Couric would become the next Jenny McCarthy, famous for promoting pseudoscientific anti-vaccine views. Multiple Forbes columnists, Slate writers, Salon and others slammed the episode, cataloguing its inaccuracies and correcting its misinformation. <br> Yet the show’s response to the backlash–claiming to present “the facts supporting the potential of the vaccine” and a desire “to share multiple viewpoints”—offered no apologies. Now Couric confronts a crossroads of sorts: Does she take the path from respected journalist to sensationalistic tabloid star? Or does she step back and salvage her reputation? <br> It helps to understand what sins Couric committed in an episode offering an almost textbook example of false balance, the practice of presenting “both sides” of an issue as though they have equally valid evidence when, in fact, one has a clearly established evidence base that the other lacks. (Think of inviting 9/11 Truthers to join a show featuring 9/11 victims’ family members.) Media coverage of vaccines has a particularly sordid history of false balance already, but Couric tipped the scale toward the “side” without evidence, letting emotion outweigh facts. <br> One guest tearfully told of her daughter’s death, which the mother blamed on the vaccine. Then a mother-daughter couple (founders of an anti-vaccine website) told their harrowing journey supposedly caused by the vaccine. After assigning a “controversy” where none existed with the episode title, “The HPV Controversy,” Couric drummed up more fear with the subtitles: “Was the HPV Vaccine Responsible for One Girl’s Death?” and “Is the HPV Vaccine Safe?” As Michael Hiltzik noted at the LA Times, “Merely to ask the questions is to validate them.” <br> In the segment, Couric did not demand evidence to show the vaccine actually caused the problems (and no evidence to date substantiates the possibility), and the mothers offered only vague assertions. Not that Couric seemed to mind: It’s been long established that emotional anecdotes trump facts and figures in the human mind—a trick of our amygdalae that can skew the risk-benefit calculus we make about issues such as vaccines. 
President Barack Obama has gamely acknowledged that the HealthCare.gov disaster is “on me,” and surely this is one of the more accurate assertions he’s made related to his signature health care program. <br> But no president could have pulled off HealthCare.gov alone. After all, as he put it, “I don’t write code.” It truly takes a team effort to come up with something so impressively catastrophic. <br> Indeed, this serving of Pasta Fiasco was whipped up by a cadre of chefs, toiling together in spectacular incompetence, each doing their part to create one of the greatest flops in modern political history. <br> Each should be marched right out of the kitchen with alacrity. But Obama, who once said during another crisis — the 2010 Gulf oil spill — that he was searching for an “ass to kick,” hasn’t really found one this time. <br> And yet, with respect to the creation of HealthCare.gov, there’s really no shortage of asses. Herewith, as a service to our flummoxed commander in chief, 10 candidates for the chopping block. <br> 1. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough <br> This goes without saying — and actually, that’s the only reason I can think of that no one’s saying it. <br> Obama claims he didn’t know how badly the website would perform. And yet, given that it had failed rudimentary tests and wasn’t even close to being ready, people in the administration had to know. <br> It is the White House chief of staff’s responsibility to ensure the right documents and people are getting before the president — to establish a smooth process by which the president gets the information he needs. <br> Obamacare is the ballgame when it comes to the Obama presidency. Ensuring it was up and running right should have been McDonough’s can’t-fail mission. According to a June 20 article in Time magazine, McDonough was supposedly spending “two hours a day” on Obamacare implementation. If that’s so, it’s inexcusable that he somehow missed that the website was months from being ready — even with the current “24/7” fix-it drive — at launch time. <br> If Obama requires any further reason to cashier McDonough, he need only survey the wreckage of his second-term agenda and his cratering approval ratings. <br> 2. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius <br> Sebelius needs to be hustled out the door without delay, and everyone in town knows it. <br> The White House has defended her, pointing to her earlier achievements. This is approximately like noting the sublime performances of the actor John Wilkes Booth. <br> Only in government would someone in a leadership position be permitted to claim they did some other good stuff after supervising an unmitigated disaster that might bring down the whole operation. One hopes Obama is only keeping her on temporarily because she knows something about how to clean up the mess. <br> 3. Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services Director Marilyn Tavenner <br> CMS is the agency within HHS that was responsible for developing the website. In the months before the rollout, Tavenner suggested in testimony to Congress that testing of the website was on track. She is the one who signed off on the website she was overseeing. <br> “I want to apologize to you that the website is not working as well as it should,” Tavenner told the Ways and Means Committee last month. “I’m in charge of the program,” she said. <br> Enough said. Get out. <br> 4. CMS Deputy Chief Information Officer Henry Chao <br> Chao, deeply knowledgeable about the website, fretted for months about how it would perform. But he suggested to Congress things would run smoothly. <br> In March, he wisecracked at an insurance industry forum, “Let’s just make sure it’s not a Third World experience.” <br> In a July 16, 2013, email, Chao expressed concerns about the launch, writing that he needed “to feel more confident they are not going to crash the plane at take-off.” <br> The very next day, he testified before Congress that HealthCare.gov would be ready to launch on time. <br> In late September, Chao also signed off on a memo to Tavenner saying there were no significant security risks with the website. He recently claimed he was not included on a memo from CMS Chief Information Officer Tony Trenkle warning that such security risks existed. <br> Bye-bye. <br> 5. CMS Chief Information Officer Tony Trenkle <br> Actually, Trenkle resigned and left CMS Friday to join the private sector, according to CMS. But he should have been fired instead of being allowed to quietly seek greener pastures, having supervised the dropping of fertilizer all over this one. <br> Trenkle’s memo on security risks shows he knew of such issues before the website launched. What he did about it is unclear. <br> But, whatever — he was in charge of IT at the agency that put together the world’s most famous technological boondoggle. He needed to be denied the “spend more time with my family” excuse and fired instead. <br> 6. White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park <br> Where was he? <br> Park reportedly was not heavily involved in the latter stages of the website’s development. Is that really the case? <br> But if not, why not? If you were the president, wouldn’t you expect your chief tech guy to be all over your most important technological project, reporting back to you on progress and running the traps to make sure everything was going smoothly? Park must go. <br> 7. White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri <br> In this crisis, as it did with the Benghazi videotape fairy tale, the White House started running at the mouth before it had any idea what was happening. <br> The communications on the website debacle have been abysmal. Remember how Obama took to the Rose Garden on Oct. 1 and proclaimed the website was suffering a bad case of the “glitches” and compared it to Apple rolling out “a new mobile operating system”? Or his absurd appearance in the same spot three weeks later, hawking call-center phone numbers like some 2 a.m. infomercial host? <br> Moreover, Obama’s explanations of his false promise — “If you like your plan, you can keep it” — featured the hideously inaccurate assertion that he had said he was referring only to plans in existence before Obamacare was signed. <br> The boss has been made to look like a fool too many times. <br> 8. Jeffrey Zients <br> Zients is in charge of HealthCare.gov CPR. “By the end of November, HealthCare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users,” he said in October. That sounded like just about everybody could use it — pretty much fixed. But now we’re talking four out of five users. And there are growing indications that even 80 percent might be ambitious. <br> If the latest Obamacare promise doesn’t pan out, its deliverer, Zients, should be fired from his ad hoc post as chairman of the Department of Website Surgery, and Obama should consider preventing him from becoming National Economic Council director as scheduled Jan. 1. The clock is ticking, Jeff. <br> 9. White House health policy adviser Jeanne Lambrew <br> Was Obama’s White House health care guru in some kind of trance? <br> Few if any in the White House have had more to do with implementing Obamacare or understand it better than Lambrew. Did she fail to ensure that the requirements for the Obamacare website were understood and heeded by the techies? As the former director of the now-defunct HHS Office of Health Reform, Lambrew presumably had extensive contacts at HHS to ensure things were going smoothly and if not, to sound the alarm at the White House. She apparently didn’t. Clean out your desk. <br> 10. HHS Deputy Assistant Secretary of Information Technology Frank Baitman <br> During his opening remarks at a Nov. 13 House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing, Baitman seemed to place responsibility for HealthCare.gov squarely on CMS while taking credit for a list of exciting achievements at HHS, prompting panel Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) to cut him off, dryly remarking, “Mr. Baitman, we know how great a job you’re doing — that’s why you’re here today. Could you please wrap up?” <br> According to his HHS bio, Baitman’s “emphasis is on delivering improved business outcomes from the agency’s IT investments.” <br> Is that so? HealthCare.gov was the agency’s top tech project. Why wasn’t he on top of this? <br> Why wasn’t anybody? <br> Keith Koffler, who covered the White House as a reporter for CongressDaily and Roll Call, is editor of the blogWhite House Dossier. 
Dr. Stephen P. Morse is an independent IT consultant from San Francisco. He has worked in the computer industry for more than 40 years, building hardware and software for many well-known tech companies. He has never been an employee of the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, the Department of Health and Human Services or any of the other federal agencies involved with building the federal health care exchange website. <br> But they sure could use him. <br> Like most Americans, Morse watched with bewilderment as HealthCare.gov promptly crumbled after launching last month. He already has health insurance, but he wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So he logged on and tried to compare his coverage options. No surprise: He couldn’t. <br> So what did he do? He built his own HealthCare.gov. <br> In the weeks since Oct. 1, Morse has done what it seems the federal government could not. He built a simple, user-friendly, anonymous shopping tool that compiles pricing information from all of the plans on the state and federal health insurance exchanges and provides custom, premium readouts according to age, location, tobacco use and income. <br> Sound too good to be true? Try it out for yourself here. <br> And Morse’s isn’t the only HealthCare.gov alternative out there. ValuePenguin.com, a start-up consumer finance website, has an even more elegant anonymous shopping tool that lists premium and subsidy calculations along with cost-sharing options that can be compared across plans. <br> With open enrollment looming last summer, the website’s team of three young entrepreneurs sensed a ripe opportunity to get ahead of the Obamacare curve. They decided to build their own health insurance window-shopping tool before the federal exchange rolled out, and post information about plans in each state as it became available to give people a sense of what was coming. <br> They finished, tested and launched their own shop and compare tool on June 18—three and a half months before the start of open enrollment. It took them about a day to write the necessary code and less than $2,000 to build and maintain the site. Unlike the multi-million dollar HealthCare.gov behemoth, it has actually been a tremendous success. By Oct. 2, ValuePenguin had information available for all 3,500-plus plans in all 50 state exchanges, while offering a much better user experience than HealthCare.gov. No glitches to speak of. <br> Of course, comparing a simple anonymous shopping tool to an entire federal or state-based exchange isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison. The actual exchanges have to perform many other complicated tasks, like verifying consumers’ identity, citizenship and income with other government agencies, synthesizing that information with plan selection to determine subsidies and generating complete and accurate enrollment forms to share with insurance carriers. That’s not easy. <br> But the success of Morse’s site and ValuePenguin proves that aggregating insurance information and presenting it in a clear, comprehensible fashion isn’t exactly complex rocket science. It isn’t even complex computer science. As Jonathan Wu, ValuePenguin’s 32-year-old CEO told us, “Of all the functions on the exchange, calculating premiums and displaying the relevant plans is probably one the easiest. … Based on our experience building the tool, I'm pretty confident any competent developer, let alone a team of developers, should be able to put a working version together in less than a few days.” That makes this week’s testimony from CMS Deputy Chief Information Officer Henry Chao—about how HealthCare.gov’s anonymous shopper feature “failed so miserably we could not consciously let people use it”—all the more disconcerting. <br> The administration needs to put an accurate, easy-to-use anonymous shopping tool up on the front page of HealthCare.gov—yesterday. The tool on the front page of the website now, which only provides quotes for a 27- or 50-year-old and doesn’t offer any cost-sharing or benefit details, just doesn’t cut it. When individuals and families can go online, browse through their coverage options and see the new benefits for which they are eligible, they will be more likely to give Obamacare a chance—even if the back end of the website doesn’t let them enroll immediately. If they remain in the dark, however, scaremongering from congressional Republicans will continue to fill the void. <br> Ultimately, the anonymous shopping problem, along with the other problems on HealthCare.gov, will get fixed. If ValuePenguin.com can do it, so can the federal government. But in the meantime, consumers who just want to window shop on the exchanges can check out the user-friendly alternatives. Because when it comes to window-shopping anonymously for health insurance online, who needs HealthCare.gov? <br> Andrew Steinmetz is senior research assistant in the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. Ezekiel Emanuel is vice provost of the university and chairman of the department. <br> Ezekiel Emanuel is vice provost of the University of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy. He also advised the White House on healthcare reform during the Obama administration.
The postcard couple huddled at a kitchen table as they hash out a budget is among the most shopworn of American political clichs, its currency as a debate device soaring to new heights during the recent government shutdown. <br> It was repeated ad nauseam on the floor of the U.S. House and the Sunday political talk circuit, but this apple pie convention, like most political theater, is absolute bunk: No longer are there any kitchen summits of the pocketbook or sacrifice, instead only heavily financed jet skis and matching gastric banding surgeries. <br> The image of the distressed couple, fashioned from a false nostalgia by conservative budget scolds to force legislative action on spending, relies on an outmoded notion of fiscal responsibility. But like white-picket fences, Americans have long abandoned any measure of virtue where money is concerned. <br> We rouse only from our recliners to yell in concert with choleric television personalities lamenting the state of America’s fiscal affairs — “they’re spending us into oblivion!” — even as we dive deeper into debt ourselves. <br> The reason Americans fail to appreciate the severity of the federal debt, having soared beyond a startling $17 trillion at last count, is the same reason we don’t appreciate our own pauper’s descent: Ours is a nation that is fundamentally money-dumb. <br> The math of eliminating the federal deficit is hard; the process harder still. But the obligation of America’s elected leaders to act is a moral imperative, a transcendent challenge made steeper by a debate that values marginalia over material. <br> Take House Speaker John Boehner’s appeal earlier this year that Congress adopt Rep. Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) budget in the same way, he said, ordinary Americans spend only what they can afford. “Listen, American families have to balance their budget,” he told conservative radio talker Michael Medved. “They understand you can’t continue to spend money that you don’t have.” <br> Yet it’s increasingly obvious that Americans don’t understand the fundamental underpinnings of budgeting. <br> According to data gathered by the Federal Reserve, the average American household is shouldering in excess of $15,000 in credit card debt. Similarly, a July survey by Gallup found that fewer than one-third of Americans create a monthly budget to track finances, and even fewer have a long-term financial plan. <br> That dynamic should sound familiar. Congress is the ultimate mirror, its members a beastly reflection of the public they serve. Often blustered, mostly paunched and rarely informed, our legislative betters have likewise failed to balance a budget or address the structural long-term debt the nation is already carrying. <br> So you see, it’s not just capricious lawmakers who can’t manage a balanced budget. It’s a national epidemic. The recent 16-day government shutdown and the budget bloat that precipitated it were not symptoms of a broken Congress, then, but the function of a broken electorate. <br> Those lawmakers advocating for budget reform have the right idea, but do the effort a profound disservice by leaning on bogus analogies of personal responsibility in an effort to whip support. <br> Americans want the debt and deficit resolved but don’t want to do it themselves. The proposition is thorny and complicated, and any serious solution means throttling funding for programs that benefit ordinary citizens. The burden is on Congress to lead, not deflect — to make the sacrifices necessary, even if it means sacrificing an election. <br> Voters tell pollsters they believe it imperative that Washington address the federal deficit, while failing to identify a single significant government program for reduced funding. <br> But the public’s lack of resolve where the deficit is concerned is no excuse for congressional leaders resorting to bogus analogies of dimly lit kitchen tables or arguing it’s what Americans want because neither trope is true. <br> Instead, Washington should eliminate the deficit because it’s a right and moral undertaking. <br> James Richardson, a conservative communications strategist, was formerly a spokesman and adviser to the Republican National Committee and to Govs. Haley Barbour and Jon Huntsman. 
“If Apple launched a major new product that functioned as badly as ObamaCare’s online insurance marketplace, the tech world would be calling for [CEO] Tim Cook’s head.” <br> That searing indictment of Obamacare didn’t come from a conservative. Those were the words of the Washington Post’s Ezra Klein — yes, liberal Ezra Klein —and Evan Soltas in a blog post on Oct. 4, just three days after the online Obamacare marketplace opened. They were right. <br> Now, two full weeks since its launch, the website healthcare.gov still isn’t functioning. One CNN reporter began trying to sign up on Oct. 1. As of the morning of Oct. 14, she still hadn’t been able to. A researcher who works for the New York Times has tried and failed to sign up for Obamacare 40 times since the website launched. But the Obama administration continues making excuses for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and the people who spent hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on a site that does not work. <br> How much more money will her department waste — and how much time will Americans waste on the website — before the administration admits they have a problem? In a business, someone would be held accountable for such a large-scale disaster. <br> ( QUIZ: Do you know Kathleen Sebelius?) <br> When pressed on her failures, Sebelius repeats her favorite line: “We had some early glitches.” A glitch, says Merriam-Webster, is “temporary” and “minor.” For two weeks, the Obamacare website has hardly functioned. That’s not minor or temporary. That’s not a glitch; that’s a systemic failure. <br> HHS had over three years to build the system, and the launch date still caught them entirely off guard—though not for a lack of warning signs. <br> The New York Times — yes, the liberal New York Times — documented the many red flags. <br> ObamaCare’s “chief digital architect” worried the site would be a “third-world experience.” The firm contracted to build the site didn’t start writing code until this past spring. “As late as the last week of September, officials were still changing features of the Web site,” reports the Times. Back in February one insurance executive said he foresaw “a train wreck.” He was right. <br> ( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes) <br> It’s bad enough that Sebelius and company produced a terrible taxpayer-funded product. It’s even worse that they didn’t heed the warnings or spot the red flags. They put on a smile, flipped the switch, and sat by as it crashed. <br> Now there is a very simple way that the Obama administration could prove their critics wrong — a way to back up their claim that this really is all about a few “glitches” and that the site has worked for people. They could release the number of Americans who have enrolled for coverage. But they won’t, saying they don’t know the numbers yet and will only report them monthly. <br> Think about that for a second. This is not an administration that misses an opportunity to brag. They’ve even leaked sensitive national security information to burnish their image. They could release the numbers if they wanted. The truth, most likely, is that the numbers would prove their many critics right. <br> Then again, maybe they did such a terrible job building the system that it’s impossible even to do something as simple as count enrollees. <br> The website is only part of the Obamacare story. The law continues to wreck the economy and endanger the healthcare of Americans. More and more families who already have insurance are now receiving the kind of letters that many Americans dread. They’re being dropped from their current plan. <br> Writing for US News and World Report, Peter Roff shared an excerpt of the letter he received from his insurance company. <br> “Among other things, these (Affordable Care Act) requirements will cause your benefits to change to include federally-mandated Essential Health Benefits. Since your current benefit plan does not conform to these new mandates, your current health plan will cease upon your anniversary date,” it said. <br> Again and again and again, President Obama promised that if you like your plan you could keep it. He lied. <br> And now what are these families without insurance supposed to do? <br> Find a new plan on the exchanges. <br> What a train wreck. Even former Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs says, “This was bungled badly,” adding “I hope they fire some people that were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work.” <br> I agree. And the first person fired should be Secretary Sebelius. <br> Reince Priebus is chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
‘I’m not yet ready to be tsar,” Nicholas II reportedly said in 1894 when his predecessor died. “I know nothing of the business of ruling.” <br> The tsarina of Obamacare, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, must know how he felt. Given the keys to the kingdom of American health care by the sweeping 2010 law, she appears to have dropped them somewhere and is fumbling to pick them back up. <br> The rollout of Obamacare has been so disastrous that even “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart was plainly mystified and unconvinced when Sebelius came on his show the other day to offer soothing explanations and reassurances. Stewart gently expressed his frustration that there is “a level of incompetence that is larger than what it should be,” and after pressing her on why the individual mandate can’t be delayed, said after the interview was over, “I still don’t understand why individuals have to sign up but businesses don’t.” <br> ( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes) <br> Nancy Pelosi infamously said that we had to pass the law to find out what’s in it. But the then-House speaker erroneously assumed, evidently, that people would be able to get onto the government-run exchanges created by the law. So far the law’s implementation has been as ugly as its passage. <br> Judging by the haphazard rollout — incomprehensible error messages have been the norm, and the federal website has had to be taken offline several times — you’d guess that this was a back-burner project for the Obama administration, or the start-date for the exchanges had been sprung on it a few weeks ago. Of course, it is the president’s most cherished initiative, and his team has had more than three years to get the exchanges up and running. <br> Imagine the chaos if this were something the administration cared about less. The conservative trope used to be that Americans shouldn’t want health care delivered by the people who run the post office. The new conservative trope should be that Americans shouldn’t want health care delivered by the people who built HealthCare.gov. <br> ( WATCH: Kentucky residents react to Obamacare roll-out) <br> Last week, Chad Henderson achieved instant media celebrity by claiming to have signed up for Obamacare on the federal exchange. So desperate were reporters to find someone who had managed this unlikely feat that they flocked to Henderson for color and background about his amazing experience. <br> It turned out that Henderson, an Organizing for America volunteer, was the Cory Booker of the federal health care exchange, peddling a mediagenic story that didn’t quite check out. He hadn’t really signed up, although he maintained that he had completed an application. Perhaps that should have been considered accomplishment enough. <br> How many people sign up for insurance on the exchanges and what kind of people (young or old, sick or healthy) are central to the future of the law. But administration officials won’t say how many people have enrolled. This is either because they do know and are too embarrassed to say. Or perhaps the system is so dysfunctional it is genuinely impossible to determine. <br> ( WATCH: Boehner calls Obamacare “a trainwreck”) <br> The website problems are the result, according to the administration, of overwhelming volume. Experts disagree. CBS quoted a sympathetic programmer named Luke Chung observing that “it wasn’t designed well, it wasn’t implemented well and it looks like nobody tested it,” adding, “I would be ashamed and embarrassed if my organization delivered something like that.” <br> Obama officials can’t say they weren’t warned. Actually, they probably can say that — it just wouldn’t be true, according to press accounts. The Washington Post cited two allies of the administration who “said they approached White House officials this year to raise concerns that the federal exchange was not ready to launch. In both cases, Obama officials assured them there was no cause for alarm.” <br> President Barack Obama and his team have repeatedly compared Obamacare’s “glitches” to those of the new Apple operating system. But Steve Jobs was a famously demanding and exacting boss. It’s hard to imagine him tolerating the maddening constraints of operating in a federal environment. If he had run Apple like HHS, it would have been the best thing ever to happen to Blackberry. <br> ( Understanding Obamacare: POLITICO's guide to the Affordable Care Act) <br> The more apt comparison might be to the FBI, which had an epic years-long struggle to upgrade its computer system, beset by software meltdowns and cost overruns. <br> It is true that successes can have rocky starts. The invasion of Normandy, the Manhattan Project and the space program all had “glitches.” Obamacare is like none of those other things. <br> Presumably, the administration will eventually be able to make its website work, since it doesn’t involve a radically new technology; people have sold insurance on websites before. The more fundamental question is whether the larger project is sustainable when the exchanges need young and healthy people to sign up, at the same time they will have to pay sharply more under Obamacare. <br> The San Jose Mercury News did a story on premium shock. It quoted one Cindy Vinson, an Obamacare supporter, who was disconcerted to learn that she will have to pay $1,800 more a year for an individual policy. “Of course, I want people to have health care,” she said. “I just didn’t realize I would be the one who was going to pay for it personally.” <br> She might not have realized it because the president of the United States never mentions it, even though explaining how Obamacare will work has been one of his main rhetorical priorities for years. Somehow, he never quite gets around to the part about some premiums going up, which for people forced to pay more will probably be the most salient feature of the law. <br> But, hey, what possibly could go wrong? <br> Rich Lowry is editor of National Review. 
America’s patent system, when operating as intended, is the envy of the world. It fuels the technological advances that invigorate our economy, create jobs and benefit American consumers. <br> Unfortunately, some patent holders are abusing the system. Rather than incentivizing the creation of the next-generation iPhone or a lifesaving drug, they are misusing patents by suing unsuspecting consumers and extorting settlements. In some cases, patent abusers who maintain that a Wi-Fi router infringes on their patents have sued hotels or small coffee shops that bought the routers, instead of the routers’ manufacturers. If the patent holder has a legitimate claim, it is against the company that makes the router, not the small business that bought it, yet retailers are being targeted in a pressure quest for easy settlements. <br> This same misuse of the system is happening in other parts of our economy. Retailers who operate websites are threatened with lawsuits by patent abusers, based on technology that another company has provided and that the retailer is ill-equipped to defend. Threats of these kind of predatory lawsuits continue to arise, hurting real businesses, large and small, that are being forced to divert resources from job creation to defend allegations of infringement. <br> The result of this misuse of the patent system is a drag on our economy. It also tarnishes the image of legitimate patent holders. This is not the patent system provided for in our Constitution. <br> We are working on a bipartisan basis to craft legislation to address this problem of abusive practices and restore confidence in the American patent system. Our legislation will increase the transparency of patent ownership, protect the customer of a patented product when the manufacturer should really be the defendant and improve the process for reviewing patents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We are coordinating closely with other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle and with Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. <br> No single provision will solve the problems we aim to address. But just as Democrats and Republicans came together to pass the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which brought the most comprehensive change to our nation’s patent laws in 60 years, we again are working in a collaborative, bipartisan way. Our legislation will make it harder for bad actors to succeed, while preserving what has made America’s patent system great. <br> Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over patents, copyrights and trademarks. He is co-author of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is also a member of the Judiciary Committee and serves as ranking member of its Antitrust subcommittee. 
Every mass movement in America, the philosopher Eric Hoffer once wrote, becomes a racket in the end. <br> And he hadn’t even witnessed the full course of the civil rights movement. If the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington is a time for taking stock, the score is clear. The Dream was a glorious triumph, changing America forever and making it more just. The contemporary civil rights movement, partly as a consequence, is an intellectually exhausted disgrace. <br> It is the victim of its own success. No longer confronted by a system of American apartheid and incapable of simply saying, “We won,” it subsists largely on imagined slights and manufactured controversies unrelated to the welfare of real people. <br> Somewhere along the line, the movement took on all the moral majesty of an effort to extort contributions from corporations, a favorite tactic of Jesse Jackson. The Congressional Black Caucus, for its part, is a sponge for business money, making it “a fund-raising juggernaut,” in the words of a New York Times report. <br> The difference between the movement now and then is the difference between confronting grave injustices and coming up with excuses for your latest press release; the difference between connecting to the nation’s profoundest ideals and reflexively agitating for more government activism; the difference between a calling and a career. <br> As Roger Clegg of the Center for Equal Opportunity notes, from Martin Luther King Jr. to Al Sharpton is the personification of the Karl Marx line that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. Great challenges call for great men; frivolous times call for late-afternoon cable TV hosts who are fodder for “Saturday Night Live” parodies. <br> King did his work under clear and present physical threat. In Montgomery, Ala., in 1957, he had a bad feeling one night while staying at the parsonage in his Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and insisted on leaving. A few hours later, a bomb exploded outside on the street corner. <br> He gave his famous Mountaintop speech in 1968, the night before his assassination after flying from Atlanta to Memphis on a plane delayed because of a bomb threat. <br> He operated under the ever-watchful eye of an FBI that managed to flagrantly violate civil liberties before the advent of the National Security Agency surveillance program. In 1964, it sent King a “suicide letter” evidently intended to compel him to end his own life. <br> King had a well-developed moral philosophy, based on a profound engagement with the biblical prophets and Reinhold Niebuhr. He believed that “unearned suffering is redemptive” and rejected a facile optimism that comes so easily to Americans, as he wrote: “Instead of assured progress in wisdom and decency, man faces the ever present possibility of swift relapse not merely to animalism but into such calculated cruelty as no other animal can practice.” <br> He wasn’t merely glib, but truly eloquent, a practiced Baptist preacher who wedded the cadences of the Bible to the nation’s founding ideals under the unbearable pressure of historic events. <br> Then there’s Sharpton, whose career is a long catalog of the ridiculous and outrageous in pursuit of newspaper clips and cable TV appearances. <br> Sharpton is a Christian minister who refuses to this day to apologize to the man he defamed by falsely accusing him of raping a woman. He is the peacemaker who in the midst of anti-Jewish riots issued the inspiring call, “If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house.” He is the paragon of civil rights who denounced a Jewish businessman in Harlem as a “white interloper.” <br> If there were genuinely something consequential at stake, as in the fight against segregation of the mid-20th century, it would be a disaster for the country that Al Sharpton is so prominent. <br> But that fight is won, no matter how loath King’s self-appointed heirs are to admit it. At his speech at the Mall, Sharpton said Jim Crow has been vanquished, but now the struggle must go on against James Crow Jr., ESQ. The old Jim Crow knocked down protesters with high-pressure fire hoses; the new Jim Crow asks everyone to bring a photo ID when they vote. The apple has fallen very far from the tree. <br> In his own speech, President Barack Obama tried to reach rhetorical liftoff at the end by citing people serving the community or otherwise demonstrating kindness or regard for others and declaimed that they “are marching,” just like those marchers in 1963. This is a strained metaphor in the service of a deep misunderstanding. These people aren’t marching; they are living admirable lives in a society where the civil rights marches of yore are no longer necessary. Surely that’s the point. <br> What the contemporary civil rights establishment can’t bring itself to acknowledge is that cultural breakdown has more to do with the struggles of blacks than any officially sanctioned discrimination. To his credit, Obama says as much at times. It is one of the reasons that Jesse Jackson in 2008 thought he was “talking down to people,” and mused on an open mic about performing an anatomically sensitive operation on the presidential candidate. <br> But the left doesn’t want to hear it. When commentator George Will noted how disastrous it is that 72 percent of black children are born out of wedlock on “This Week” last weekend, MSNBC went to battle stations. Host Ed Schultz convened a panel on Will’s comment that inevitably concluded, in the words of one guest, “he needs to meet black people that are not working for him.” <br> Fifty years ago, a movement using self-sacrificing tactics of tremendous courage fought and defeated racism in the streets and in the halls of power. Today, its successors use the charge of racism to try to shut down all argument and deflect uncomfortable conversations. They aren’t a testament to the legacy of a great movement so much as to its degeneration. <br> Rich Lowry is editor of National Review. 
The most interesting question surrounding the campaigns of Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer is not whether they can win. Instead, it is whether their candidacies signal a shift in the values and priorities of voters when it comes to political sex scandals. <br> The main difference between past and current political sex scandals is not the frequency with which they occur, but rather the time it takes to recover from them. <br> In the past, once a politician’s sex scandal was revealed, it often took him (it’s almost always him) many years to regain credibility with the public, if he regained it at all. Today, the interval between revelation and redemption is vanishing. <br> Mark Sanford won a South Carolina congressional seat just four years after tearfully admitting to a scandal in which, during his second term as that state’s governor, he cheated on his wife, lied to the public about his whereabouts, and violated state ethics laws. <br> Eliot Spitzer declared his candidacy for New York City comptroller in July, just five years removed from resigning the state’s governorship after admitting to having patronized an expensive prostitution service. <br> Anthony Weiner’s bid to become the Big Apple’s mayor comes only two years after he resigned his congressional seat for sending sexually explicit photos of himself to numerous women before and during his marriage. <br> Some voters don’t seem to mind. As an elderly voter told Time magazine about Weiner’s Internet sexcapades, “Oh, I don’t care. Which one of us is perfect?” <br> Many other voters seem to agree. According to a 2012 study published in the Political Research Quarterly, sex scandals cost politicians just five points at the ballot box. <br> On many measures, public opinion has shifted toward greater acceptance of sexual license. Consider the rising popularity of sexting, the sending of sexually explicit photos via text message or Twitter. A 2012 Harris poll found that one in five Americans sexts. <br> That’s a significant increase from 2010, when a Pew Research Center poll found that 6 percent of American adults sent sexts and 15 percent received them. <br> But polls show that the vast majority of Americans still believe marital infidelity is wrong. A 2013 Gallup poll found that just 6 percent of respondents felt “married men and women having an affair” was morally acceptable. <br> It is impossible to know whether marital infidelity is more common than it used to be. But it is telling that more Americans feel comfortable admitting to others that they’ve been unfaithful. In 2008, University of Washington researchers found that the lifetime infidelity rate of men over 60 rose from 20 percent in 1991 to 28 percent in 2006. For women in that age group, the rate rose 300 percent, from 5 to 15 percent. Increases in infidelity were also seen among men and women under 35. 
Will Jeff Bezos destroy The Washington Post, or rescue the entire struggling business of journalism? Those are both very real possibilities raised by the Amazon mogul’s purchase of The Washington Post, a development that stunned the journalism world this week and set a million keyboards typing the latest round of thumb-suckers on the future of media. <br> Bezos clearly expects to do something dramatic. He’s putting $250 million of his own money into the company. Of course, his net worth is somewhere around $28 billion, including about $1.7 billion in cash and other assets that he can use for investing. This won’t hurt him much. <br> He has never shown an interest in owning a newspaper company before. It’s not one of his quirky interests, like building a thousand-year clock or creating a space exploration company called Blue Origin. These are Rich Man’s Toys. He makes those investments because he loves science fiction, wants to be a futurist — and even wants to colonize space to save humanity. <br> Online retailing is his real business, the place where he makes his name and his money. So why get into the news business now? Here’s a guess: because he wants to create a new business center for Amazon.com. This purchase represents a real opportunity for Bezos to expand Amazon’s horizons here on Earth. <br> Of course, it’s Bezos himself, not Amazon, that will own The Washington Post. There will, however, most likely be a connection. He can learn about the publishing business from the Post and try to figure out how to turn it back into a profitable business, most likely by getting Amazon involved in collecting revenues. <br> I have a few reservations about this. I’m always concerned when a news organization is owned by a company — or the CEO of a company — that is not dedicated to publishing. Tycoons don’t always have the right dedication to journalism standards: to impartiality, to getting the story right (but then, some publishing companies don’t, either). Producing the news is not just another business. It’s an important part of any democracy. It keeps the public informed, helps it decide how to vote in elections, exposes corruption and digs up important information that governments and corporations would rather keep private, to the detriment of the public at large. <br> Jeff Bezos is a very secretive man. He rarely gives interviews or discusses what Amazon is up to. Publications write articles about Amazon’s fights with retailers and book publishers, the company’s alleged mistreatment of warehouse workers and other lower-echelon employees, and its battles with Apple (in which the U.S. Justice Department has gotten involved). Throughout all this, there is rarely a comment from Bezos or Amazon. <br> We in the press know that Bezos manipulates us. By rarely speaking, we’re all desperate for interviews. He grants them only on his terms. There is a lot of pressure to stay on his good side to be one of the coveted few granted an audience. I spent 18 months writing a book about Bezos without ever managing to get an interview with anyone at the company. This doesn’t seem like the kind of person to run a news business. <br> Will The Washington Post get more access to Amazon now? Not likely. Will the public, competitors and watchdog organizations seek out new biases in the Post’s coverage? Most certainly. Even if the allegations are not true, perception is important to a publication. <br> There is, however, a very positive alternative to this story. As a businessman, Bezos is interested in figuring out new ways to make money online. He has reason to be interested in the Post. There is enormous opportunity in the business. <br> The problem in the news business (and at The Washington Post in particular) is not the ability to collect reporting and write the news. The industry knows how to do that. Bezos has no incentive, and no reason, to get involved with this side of the business. If he damages the Post’s editorial integrity, he could kill the company and his investment. He’s too smart to waste money like that. <br> The problem in journalism is figuring out how to make money at it. The Internet has changed the business model of media companies. New paradigm-shifting technologies always do that to existing businesses. This time, it’s the journalism industry’s turn. <br> Eventually, however, smart entrepreneurs figure out how to adapt. Many old companies do not, and die off. Bezos is a “new paradigm” kind of guy, an Internet pioneer. What he can do is figure out how to make a newspaper profitable in the digital age. At least, we hope so. <br> That ambition goes far beyond The Washington Post. By buying the company and learning the revenue-generating side of the business, he may figure out a new, Internet-centric road to profitability. If it works at the Post, it might work for the entire industry. He doesn’t have to own every newspaper in order to help them change their business models; he just needs to show them the way. He could disrupt the entire industry, we hope in a positive way. <br> And here’s where Amazon comes back into the picture. Bezos’s new business model will most certainly involve Amazon in the retail channel. Bezos has made it clear that he wants to own as much of the business of doing business on the Internet as possible. That’s why he created the Kindle, following the pioneering ideas of Steve Jobs. With the Kindle, he can put media in your hands. <br> Newspapers are dying: Classifieds are gone, print ads are drying up, and subscribers are dwindling. Few outlets have figured out how to persuade readers to pay for content. Nobody yet knows exactly what the new business model or models may be. But if anyone can come up with one, it’s likely to be Jeff Bezos. <br> That is the great news in all of this. Imagine a press-shy CEO like Bezos playing a key role in reviving the journalism business. That might be bad news for some: Bezos cares about customers, and that means low prices for quality products. Not many book publishers or offline bookstores appreciate Amazon’s dominance of the bookselling business. Newspaper executives may have similar problems. <br> Bezos may not be a journalism idealist, but those of us who are can only applaud the possibility that he is successful in finding a way to make it profitable. George Guthrie, a press photographer in Tom Stoppard’s play, “Night and Day,” may have said it best. After a long exploration of the importance and failings of the press, Guthrie sums it up near the end. <br> “I’ve been around a lot of places. People do awful things to each other. But it’s worse in places where everybody is kept in the dark. It really is. Information is light. Information, in itself, about anything, is light. That’s all you can say, really.” <br> Jeff Bezos is no saint. But as a businessman, he may end up helping to shed more light on the world. <br> Richard L. Brandt is a freelance technology/business journalist and author of One Click: Jeff Bezos and the Rise of Amazon.com . 
When America’s system of patent litigation has gotten so dysfunctional that President Barack Obama and Republican Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte agree on the need for reform, something is amiss. Make no mistake: Patents are important. Inventors’ ability to protect and exploit their discoveries has long been an essential driver of American prosperity — deemed so vital by the founding fathers that granting patents was one of the new federal government’s few enumerated legislative powers. <br> Of late, however, litigation over software patents has emerged as a drag, not a boon, to technological innovation. According to a study by Boston University law professors Mike Meurer and Jim Bessen, the “patent tax” adds 20 percent to software and electronic research and development costs, and in 2011, Google and Apple spent more on patent litigation and acquisition than on research and development. Little wonder: In June, for instance, the International Trade Commission (ITC) responded to a Samsung patent-infringement claim with a ruling that would have blocked the importation of certain Apple iPhones and iPads, had President Obama not taken the extraordinary step of vetoing the decision last Saturday in the first such presidential override of an ITC decision since 1987. <br> Unlike pharmaceutical patents, software patents are hard to define and have often been improvidently granted. And multiple software patents tend to be embedded within products, such as smartphones, cars, and printers — which can open up the manufacturers and even the users of such products to exploitative litigation. <br> Thus, the nation’s most aggressive plaintiffs’ lawyers — whom we at the Manhattan Institute have dubbed Trial Lawyers, Inc. — have begun to manipulate U.S. legal rules to extract wealth from the nation’s most innovative companies. Most such litigation today is not filed by companies holding patents, such as Samsung, but by “patent trolls” — people or companies that produce no goods or services themselves but exist to acquire patent rights and seek to enforce them against businesses that are producing goods or services using related technologies. Over the last six years, the number of lawsuits filed by such patent-assertion entities has increased 526 percent, according to research by Santa Clara law professor Colleen Chien, examining data from the patent risk-management company RPX Corporation. <br> And the businesses and individuals being hurt by patent-troll litigation abuses are not merely technology companies and manufacturers. In February 2011, a patent troll named Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC, acquired a portfolio of 31 patents related to Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology. Instead of suing manufacturers employing Wi-Fi technologies that allegedly infringed on the patents, attorneys working with Innovatio mailed more than 8,000 letters seeking $2,500 to $3,000 each from retail businesses — including hotels, coffee shops, and restaurants — that offered customers Wi-Fi services. <br> Late last year, another patent troll, MPHJ Technology Investments LLC, acquired a patent covering scanner technologies that employed a one-button scan and send-to-e-mail function, which had been granted to Israeli resident Laurence Klein in 1997 but never used in a manufacturing setting. Rather than suing scanner and printer manufacturers, attorneys working with MPHJ mailed demand letters to hundreds of small and medium-size U.S. businesses that were end users of printers and scanners — seeking roughly $1,000 per worker in licensing royalties. <br> Apart from the fact that the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office has issued many patents it shouldn’t, such patent-lawsuit shenanigans are enabled by idiosyncratic features of the American legal system that have made the United States far more litigious than any other nation in the developed world. The U.S., unlike every country in Western Europe, does not require the losers of a civil lawsuit to reimburse the winner’s expenses. A company facing a $3,000 demand letter might very well settle up rather than risking the need to mount a legal defense — which in a patent suit typically costs hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars if the case goes to trial, successful or not. <br> “Forum shopping” is another useful and much-abused tool for patent trolls. Under U.S. law, patent lawsuits can be asserted wherever a product is sold, which has led plaintiffs’ lawyers to seek out jurisdictions particularly likely to expedite their claims and award them hefty jury verdicts — places like the Eastern District of Texas, where the number of patent lawsuits filed skyrocketed from 32 in 2002 to 1,266 in 2012, according to filing data compiled by Perkins Coie patent attorney James Pistorino. And in addition to federal court, patent lawyers can file suit at the ITC, which has broad powers, as in the Samsung-Apple case, to keep products at the border on the basis of an alleged patent infringement involving a single software program. <br> The president and certain congressional leaders have advanced various approaches to fixing patent-litigation abuse, but there seems to be a growing consensus that something must be done. Let’s hope that our elected officials put aside the normal partisan bickering on this one and get to work: The nation’s economic growth and technological leadership depend on it. <br> James R. Copland is the director of the Center for Legal Policy at the Manhattan Institute, which on Aug. 5 released a new report, “ Trial Lawyers Inc.: Patent Trolls.” 
The Republican Party’s failure to invest in high-level technology and analytics in 2012 has become shorthand code for the party’s woes: this alone wasn’t the reason Mitt Romney lost, but it was emblematic of a party whose leaders had stopped innovating — in policy, messaging, or campaign tactics. <br> Last week, the Republican National Committee hired Andy Barkett, a senior Facebook engineer, as its new chief technology officer. The party is also pressing the reset button on its previously close relationship with Liberty Works, a Silicon Valley-led consortium that was to manage access to the GOP’s voter file. <br> Barkett’s hiring — along with the RNC’s other reform-minded hires — shows that the party may finally be serious about stopping the brain drain of recent years and closing the innovation gap with the Democrats. Yet, while the broad outlines of the RNC’s technology initiatives have been greeted favorably, many of the details are still being defined. Ask most political operatives what those details should be, and you’ll get wildly different responses. <br> One of the key promises made following the release of the party’s 2012 postmortem report was opening up the voter file to outside developers and allied groups to access and contribute back to in real time. This small technical change could go a long way towards solving the data sharing problems campaign staff have griped about for ages. Done right, it could seed a whole new technology ecosystem on the right. <br> ( PHOTOS: Mark Zuckerberg with pols) <br> This is one of the bigger things that the RNC will need to get right in the coming months. <br> Known as an API, this platform would allow outsiders to access and interact with the GOP’s store of voter and microtargeting data. Theoretically, the platform would allow anyone complaining about the quality of the party’s voter file software to build alternatives using the party’s own data. <br> The Apple app store is a metaphor frequently used to describe something like this, but for the GOP, an analogy to the early days of Twitter is more apt. In start-up mode, the service was beset by numerous outages (giving birth to the iconic Fail Whale) and struggled to scale. Yet the one big thing it got right is to give developers virtually unlimited access to its data to build their own applications that in some cases almost entirely replaced the main Twitter experience. The market spawned tools like TweetDeck and mobile apps like Tweetie — both of which were later bought up by Twitter — that grew in popularity. By allowing others to innovate in creating new ways to access the service, Twitter was able to focus on improving its core platform. <br> In similar fashion, innovation on the Democratic side of the aisle didn’t first come with an official party imprimatur. “The VAN” — the party’s revered voter file software — initially started out as a rebellion by state parties dissatisfied with the slow movement and buggy software of the national party. Once a clear majority of state parties had coalesced around VAN, the DNC adopted it as its own. <br> ( PHOTOS: Politicians and cellphones) <br> A clear lesson emerges time and again when it comes to technology: no matter how smart and well-intentioned your leadership is, innovation still mostly comes from the bottom up. The party’s job is to allow for this emergent innovation to flourish, and borrow the best of it. A truly open Republican approach to technology could create such a dynamic. <br> To succeed, the GOP’s platform must be open to all Republicans and conservatives and not closed off to all but a handful of select vendors. This must be a conscious policy decision made with an eye towards enticing new entrants into the marketplace, even if that means disrupting the existing consultant class. <br> A common gripe in GOP circles is that data isn’t shared across campaigns and election cycles. But in reality, there is no easy way to do this, and the RNC’s nominal sharing requirements have proven all too easy to dodge. Data sharing today (largely) consists of people pushing and pulling CSV files to the party’s FTP servers, often at the end of election cycles, when the data’s value diminishes markedly. This is not a viable solution moving forward. 
The ubiquitous smartphone and the app revolution it is enabling will be propelled or not by the availability of one essential input, radio spectrum. Like radio in your car or television in your home, mobile phone services need exclusive dedicated frequencies — called spectrum — to operate. The more spectrum available, the faster the speed of existing apps and the greater the potential for innovation of new ones. <br> There is no question that mobile technology has transformed our lives, making valuable information and entertainment accessible to millions of Americans from nearly anywhere at any time. Two weeks ago, Apple announced that customers have downloaded more than 50 billion apps. In just five years, the App Store has grown from 500 to 850,000 apps available on the iPhone. <br> As data-rich applications continue to grow, existing capacity is just not sufficient. <br> Fortunately for American mobile users, both houses of Congress are actively considering specific action to bolster the reallocation of spectrum for mobile broadband use, with a hearing this week in the Senate and later this month in the House. <br> Congress has attempted to strengthen and accelerate this process by creating significant incentives for commercial licensees to vacate their spectrum voluntarily. The “incentive auctions,” authorized by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, will allow the Federal Communications Commission to use some of the auction proceeds from selling cleared spectrum to mobile carriers to buy out willing TV broadcasters. <br> Another such tool is the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act, which established a mechanism for compensating federal users for the costs of relocating their systems to different frequencies. One band currently under intense study for relocation or sharing is the 1755-1850 MHz band, used largely by the Department of Defense. <br> Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) have proposed legislation that would determine a sensible way forward. They believe that by focusing on the lower 25 MHz, the costs of moving existing government users (the auction reserve price) could drop to a point where a successful CSEA auction could be held in the near term. <br> Under the existing framework, however, incumbent federal users still stand to gain little from giving up spectrum, causing them to be overly conservative in estimating relocation costs and sharing opportunities. During a Senate hearing in March, former FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski advocated for the reallocation of government spectrum for commercial use, noting “the government has about 60 percent of the most desirable spectrum. And even though military needs in the U.S. are going up, that’s more than is necessary and a lot of it is ineffectively allocated.” <br> Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) also are discussing ways to encourage the Department of Defense and other government users to move to new frequencies. The two formed a spectrum reform task force, which is seeking ways for federal agencies to operate more efficiently. Given the cost of doing nothing, we need to think expansively. <br> The monies raised could be used to reduce the Defense Department’s exposure in the sequestration and other budget processes. Or create a presidential level award for select employees who generate the best ideas for improving the government’s use of the radio spectrum. Also, local and state governments could be empowered to negotiate with neighboring military installations to share the spectrum they are using. These installations have long had symbiotic relationships with their surrounding communities, sharing local resources such as roads and schools. Why not spectrum? <br> Indeed, the sale or sharing of federal spectrum could enhance defense capabilities by providing better, newer systems for mission critical projects, achieving the goal of all Americans to see our troops have every advantage. <br> It’s time to get creative. Last year, U.S. mobile networks carried 69 percent more data traffic than in the prior year, and the number of smartphones grew 36.4 percent, while even more data-hungry wireless-enabled devices, such as tablets and laptops, grew 10.2 percent. <br> The benefits of mobile computing cannot be overstated, from access to health care and education to monitoring energy consumption and social networks. The U.S. needs to secure the spectrum necessary to meet demand in this country. Congress should move forward with a framework that will maximize the efficient use of spectrum for the benefit of federal and commercial users and, most important, American consumers. <br> Peter Cleveland, vice president of Global Public Policy for Intel Corp. 
On Tuesday morning, a political sideshow masquerading as a Senate hearing will target America’s economic champions — companies that are creating American jobs and strengthening American innovation. That’s when Michigan Sen. Carl Levin convenes his Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for another hearing on his flawed belief that U.S. employers are trying to cheat Uncle Sam. <br> Yes, the U.S. tax system produces outcomes that sometimes are hard to explain, and it’s easy for a politician to capitalize on that reality. But slanted political rhetoric ignores the hard work of repairing what everyone agrees is a broken, antiquated tax system. <br> Stripped to the core, Levin doesn’t like companies that utilize the tax code’s full deductions and benefits — basically what most law-abiding Americans do every April 15. In his own 2012 tax return, Levin claimed deductions to cut his tax bill to the lowest legal amount — the same as most Americans, as no one purposely leaves deductions sitting unused. <br> ( Also on POLITICO: Senate investigators: Apple avoided $44 billion in taxes) <br> Companies operate in the same manner, working within the tax code to pay their share, but not unilaterally paying more than is required. Yet, Levin claims that companies, by taking advantage of the deductions in law, engage in “tax-avoidance schemes” to shortchange the IRS. It isn’t a scheme for Levin to legally reduce his own tax bill. Nor is it a scheme for any company to do the same. <br> Apple’s top executives will be the latest tech sector leaders called before Levin’s subcommittee. They’ll talk about their fidelity both to the law and to their employees and shareholders. Apple is one of the country’s largest taxpayers, paying more than $6 billion to the Treasury last year. In fact, in the hour it will take to peruse this web site and drink a cup of coffee, Apple will have paid about $1 million in state and federal taxes. <br> And while they are meeting their obligations to the government, Apple is investing in America with new jobs, facilities, and industries. In addition to its more than 50,000 U.S. employees, Apple is responsible for more than a quarter-million jobs at other companies in fields ranging from manufacturing equipment to transportation to outside developers. The iPhone — a single product in Apple’s line — revolutionized the mobile industry, with the app economy generating almost $20 billion in annual revenues as more than 120,000 companies publish products for the Apple platform alone. <br> That is an amazing record of investment and success, and is a microcosm of the tech sector’s significant benefits for the U.S. economy. We play by the rules. We pay our taxes. We create new jobs. And we believe that it’s time to bring the antiquated U.S. tax laws up to date. 
At this very moment, likely at no less than a dozen kitchen tables, there are a handful of people contemplating a run for the presidency in 2016. Odds are good they’re all over 50, which means they were in college around the time Apple released the first Macintosh computer. And as they plot their way to Iowa and New Hampshire, they have a new variable to reckon with: a technology-media landscape that is rewriting the rules of politics. <br> The combination of the Internet and mobile phones — a combination I call radical connectivity — dramatically unsettles politics by empowering upstarts and insurgents and dramatically lowering the advantages enjoyed by established incumbents. <br> We’re in the midst of a dramatic change — about a decade into it by my account. Over the past five years — from Obama’s defeat of Hillary Clinton, to the rise of the tea party and its success in the 2010 elections, to the Arab Spring movement of the past 12 months — we are seeing the political and governmental institutions of our time encounter the people-powered organic movements of the digital age. <br> Establishment outsider Gary Hart quite literally lost the 1984 Democratic primary because his staff was unable to process small-dollar donations as fast as they received them. Checks were mailed to his Senate office, then had to be rerouted to his campaign office, then the out-of-state checks took weeks to clear the banks. Hart went bankrupt against Walter Mondale’s well-funded but soon-to-be-vanquished campaign. <br> That began to change in 2003. I got involved with Howard Dean because I wanted to donate to his campaign to support his policies. After I discovered that it was almost impossible to figure out how to send him money online, I wound up moving to Vermont to be his webmaster. <br> A few months later, we had raised $7 million in just a few days, shocking the Democratic establishment and making Dean a brief front-runner. <br> Following Dean’s model, the Obama campaign was able to use the Internet to mount an unthinkable challenge to Hillary Clinton. In 2007, the Democratic Party was for the most part still the party that Bill and Hillary built. The dominant narrative of the campaign right up until Iowa was that Obama was too new and too young and couldn’t beat Hillary. 
You walk through the Safeway deli section looking for lunch meat. The sliced turkey is what you wanted, but the price is a little high. So you check out the ham, like the price, toss it in the cart and go merrily on your way. Watch out - you’ve just committed chain-weighted CPI. <br> This choice — turkey or ham — is at the heart of a political civil war because how we measure the Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines everything from the setting of tax brackets to cost-of-living adjustments for those receiving Social Security. Now that President Obama has proposed chained CPI in his latest budget, this arcane technical fix to the measurement of inflation has become the Battle of Gettysburg between those with fiscal concerns about Social Security and those without. Some progressives are even calling for primary opponents against other Democrats who support fixing Social Security with this change. <br> In the red glare of battle, truth is sometimes a casualty. We’ve assembled the five myths, and some much needed truth, about chained CPI. <br> Myth 1: It’s a radical new idea. Chained CPI is a commonly accepted cost-of-living index. It simply accounts for consumer choice when the price of one product rises and the price of a ready substitute does not. It acknowledges that if the price of orange juice rises by a quarter but the price of apple juice remains the same, some consumers will go with apple juice and not pay more. And it recognizes that some products (like gasoline) are less easy to substitute than others (like hot dogs). <br> Myth 2: It’s bureaucrats gone wild. Actually, the stat hounds at the Bureau of Labor Statistics make adjustments to the inflation formula all the time, including six major revisions since the CPI was created during World War I. Most major adjustments have led to lower estimates of inflation. What makes chained CPI different is that because of technical reasons, its adoption requires congressional approval. <br> Myth 3: It’s a huge benefit change. Chained CPI would shave only about 0.3 percent off of Social Security COLAs — and recent trends suggest it would be less. Over ten years, that would amount to roughly $100 billion in Social Security savings. Compared to the $11.1 trillion we are expected to spend, it’s about a 1 percent reduction. 
The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has maintained a clear position on immigration policy since the organization’s inception in 1979. We believe that immigration policy must be reformed and enforced in a manner that protects the interests of the American people. The interests of the American people include jobs, wages, tax dollars, vital social institutions like education and health care, and, yes, population growth and its impact on the environment and natural resources. <br> Over the years FAIR has been attacked by a variety of groups and individuals who see us as an impediment to achieving their political, ideological or economic goals through immigration policy. In Washington, being attacked is a clear acknowledgement of an organization’s effectiveness. <br> The latest round of smear attacks is being mounted by libertarian/cheap labor interests, including in an op-ed published in POLITICO by two representative of the American Principles Project (APP). Their aim is to drive a wedge between immigration policy groups like FAIR and conservatives in Congress who have generally supported our opposition to amnesty for illegal aliens and overall reductions in immigration. <br> The clumsy line of attack employed by this coalition is to try to discredit FAIR and like-minded organizations with political conservatives by claiming “that these groups are not conservative.” Of course, neither FAIR nor any of the other groups mentioned have ever claimed to be conservative, or liberal for that matter. <br> While the charge that FAIR is not conservative can best be described as comical, other assertions made by APP and other cheap labor front groups are downright malicious and unfounded. These smears attempt to link FAIR’s concerns about rapid U.S. population growth with malevolent policies of forced sterilization and eugenics – policies FAIR has never advocated and affirmatively rejects. <br> FAIR is, and always has been, an immigration policy group. In the 34 years the organization has been around we have attracted supporters and detractors from across the political spectrum. If arguing that our nation’s immigration policy should written and enforced in the interests of American workers and taxpayers, and should not lead to runaway population growth makes us controversial in the eyes of a radical fringe of either political party, then so be it. <br> The people who follow the immigration policy debate closely know FAIR and respect our work. That includes people who agree with our positions and those who do not. It includes conservative members of Congress, as well as those who consider themselves to be moderates and liberals. FAIR has been invited to testify before Congress on more than a hundred occasions by Republicans and Democrats. 
If we want true American exceptionalism, let’s fix immigration. <br> Carlos Gutierrez, on CNN’s “State of the Union” last weekend, had this to say: “If we get this right, the 21st century is ours. If we get it wrong, shame on us.” <br> He is spot on. Immigration reform will determine our economic future. <br> First-year business school students know that the key competitive question asked by the smartest CEOs is: “What is our competitive advantage?” <br> The 2012 election has given us a rare bipartisan chance to nail down an immigration advantage, which is why speedy reform is so important. <br> In order to keep America competitive — in order to remain “exceptional” — we must leverage the key strand of our national DNA: our global diversity. Our major national competitors are mostly homogeneous. Our diversity is our competitive advantage. Our blend of people and cultures and talent and perspectives can keep us the strongest, the smartest, the most advanced nation on Earth — if we have the right immigration policies. <br> Although I was brought here from Canada as a tot, I am a bona fide U.S. citizen and have lived here for almost 50 years. Every time I publish some thoughts, at least one clever commenter tells me to “go back to Canada.” <br> I’m pretty thick-skinned, but that closed mindset is crippling our country. Foreign-born students receive a third of all U.S. college degrees in engineering, and 27 percent of degrees in mathematics, computers and statistics. And lately, those students are taking their American education and skills to other countries and to other economies. <br> Gutierrez — a private sector guy who knows about brands — makes a crucial point: America can choose to close our borders and send immigrants away, or we can smartly take advantage of our ‘brand” as a country of immigrants. It’s who we are. <br> If you walk into the most innovative companies in the world, those in Silicon Valley, you will see that the workers, the engineers, the designers and the thought leaders come from everywhere on the planet. That’s their competitive advantage. Instead of a homogeneous design team pumping out bland products, their diverse people with the dynamism of different perspectives and experiences make products that are that much richer, more interesting and more thoughtfully crafted, which means they have a greater likelihood of global success. <br> Elsewhere, Pakistanis fight against Indians. Sunnis fight against Shiites. Greeks and the Turks. Iranians and Saudis. Israelis and Palestinians. Different cultures fight over ethnic and geographic grudges from the past. Here in America, they come together to build the future. <br> This is our history, and it is as fundamentally America as baseball and apple pie, and it is what makes us exceptional. Congress has this moment to capture it, bottle it and sell it to the globe. <br> And when they do, put on your seatbelts folks, and get ready for takeoff. Our immigration reform efforts will show the world whether we are indeed “exceptional.” <br> Jennifer Granholm is the former governor of Michigan, serving from 2003 to 2011.

In this post-election week — which happens to coincide with Global Entrepreneurship Week — it is a good time to look at what more the United States could and should be doing to raise the profile of entrepreneurship promotion as a key element of our foreign policy in an increasingly troubled and fragile world. The bottom line is that in the next term, the Obama administration needs to substantially expand on the start made in the first term to promote entrepreneurship as a way to create jobs, increase political stability and advance civil society in strategic countries like Egypt, Turkey, Colombia and Indonesia. <br> You would be hard-pressed to find an American who does not appreciate the fundamental relationship between entrepreneurship, job creation and economic growth. In fact, many consider entrepreneurship as American as apple pie — a fundamental, if not founding, American value. President Barack Obama even cited the equation in his victory speech last week, declaring that Americans want “a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation, with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow.” Indeed, Republicans and Democrats alike tout entrepreneurship as critical to addressing domestic unemployment and economic malaise. And rightly so. Nearly all net job growth in the past 25 years is attributable to firms less than five years old. Yet, despite all the evidence that entrepreneurship works at home, the U.S. government has yet to fully deploy the power of entrepreneurship in its foreign policy. <br> As a foreign policy tool, entrepreneurship is especially constructive. Overseas, small and medium enterprises account for 97 percent of jobs in emerging economies. Entrepreneurship creates jobs, and jobs are the underpinning of political stability, particularly in fragile states. This was most recently evidenced by the Arab Spring, where the lack of economic opportunity increased social frustration to a dramatic tipping point. In sub-Saharan Africa, annual economic growth dips of 5 percent have led to 50 percent increases in the likelihood of civil war. As youth unemployment continues to rise in the Middle East (over 26 percent in 2011), promoting entrepreneurship can help ensure democratic gains do not give way to political instability and radicalism. <br> America is as famous for its entrepreneurial know-how as it is for its movies and music. Even those who disapprove of U.S. policies the most still respect its entrepreneurial culture and spirit. A 2012 Pew Research Center report reveals that more than half of the populations in Lebanon (63 percent), Tunisia (59 percent), Jordan (59 percent) and Egypt (52 percent) admire the “American way of doing business” and respect Americans’ “scientific and technological prowess.” By sharing its expertise in entrepreneurship, the U.S. can contribute to a country’s growth and development while opening markets for American goods and investors. It’s a 21st-century Marshall Plan, but with a far lower price tag. 
Late in September, the Department of Commerce issued a preliminary decision to scrap a 16-year-old trade agreement governing the import of Mexican-grown tomatoes into the United States. That might seem like an obscure and prosaic federal government action to most people, but to those of us who have watched the evolution of the tomato market over the last few decades, it is really a startling departure whose impact could be devastating. <br> I say startling because the agreement, which the U.S. and Mexican governments adopted when I was Secretary of Commerce, has been one of the models of successful trade policy. Startling also because, if the U.S. government ultimately adopts the preliminary decision, it will reward a segment of the U.S. tomato growing industry that has simply not kept up with the innovation and quality of its counterparts in Mexico, likely set off a spiral of retaliation that will hurt American exporters of other commodities, and most certainly drive up the price of tomatoes here. What’s more, it will pick a fight with Mexico, one of our biggest trading partners, that we don’t need and can easily avoid. <br> This approach, in other words, seems to be guided by a simple, but misguided, principle: if it ain’t broke, break it, and break it bad. <br> I’m more than just a curious observer. Beyond my role in striking the 1996 agreement, my personal experience with the tomato industry goes back to 1968, when I was a young legal aid lawyer representing migrant workers who were literally slaving away in the tomato fields of Florida. I saw firsthand the conditions that led to the conviction of some Florida tomato growers for involuntary servitude — that’s right, slavery in the modern day. As journalist Barry Estabrook documented in his 2011 book “Tomatoland,” accusations of slave-like labor practices continued to plague the industry in recent years. <br> The Florida growers — who represent only a small fraction of the overall U.S. growers — have been trying for decades to block competition from Mexico. With the Florida growers in mind, we designed the ’96 agreement to protect them by preventing Mexico from flooding the U.S. market with tomatoes far below market price. Since then there have been no violations, and the price floor prescribed in the agreement has been revised twice to reflect changing conditions. Nearly everyone on both sides of the border will say that it has worked to their benefit. 
When it comes to determining how best to meet our future energy needs, there are no Republican solutions, nor Democratic solutions. That’s why I believe leveraging the presidential election to turn U.S. energy policy into the latest political football is bad for America. <br> Consider the current debate on natural gas. Republicans recently tried to paint the Obama administration as opponents of the fuel. They cited the Department of Energy’s recent delay of a report on the economics of exporting natural gas, which was pushed back from a March 2012 release date, because of complexities in assessing the global natural-gas marketplace. It’s now going to be released after the election, and Republicans say it’s an attempt to punt the debate. <br> Yet, what Republicans conveniently ignore is that the Obama administration’s new power plant rules are crafted in a way that ensure all new facilities will run on natural gas, not coal or even alternative energy sources. While such a mandate may bring unintended consequences and needs to be closely examined, suggesting President Obama is against natural gas doesn’t pass the smell test. <br> This is precisely the kind of election-year stunt that undermines earnest attempts to develop energy proposals, on which both parties should be able to agree. Americans deserve better. <br> In this election year, both Democrats and Republicans proclaim to support plans that include a wide mix on energy sources. You just have to drive by a gas station and see the ever-increasing price for a gallon of gas to realize that our current dependence on foreign oil is bad for our wallet, not to mention a myopic foreign policy. Electricity bills are on the rise as well. <br> Most Democrats want natural gas to be part of our energy solution, but don’t want to put all of our eggs in that basket. Those of us who were on the front lines in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita saw firsthand just how volatile natural gas costs can be. As natural gas prices reached record highs, it was clear that we needed a diversified energy portfolio to keep America powered. <br> The best approach is one that galvanizes numerous industries to develop scenarios, and then to assess all based on their price, viability and environmental impact. The fact remains that no one single fuel is perfect (even natural gas), and that all energy sources bring certain risks and rewards. <br> But there is a right way and a wrong way to determine which products are best for American families, the environment and our economy. The right way is to allow energy producers to develop their products in the open market. The wrong way, and the one we have seen too often in recent months, is to insert political pressure and try to paint one solution as the only way to move our country away from our dependence on foreign energy. 
A decision on whether to bring a potentially historic antitrust case against Google is imminent, and the Federal Trade Commission will be judged, for better or worse, on what it decides. <br> At a recent Technology Policy Institute conference, former FTC Chairman William Kovacic lamented that antitrust agencies are too often evaluated on the number of cases they bring — especially big cases — which he analogized to evaluating airlines on the basis of departures rather than arrivals. “You are whom you sue,” Kovacic suggested, is not a meaningful measure of agency performance. A better measure is whether the suits yield benefits for consumers. <br> After investigating for more than a year, and with the European Union already in settlement talks, the FTC may find it difficult to drop the Google case. But that’s what responsible agencies do when the evidence is lacking and no possible remedy is likely to benefit consumers. Just because the FTC may be able to claim a scalp doesn’t mean it should. <br> The principal complaint against Google is inextricably intertwined with Google’s attempts to innovate and better serve its users by directly answering their queries rather than simply referring users to other sites. For example, when users search for travel information, Google now provides a list of the best flights in addition to links to other travel sites. Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, provides similar information in its search results. <br> Despite the fact that consumers have welcomed this practice, it is the basis for the allegation that Google favors its own content and that its searches are “biased.” This complaint comes principally from Google’s competitors in specialized search. In a recent op-ed, for example, Jeffrey Katz, CEO of price-comparison site Nextag, complained that Google promotes its “less relevant and inferior” service instead of Nextag’s, which Katz asserts is “better.” Katz wants Google to work “the way it used to work,” which presumably means going back to showing 10 blue links. That is clearly not a recipe for innovation. <br> Although antitrust should focus on consumers and not competitors, it should be noted that specialty search sites like Kayak and Yelp have been doing very well and have had successful IPOs, even as they complain to the FTC about Google’s supposedly anticompetitive practices. (Nextag is not a public company, so details about its finances are not available.) 
Unless members of Congress take immediate action to address the threat of the process known as sequestration, mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts will go into effect on Jan. 2, 2013, that will weaken national security, hamstring our system of justice and ruin any opportunity our nation has for timely economic recovery. <br> Legislation in 2011 created a bipartisan congressional committee tasked with crafting a comprehensive, multiyear, deficit-reduction plan. Failure of the committee to recommend and Congress and the president to accede to a budget plan would trigger deep and undesirable automatic reductions in spending — sequestration of funds — to nearly all federal programs. At the beginning of 2013, most defense spending and nondefense spending would be slashed 9.4 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively. <br> As lawyers, we are particularly concerned with the devastating impact that sequestration would have on our entire justice system. Basic government functions that keep our streets safe, enforce our laws and maintain access to justice are vulnerable. <br> Sequestration would gut the Department of Justice — and the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Drug Enforcement Administration; and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with it. The FBI has foiled at least 30 separate terror plots since Sept. 11. In addition to investigating domestic and international terrorism, the FBI investigates public corruption and human trafficking. The DEA and ATF investigate drug crime, pursue violent gangs and work in cooperation with other agencies to secure our borders. <br> It is estimated that sequestration would cost the DOJ, FBI, DEA and ATF some 3,700 agents and U.S. marshals. Nearly 1,000 attorneys would be asked to stop protecting the homeland and start applying for new jobs. Sequestration would put the United States in the vulnerable position of having to choose what kinds of serious crimes to prevent. <br> Federal programs that give states the resources to hire police officers and prosecutors to take violent criminals off the streets would be severely diminished. Initiatives such as state and local law enforcement assistance programs, juvenile justice programs and efforts to combat sexual and domestic violence that have already endured budget cuts would be scaled back even further. <br> Funds to buy bulletproof vests for police, hire prosecutors and defenders at the state and local level, and monitor child predators are on the chopping block. So, too, are youth violence prevention programs to address bullying, substance abuse and gangs. Individuals escaping from domestic or sexual violence would be doubly victimized by the deep expected cuts to the Legal Assistance for Victims programs that provide, for example, civil legal services to victims; and by reductions in grant programs to hire and train police, prosecutors and courts. <br> Sequestration also would roll back one of the signature achievements of the past Congress by reducing funding for the bipartisan Second Chance Act, which uses public-private partnerships to reduce recidivism through programs that provide education, skills and job training, mental health and substance abuse counseling and housing services. With more than 650,000 prisoners released in the United States each year and two-thirds re-entering prison within three years, we should work to ensure that those who serve their time become contributing members of society. 
Every four years we hold these truths to be self-evident: this is the most important presidential election in history, and this is the dirtiest, most negative campaign on record. <br> It may actually be true this time. The ads themselves are not only reaching a new low but, even worse, are pedestrian, Pavlovian and tiresome— devoid of any measure of creativity. We can debate whether these are the most negative ads since TV started, but there is no doubt they are the most predictable, boring, boiler plate ads ever. Plus, they’ve gone from misleading and twisting the truth to blatant lying. It used to be embarrassing to be called out by legitimate fact checkers. Now it’s a badge of honor. <br> As one of the few who has straddled the fence between “Madison Avenue” and political for 30-plus years, I’ve often defended political ads and their makers at major ad industry conferences, much to my detriment at mealtime, since Mad Ave thinks the politicos are a blight on the profession. But now I have to recant. Joe Kennedy once said, “We’re going to sell Jack like soap flakes.” <br> It’s time to bring back the guys who sell soap flakes. <br> It wasn’t always this way. Starting in 1952,Madison Avenue was in charge of presidential ads, but that model died more than two decades ago thanks to the rise of a professional political priesthood, which out smarted the agency people and took control. They convinced candidates that political ads were a breed apart and couldn’t be trusted to Madison Ave — which took months, not days or hours — to produce a spot and whose production cost for a 30-second spot topped most feature films at Sundance. That message resonated, so they began monopolizing House, Senate and gubernatorial races. When their clients won, they’d be grateful and loyal as they rose up the electoral food chain. Ultimately, presidential candidates, too, questioned our value. Now both sides and the super PAC’s may have one or two token Mad Men, but the politicos have all the power. <br> You see the results 24/7 if, God forbid, you live in a battleground state. Regardless of party or candidate, it looks like one person did them all. The same charges and so’s-your-old-man counter charges. The same distorted pictures of the opponent, the same creepy music, the same nasty, sarcastic voice overs (now frequently women), the same typed reinforcement at the bottom of the screen, in case you’re deaf. The same kind of out-of-context candidate clips, and the same newspaper headlines to prove the point. And in case you didn’t get the message the first or second time, you’ll have 50 more opportunities. The irony is that the candidates and pundits are always telling us how smart and discerning voters are. Ha. (However, if you’re lucky enough to own a TV station in these states you’re probably already customizing your new yacht and G-4.) 
When Congress left for its August recess, it neglected to act on a bill that could help support the U.S. economy and American jobs. Granting permanent normal trade relations to Russia would do just that — and has broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate. <br> Approving permanent normal trade relations (PNTR), coupled with graduating Russia from the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik amendment, is necessary if the U.S. is to get all the economic benefits of Russia’s membership in the World Trade Organization. Russia formally joined the WTO on Aug. 22, following 18 years of negotiations — in which we each engaged while serving as U.S. trade representative. <br> This landmark achievement finally brings the world’s ninth-largest economy into the community of nations that have agreed to abide by international trade rules and procedures. In addition to lowering many tariffs, the Russians have agreed to comply with international standards on intellectual property protection and to abide by the WTO’s rules and dispute-settlement procedures, as well as many other market-opening provisions. <br> Until Congress approves PNTR, however, and graduates Russia from Jackson-Vanik, the U.S. cannot claim all the benefits of having Russia take on the obligations that come with WTO membership. Meanwhile, the other 150-plus WTO countries, including our biggest competitors, will most likely press their advantage in the Russian market to land contracts and win new opportunities for their exporters — at the expense of U.S. workers, farmers, service providers and manufacturers. <br> The demand for foreign goods and services in Russia is strong and growing. It has an estimated $400 billion import market and is home to roughly 142 million people, about one-fifth belonging to a rapidly growing middle class. <br> The U.S. has “underperformed” in the Russian market. Estimated U.S. exports of goods and services to Russia in 2011 reached $11 billion — making it only our 31st-largest goods export market. <br> There is clear opportunity for improvement — and PNTR is a prerequisite for progress. In fact, with PNTR, it is estimated that U.S. exports could double to $22 billion by 2017, providing U.S. workers, farmers and businesses a significant opportunity to expand their sales to Russia, supporting American jobs and helping to strengthen U.S.-Russia commercial relations. <br> This delay in both the House and the Senate has been particularly disappointing, given that the bill has received wide bipartisan support. The Senate Finance Committee approved it in July by a unanimous vote. Soon after, a House Ways and Means Committee voice vote was near unanimous. <br> With September here, and the pre-election congressional recess looming, the clock is running on a timely approval. We can put the most recent delay behind us — along with its negative impact on U.S. exports to the Russian market — but only if these few weeks do not stretch into several months or more. <br> Such a lengthy gap would create a significant economic disadvantage for the U.S. in the Russian market that could take years to turn around. It wouldn’t affect the Russians. Only U.S. businesses, farmers and workers would get hurt. <br> Quick approval of PNTR is clearly in the national interest. Congress should make it a priority and get it done in September without further delay. <br> Ambassadors Charlene Barshefsky and Susan C. Schwab are former U.S. trade representatives. Barshefsky served in the Clinton administration. Schwab served in the George W. Bush administration. 
In Washington today, a new lobby called the ITC Working Group — made up of the big high-tech importers Apple, Google, HP, Intel, Cisco, Avaya, Broadcom, and Oracle, and others - is urging Congress to restrict the right of some patent holders to ask the International Trade Commission (ITC) to bar the importation of products that infringe their patents. <br> They argue that following the Supreme Court’s eBay Inc. v. MercExchange decision in 2006, which limited the grounds upon which federal courts can bar the sale of infringing products, a “stampede” and “avalanche” of “non-practicing entities” (NPEs) - patent holders who don’t make products but instead license their technology for others to do so - have swamped the ITC instead with spurious claims of infringement. <br> Is there any truth to these claims? This is not an idle question for today’s business leaders and policy makers, because the remedies being proposed by these former startups-turned- incumbents could have lasting effects on America’s future as the world’s pre-eminent innovator - and possibly also prevent the next generation of startups from ever getting off the ground. <br> I testified before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on this matter in July, and would here like to provide readers with the evidence in a just-released report by the ITC. <br> Although its caseload has certainly increased in recent years, the ITC found that NPEs were not responsible for it. According to its report, Category 1 NPEs - which the ITC defines as “inventors who may have done research and development or built prototypes … research institutions such as universities and laboratories … and start-ups that possess IP rights but do not yet manufacture a product” - accounted for only 10 percent of the caseload since 2006. Meanwhile, Category 2 NPEs - firms “whose business model primarily focuses on purchasing and asserting patents” - accounted for only eight percent of the ITC caseload. <br> Instead, the real source of its caseload surge, the ITC found, was a nearly 500 percent increase in filings from non-NPEs like the Big Tech importers in the ITC Working Group lobby. Since the eBay decision on May 15, 2006, a grand total of three NPE-initiated exclusion orders have been granted out of 258 cases - one to Rambus, one to the technology transfer office of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and one to Tessera, my employer, which last year spent $75 million a year (30 percent of its revenues) on research and development while licensing our semiconductor breakthroughs to manufacturers overseas. 
The placid political waters of the Cayman Islands were roiled recently by an unprecedented announcement. Premier McKenna Bush instituted an expatriate-only payroll tax of 10 percent — immediately sparking an outcry among the wealthy people and international corporations that have built the Caymans’ massive financial sector on the premise of a tax-free paradise. More than 9,000 mutual funds, 260 banks and 80,000 companies are now based on an island of roughly 54,000 people. <br> While this move is rooted in the island’s budget wrangling with London, it comes just as such “offshore financial centers” are under increasing scrutiny for their role in an international financial system tainted by suspicion and scandal. From tax dodging to money laundering, from shady derivatives trading to the manipulation of the LIBOR rate, the lack of transparency and effective regulation in world finance has led to serious problems. <br> In U.S. politics, places like the Cayman Islands have emerged as rhetorical weapons for campaign attacks on the evils of corporate tax evasion and outsourcing. President Barack Obama has long made clamping down on offshore tax havens a priority, regularly citing the issue in the 2008 race and, once elected, promoting aggressive tax code changes to reduce U.S. companies’ ability to shelter profits from taxes by keeping them overseas. <br> Now, of course, the Obama campaign has pounded former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for his Cayman Island accounts, using them to attack what many see as a culture of unscrupulous selfishness among a global elite. Combined with persistent questions about Romney’s refusal to release his tax returns, the implied charges of shady financial dealings could add up to a potent character weakness for his campaign. <br> However, since the Cayman’s new tax only targets wages, it would leave the passive investments and corporate profits of the super-rich, like Romney, untouched. And this is really where the action is. Between $21 billion and $32 trillion is hidden offshore each year, the watchdog group Tax Justice Network estimates, meaning nearly $200 billion of lost government taxes annually. <br> These lost revenues, however, are just the tip of the iceberg of an international financial system that has grown so sprawling, complex and secretive that regulators face a near-impossible task. That’s the way many financial players – legitimate and otherwise – want it. <br> Not only do criminal enterprises benefit from no-questions-asked banking. But international corporations take advantage of it to streamline global operations with a minimum of red tape. These multinationals lobby against greater regulation — arguing that these liberties grease the wheels of international trade and promote growth. <br> They may have a point – but it has a dark side. As tax evasion and other white-collar crimes sap government revenue, this lack of transparency also facilitates money laundering, terrorist financing and political corruption. <br> Indeed, money laundering is the linchpin of the criminal universe. Without it, the billions generated by drug sales, human trafficking and the like would be trapped in the unwieldy form of cash. But once it enters the global financial system – whether through the fabricated profits of shell companies or unmonitored deposits – it becomes infinitely more useful. It can be used to pay suppliers, manage international criminal supply chains, fund preferred politicians and make legal investments in legitimate activities — that then get funneled back into the original criminal enterprise. 
The Beatles wrote, “Money can’t buy me love.” And they’re right — particularly in politics. <br> It’s not that unusual for a candidate to significantly outspend his opponent — and lose. <br> This happened recently in the Democratic congressional primary for the new 33rd District in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area of North Texas. <br> A wealthy Dallas trial lawyer, Domingo Garcia, spent $1.8 million of his own money, first in the primary and then in the runoff election there. Ft. Worth State Rep. Marc Veasey, who is African-American, ran against him and raised $950,000 for the two races. He defeated Garcia 53 percent to 47 percent in the runoff. <br> The district is more than 80 percent minority, so the winner of the Democratic runoff will be the new congressman. <br> On paper, the new district appeared to favor Garcia. It was 61.8 percent voting age Latino and 17.8 percent black. Even when citizenship was factored in, the district was 39 percent Latino and 25 percent black. However, a strong, smart turnout effort in the black community could make up the difference. <br> Veasey worked on my congressional staff for six years before winning a seat in the Texas Legislature in 2004. He had to accomplish three things this year to defeat his wealthy opponent: (1) raise enough money to be competitive (2) maximize the black vote, which was largely in his current State House district and (3) carry the white vote, potentially the swing element. <br> Though the Latino population significantly outnumbered the African-American vote, the Lone Star Project, run by a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee staff director, Matt Angle, predicted early on that Veasey could win with the right kind of campaign — given the high turnout nature of his current State House district in Ft. Worth. <br> Garcia, it turned out, wasted much of the total amount he spent. He ultimately raised another $300,000, bringing his total outlays to $2.1 million. But he committed major blunders that helped Veasey level the playing field. <br> First, Garcia helped Veasey raise the critical mass he needed to be competitive (a candidate generally can be outspent 2-1 and still have a reasonable chance) by attacking two of the district’s largest employers, General Motors and Lockheed Martin, as being greedy corporations. Both companies have large unionized workforces. So this galvanized labor’s financial support for Veasey and helped him raise even more money in Ft. Worth — where the local business community views Lockheed Martin as apple pie and motherhood all rolled in one. 
Texas Gov. Rick Perry has pledged he won’t create a state health insurance exchange or implement the optional Medicaid expansion — both components of the recently upheld Affordable Care Act. So far, only 16 states have begun creating insurance exchanges. Eighteen are considering it, four have pledged not to and 13 have yet to announce their intentions. <br> This is a shame, because health insurance exchanges are a great idea. As a venture capitalist focused on health care information technology, I’m always looking for ways to create efficiencies and cut costs in our health system — and exchanges are a promising way to do this. <br> Exchanges create a transparent, easy-to-shop place for consumers to purchase health insurance from competing plans. Exchange rules standardize the “models” that participating plans can offer, calling for bronze, silver, gold and platinum levels that correspond to price and benefit levels. This allows for apples-to-apples comparisons between insurance offerings, instead of the murky confusion that plan selection involves today. <br> Increasing transparency and choice for consumers is likely to make exchanges popular. More important, exchanges will most likely save money by driving inefficient, antiquated practices that have nothing to do with medical care out of the health insurance industry. <br> This is because distribution of health insurance to individuals and employees of small companies remains extremely expensive. Insurance carriers spend $25 billion per year solely on sales and distribution — that is, getting health insurance plans into the hands of consumers before a single medical claim is filed. <br> This is far more than in other financial sectors, on a relative percent of premium basis. Commissions for sales agents range from 8 percent to 12 percent of the premium in the individual and small group markets — for which exchanges are designed. <br> Expensive, inefficient distribution persists because IT innovations that have revolutionized markets for everything from stock trading to car buying to taking out a home mortgage loan haven’t yet transformed health insurance. Only 5 percent of consumers, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, have bought health insurance online, compared with 17 percent for car insurance and 45 percent for airline tickets. 
Privacy? The government has an app for that. <br> Well, to be precise: The Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced last week that mobile apps and privacy will be the first issue considered in the White House plan for enforceable privacy codes of conduct. Leading players in industry, consumer and advocacy groups and academia are due in Washington in mid-July to begin developing rules to protect the privacy of app users. <br> The fact that the Obama administration wants to look first at mobile privacy in devising a privacy bill of rights demonstrates how ubiquitous apps have become and the privacy risks they create. <br> Online stores now offer hundreds of thousands of apps, and billions have been downloaded. Yet the ground rules for personal privacy and consumers’ control over personal information are far from clear. <br> Like so much modern technology, no one thought about setting baseline rules on privacy. App stores now have some policies in place, but without consistent rules to cover the many participants in the mobile ecosystem, personal data is flowing through apps — including locations, address books, texts, emails and other highly personal information. Popular apps have been caught uploading users’ address books without asking permission. Advertising companies can bypass mobile browser privacy settings to track users. <br> The greatest sin of most online ad models is that they can verge on being creepy when ads seem to know too much. But the missteps of a naive app developer can create serious problems. <br> Ad networks, analytics companies, device manufacturers and location service providers collect and use consumer data, creating confusion over who is responsible for making sure consumers know. Despite an agreement between leading app stores and the California attorney general, many apps still lack privacy policies. <br> Plenty of companies in the app ecosystem want to do the right thing when it comes to privacy. A recent gathering of app developers at Stanford showed how eager many people are to learn how to protect consumers. They realize that unless consumers can trust them, the entire app economy could be jeopardized. That’s one reason for the traffic on www.applicationprivacy.org to learn about privacy. <br> The Washington conference is designed to bring together diverse points of view. Some privacy advocates most likely will call for the strictest controls. Some developers — and advertising companies that support them — very likely will argue for a more laissez-faire arrangement. 
As election 2012 progresses, there’s continuing hubbub about the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which paved the way for super PACs. Proponents of campaign-finance laws see the ruling as opening the floodgates for unlimited, often undisclosed, money to overwhelm our political system. Opponents view it as a victory of free speech over government regulation. <br> Where does the truth lie? While super PACs may be “speaking” up a storm, it’s now difficult to hear anyone else. That can’t be good in a representative democracy, which has long prided itself on protecting free speech. <br> A quick tour through the campaign-finance law landscape demonstrates there is much to be concerned about — unless you’re a wealthy donor or well-funded corporation. <br> It begins with the Supreme Court’s seminal 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision. The court analyzed the constitutionality of Congress’s first comprehensive campaign-finance scheme, passed in the wake of Watergate. It essentially found that money spent in elections ? both by candidates and independent groups ? should be treated as speech and protected by the First Amendment. So expenditure limits are virtually guaranteed to be found invalid. But campaign contributions are less “speechy” and so subject to a slightly lower level of review. That’s why courts often uphold contribution limits. <br> This created the “ Buckley bifurcated framework,” which managed to unify critics on both sides of the campaign-finance divide. Each found something to deride. <br> Regulation proponents decried equating money with speech while striking down expenditure limits. They rightly predicted this would lead to endless fundraising. Regulation opponents condemned the contribution limits, which, in their view, allowed government to trample speech rights. <br> But a decision made in the name of protecting speech rights actually did the opposite. Now it’s the people with the most money who can speak longest and loudest. <br> Here are just two among many problems that were created. <br> First, limits on spending are not limits on pure expression. If I limit the amount of money you can spend, you can still speak — if at a lower volume. If I limit whether you can say something, then I’ve limited your speech. Don’t pretend these are the same. <br> Second, unlimited spending, far from protecting speech rights, actually harms them. For example, if a group debates in that town square and only one has a microphone, that’s the person heard. Others may be screaming, but they’re no match. <br> It’s also true in the political marketplace. We overwhelmingly hear those who amplify their views by spending money. It hurts the ability of the rest of us (candidates and public) to present our views. We are, in effect, drowned out by money. 
There is a yin and a yang to two recent cultural politics stories: first, President Barack Obama endorsing same-sex marriage, and then Mitt Romney being outed as an old-fashioned high school bully. The timing was uncanny, juxtaposing an Obama depicted as extending hope and promise to gays and lesbians with a Romney whose bullying past was tinged with homophobia. <br> Obama’s reflective “evolution” provided a sharp contrast with Romney’s teenage “pranks” — yet the common thread between these two stories isn’t only gay rights. It’s about two issues that have evolved — to borrow a phrase — in the public sphere. And about how Romney hasn’t. <br> Bullying is as American as, if not apple pie then at least as the many movies that have immortalized it. (You show me an ’80s teen comedy, I’ll show you a movie with a preppy, blond popped-collar bully). Whether they’re taking lunch money from George McFly, sweeping Ralph Macchio’s leg, outlawing sweatpants on Monday or being mega-bitches just because they can be, these bullies are clearly the villains. <br> They’re also drawn from a common experience. Movie bullying may be cartoonish, but it clearly evokes real-life bullying. And real-life bullying has gotten a great deal of attention lately — what with The Trevor Project, It Gets Better, the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights and the powerful documentary “ Bully.” <br> There are 13 million kids bullied in this country every year, some, tragically, to the point of suicide. It is to be taken seriously. <br> And yet Romney’s response to The Washington Post story — which detailed how he allegedly led a pack of boys in pinning down another student, described as effeminate and presumed to be gay, to cut off his dyed blond hair, and also how he once led a near-blind teacher smack into a door — was rather unserious. <br> “I participated in a lot of hijinks and pranks in high school,” Romney said to Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade. “Some may have gone too far and for that I apologize.” <br> Romney said he did not recall the incidents described. “Back in high school,” he explained, “I just did some dumb things, and if anybody was hurt by that or offended by it, obviously I apologize.” <br> As apologies go, it was pretty weak — both minimizing the alleged offense (hijinks/pranks) and the magnitude of its effect (“if anybody was hurt or offended,” “some might have gone too far”). <br> But the behavior that matters isn’t what might have transpired in 1965. It’s what Romney says and does in 2012, when he is running for president, that counts. <br> Many have pointed out that this was a missed opportunity for Romney to display empathy. (See David Letterman’s “Other Hilarious Pranks Pulled By Mitt Romney”: “As a sophomore in high school, Mitt Romney cut the brake lines of his lab partner Ted’s car.” Ouch.) But even more, it was a missed opportunity for Romney to display modernity. <br> The New York Times noted the gulf between then and now: “Even at his otherwise-strict school, pranks were tolerated with boys-will-be-boys indulgence, and the term ‘bullying’ was decades away from being a subject for assemblies and school psychologists.” 
The U.S. wireless industry plays a vital role in Americans’ lives and in America’s economy. <br> More than 40,000 of the world’s wireless industry experts, policymakers and enthusiasts were in New Orleans recently for International CTIA WIRELESS 2012. A stream of new and cool wireless products and services were unveiled, including announcements by ATT’s Connected House, MasterCard’s PayPass Wallet, HTC’s Droid Incredible 4G and Samsung’s Focus 2. <br> The announcement of these products seems like a beginning but the reality is that product announcements are long in the making. Part of the reason for that is because of the need for spectrum, the fuel for the wireless industry and its “virtuous cycle” of innovation. As long as our members have access to spectrum, the networks are upgraded to be faster and handle more capacity. Then the device manufacturers create new capabilities. Content creators then develop new uses and apps, so consumers can benefit from all of it. But it all starts with spectrum. <br> Some have accused us of “playing a game” when talking about the looming spectrum crisis. That is ridiculous for two simple reasons. <br> First, spectrum is the key element to addressing the “hockey stick” of demand we face in terms of usage, users and use. If there were a more effective solution, which would allow carriers to avoid spending billions of dollars at auction, our carriers would be deploying it. <br> As the Information Technology Innovation Foundation’s senior research fellow, Richard Bennett, explained in a recent blog post, if there were a cheaper solution that would perform in any spectrum bands, “any such company would rule the market for smartphone service in short order. … The reason this hasn’t happened is that it’s simply not possible with the technology we have today. … The communications industry has made steady progress toward improving radio efficiency for a hundred years. … but the constraints are very real.” <br> Second, if the looming spectrum crisis is a “game,” then it’s one that involves a number of other countries around the world. Countries like Germany, France, South Korea, Japan and Canada are bringing an additional 120-400 MHz of spectrum to market for their wireless industries. This disparity is even more stark when you consider that the U.S. has a larger population than any of these other countries and that our wireless users talk more, at lower cost, than their counterparts in Europe and Asia. With more subscribers and more usage, but less spectrum in the pipeline, it’s clear that we need to address this disparity or risk ceding the leadership position we currently enjoy. 
It’s no secret that the Internet has fundamentally changed how people live and the way businesses operate. Amazingly, government hasn’t gotten the message. <br> Critical government programs remain stuck in the past. Consider food stamp assistance — which could be significantly improved through the Internet. <br> Americans who depend on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — known as food stamps — are unable to buy groceries from online vendors. The Electronic Benefits Transfer, the system that allows SNAP recipients to pay for groceries, does not support Internet transactions. <br> But Congress now has a unique opportunity to change this and bring some relief to millions of people. <br> A provision in the Senate farm bill, now making its way through the legislative process, would launch a pilot program to test and eventually give recipients of SNAP benefits the same access as every other American to online grocery retailers. More food stamp recipients then would be able to purchase fresh, healthful and quality food. <br> This important measure could help ensure that the millions of Americans who rely on nutrition assistance programs every year — including many elderly or disabled, who require delivery services — have a modern, convenient way in which to buy good food. <br> The effect could be enormous. More than 46 million Americans received food stamps in January, according to Agriculture Department statistics. The number of recipients has risen steadily throughout the economic crisis — 31.9 million used the program in January 2009. <br> Though unemployment has recently declined, food stamp enrollment in 2011 reached an all-time high, according to a report by Bloomberg Government. Historically, enrollment in SNAP has risen and fallen in tandem with unemployment . But as more Americans find themselves underemployed, an increasing number of them are depending on food assistance. <br> In New York, the situation is no better. More than 1.8 million New Yorkers relied on food stamps in March of 2011, according to the New York City Human Resources Administration, up from 1.1 million in 2007. <br> I co-founded FreshDirect, one of the largest online food retailers in the New York City area, and we want to expand access to fresh, healthful foods throughout the region. We would like our groceries available to all who depend on food stamps. <br> We also believe the way to decrease the skyrocketing rates of obesity and diabetes that plague so many in low-income neighborhoods is to make healthful foods more accessible and convenient. <br> FreshDirect has advocated for food stamp modernization for many years. This legislation could be the first step to bringing healthful food to food stamp recipients. <br> If Congress passes this important farm bill provision, we are ready to participate in the online EBT pilot program. Updating the food stamp system to allow recipients to purchase groceries online is not just a convenience in this difficult economy — it is a necessity. <br> More and more, statistics show, food stamp recipients are not necessarily unemployed. Rather, they are low-income workers — balancing part-time jobs and parenting. They may not have the time or the means to trek to a grocery store in another neighborhood to buy fresh, healthful food. <br> Congress must act now to ensure that all Americans have an easier and more reliable way of getting quality food. FreshDirect will be there — to support this long overdue change. <br> Jason Ackerman is co-founder and chief executive officer of FreshDirect. 
Microsoft and Facebook, as the news headlines proclaim, just signed a $550 million patent pact to hem in Google. This follows Microsoft’s recent $1.1-billion purchase of AOL patents and spotlights the high-stakes patent war among the tech titans to gain legal leverage in the fight for dominance in smartphone and Internet markets. <br> Yet to read the editorials — including a much-cited op-ed by Andy Kessler in the April 12 Wall Street Journal — or judge from recent Capitol Hill actions, you would think the tech giants are acquiring patents for an entirely different reason. Never mind that these multinationals have already launched a circular firing squad of patent suits against each other — more than a hundred filed so far. The real reason for all this smartphone litigiousness, commentators like Kessler insist, are “patent trolls [who] don’t sell products or services [and] are a pain in the side of those who do.” <br> Which is rather like claiming that World War I was caused by a minor Austrian archduke named Ferdinand rather than the great power rivalries of the major European nations. <br> These analysts urge us to look back to the wisdom of the Founders and, as Kessler puts it, “require patent holders to actually make or sell products before citing infringement.” <br> What? It was the Founders who created the world’s first patent system in which small innovators who did not have the capital or the business model to commercialize their own inventions could still profit from invention by licensing or selling their patents to enterprises that did. <br> The Founders granted patent rights to “non-practicing entities” — in those days mostly poor but technically-inventive farmers, workers and artisans — because they hoped to spark a surge of innovation activity among the citizens of our young and underdeveloped nation. <br> Their gamble paid off. By 1865, the U.S. per capita patenting rate was triple that of Britain’s, and America had surged past Britain to become the leader of the Industrial Revolution. Patent assignment records from the 19th century show that more than two-thirds of the 160 “great inventors” of the Industrial Revolution — including Thomas Edison — were “non-practicing entities,” who licensed many of their patents to others rather than commercialize these themselves. 
 What POLITICO described as “ Tech firms behaving badly” (April 23) could more accurately be described as “regulators gone wild.” <br> For whatever reason, the Obama administration is using ambiguous antitrust laws as a club against America’s top technology companies who are trying to serve consumer needs. We need some introspection when ATT pays $4 billion to a foreign company because our government surprisingly nixes a merger, and our Justice Department sues Apple for providing consumers with cheaper eBooks and accuses Google of “monopolizing” the highly competitive world of search. <br> These are just some in a long line of misguided attacks on successful technology firms (see Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm, etc.) and further evidence of misplaced priorities in Washington. <br> The rest of the world envies our tech prowess even as our own government leads the attack on these same world-class firms. This is national economic suicide. We need first to do no harm to our own national competitiveness, rather than lead the world in attacks on our best companies. <br> Gary Shapiro <br> President and Chief Executive Officer <br> Consumer Electronics Association 
Counterfeiters are in the business of deception. It’s safe to surmise that counterfeiters operate with the single goal to deceive the public, consumers and businesses to buy inauthentic, cheaply made — and thus sometimes dangerous — items. <br> Where the deception should end, however, is at law enforcement’s door. There are varying degrees of sophistication among counterfeiters — from crude knock-offs to refined, hard-to-spot fakes — that are challenging U.S. law enforcement every day at our border crossings and ports. <br> When a suspected fake was spotted in years past, U.S. Customs and Border Protection would seek guidance from the most knowledgeable expert on the product: the rights holder. In that capacity, the rights holder would be allowed to examine the product and pronounce its authenticity or inauthenticity. <br> In 2008, unfortunately, a new interpretation of the Trade Secrets Act closed the open line of communication between CBP and these experts and rights holders. Today, our law enforcement must fight the war against counterfeits with one hand tied behind its back. <br> It’s unreasonable to expect law enforcement to know the intricacies of every pair of sneakers, children’s toy and fire alarm. Yet now they cannot get help from the companies that make these products, under our most trusted brands. <br> Not only is there a delay in resolving suspected fake shipments, this red tape also delays legitimate trade and commerce. Real shipments of authentic goods, from pharmaceuticals to video games, are potentially being held up under this new, cumbersome authentication process. <br> Protection of innovation and intellectual property does not—and should not—have to be this difficult. This is precisely why Reps. Ted Poe (R-Texas) and Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) last week introduced the Foreign Counterfeit Prevention Act. The House Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing about it today. <br> This legislation ensures that common sense aligns with IP protection at our borders, again allowing customs officers to access information and expertise from those potentially being stolen from. <br> This act is a win all around. It is designed to give CBP the necessary resources to ensure that deceptive and sometimes even dangerous fakes don’t make it into our homes. It is devised to streamline and expedite legitimate shipments and trade, and will likely uphold the intellectual property that supports millions of U.S. jobs and companies. <br> It’s one thing if the counterfeiters are deceiving us — but another if we’re deceiving ourselves. Counterfeiting and piracy is not a victimless crime when consumer health, jobs and commerce are on the line. <br> It has become clear that preventing law enforcement from talking to the rights holder is not a best practice. We need a logical, good-government approach to IP enforcement and this act can provide it. <br> Mark Elliot is executive vice president of the Global Intellectual Property Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
America has always offered immense opportunity because innovators have had the ability to take risks, work hard and be rewarded for it. Innovators, entrepreneurs and small-business people built the framework for American success, creating legacies lasting generations. <br> Companies like Ford, Apple and Boeing started as small businesses and became industry leaders, creating high-quality jobs and boosting economic growth. More recently, companies like Google and Facebook were launched by a single idea and then revolutionized the way we live. <br> The entrepreneurs who had these ideas are the key ingredient in the formula for success and opportunity in America. Each one took a risk and did whatever they needed to do to make it work. In the process, they helped thousands — if not millions — of families, neighbors and friends. <br> Those who earn their success not only create good jobs and services that improve our lives, they give back and help everyone move just a little bit further up the ladder of success. <br> Yet, today, the ability of an individual to take a risk and create a small business or startup company is threatened because of the barrage of red tape and uncertainty — much of it from Washington. <br> Since 1980, startup firms less than five years old have created the vast majority of new jobs in this country, nearly 40 million of them, according to the Kauffman Foundation. The past few years however, have seen a 23 percent decline in these small-business startups — sapping 1.8 million additional jobs from the economy. <br> Whether it’s due to the threat of higher taxes; or regulations that place higher costs on businesses and limits on who can invest, small businesses and entrepreneurs are frozen in their tracks. <br> For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s increasing regulation has made costs prohibitive for companies to go public — leading to a huge drop in small-scale initial public offerings over the past 15 years. This worrisome statistic highlights the need to reform costly regulations that are keeping companies from growing — particularly because, on average, 92 percent of business expansion and hiring occurs after it goes public. <br> This cannot become the new normal. We need to do everything we can to ensure that America remains a country of opportunity, in which jobs are created, startups and innovation happen, risks are taken and small businesses flourish. <br> President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address asked Congress to send him a bill that helps small businesses and entrepreneurs succeed. That is exactly what we intend to do. <br> Last year, the House worked on a series of bills to remove regulatory barriers that are holding back entrepreneurs and small businesses. Today, we are unveiling a bipartisan legislative package that puts all of these items together: the JOBS Act — Jumpstart Our Business Startups. This represents an important opportunity to work together to help our small-business startups grow, create jobs and get the economy back on track. 
Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, expected to be China’s next president, arrives in Washington on Tuesday. The Obama administration and international business community are ready to go out of their way to make sure his visit is free of public controversy. But Xi should not leave the United States without knowing there is deep dissatisfaction with his government’s policies — and our government’s tepid response. <br> U.S. voters believe China’s economy is stronger than ours. They are worried about the role China could play in determining our future. They hear talk about an America that may be in relative decline. Yet they are told not to worry. <br> We shouldn’t fear China’s citizens. But we should be worried about the actions of its authoritarian — and, yes, still communist — regime that tightly controls the People’s Republic. And we should be downright terrified by some of our own leaders’ attitudes toward China. <br> True, Washington periodically lashes Beijing verbally about its human rights practices. But most U.S. policies bolster a regime that is undemocratic, brutal to its critics and bullying to trade partners. <br> It’s not like China needs the help. It is growing at an astonishing pace. In the past few years alone, China topped the U.S. in manufacturing output, Germany in exports and Japan in economic size. It now wields more than $2 trillion in foreign currency reserves. <br> The U.S. just recorded the largest-ever trade deficit with China — a whopping $295.5 billion last year. It is only a matter of time until China passes the U.S. to be the world’s largest economy. <br> Today, we are in a serious race with China over supercomputing, innovation and anti-satellite weapons technology. China is not merely the key U.S. supplier of cheap toys, clothing and electronics: Its government is also one of our foreign financiers. China achieved this status by defying the free market and its international obligations toward more open trade and investment. <br> China is also learning from our history. Beijing knows why past U.S. competitors collapsed. Our Cold War victory over the Soviet Union required a bipartisan effort on defense and economic issues. We linked trade to free emigration and human rights and shone a bright light on abhorrent practices through a law known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment. <br> History didn’t do in the Soviet Union. A sustained and aggressive strategy did. China engaged our business and political elites — and seduced them into believing these policies were no longer necessary. <br> With China, there has been no George F. Kennan, no President John F. Kennedy, no Jackson-Vanik, no Ronald Reagan. There has been no strategy, no effort to prevail economically. <br> Critics of China are decidedly uncool — cast as xenophobes, hawks and protectionists, though our positions are entirely in line with prevailing (and correct) U.S. efforts to promote American ideals while expanding our economy. 
Easy-to-understand health plan summaries would be extremely popular with consumers, according to recent polls. That shouldn’t be surprising. Consumers dread choosing health insurance, as various surveys show, largely because they don’t understand it. <br> But the new health care law now calls for uniform health insurance summaries, available to all consumers starting in 2012. The Affordable Care Act requires that this summary be “understandable to the average plan enrollee.” <br> Every private health plan is required to provide this summary, so consumers for the first time will be able to compare options on an apples-to-apples basis. This holds true even if the options are from two different employers, or consumers are considering options on an individual basis. <br> We expect a final ruling from the Office of Management and Budget soon. But the real question is: What will the rule, and ultimately the summaries, look like? <br> Though the law is clear, strong objections from certain employer groups cast doubt on what consumers will likely get to see. Certain employers say that the health plan information they already provide should be sufficient. Yet when the new form was tested with workers who already have employer-based coverage, they strongly preferred the revised format — finding it clearer and easier to use. <br> The Affordable Care Act also strengthened the new summaries by requiring a feature called “Coverage Examples.” These would show what the plan covers under certain standard medical scenarios, like having a baby. But this new feature, which consumers liked because it “did the math for them,” also is threatened. <br> Health insurers have objected to the coverage examples, citing possible consumer confusion and the effort of compiling the cost data. Again, these concerns have been called into question since consumer testing showed this new feature to be tremendously helpful and less confusing than traditional displays of health insurance information. Showing the deductible, coinsurance and other elements is necessary. But it doesn’t provide a “bottom line” on how much coverage the plan offers. <br> Consumers should not have to select a plan without access to this basic, bottom-line information — and insurers are better positioned than consumers to calculate the plan payments for standard medical scenarios. <br> A key opportunity would be missed if the coming rule does not incorporate a robust vision for the new form — including a requirement that employers provide the form and strong “coverage examples.” The evidence is clear — today’s health plan documents are insufficient. <br> In light of the financial and health implications, it is past time to provide consumers with understandable, standardized health insurance documents. <br> Health insurance markets cannot work efficiently unless Americans have the basic, comparable information crucial in making the best choices for their families and businesses. Surely these are goals everyone can agree to. <br> Lynn Quincy is senior health policy analyst at Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy division of Consumer Reports. 
The media chorus is singing a new song this week in its anti-tea party echo chamber. It goes something like this: The law-breaking anarchists who want to tear America down are somehow just like law-abiding tea partiers — who are working tirelessly to build America back up. <br> This boneheaded comparison reminds me of what has now become an oft-repeated political euphemism. In 1988, during a vice presidential debate, Democratic candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said to his Republican opponent, Sen. Dan Quayle, “Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy; Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy.” <br> So despite the risk of sounding clich here, I say to the small band of misfits and anarchists now occupying Wall Street: I was one of tens of thousands of patriotic Americans who were there at the beginning of the tea party movement. I stood shoulder to shoulder with tea partiers all across this country. And you, who are occupying Wall Street and trying to tear America down, are no tea partiers. <br> The tea party movement started spontaneously from the rant of CNBC’s Rick Santelli on Feb. 19, 2009. His words resonated with millions across the country, and his spontaneous call for a “tea party” spurred tens of thousands to action. <br> Within a week, in close to 50 locations across the country, almost 40,000 people turned out to protest the U.S. government’s fiscal irresponsibility. By Tax Day in April 2009, the movement had grown to millions — and there were more than 850 peaceful, lawful protests across the nation attended by more than a million people. <br> The movement was organic, fast moving and had a cogent message: It’s time for fiscal responsibility in government. <br> Tea party rallies have always felt like “parties” — and safe and clean ones at that. Unlike protesters in New York, I can find no reports of tea partiers being arrested, individually or en masse, at the thousands of tea parties across the country with millions of attendees that have taken place for years now. <br> We are not lawbreakers, we don’t hate the police, we don’t even litter. A quick glance at the TV reveals the sharp contrast to the Wall Street occupiers. <br> In recent days, I’ve been repeatedly asked by reporters, “Does the comparison now being made in the media between the tea party and the Wall Street protesters bother you?” <br> My answer is an unequivocal: “Hell yes, it bothers me.” <br> It bothers me because it groups millions of patriotic tea partiers, who want to build America back up, together with a bunch of criminals who want to tear America down. 
For many conservatives, the notion of class warfare that President Barack Obama now evokes is both un-American and noxious — a crass attempt to cash in on envy among the masses. Yet the problem is not in class warfare itself — but in being clear what class you are targeting. <br> In this sense, Obama’s populism is little more than a faux version. He is not really going after the privileges of the super-rich — that would involve actions like removing the advantages of capital gains over earned income or limiting dodges to nonprofit foundations or family trusts. Rather than a war against plutocrats, Obama’s thrust is against the upper end of the middle class, whose income is most vulnerable to higher taxes. <br> The president is within his rights to use these class warfare tactics; it’s just too bad he is aiming at the wrong target. Exploiting class divisions, in fact, has long been a part of American politics — from the Jacksonian era through Abraham Lincoln, the New Deal and even Bill Clinton. Obama’s sudden tilt toward class warfare may thrill left-wing commentators such as The American Prospect’s Robert Kuttner. But it’s no real threat to the real ruling classes. <br> Though the president’s rhetoric focuses on “millionaires and billionaires,” his proposals do less harm to the ultrarich and their trustifarian offspring than to the large professional and entrepreneurial classes, whose members are earning more than $200,000 a year. More affluent than most Americans, these members of the upper middle class hardly constitute oligarchs. Ninety percent of the targeted class earns less than $1 million annually. Only a tiny sliver, or .01 percent, are billionaires. <br> Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s proposal to raise the target income level closer to $1 million is a concession to political common sense — but still avoids the big distinction between investor and income earner. Meanwhile, the administration’s rhetorical gambit of using Warren Buffett as the class warfare poster boy reveals its fundamental disingenuousness. <br> Many rich do avoid high taxes through dynastic trusts concocted largely to avoid the Internal Revenue Service. Others, like Buffett, put vast amounts into foundations — in his case, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where it sits tax free. In addition, the patrician class, because its members tend to be more active investors, also pays less, largely because its capital gains earnings are taxed at a low 15 percent rate, less than half that paid by high-income professionals. <br> Obama’s biggest problem with class is that his policies have made a bad situation worse. During both the Clinton administration and most of the George W. Bush years, the rich prospered. But so, too, did middle- and working-class homeowners, professionals and construction workers. 
The biggest mistake I ever made as a Wall Street analyst was my review of the iPhone. When it was introduced, I titled my comments: “What is the Black Swan of Telecom? Hint: It’s not the iPhone.” <br> I learned two lessons. One, sadly, is no longer relevant: Never underestimate Steve Jobs. The second is eternal: Never underestimate human creativity in changing a business equation. <br> In my review, I focused too much on the contractual relationship between device manufacturers and service providers. That remained unchanged. What Jobs and Apple focused on, however, was the value creation made possible through a platform anchored by a beautiful — not just functional — smart phone. That changed many things — including the relative values of Apple and the service providers. <br> I should have known better. For of the thousands of meetings I have had in nearly two decades in the telecom ecosystem, four stand out. Three of those were with Steve Jobs.(The other was with Wynton Marsalis). <br> I think it is because, though both men had strong, clear visions, neither had an agenda. Their words possessed an integrity inevitably difficult when one is, say, discussing technical rules for unbundling networks with a CEO whose stock will go up or down depending on the outcome. <br> Jobs – and Marsalis — combined perfectionism on technical details with a capability of communicating an aesthetic vision that retains the same power — whether in a room of thousands or in a one-on-one conversation, whether it occurred yesterday or a decade ago. <br> What made these meetings with Jobs perhaps most memorable was that he had mastered the rare art of appearing completely transparent and sincere — while also being a master showman. At that level, an act is no longer an act. <br> Jobs was interested in things that government can do — the one meeting at his request, in summer 2007, concerned spectrum policy and a coming auction. But his faith, ultimately, was in his ability to provide consumers experiences they would love. This gave him a Zen-like indifference to major policy issues. 
Imagine it’s 1986. Apple has just released a compact computer called the Macintosh Plus. It looks a little like a cinderblock standing on one end, has one megabyte of memory and costs about $2,600. It includes a 9-inch, black-and-white monitor and a built-in disk drive that runs the latest 3.5-inch floppy disk technology. <br> Now imagine that for the next 25 years, Apple releases no other products: no new computer, no iPod, iPhone, iPad, not even a laptop. The company never expands the memory or the monitor size, though it does eventually offer the Mac in other colors and raises the price. <br> Apple would not be one of the largest and most successful businesses in the world if it had ignored the marketplace and stopped coming up with new ideas. <br> Yet while America’s high-tech businesses like IBM, Google, eBay and Amazon have led the world in innovation, the federal government has lagged far behind and shackled the industry with an outdated tax system and policies on trade, patents and Internet regulation that do not suit a fast-changing business environment. Increasingly, it’s become clear that Washington continues to pursue VHS policies in a Blu-ray world. <br> A recent Gallup Poll found that Americans give the computer industry the highest marks among all business sectors, with 72 percent of those surveyed viewing the industry positively. The same survey found the federal government ranked the worst, with only a 17 percent positive rating. <br> America’s tax laws hurt high-tech businesses that employ millions and create jobs. So perhaps nowhere is the need for major policy reform more apparent than in our federal Tax Code. The last major rewrite of it was in the Mac Plus year of 1986, before the Internet and the digital economy. Because of Washington’s failure to keep up with worldwide changes in tax policies, U.S. companies, large and small, lose business and investment to competitors in countries with less punishing tax systems. It also means foreign companies are less likely to locate and create jobs here, choosing instead to keep their operations overseas where they have an advantage. <br> In the decade following the 1986 tax reforms, America’s corporate taxes were about average. But over the past 10 years, other countries looking to boost their economies have been dropping their rates, while Washington embraced the status quo. Since 2000, Germany has dropped its top rate by 22 points and Canada by 13. 
Since the economic collapse, American families and businesses have taken three simple yet painful steps: Cut the amount of debt they owe, cap future spending and balance their budgets. <br> Why can’t Washington do the same? <br> The House already has, last week, by a bipartisan vote. “Cut, Cap and Balance” gives President Barack Obama the $2.7 trillion increase in the debt ceiling he seeks; requires the deficit be cut in half from last year; includes 10 years worth of enforceable spending cuts that will keep the budget in balance, and requires a Balanced Budget Amendment be sent to the states. <br> Cut, Cap and Balance does not touch Medicare. It does not touch Social Security. What it touches is a nerve in a president who has spent a trillion dollars in two and a half years, and presided over a 40 percent increase in the national debt — from $10.6 trillion when he took office, to $14.3 trillion today. <br> Cut, Cap and Balance” is not typical Beltway-speak, designed to confuse the public and defer tough choices. It is straightforward and, according to a recent CNN poll, favored by two-thirds (66 percent) of Americans when described without politicized terms. That same poll showed that 74 percent of American adults favor a Balanced Budget Amendment, and 60 percent believe such an amendment is necessary for the government to get the federal budget deficit under control. <br> The Boehner plan contains similar elements: no tax increases, a dollar-to-dollar match in spending cuts to debt ceiling increases and a requirement that Congress pass a balanced budget amendment before the second step of a debt-ceiling increase is approved. <br> That second bite at the apple would come in six months — the debt ceiling could then be raised by another $1.6 trillion if a special legislative commission approves spending cuts of $1.8 trillion over a decade. It may not be perfect, but the House GOP has already won the debate. Kicking a field goal on 4th and 15 when you are ahead is not crazy. <br> Both solutions have more public support than the boondoggles that exacerbated the problem. Obamacare is even less popular and more expensive now than when it passed. The $850 billion stimulus that promised to create 4 million jobs and keep unemployment at 8 percent? Now 1.5 million fewer Americans are working than when Obama became president and unemployment is at 9.2 percent. <br> People are paying attention, and are far more financially sophisticated than many in Washington think. They can do the math. “Debt” was a four-letter word in the 2010 elections, and candidates who promised to tackle it won. <br> Roughly 64 percent of voters, in our Election Day 2010 poll, said the government should stop spending now to avoid an increase on the national debt. That same poll found government spending was the second most important concern that voters took to the ballot box. <br> Not much has changed. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that debt will equal 100 percent of our gross domestic product in 10 years. Public sentiment remains in favor of austerity measures that force Washington to do what millions of Americans have done — turn off the spending spigot, fashion a reasonable budget and live within one’s means. 
Monopoly can be a terrific game to play with the kids at home. But there are strict rules and guidelines that prevent us from playing the game in the business world – and rightly so. In business, a monopoly means one thing: the rich get richer, while the poor get left behind. <br> Last week, the Federal Communications Commission began its review of ATT’s proposed merger with T-Mobile. The investigation will analyze the effect this merger could have on market consolidation and overall spectrum management. The Justice Department will focus on whether or not the deal accords with antitrust laws. <br> But the FCC and Justice must analyze more than the effect this merger could have on the nameless market; they must give serious consideration to the people who could be most affected. <br> Like in Monopoly, ATT is trying to buy the best real estate on the block. If the FCC and Justice allow this merger of telecom giants to happen, it will be consumers – particularly lower income and minority wireless users – who won’t be able to pass “Go” or collect $200. <br> Low-income families and communities of color rely heavily on their mobile phones to connect to the Internet – a lifeline increasingly critical in today’s world. Higher rates could have devastating consequences. <br> About 17 percent of people in the U.S. earning less than $30,000 per year use the Internet only through their cell phones, according to a Pew Research Center study. This is also true for 20 percent of those who did not graduate from high school. <br> The higher prices for wireless service that could result from this merger would add a financial burden to these struggling workers, or force them to cancel their mobile phone plans. This could leave them without the access they need – and one step farther away from a higher wage or a better education. <br> The merger also disproportionately affects people of color, who rely on their cell phones to access the Internet more than whites. While 10 percent of white people access the Internet only from their phones, 18 percent of blacks and 16 percent of English-speaking Latinos depend on affordable wireless coverage to get online. <br> It’s already extremely difficult to depend on a cell phone for Internet access. Anyone who has tried to fill out a job application or schedule an immigration appointment on a cell phone will tell you it’s easier said than done. <br> With less competition among wireless companies, there will be even less incentive for the telecom giants to provide greater access. <br> Advocates from the Media Action Grassroots Network explain that for everything from job postings to college applications, access to mobile Internet means access to opportunity. To price gouge those who need it most would be cruel. <br> There’s a reason why mergers must be approved. We hope federal officials carefully consider the effect this deal would have on the most vulnerable U.S. communities. <br> These communities need a real chance now more than ever. Not another obstacle to success. <br> While ATT’s market grab must first pass the antitrust law test, it should also stand the test of historic American values – that tell us to put people before profits; lift up our tired, hungry and poor; and ensure that this country doesn’t erode opportunity for those who need it most. <br> This is too important to be treated like a game. <br> Malkia Cyril is executive director of the Center for Media Justice. 
The House version of the continuing resolution should be called “the China Innovation Advantage Act.” It erodes our nation’s position as a high-tech leader while providing a major boost to our global competitors. <br> The bill makes large cuts in government-funded science and technology programs. It yields little deficit reduction; however, it does serious damage to the American innovation engine — the long-term driver of high-tech U.S. job creation. The main beneficiaries of H.R. 1 would be international competitors, who are already on our heels and would like to take the lead on innovation. <br> China, for example, has made huge investments in science research and innovation during the past decade, leaving the U.S. in the dust. Beijing’s investments in research and development grew by more than 20 percent annually between 1996 and 2007, according to the National Science Foundation’s 2010 “Science Engineering Indicators Report,” compared with less than 6 percent annual growth in the United States. <br> This devastating scenario for U.S. innovation is likely to occur because Washington seems to have little understanding of the government and industry’s complementary roles in the innovation cycle — and the job creation that goes with it. <br> Advanced scientific technologies most often come from government-funded work, and many important new products have been created by what industry builds with them. <br> Consider Apple’s iPhone, one of the most iconic devices of the past few years. Every scientific technology behind the iPhone was developed with government funds: large-scale integrated circuits, the Internet, the browser, the global positioning system and the touch screen. <br> Engineers and software experts at Apple put these scientific building blocks together to create a remarkable product. But without government-funded foundations, there would be no iPhone and many fewer jobs at Apple — 49,000 as of last year. <br> As Congress debates cutting the deficit, it must be mindful not to torch the nation’s seed corn — science and innovation, which, since World War II, has contributed to more than half of the nation’s economic growth. <br> Despite this, some conservative economists and politicians say that if research and development are left to the market, the right innovative path will be chosen. Not so. <br> These days, industry, with very rare exceptions, devotes RD budgets to things that can become products in three to five years. Industry doesn’t do risky, long-term research with its own money. Universities, government-funded labs and industries conduct research with government money — and the resulting benefits to the private sector, our economy and U.S. jobs are enormous. 
Steve Jobs is one of the most famous Americans. His name is synonymous with products that have changed the way we communicate, hear music and watch TV. It’s hard to go anywhere without seeing someone using an iPod, iPhone or the new iPad 2. <br> Michael Dell is another celebrated innovator whose name is recognized for the computer company he started in Texas in the 1980s. Dell laptops are in homes and college dorms across the country. <br> Both men created products that changed society. But they are more than just developers of successful products. Their innovations created jobs for thousands of Americans, produced products for millions of consumers and helped drive our economy. <br> American inventors have led the world in innovations for more than a century. But if we want to foster future creativity, we must do more to encourage today’s innovators. <br> Earlier this month, the Senate took an important step toward modernizing our patent system. It voted overwhelmingly to support much-needed reforms that can help spur economic growth. It’s now the House’s turn. <br> Intellectual property plays a critical role in our daily lives and global marketplace. Patents protect this intellectual property and encourage the creativity that generates jobs and increases productivity. <br> Unfortunately, our patent system is outdated, bogged down by frivolous lawsuits and uncertainties about patent ownership. The last major patent reform was nearly 60 years ago. Since then, U.S. innovators put a man on the moon, developed cellphones and launched the Internet. <br> But we can’t protect the technologies of today with the tools of the past. We need a patent system that keeps pace with ever-changing technologies. <br> Like the Senate bill, the House proposal switches the basic standard of patent approval from a “first to invent” to “first inventor to file.” The U.S. is the only developed country that uses a first-to-invent standard in awarding patents. This system invites expensive disputes over patent ownership that the little guys often lose. 
Congress is due to hold its first oversight hearing Wednesday about the startup of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created last year to be the top cop on the beat for consumer financial issues. <br> Oversight is crucial. In fact, the central idea behind this bureau was to increase government accountability by consolidating core consumer financial protection functions that had been scattered across seven federal agencies. Now, one agency will have a principal mission to make the market work for all Americans — and to be accountable while doing it. <br> This is how oversight begins — with a clear purpose and someone who can be held responsible. That’s why I am looking forward to testifying for the first time. <br> The consumer bureau’s mission is to make sure consumers have the information they need — upfront, not buried in fine print — to make the best choices about mortgages, credit cards and other financial products and services. Consumers’ personal responsibility is, of course, critical. But prices and risks must be straightforward, consumers should be able to make apples-to-apples comparisons among two or three products. <br> We have spent substantial time meeting with and listening to ideas and concerns from many different interests — including state attorneys general and banking supervisors, consumer advocates, trade associations and chief executive officers of large financial institutions. The time we have spent with small financial institutions has been particularly valuable. (I wrote about this in an earlier POLITICO Opinion article.) I have also now had more than 60 one-on-one conversations with members of Congress, briefing each on the consumer bureau and listening closely to their concerns. <br> We recently launched our ConsumerFinance.gov website. It is a bare-bones version, five months ahead of schedule. But we wanted to put in plain view as much as possible about how we are building this agency. <br> We have already received hundreds of responses as part of our “open for suggestions” campaign, and we have posted videos from our staff addressing many of the most frequent comments. <br> To build the new consumer bureau, we have begun assembling a team of strong, experienced leaders and other capable staff. Already, we have a diverse group of about 175 from a wide variety of backgrounds — industry, consumer and civil rights groups, military service, government and academia. We have people in their first jobs and people who had retired and decided to return for one more job — and lots in between. 
I love The New York Times. I read it every day, and it’s been my paper of choice since I was a teenager. Much of what I say on “Morning Joe” is shaped by its newsroom of reporters, who are still without peer in the world of journalism. <br> Does their coverage slant a bit left? As I say to my friends at the Times, I love the paper so much I buy two copies every day. One to read and one to burn after reading. But as I am watching the editorial section go up in flames, I remind myself that the Times does what all great papers do; it reflects the attitudes of the city it serves. And because I am an unabashed fan of New York and its people, I spend little time railing against the paper’s point of view. <br> That is easier these days, because the great paper’s focus over the past decade has been to become a national paper that attracts readers in Manhattan, Kan., as well as those in the Big Apple. The front page of the Times has also become a bit more agnostic politically. To be sure, its coverage of the 2008 campaign was embarrassing at times, with John and Cindy McCain taking undue hits and Barack Obama receiving glowing praise. <br> But for the most part, the Times has become more balanced. If you don’t believe me, look for bias in the work of reporters like Jeff Zeleny, Mark Leibovich and David Sanger. Good luck finding examples of a leftward lean. I read the paper as closely as anyone and find these reporters beyond reproach. Most there are. <br> That is not to say there aren’t times when the Gray Lady backslides and begins behaving like it did during the debacle created by its coverage of the 2003 Masters and the controversy over Augusta National’s lack of female members. While its current coverage of the Wisconsin showdown has not reached Howell Raines-like proportions, last week’s coverage of Gov. Scott Walker’s legislative win over public unions has gotten off to an embarrassing start. <br> If the Times is your only source of news, you could be forgiven for believing that Walker has single-handedly doomed the Republican Party while ensuring President Obama’s reelection next year. This is a curious conclusion to reach considering that Walker’s GOP has stripped public unions in his state of many collective-bargaining rights while limiting their ability to collect mandatory dues from workers. <br> How Democrats are the beneficiaries of these draconian measures must remain a mystery to readers not employed by left-wing cable news shows or progressive bloggers. <br> The political reality is that Walker’s victory last week was a crushing blow for labor’s most valuable players: government workers. The fact that those actions were taken in a state where public unions first came into existence makes labor’s loss all the more distressing. And since public workers unions were the biggest contributors to the 2010 campaign — giving more than $200 million to Democratic candidates — Walker’s efforts to break Wisconsin’s public unions will ultimately be felt in all 50 states. <br> But don’t try telling that to The New York Times. <br> On Friday, the Times tried to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by declaring that Walker’s win was actually a “gift” for Democrats. <br> Another Friday headline in the Times declared the historic union loss was a huge win for Obama. The headline “Walker Hands a Victory to Obama?” was laughable on its face considering that outside Wall Street, public unions were the president’s most loyal contributors in 2008. <br> The next day, the Times told us that labor’s loss in Wisconsin was a “galvanizing” event that would help Democrats roll up huge victories in next year’s elections. 
Imagine this. You are at the kitchen table playing Scrabble with your family. Your whiz kid daughter takes all seven of her tiles and spells “casuist.” The other players are skeptical. They want an official review. You go to look it up at Dictionary.com. This is what you learn: “casuist” is a noun meaning someone who uses clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions—and your daughter is really smart. <br> Here is what you probably don’t know. By visiting Dictionary.com, you’ve exposed yourself to the single greatest tracker of online activity on the Internet. <br> There is no longer any anonymity on the Web — unless we mandate it. The most personal information about your online habits is collected, bought and sold, often instantaneously and invisibly. Data collection is a business driven by profits at consumers’ expense. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted these practices —which include targeting children —in its groundbreaking series, “What They Know.” The Journal also outed Dictionary.com as the top venue for tracking technology. <br> Online trackers claim the information they collect is anonymous and helps enhance the user’s experience. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. The truth is it only takes 33 bits of information to uniquely indentify someone. In addition, the data collected is being used to make assumptions about you that can affect everything from your insurance premiums to your next job interview. <br> Just imagine this. You are the social director at your local church. You are in charge of buying refreshments for an upcoming bazaar. You go online and buy 15 cases of wine. This information is collected and then sold to a life or health insurance company that determines you are an alcoholic and should be charged more or denied coverage altogether. <br> How will a prospective employer interpret this information when it purchases it from an online tracking company? <br> Privacy isn’t negotiable. It’s the right of every American. That’s why I introduced the Do Not Track Me Online Act of 2011. This legislation would give consumers the ability to prevent the collection and use of data on their online activities. The message is simple: where you go and what you do on the Internet is your business. 
The merger between Germany’s Deutsche Brse and the New York Stock Exchange announced last week has met with an all too familiar knee-jerk reaction in Washington. <br> It’s unfortunate that whenever an iconic U.S. institution receives a capital infusion from abroad, a policy debate ensues questioning whether American economic power is on the wane. Anti-foreign jabs about this deal, however, are likely to make other global companies worry about pumping much-needed capital into the United States. <br> Historically, foreign direct investment has been a reliable source of U.S. economic growth. Think back a decade ago. Ice-cream lovers across the U.S. bemoaned the British-Dutch multinational Unilever’s purchase of Ben Jerry’s. Yet, today, one can still find a pint of Cherry Garcia in almost any U.S. grocery freezer section, and Ben Jerry’s maintains its socially conscious operating style. Under Unilever, Ben Jerry’s has streamlined production and expanded internationally — for increased sales and better margins. Without the investment, we might be remembering Ben Jerry’s wistfully rather than trying to resist just one more scoop. <br> Many companies as ingrained in the American cultural landscape as apple pie have traveled the same path. InBev of Belgium purchased Anheuser-Busch in 2008, but that has not dampened our enthusiasm for the King of Beer’s Super Bowl commercials. Race cars at the Indianapolis 500 still run on Firestone Tires, bought by Bridgestone of Japan in 1998, after years of financial struggles. Slurpees are available at 38,000 locations worldwide since Japanese investors purchased 7-Eleven in the 1990s, and fueled its rise to the largest chain franchise on the planet. <br> All told, the U.S. subsidiaries of global companies have insourced 5.6 million jobs for Americans. Annually, these companies write $408.5 billion in U.S. paychecks, spend $40.5 billion on U.S. research and development and manufacture close to 20 percent of total U.S. exports. 
This column is mostly self-plagiarism. Ten years ago, on the occasion of Ronald Reagan’s 90th birthday, I tried to make a sober and compact case against the notion that he was a great, or even a very successful, president. Apparently I was not effective. On the 100th anniversary of his birth (and seven years after his death), he has moved into Mount Rushmore territory: beyond criticism — not just among conservatives and Republicans but among liberals and moderates, who insist that “you have to hand it to him,” and, most notably, among the media. <br> I do not think that you have to hand it to him. So, one more time, here is the case for not handing it to him. Claims for Reagan’s greatness are in bold. Counters follow. <br> 1. Reagan got the nation out of its Jimmy Carter funk and restored its optimistic spirit. OK, let’s give him that one. Carter was not a lighthearted leader. To the extent that a nation’s psyche can be repaired by words and facial expressions (and to some extent, it can), Reagan therapy did the trick. But the main reason we cheered up in the years after 1981 was that things got objectively better. <br> 2. Reagan ended stagflation. Well, no. The “stagflation” of the late 1970s was two different phenomena. First came inflation, then came a vicious recession that wrung inflation out of the economy, but at a high price. The recession was purposely engineered by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul Volcker. The real hero of this episode was Carter. He appointed Volcker, knowing what Volcker would do and what it would probably cost him politically. Reagan also deserves some credit for standing by and not complaining or demagoguing while Volcker’s chemotherapy had time to work. He even reappointed Volcker — once. But when Volcker wanted a third term, Reagan pushed him aside. The return of a stable currency was the essential foundation for the prosperity of the late 1980s — the “Reagan boom.” When I wrote this piece the first time in 2001, I asserted that “Reagan hagiographers don’t even have a theory, beyond raw assertion, to explain how their man ... stopped inflation.” A couple of people pointed out that I had forgotten the PATCO strike, in which Reagan stood firm against, and ultimately broke, the air traffic controllers union. This episode was like a road company version of Margaret Thatcher’s epic battles with the unions in Great Britain. But I was wrong to say that Reagan fans didn’t even have a theory. They have a theory. <br> 3. By keeping taxes low and government small, Reagan brought us a long economic boom. Unlikely, because Reagan did not make the government smaller (see below), and for most people he didn’t reduce taxes, either. Bill Clinton raised taxes, and the record of economic growth on his watch is better than Reagan’s. (This remains true even if you allow a year’s lag time for an administration’s policies to take effect.) But no one is proposing Bill Clinton for Mount Rushmore. 
Because of my crazy schedule, I haven’t seen a movie in months. This is despite the fact that since the beginning of the year, I’ve tried to make time to watch “The King’s Speech,” “True Grit” and “The Social Network.” <br> This weekend, my life finally slowed down enough for my wife and me to turn on Apple TV and download the film about Facebook. <br> I was excited to escape into a movie that friends and family have praised as one of the best of the year. Critics seemed to agree that Aaron Sorkin’s take on Facebook’s founding is a masterpiece. I received further proof of the film’s greatness last month at the Golden Globes, hosted by Ricky Gervais. “The Social Network” took home more trophies that night than any other film. Expect a similar scene later this month at the Oscars; “The Social Network” has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. <br> Rolling Stone even called “The Social Network” the best movie of the year and a film that has defined a generation. <br> Not bad for a motion picture that left me wondering why I didn’t download “True Grit” instead. <br> Mark Zuckerberg’s story is no cinematic joy ride but a grim tale of a man and his generation lost in cyberspace, where someone can be everyone’s friend and nobody’s friend and where computers offer a cold substitute to human contact. The world in the film is a place where instant intimacy has replaced deep relationships, where poking has replaced long talks on the phone and where handwritten notes have been thrown out in favor of a status update. <br> Facebook is cynically feeding the narcissistic appetites of a self-consumed culture that is populated by teenage vulgarians, desperate housewives and bored men. <br> Americans are now simultaneously all places at once and nowhere all the time. This Facebook world leaves millions distracted at work, distracted at home, distracted at play and distracted around their families — even when sitting down for dinner. <br> Facebook is now the perfect complement to the text-obsessed parent who misses most of his child’s soccer game while working the iPhone. It provides millions of parents the chance to continue ignoring their children at home, too. <br> Rolling Stone got it right recently when it described “The Social Network” as a movie that illustrates “how technology is winning the battle against actual human contact, creating a nation of narcissists shaping their own reality like a Facebook page. If youth can’t see itself in this movie, it’s just not paying attention.” <br> Maybe it should. Maybe we should all start paying closer attention to who we are becoming as a society. <br> The warning signs are appearing in places like Rutgers University, where this new reality is creating an emotional disconnect that leads to thoughtless cruelty — the kind that allows teenagers like Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei to allegedly stream live video of their roommate, Tyler Clementi, having an intimate encounter in the privacy of his room. That Internet “prank” ended with a gifted young man jumping to his death off the George Washington Bridge. 
The reorganization of President Barack Obama’s economic team is exactly what’s needed now. <br> All groups benefit from periodic renewal and the fresh perspective it brings. The president’s timing is perfect. We are turning a crucial corner in our recovery from the unmitigated disaster of the Bush-GOP economic meltdown. <br> Thanks to the Obama administration’s previous economic team and the Democratic Congress these past two years, we have staved off a second Great Depression. Job losses seem to have plateaued, and unemployment is beginning to slow. <br> The team’s task now will be to institute policies that lead to a dynamic high-growth economy, placing us at the forefront globally. <br> The president was absolutely right in his State of the Union address to cite American innovation as a key area for investment. His challenge to scientists and engineers to invent clean energy technologies is an ideal example of effective leveraging of limited federal dollars to produce big results. <br> When Obama’s new team devises a game plan to spur innovation, however, it is critical that these advisers do not overlook the challenges of “scaling up” — the process by which innovation is brought to the market. <br> Policies that favor scaling up domestically, as opposed to overseas, are essential to ensuring that American ingenuity generates U.S. jobs — not just a high Dow Jones Industrial Average. <br> Representing Silicon Valley in Congress, I have seen the price Americans pay when scaling up occurs overseas. It undermines our domestic manufacturing. <br> Apple Computer, for example, has long been a darling of the stock market, with good reason. Its innovative products have consistently led the technology market. Apple changed the way we listen to music, use our cell phones and look at e-mail and other media. 
With the start of a new session, the time was ripe for the Senate to reform its archaic procedural rules and curb obstruction – to do something about rampant filibuster abuse. <br> There had been much talk about comprehensive rules reform, but Senate leadership is now considering only a limited set of changes – namely, abolishing secret holds and streamlining the nominee confirmation process. It has apparently missed its opportunity for real reform. <br> To be sure, these changes represent steps – albeit baby ones – in the right direction. But they do not come close to addressing the root causes of Senate dysfunction. Here’s why: <br> First, these proposals would not be implemented through an official rules change. Instead, they rely on a “gentleman’s agreement,” an informal handshake between the parties. <br> This is already suspect. If the Senate were actually comprised of gentlemen and gentlewomen committed to institutional comity, it wouldn’t be riddled with gridlock in the first place. <br> In fact, secret holds are already banned. The 2007 Honest Leadership and Open Government Act requires senators to publicly disclose their holds within five days. Most senators, however, routinely dodge this rule with a tag-team-hold technique. By passing off an anonymous hold to a cooperating senator (think relay runners) just before the five-day limit expires, a few senators can maintain a secret hold indefinitely – without technically violating the rules. <br> The current proposal to ban secret holds would change nothing. It is not a meaningful fix because it lacks any enforcement mechanism. <br> Similarly, reducing the number of executive appointments that need to be confirmed by the Senate also skirts the underlying issues. This move may lessen the logjam somewhat. But there will still be dozens, even hundreds, of nominees in limbo, while essential executive positions remain unfilled. <br> Senators are still likely to place indefinite, anonymous holds on uncontroversial executive nominations to extract concessions on unrelated issues. Despite Chief Justice John Roberts’ public rebuke of the Senate for partisan game-playing that has created “judicial vacancies in critically overworked districts,” the current reform proposal would not address the judicial nomination crisis at all. <br> The current proposal thus contains minor fixes that ignore the core problem: The Senate’s procedural rules incentivize the wrong things. Under the current system, obstruction, partisan maneuvering and strategic gamesmanship predominate. There is little genuine debate on the critical issues facing our country. 
Arena contributors discuss if the First Lady's ideas are too interventionist. <br> Drew Westen, psychologist and neuroscientist, Emory University <br> With the government picking up the tab for hundreds of billions of dollars and rising in obesity-related illnesses, I’d be comfortable with the government’s starting by imploring, “Let them eat sliced apples” and, if that doesn’t work, taxing fast-food restaurants to cover the health care costs of their fries. Seems like we had this debate about seat belts. If you can’t change behavior by changing attitudes, change attitudes by changing behaviors. How many of us would even think of driving without our seat belts on — something we would never have done without laws to stop us from killing ourselves? <br> David Boaz, executive vice president, Cato Institute <br> Why is it any of the federal government’s business how fit we are? We don’t need a national nanny. The federal government has an important role in our society. Its primary function is national security, and it hasn’t been doing a very good job providing it. It should focus on that. Americans know that first they say you “should,” and the next thing you know, they want to make it mandatory. Already, the government is talking about taxing junk food, and it’s filing suit against fast-food companies. We teach our kids to take responsibility for themselves and to “mind your own business”; the government should take that advice. <br> Mark Weinberg, former Reagan spokesman <br> If Michelle Obama is successful in using her bully pulpit to help improve the eating habits of people in this country, she will be performing a valuable public service. Obesity is a crisis here — especially in children — and educating people about healthful eating habits is essential if we are to reverse the trend. It is very difficult to imagine that this campaign will result in government mandates. Right on, Mrs. Obama! <br> Lurita Doan, Federal News Radio commentator I applaud the first lady for championing the option of healthful food choices. But that’s where she needs to stop. Obama should not be trying to make policy; she should not think her role in the healthful-food debate is to tell restaurants what they can and cannot serve. I like vegetables — pretty much all vegetables — but I think the push to get American children to eat more vegetables needs to begin at home, not in legislating restaurant menus. <br> Clyde Prestowitz, founder and president, Economic Strategy Institute It sounds like good sense, good advice, good policy and, ultimately, smaller government to me. As things stand, with Americans becoming increasingly obese, the result is more health problems, higher health care costs for everyone and bigger government to deal with all the problems. Let’s listen to Michelle Obama, I say. <br> Alvin Felzenberg, author, “The Leaders We Deserved” <br> Kudos to the governors and mayors who have persuaded local schools to press vendors to substitute fruit for candy in the machines that clog school halls. I wonder whether more of the first lady’s efforts might be done through public service announcements and less through taxpayer funds. Her message is clearly getting out. The next step is to do it with fewer public expenditures. 
Buses are due to head out Thursday from Nebraska, Kansas and the Dakotas, from Gillette, Wyo., and Billings, Mont., all hauling cattlemen to Fort Collins, Colo., where they set to testify in favor of the Obama administration’s efforts to reshape the business of food. <br> Bill Bullard of R-CALF, a nationwide advocacy group of cattle producers, is talking about having 25,000 people there Friday to testify before Attorney General Eric Holder and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack about antitrust violations in the meat business. <br> Bullard probably won’t get 25,000 people to Fort Collins. It’s inconvenient and hot, and Aug. 27 is a Friday at the start of football season. But there are likely to be a few thousand square staters there in what is one of the more improbable coalitions of the politically Balkanized U.S. countryside. <br> Lizard-booted ranchers and good old boys with John Deere gimme caps are lining up with a labor union and President Barack Obama against meatpacking giants, big farm organizations and a coalition of Republican and Democratic House Agriculture Committee members. Politics on this one is all mixed up. <br> The tangled situation began slightly more than a year ago. Justice Department officials came to a meeting of ranchers and farmers in St. Louis to announce a series of hearings on competition in the food business. <br> The Justice antitrust division had just about rusted shut during the Bush administration. In those years, there was a national infatuation with markets. Antitrust enforcement was thought to be so, well, 20th century. <br> By 2008, however, the market was no longer infallible and the new administration was keen to take on monopoly. Food — from Monsanto’s dominance in seeds to Wal-Mart’s growing share of the grocery dollar — looked like a good place to start. <br> That was dandy with ranchers and farmers— who have watched their share of the food dollar shrink steadily for the past 30 years. <br> In 1980, for example, cattle raisers received 63 cents of each dollar spent on a box of cut meat sold in groceries. By 2009, ranchers were getting just 43 cents on that same passel of beef. <br> With just four meatpacking firms controlling 88 percent of the cattle market, ranchers came to the not unreasonable conclusion that business concentration among beef buyers was one reason their share of the meat dollar had shrunk by a third. <br> The Justice and Agriculture departments decided on a two-pronged strategy. <br> First, they would pursue the traditional trust-busting route -— beginning with a series of fact-finding sessions across rural America. Fort Collins is the fourth of five such hearings. <br> Second, USDA published proposed regulations under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, which would give new rights to ranchers, hog raisers and contract chicken growers. The rules make it easier for livestock owners to sue meatpackers for discriminatory pricing. And they give contract chicken growers more power in their dealings with the likes of Tyson Foods. 
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, known for his smoothness and precision, seems to have erred egregiously twice in just weeks. <br> First, he speculated on TV that Democrats might lose the House, an inexcusable blunder because it is his job to omit the truth— not lie, just omit the truth — when the truth hurts. Then, there he was in print this week, deriding “professional liberals” who label President Barack Obama too moderate, saying they need “to be drug tested.” <br> Gibbs should have expected this would enrage liberals. Maybe that’s just what he planned. <br> Facing reporters Wednesday, Gibbs neither apologized nor backtracked. Instead, he doubled down. He was angry at the liberal TV pundits who bash the president, Gibbs said, standing by his words. Then he said he wasn’t the only one at the White House that felt this. <br> If Gibbs is purposely picking fights with the left, it’s not too surprising. In fact it’s consistent with the White House effort to position Obama closer to the center — where he traditionally needs to be for a reelection victory in 2012. <br> That’s where former President Bill Clinton went after the voters threw the congressional Democrats out of power in 1994. He won reelection by a comfortable margin. <br> Now Obama, excoriated by conservatives as a free spender who wants to socialize medicine and coddle U.S. adversaries, is starting to remake his image in the same fashion. <br> In the last few weeks, for example, he has presented himself as the relentless advocate of small business — long a GOP bastion, given its abhorrence of taxes and regulation. The small-business trade group, the National Federation of Independent Business, is about as Republican-friendly as a business organization can get. <br> Yet Obama now rarely misses the chance to tout the sanctity of the mom-and-pop shop and voice support for legislation that eases lending to Main Street. Over the last few weeks, he has stopped at a sign-making company in Washington and the Tastee Sub Shop in Edison, N.J., to showcase his support. Half of his July 17 weekly address was about this. <br> “Helping small businesses, cutting taxes, making credit available,” Obama said in New Jersey, “this is as American as apple pie.” <br> Obama, the small-business advocate, has been paired with Obama, the tax-cutter, to woo the middle class. The president is seeking to recast the large tax increase set for Jan. 1 — when the Bush tax cuts expire — as an example of his devotion to keeping middle class taxes low. So Obama is now trying to keep the focus on his vow not to repeal the law for average income earners. <br> Obama staged an East Room celebration Wednesday to mark his signing of the Manufacturing Enhancement Act, a relatively minor bill that reduces tariffs on some manufacturing materials. Newly expressive about his commitment to free trade, Obama is now prodding Congress to pass the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Act, a Bush-era deal that has languished on Capitol Hill for years. 
Republicans tried to manufacture a controversy out of first lady Michelle Obama’s trip with her daughter Sasha to Spain. But national attention should not be diverted from the monthlong vacation that Congress is set to take, even as the struggles of working families in today’s troubled economy remain unaddressed. <br> This summer, Congress is due to join nearly 15 million men and women who also have August off from work — including the 6.6 million who have had 27 weeks or more off from their jobs. And they didn’t even ask for it. <br> Why? Because they’re unemployed. And for workers lucky enough to have jobs, the outlook this August isn’t much sunnier. <br> Unlike Congress, more than 25 percent of employees receive no paid vacation time. For young workers, the statistics are even worse. <br> And wages? From 2000 to 2009, median weekly wages actually fell for high school and college graduates, according to the Economic Policy Institute. With stagnant or falling earnings and an uncertain financial future, few can afford to take unpaid time off this summer. <br> So who, besides Congress, is enjoying summer vacation? You guessed it: Wall Street. <br> Companies are raking in record profits, with the top 500 nonfinancial firms sitting on nearly a trillion dollars in cash as of the second quarter. But instead of doing their fair share to bring us out of this recession — a recession that Wall Street’s recklessness helped create in the first place — many businesses are taking advantage of the economic climate to squeeze workers for more hours with less pay. <br> Take Mott’s, for example. The juice and applesauce manufacturer earned $555 million last year, and its parent company, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, has seen its stock rise a whopping 180 percent since March 2009. Rather than reward the employees at its Williamson, N.Y., plant for their hard work, however, Mott’s decided to slash wages and benefits. <br> In May, Mott’s workers took a stand and declared a strike. But instead of bargaining with its workers, Mott’s has opted to leave them — and hundreds of New York apple farmers — in jeopardy, without a fair contract. The standoff continues. <br> Sadly, Mott’s is by no means the only company using such tactics to take full advantage of today’s harsh economic landscape. 
Class, the Industrial Revolution’s great political dividing line, is enjoying Information Age resurgence. It now threatens the political future of presidents, prime ministers and even Politburo chiefs. <br> As in the Industrial Age, new technology is displacing whole groups of people — blue- and white-collar workers — as it boosts productivity and creates opportunities for others. Inequality is on the rise — from the developing world to historically egalitarian Scandinavia and Britain. <br> Divisions are evident here in the United States. Throughout the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama lagged in appealing to white middle- and working-class voters who supported Hillary — and former President Bill — Clinton. <br> Now, these voters, according to recent polls, are increasingly alienated from the Obama administration. Reasons include slow economic growth, high unemployment among blue- and white-collar workers and a persistent credit crunch for small businesses. These factors could cause serious losses for Democrats this fall — and beyond. <br> This discontent reflects long-term trends. Since 1973, for example, the rate of growth of the “typical family’s income” in the United States has slowed dramatically. For men, it has actually gone backward when adjusted for inflation. <br> The past few years have been particularly rough. About two in five Americans report household incomes between $35,000 and $100,000 a year. Right now, almost three in five are deeply worried about their financial situation, according to an ABC poll from March. <br> This should give Democrats an issue, theoretically. But to date, Obama and his party seem incapable of harnessing the growing middle- and working-class unrest. <br> In fact, according to recent polls, these have been the voters that Democrats and the president have been losing over the past year as the economic stimulus failed to make a major dent in unemployment. <br> Part of this problem lies with the party’s base, which the urban historian Fred Siegel once labeled “the coalition of the overeducated and the undereducated.” Major urban centers like New York, Chicago and San Francisco might advertise themselves as enlightened, but they have lost much of their middle class and suffer the highest levels of income inequality. <br> Representatives from these areas now dominate the party and reflect their bifurcated districts. They often stress the concerns of the educated affluent on issues like climate change and gay marriage, while their economic policies focus on the public-sector workers, “green” industries and maintaining the social welfare net. <br> Not surprisingly, this agenda does little for the middle-class — mostly suburban — voters. <br> Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), for example, won his margin of victory in largely middle- and working-class suburbs, where many voters had backed Obama in 2008, according to demographer Wendell Cox. Brown lost by almost 2-to-1 among poor voters — and also among those earning more than $85,000 a year. <br> Given the danger revealed by these numbers, Democrats and other center-left parties around the world should refocus their policies on issues — such as taxes, private-sector job creation and small business — that affect such voters. <br> For this growing class divide can be found globally: In China, for example, technological change and globalization have produced a new proletariat that, unlike in the past, is disinterested in warmed-over Maoist ideology. 
President Obama and other world leaders meet in Toronto for this weekend’s G-20 summit amid a challenging period for global markets. <br> U.S. unemployment still hovers around 10 percent. Trade deficits are widening. While the success of the summit’s proceedings will be based on many factors, collaboration and agreement on top-of-mind economic issues rank among the most important. <br> Nowhere is this more relevant than U.S. trade relations with China, already close to eclipsing Japan as the second largest economy. <br> Today, China is the world’s largest recipient of direct foreign investment, with 480 of the Fortune 500 companies doing business there. U.S. exports to China were nearly $70 billion last year alone, or four times what they were a decade ago. <br> Earlier this month, I testified before the House Ways and Means Committee on the need for open market access in light of Beijing’s recent “indigenous innovation” policies that have jeopardized the vitality of foreign companies whose operations have helped develop and build up the Chinese economy. <br> Beijing has sent shockwaves across the global economy in the last few months by issuing a series of guidelines intended to favor products with China-based intellectual property — while requiring foreign companies to disclose their IP. <br> Getting the trade calculus right at the G20 will require a recalibration of these types of vague and punitive rules that unfairly tip the scales and threaten to disrupt the free flow of commerce essential to growth across our respective economies. <br> In Toronto this weekend, G20 participants must build on the recent U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue by pursuing three interlocking objectives. <br> First, holding China accountable to its international commitments. If China builds its own island in a sea of globally accepted commercial standards and practices, this sets a dangerous precedent for future growth and innovation. <br> Consider a hypothetical but relevant example of the economic implications of an “indigenous innovation” policy. The BlackBerry smart phone, which generated 10.5 million shipments last quarter alone, was developed by the Canadian company Research in Motion. Imagine the commotion if Washington made BlackBerry phones illegal or difficult to buy in the United States because they are the intellectual property of a foreign company. <br> In reality, products invented by U.S.-based companies like Apple, Dell, HP or Microsoft, should not be put at a disadvantage in China now or in the future. <br> While China has been in the World Trade Organization for nearly 10 years, it has still not signed the Government Procurement Agreement, which enables greater collaboration among governments on commercial issues. <br> If China completed the GPA accession process and committed to a date-certain to sign the agreement, Beijing then sends a signal that it is prepared to live up to its responsibilities as a global leader. <br> Second, G-20 participants have an opportunity to endorse the need for greater predictability in trade with China. While China’s recent commitment to hold bilateral innovation discussions and pursue revised policies is a positive first step, the notion of fair and predictable trade has been a cornerstone of U.S. industry’s ability to sell into foreign markets for more than 150 years. <br> Within the context of 10 percent unemployment and limited capital for new ideas and innovation, predictability in global commerce is as important to Washington as itever has been. <br> Hundreds of thousands of American jobs, including many in the high-tech sector, are directly tied to predictable and robust business with China. <br> Third, Washington can set its own economic example. This begins with emphasizing the importance of private-public solutions — including our commitment to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education; implementing tax policies that help research and development, and moving to a clean energy economy, based on IT-driven technologies like smart grids. <br> More broadly, whether related to cybersecurity, protecting intellectual property or encouraging globally accepted standards, it is critical to Washington’s long-term competitiveness that we continue to be a pace setter by adopting policies that discourage others from going their own way with regard to country-specific solutions. <br> With China, there are barriers to overcome and little room for error. <br> Let’s hope the diplomacy demonstrated at the G-20 ignites a movement to get back on track. <br> Dean Garfield is president and chief executive officer of the Information Technology Industry Council. 
POLITICO's Arena contributors discuss if Obama is facing apolitical fate similar to that of Jimmy Carter. Gregory Hess, professor of economics and taxation, Claremont McKenna College <br> Whatever you think of the Obama administration’s performance, the comparison to President Carter isapples and orangesto my mind. The Iranian Revolution and subsequent U.S. hostage situation were bellwether international historical events that the U.S. government was ill prepared to deal with either in the particular or in the context of a wider shift in Middle East politics. President Carter’s response was to micromanage and become self-absorbed by the daily events. His hold on the Democratic Party was always tenuous, and he was never able, even before the Iran situation, to lead his party and establish, let alone maintain, cohesion. By contrast, President Obama has continued to maintain a broad reach in the Democratic Party, though he has not had much success in outreach to the Republican Party, passed some historical legislation and clearly is the unrivaled leader of the Democratic Party. <br> Stephen Hess, media and government scholar <br> Carter is now the shorthand for “the failed presidency.” And these comparisons always predict or warn that Obama’s will fail, too. But in aims, operations, person or first-year record with Congress, Carter and Obama are poles apart. Start by comparing their inaugural addresses. Compare the personnel of their White House staffs. If the Obama presidency ultimately fails — far too early to judge — it will not be necessary to resurrect the ways of Jimmy Carter (or, I can see it coming, Woodrow Wilson). <br> Steven Calabresi, law professor, Northwestern University <br> Obama is showing signs of serious incompetence in crisis management with the Gulf oil spill that do call to mind memories of Jimmy Carter’s botched effort to manage the Iranian hostage crisis. In addition, he is projecting U.S. weakness abroad, which is emboldening Iran, Turkey, Brazil and North Korea to take aggressive anti-Western threats. At home, he is pursuing economic policies that eventually will lead to a return to the stagflation of the 1970s. There is essentially no new jobs creation in the private sector because Obama has scared the daylights out of small businesses, and no one wants to invest or expand in this economic climate. <br> Meanwhile, the steady cranking of the government printing presses to pay for our gargantuan deficits almost guarantees that inflation eventually will return. Once the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of this year, the recovery will take a huge hit as taxes go up. Higher unemployment, higher inflation and ultimately higher interest rates are what lie before us. <br> Taken together, these three things mean a higher misery index. Wouldn’t it be nice if this trip back to the 1970s were limited to just wearing bell bottoms? But, it is not. <br> Tevi Troy, former Bush administration official and visiting senior fellow, the Hudson Institute <br> Like Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama was a fresh young face who came to power after a long period of Republican rule and found that running things in Washington is more difficult than running a smart campaign. <br> Of course, this description applies to Bill Clinton, as well. The difference between the Clinton and Carter approaches is Clinton was willing to pivot and move to the center in the face of political and policy realities. <br> Obama thus far has shown little willingness to take the needed steps to the center — and the Democratic leaders in Congress have no interest in letting him do so. 
April really is the cruelest month. <br> April 19, 1995 — the Oklahoma City bombing. 168 killed. <br> April 19, 1993 — the Waco siege ends with a catastrophic fire. 76 dead. <br> April 20, 1999 — the Columbine school shootings. 13 dead. <br> April 16, 2007 — the Virginia Tech shootings. 32 people murdered. <br> April seems to have some special meaning for political extremists — and the dangerously disturbed. Some people associate it with Adolf Hitler’s birthday, April 20. It is an ominous month. <br> This year, on April 19, gun rights activists have scheduled a rally in Washington. In Oklahoma, some conservative legislators have proposed a volunteer state militia to resist federal government encroachments on state sovereignty. An organization called Oath Keepers is urging police, military, reservists and firefighters to pledge to refuse to obey “unconstitutional, unlawful orders.” <br> Meanwhile, some conservative websites show Democratic candidates in the cross hairs of a rifle. A Republican website that calls on voters to “Fire Pelosi” has a photo of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) engulfed in flames. <br> The theme of violent resistance is ugly. But as these April anniversaries remind us, it is not new. It has roots in some mainstream American values. <br> These days, extremist violence is associated mainly with fringe elements on the right, such as the militia movement that emerged in the 1990s. The country has not seen significant violence on the radical left since the Weathermen of the early 1970s. <br> Three deeply embedded forces appear to drive the temptation toward violence on the right. <br> One is distrust of government. <br> That is not new. The United States was settled mostly by people seeking religious or economic freedom. They were intensely distrustful of central authority. Distrust of government is written into our Constitution, with all its checks and balances and separation of power. <br> The belief in limited government is a mainstream American value. <br> Second is the gun culture. <br> Gun rights were written into the Bill of Rights. Pro-gun activists see the Second Amendment as giving citizens the right to defend themselves against a tyrannical government and to defend a system they believe is under threat. <br> “Over the last three or four years,” a tea party activist at an April 15 rally told The New York Times, “I’ve realized how immense that drift has been away from what made this country great.” <br> On the fringes of the right, defense turns into resistance. The implicit threat of violence is never far from the surface. “Violence is as American as cherry pie,” the left-wing black militant H. Rap Brown said during the 1960s. <br> D.H. Lawrence put it more poetically: “The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer.” <br> The notion of a conspiracy is never far from the surface either. “There’s a Communist living in the White House,” former “Saturday Night Live” comedian Victoria Jackson sang at the tea party rally. <br> “McCarthy Was Right” read one sign. Another read, “Hitler Gave Great Speeches, Too.” The ideologies may have been confused, but the point wasn’t. <br> Which leads to the third force — what historian Richard Hofstadter called “the paranoid style in American politics.” He described its hallmarks as “the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasy.” 
In Washington on Sunday, the tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding immigration reform looked like the opening round of the last thing the country needs now: another big debate on a divisive issue. <br> Yet Congress seems ready to take on immigration, which has been dividing Americans since the republic was founded. <br> But identifying immigrants as a “them,” as both their advocates and nativists do, misses the point. Immigrants — and their children — are the people who will help define the future “us.” They are also critical to the revival of the U.S. economy. <br> This is particularly true on the entrepreneurial frontier. <br> Overall, some of the country’s highest rates of entrepreneurship are found among immigrants from the Middle East, Cuba, South Korea and countries of the former Soviet Union. These recent arrivals regularly build new businesses — from street-level bodegas to the most sophisticated technology firms. <br> Immigrants started one-quarter of all venture-backed public companies between 1990 and 2005. In addition, large U.S. firms are increasingly led by executives with roots in foreign countries, including 14 CEOs of the 2007 Fortune 100. <br> Nowhere is this contribution more critical than in our major cities, many of which would be economically destitute without these immigrant communities. <br> In Los Angeles County, for example, the self-employment rate among immigrants is more than 10 percent — almost twice that for the native-born. Nationwide, according to the last economic census, the number of all Latino establishments increased by nearly three times the national average, while those owned by all Asians expanded by two times. <br> Immigrant contributions extend across a range of activities, from retail and food to culture. Asian immigrants, like the Italians and Jews before them, have concentrated in specific niche markets and then expanded beyond historic ghettos. <br> Asian Indians, who began emigrating in large numbers starting in the 1970s, specialized in hotels and motels across the country. South Koreans opened greengroceries in New York and Los Angeles. Vietnamese became known for nail parlors, and Cambodians for doughnut stores. Overall, Asian enterprises expanded at roughly twice the national average in the first years of the new century. <br> Perhaps most remarkable has been the movement of Asian immigrants into technology. In California, they account for a majority of such firms. Regions at the center of the high-tech economy — including Silicon Valley, Orange County and parts of suburban Seattle — are now heavily Asian-American. Although most of these new companies are small, some have grown sizable. The founders of Sun Microsystems, Yahoo, AST Research and Solectron are all of Asian descent — and are largely immigrants. <br> This immigrant experience, says John Tu, president and co-founder of Kingston Technologies, the world’s largest independent producer of computer memory, has forced them to think differently. <br> “The key thing is,” Tu said, “being an immigrant makes you flexible. ... IBM, Apple and Compaq were inflexible. They told the memory customers: Take it or leave it. We thought about the customer and the relationship with the employees. I guess we didn’t know any better.” 
When the networking giant Cisco recently experienced a 23 percent jump in quarterly profit and 8 percent gain in revenue, John Chambers, the chairman and CEO, announced plans to hire as many as 3,000 workers — despite an economy struggling to recover from the worst fiscal crisis since the Great Depression. <br> Last week, Intel announced a $3.5 billion initiative for investment in U.S.-based technology companies, as well as a commitment, with 10 other tech firms, to increase hiring of college graduates. ATT and Verizon project capital expenditures in 2010 of nearly $35 billion combined. <br> Fortunately for our nation’s economy, the high-tech playbook is a growth catalyst. After the early-1980s recession, the boom in personal computer and individual content creation — fueled by industry bellwethers like Intel, Apple, Dell, IBM and Microsoft — ushered in a new industry, thousands of jobs and the birth of the digital age. <br> The same was true in the mid-1990s, as the Internet revolutionized how businesses and consumers access information, perform research and engage in commercial transactions worldwide. <br> During the past decade, new platforms and technologies — such as virtualization, WiFi, cloud computing, mobility and social networks — have spurred new levels of efficiency, collaboration and cost savings. They created the likes of Google, MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. <br> A recent Democratic Leadership Council study found that investment and recovery go hand in hand. In the past two decades, job creation has closely tracked business investment in equipment, software and computers. Innovation is especially vital for small businesses, which create most new jobs. <br> The research firm Gartner estimates that global spending on technology products and services will rise by 4.6 percent to $3.4 trillion this year, after initially predicting 3.3 percent growth. New and emerging markets — including the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China — are expected to be responsible for more than half of all industry growth, according to IDC, a research firm. <br> While the potential of information and communications technology to drive a job-rich economic recovery looks almost certain, three factors will determine the extent of its success: <br> First, the degree to which Congress and the Obama administration — working with the private sector — outline and implement a plan for the United States to become the global leader in ICT-driven innovation. <br> Consider the issue for education. While our nation’s higher education system is the world’s most innovative, the latest scorecard, released by the National Center for Education Statistics, shows that the average score of U.S. eighth-graders in math and science is 520, compared with 530 in Russia, 553 in England and 561 in Japan. <br> We must embrace what works in the private sector, learn from our closest competitors and invest in programs that ensure our K-12 education system doesn’t fall behind. <br> Another priority must be our complex corporate-tax system. One-fifth of the U.S. private-sector work force (nearly 22 million in 2006) works for U.S.-based multinational companies. Yet the United States is the only large economy with both a worldwide tax system and a corporate tax rate greater than 30 percent — with enough tax loopholes to support the largest fleet of tax lawyers and accountants in the world. <br> To compete in the global economy, Washington needs a competitive tax structure that enables us to create jobs, promote innovation and raise living standards. <br> Second, a shift in mind-set from “make-work” to “work-wireless.” Too often, we associate job creation with shovel-ready projects and not information-technology-focused job-training programs that teach skills necessary to help Americans compete with peers in Europe and Asia, including those in intelligent infrastructure projects. 
Julian E. Zelizer, professor, Princeton University <br> “Lieberman’s ‘flip-flop’ does raise the question of whether [Harry] Reid and the Democratic leadership should take a tougher stand against the handful of moderates who have been making things difficult in the Senate. This was the strategy used in the 1970s, when House Democrats finally moved against the Southern committee chairmen who had been the source of obstruction. They deposed four chairmen, instituted a series of reforms that diminished their autonomy and made the caucus a much stronger force in House politics. Thus far, the strategy has been to negotiate and compromise with the Senate moderates. At some point, the leadership might shift, especially if the Senate health care bill falters.” <br> Rhodes Cook, writer and political analyst <br> “I will leave the proper response of Democratic Senate colleagues to Joe Lieberman for others to discuss. All I can say is that he should thank his lucky stars that he is still in the Senate. Many states have ‘sore loser’ laws that prevent candidates who lose in a party primary from coming back and running as an independent in the general election, as Lieberman did in 2006. They force candidates to pick one venue or the other but do not allow them two bites at the apple in one year. Connecticut, though, does not have such a sore loser law, which permitted Lieberman to continue a Senate career that since 2006 has become increasingly anti-Democratic.” <br> Jeffrey C. Stewart, professor, University of California, Santa Barbara <br> “It’s real simple. Harry Reid needs to prepare a bill that Olympia Snowe will support. That is the formula that worked with the stimulus bill. Then it doesn’t matter if Lieberman or [Ben] Nelson does not vote for the bill. Then, after the bill is signed by [President Barack] Obama, strip Lieberman of his chairmanship and campaign like hell against his reelection. Politics is about rewarding friends and punishing flip-floppers.” <br> Greg Dworkin, contributing editor, Daily Kos <br> “Health care reform is still in the cards, no thanks to Republicans and their ally, Joe Lieberman (Party of One-Conn.). If Democrats and independents didn’t get it when Joe supported [George W.] Bush on Iraq or [Sen. John] McCain in the election, they might get it now. Lieberman is beholden to the insurance companies in Hartford and wants no part of anything that will help their customers or his constituents. (In Connecticut, they heavily favor the public option.) Lieberman won with independent support, breaking promises every step along the way, and this is his payback to Connecticut residents like myself. National Journal, in its year-end poll, features significant political insider distrust of Joe (along with Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann), the price of going rogue and mugging for the cameras. But whether health reform is done with or without Joe Lieberman, by reconciliation or by 60 votes, something will pass. The real questions, as always with the Senate, are: “What is it that will pass, and will it be enough?” <br> Lanny Davis, attorney and Democratic strategist <br> “I have another great idea. Let’s throw Sen. Joe Lieberman, with all these liberal and Democratic positions, out of the caucus because of his position supporting revolutionary national health care but not 100 percent of the liberal wish list — and thereby Talibanize/purify the Democratic Party (just like Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh are trying to do for the GOP), even if that means going back to minority party status by also losing all the Senate moderates and Blue Dogs in the House who share some of Lieberman’s concerns.” 
POLITICO's Arena contributors ask if Obama has ‘bet his presidency’ on the outcome of the NYC terror trials. <br> Steven Calabresi, professor, Northwestern University School of Law <br> “Obama has lived up to his oath of office by scheduling these trials before a life-tenured judge and jury. Suppose some on the left called for John Yoo and all the interrogators at the CIA to be tried before a military commission with no life-tenured judge or jury? They were, after all, officers in the war on terror assisting the commander in chief on a military mission. Why shouldn’t they get a court-martial instead of a trial before a life-tenured judge and a jury? <br> “The answer is that the Constitution’s separation of powers provides that, while Congress makes the law and the president executes it or enforces it, only the life-tenured Article III courts assisted by a jury can impose punishments. The constitutional way to punish the 9/11 terrorists is the same way we would use to punish military interrogators who violated the law against torture. No Article III court or jury — no constitutional power to punish. It is a simple question of the separation of powers — something I had thought conservatives believed in passionately.” <br> Richard Albert, professor, Boston College Law School <br> “The president did not bet his presidency on the outcome of the 9/11 trials — the attorney general did it for him. By choosing a civilian court over a military tribunal, the attorney general has unfortunately chosen to prosecute the 9/11 conspirators as criminals rather than as the terrorists they really are. Civilian courts are not the proper forum within which to try terrorists because civilian courts lack the special national security procedures available in military tribunals alone.” <br> James P. Pinkerton, fellow, New America Foundation <br> “It’s not so much that Obama has bet his presidency on the outcome of the [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed] terror trial, it’s that Obama is betting his presidency on being more politically correct than George W. Bush. And that’s risky, as all those PC pieties are now crashing down amid an ongoing clash of civilizations, as shots and bombs go off in Fort Hood and Kabul — and all across the ‘bloody borders’ of Islam, as the late Samuel Huntington described them. <br> “But it was Bush, not Obama, who declared, back in 2001, that ‘Islam is peace.’ Such sentiments didn’t keep the 43rd president from fighting in Iraq, of course, but as part of his liberation theory, he was required to believe that the only thing standing between Muslims and loving America was a few bad-apple governments. ... <br> “So Obama could have swept into power pushing a new broom, applying a neo-realist vision to the challenges of homeland security as well as national security. After the Fort Hood shooting, he could have guided investigators to the obvious conclusion: that the policies that made America safe for Nidal Hasan were all implemented in the Bush 43 era or before, and that he, Obama, would make the necessary hard-nosed changes to make Americans safer. But that would have been too easy. Instead, our Nobel laureate president must prove that the cure for the ailments of PC is more PC. <br> Bernard Finel, senior fellow, American Security Project <br> “It is hard to see how these trials could become a defining moment for this administration given the other challenges it faces and initiatives it has launched. There is something disturbing and slightly pathological about the response of many conservatives to the idea of respecting the rule of law in dealing with terrorism. And their preference, essentially, for unfettered presidential authority seems at odds with their oft-expressed skepticism about the intentions and capacity of the U.S. government.” <br> Be a part of the daily political debate with PROJECT POLITICO powered by YouTube.

The Democrats have just fired their biggest guns at the insurance industry, but unfortunately they are shooting very loud blanks. <br> That’s what they did Wednesday, when the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing titled Prohibiting Price Fixing and Other Anticompetitive Conduct in the Health Insurance Industry. <br> There is no way in the world that health insurance companies are going to allow Congress to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gives them a pass from federal antitrust enforcement. The insurance industry is the only one, other than Major League Baseball, to enjoy this exemption. <br> But don’t expect the majority in Congress to play ball with those who are serious about getting rid of that exemption, even though the ever-quotable Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it “one of the worst accidents in American history.” <br> It was no accident at all. McCarran-Ferguson has been with us since 1945, when the industry got Washington’s willing lawmakers to reinstate theindustry’s immunities from federal regulation after the Supreme Court had, a year before, overturned the apple cart of special treatment insurers had gotten since right after the Civil War. <br> Because of McCarran-Ferguson, they must be regulated state by state, which is an ineffective patchwork compared with one national set of standards. <br> The result is that the insurance behemoths don’t have to pay attention to the antitrust restrictions that prevent normal companies from colluding andengaging in their other anti-competitive practices. <br> That’s why Americans can’t take their business elsewhere when their health insurer cheats them.There are no real alternatives. When it comes to abusive practices, the companies are allowed to all be in this together. Understandably, they cherish this exemption. Since it has meant they could accumulate limitless wealth, all they have to do is shower a little bit of it into the campaign coffers of this generation’s pliant politicians, and they will keep the advantage that lies at the heart of health care dysfunction in this country. <br> As we have heard ad nauseam, another way to achieve competition would be some variation of a public option.Of course, the industry is dead set against that idea, too, and can be expected to spend whatever it takes to distort the issue. However, there is one hint of its vulnerability. <br> It appears that maybe these insurance guys are not as smart as they think they are. For instance, by putting out their blatantly misleading analyses of pending health reform legislation, they were so shameless with their distortions that they insulted members of Congress, who don’t want to be treated like fools, whether they are or not. <br> So some variation of the public option is back on the table. But forget about repealing McCarran-Ferguson. It won’t happen. The Democrats who threatened that were only being spiteful.But they did a service by bringing it up and displaying how it is that the insurance companies can pretty much do whatever they want to. <br> Bob Franken, a former CNN correspondent, is a syndicated columnist and a frequent guest on MSNBC and other TV news networks. 
For the confidence that the American Clean Energy and Security Act will spark a clean energy revolution, look to 1961. <br> That year, at the height of the Cold War, President John F. Kennedy vowed before Congress that the United States would send a man to the moon and back before the end of the 1960s. His statement was bold, imaginative and, at the time, a gamble. But Kennedy recognized America’s innovative zeal, and the challenges were met. <br> Today, America has a different set of challenges. Our economy is in the worst recession since the 1930s. Our nation is addicted to foreign oil, and that risks our national security. Over this all looms the prospect of catastrophic climate change. Like 1961, now is no time to accept the status quo. <br> Thankfully, we still have the ability to launch a technological revolution, as we did in 1961. We need a New Apollo Energy Project to spur economic growth, reduce carbon emissions and break our addiction to foreign oil — and the House of Representatives approved such a program last month. <br> On June 26, the House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act by a vote of 219-212. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), my colleagues on that panel, crafted this landmark legislation to fight climate change and move America toward a new clean energy economy. The bill, also known as ACES, will cap greenhouse gas emissions and promote conservation and clean, renewable energy sources. ACES will bolster our tepid economy while helping us avoid the worst consequences of climate change. <br> Reducing greenhouse gas emissions can create American jobs by boosting emerging sectors of the clean energy economy. Globally, we are in a race with other countries to create the clean energy jobs of the future — witness China’s massive investments in solar energy and electric cars. Under ACES, money that now lines the pockets of oil barons in the Middle East will go to American workers, like those installing turbines at wind farms in Washington state’s Kittitas Valley. <br> Construction workers will install energy-efficient windows and insulation in homes and businesses nationwide. Our oil reserves pale in comparison with those of Saudi Arabia, but we are rich in wind, solar and geothermal energy; sequestered coal; and the ultimate energy source: efficiency. It’s estimated Congress’s recent clean energy efforts will replace 5 million barrels a day of oil that we now import; that’s more than we bring in from the Middle East and Venezuela combined. 
Does the Tiller murder change the abortion debate? POLITICO's Arena contributors give their two cents. <br> Theda Skocpol, professor, Harvard University: <br> “It certainly should. ‘Debate’ is not what has been going on. Systematic, sustained harassment of clinic professionals and demonization of doctors have been the modus operandi of the extreme anti-abortion groups, egged on by Fox News, etc. This is the sort of extreme harassment and verbal demonization that always precedes actual violence, official or quasi-tolerated, in every historical situation from Nazism to ethnic cleansing. Tiller’s assassin was no ‘lone wolf.’ He was thoroughly embedded in an extremist terrorist-harassment network.” <br> Steve Steckler, chairman and founder, Infrastructure Management Group: <br> “Those opposing abortion from the moral high ground, such as the Catholic Church and an increasing number of secular humanists, have been admirably consistent in their defense of life in all circumstances. This consistency should provide enough solace of conscience for pro-lifers and enough security for abortion rights supporters to continue the debate uncowed, but, in the meantime, both sides should be working together to make abortion and the unwanted pregnancies that tempt it much rarer. That was the promise of President Obama’s Notre Dame speech, one for which he should be held accountable over the next three years.” <br> Grover Norquist, president, Americans for Tax Reform: <br> “No. The good news for the body politic is that all the major right-to-life groups and individual leaders strongly condemned the murder. That is important and healthy.” <br> Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor, Harvard Business School: “The appalling murder of Dr. Tiller is one more sign that rigid right-wing rhetoric fosters hate and intolerance while appearing to justify extremism by seeing no exceptions, no personal circumstances, no private decisions, no nuances. Certainly, this was an act of one individual with one gun performing one homicide. But which political persuasion finds gun rights more important than a woman’s right to choose? Right-wing fundamentalism is not pro-anything. It is anti-this and anti-that.” <br> Jeffrey Stewart, professor, University of California, Santa Barbara: <br> “No, unfortunately, the murder of Dr. Tiller won’t change the dynamics of the abortion debate. And it won’t change the ease of access to firearms or the propensity to use them to kill — both of which set America apart from all other modern, post-industrial nations in the world. The reality is that killing is as American as apple pie. It is a tragic irony of the ‘right-to-life’ movement that ease of access to abortions has radically declined in America and yet the ease of access to firearms that kill far more people in America remains undiminished. Is not freedom from getting shot in church a ‘right to life’? <br> “Which leads to another question: Why don’t the people who stoke these fires of mental terrorism ever come out and apologize to the families of the loved ones who are robbed of their family members when the extremists take such action? Bill O’Reilly is forever lecturing America on morality. Where is his? There is a profound disingenuousness about always saying that the First Amendment does not give one the right to yell, ‘Fire!’ in a crowded theater and then suddenly embracing as freedom of expression the right to point the media gun at someone with whom one disagrees. Especially when one knows that there is a history of people being killed after such ‘outings.’” 
Maggie Mahar, Author, Century Foundation HealthBeat blog: <br> The murder of Dr. Tiller changes the terms of the debate for at least one person: President Barack Obama. Not long ago, the president expressed his hope that pro-life advocates would find a common ground with those who support choice. As we noted yesterday on HealthBeat, the killing underscores just us how far apart the two sides are. Of course, the vast majority of pro-life advocates do not support violence. But the response to the murder by advocates like Bill O'Reilly reminds us just how much hatred the debate has generated. Waving photos of bloody fetuses, denouncing doctors who dare to perform legal abortions, and pushing for laws that subject women to cruel and unusual punishment, those who oppose abortion have brought emotions to a fever pitch. <br> In recent years, there have been no killings of abortion physicians. Why? Because pro-life advocates had intimidated the majority of the nation's doctors. As we noted in an earlier post on HealthBeat, very few medical schools now offer training in how to perform abortions, and. the shortage of providers is severe: Some 87% of counties in this country do not have an abortion provider. This means that poor women often have to travel long distances to find what the law has promised them: a safe abortion. <br> In 1995, pro-life Congressmen banned abortion coverage for federal employees covered by Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) And under the Bush administration, state laws became more and more draconian. Thirteen states now require doctors to offer ultrasound exams to women seeking abortions, and in Oklahoma the law requires doctors to perform the ultrasound while making sure that the woman has a clear view of the screen during the exam. During the sonogram, doctors are directed to deliver a mandated script; providing details about a fetus's development and the suggestion that the fetus may feel pain during the procedure. (This is what I call cruel and unusual punishment.) ... Pro-life advocates felt that, for all practical purposes, they were winning the debate. It was becoming more and more difficult for a woman to have an abortion. Her opponents had the country locked down. <br> With President Obama's election, suddenly, pro-lifers were no longer so confident. While campaigning in 2007, Obama told the Planned Parenthood Action Fund; The first thing I'd do as president is sign the Freedom of Choice Act. Since then he has backed away from endorsing the Act, saying I think that the most important thing we can do to tamp down some of the anger surrounding this issue is to focus on those areas that we can agree on. At Notre Dame, he emphasized the need for both sides of the abortion issue establish common ground and make sure that all of our health care policies are grounded in clear ethics and sound science, as well as respect for the equality of women. Then came the assassination of Dr. Tiller. It was as if the killer had aimed his bullet directly at the president's policy. Recently, pro-life advocates have expressed concern that, under the president's health reform plan, universal coverage will include legal abortions. The killer was sending a message to the president: forget about common ground. <br> President Obama was visibly outraged by the murder. It is bound to make him reflect on whether it is possible to tamp down the anger or whether this administration must make it clear to all Americans that, under the law, abortion is legal. And that no advocacy group has the right to try to remake the law through a process of intimidation and terrorism. <br> A week ago, I was skeptical as to whether national health reform would cover abortions. Now, I think it will. This killer threw down a gauntlet, and those who support choice will respond. They won't buy guns. They will contact their elected representatives. <br> Cesar Conda, Republican strategist, former Romney and Cheney advisor: Some on the extreme pro-abortion Left are attempting to use the murder of George Tiller to tar the entire pro-life movement, going so far as to compare pro-life Americans to the Taliban. Every authentic and successful movement has had deranged people who pick up its cause. I mean the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski shared the environmental movement’s objective to restrict industrialization, but no one in their right mind would blame his murderous actions on the Sierra Club or the Natural Resources Defense Council. This effort by some on the extreme Left to attach Tiller’s murderer and his anti-life tactics to the entire pro-life movement will ultimately fail because Americans are moving toward the pro-life side of the debate, according to recent polls. <br> I agree with Grover Norquist’s observations about how the “increase in the number of Americans with sonograms of babies in the womb on their office computers and refrigerators” has shifted public opinion, especially when those sonograms are juxtaposed against the public’s increased awareness of the gruesome procedures involved in partial-birth and late-term abortions, which are already banned in 34 states. 
A year ago, debate over how to reduce U.S. carbon emissions reached a heated crescendo. Ultimately, a Senate proposal to implement a cap-and-trade system that would impose a limit, or “cap,” on the amount of carbon dioxide and other emissions was rejected. The high price tag was simply too much for lawmakers who would have to soon answer to affected businesses and constituents back home. Back then, the country was teetering on the brink of a recession. Today, we’re neck deep in one. <br> American families are now focused on keeping their jobs, recovering the remnants of their retirement plans and making it to their next paycheck. As such, the timing could not be worse for another bite at this bitter apple. Yet some of our former House colleagues are determined to do just that with legislation to impose a cap-and-trade system, which will be voted on in committee this week. While the end goals of the legislation may be well-intentioned, the economic consequences for consumers and workers will be hard to swallow any way they slice it. <br> Firms and industries that cut their emissions below preset levels ostensibly would be able to “trade” credits to firms or industries that cannot meet their targets. Those that cannot, including many energy-intensive industries, would be forced to purchase them. The cost of these permits would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Others may simply forgo the option by shutting plants or moving production overseas. <br> As the clock ticks before the final vote, last-minute deals on free credits for carbon-intensive states are being offered in exchange for member votes — a sign that should worry the public. Rightly so, since the vast majority of man-made greenhouse-gas emissions come from the use of fossil fuels, which account for 85 percent of America’s energy generation. This includes the gas in our cars and the electricity that lights our homes, hospitals and schools. <br> Technology to curb emissions is far from proven but hopeful in many aspects. However, sacrificing economic activity through a de facto tax on energy use is simply not a viable option, especially in view of U.S. population growth estimates and the corresponding rise expected in energy demand. American Council for Capital Formation chief economist. Margo Thorning notes that each 1 percent increase in U.S. gross domestic product is accompanied by a 0.3 percent increase in energy use. To this end, the U.S. Department of Energy projects that the U.S. will need approximately 13 percent more energy by 2030 to accommodate our growing population, higher levels of employment and economic activity. The logical questions for our former colleagues who must cast votes on a cap-and-trade system is this: What is the real cost, and what is the actual benefit? 
Lately we’ve been hearing a lot about members of Congress who are Twittering, and the creation of YouTube portals for the House and Senate mark a further embrace of the new media. <br> While it’s good to see so many incumbents getting on the Internet wagon, in many cases politicians are starting to use these technologies without really understanding their value. They just don’t want to be perceived as “out of touch” or “uncool,” particularly to younger potential supporters. But very few national political actors really get how their world is radically changing and how they should adapt. <br> The success of Barack Obama’s campaign has ended once and for all the argument about whether the Internet matters in politics. All future campaigns will study and try to emulate the strategies and techniques his team employed in raising money, raising awareness and building a grass-roots network of supporters and activists. But as much as it can be argued that Obama achieved the holy grail of all online politics — that is, converting online enthusiasm into votes — there remains one fundamental reason he was successful that will not be so easy for other politicians to copy. <br> The big shift is the rising importance of the word “we” in politics. Time magazine was wrong when it named “you” as its “Person of the Year” in 2006. What is fundamentally different about the times we are living in is how easy it has become for networks of like-minded people to form around every issue under the sun. As much as one may marvel at the world of personalization that the Internet has created, the social Web has made everyone’s personal information valuable only as it relates to everyone else. What’s the point of having a detailed Facebook profile without a sea of others who do also? Why bother blogging or Twittering anything if no one else is there to read it? <br> In technology terms, this is known as Metcalf’s Law. The value of a network grows the more nodes it contains. For example, the value of owning a fax machine went up as more people owned faxes. Translated to the social arena, what this means is the value of belonging to a network grows as more people join in. But as we all join and participate in these new communications networks, a subtle shift in power is taking place, from the center out to the edges. 
Back in 1997, I visited two Houston elementary schools, Roosevelt and Benbrook, located only a couple of miles apart in equally disadvantaged neighborhoods serving equally disadvantaged students. Roosevelt was hitting academic home runs, while Benbrook lagged far behind. <br> Why the difference? My story attempted to answer that question, but in hindsight the answer was less important than the fact that I was able to even pose the question. I went to Houston because Texas had a revolutionary school accountability system that tracked children by race and economic background, thus allowing apples-to-apples comparisons of which schools were doing the best job with the kids they were handed. <br> I wasn’t alone in noticing the potential of accountability by the numbers. Then-Gov. George W. Bush, who inherited that system, noticed it as well, inspiring him to make school reform the stuffing inside his “compassionate conservatism” theme in the 2000 presidential election. Surely you have not forgotten the “bigotry of low expectations.” Among soccer moms, that bumped up Bush on the comfort-level meter just enough to neutralize the traditional 15-to-20-point advantage Democrats traditionally enjoy on education issues. The rest is history. <br> Cynics assumed the Republican school reform rhetoric would quickly evaporate, but once in Washington, Bush shocked House conservatives by promptly acting on his campaign pledge. (Then-Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas) once confessed to Rush Limbaugh his distaste for supporting Bush education reforms, saying that abolishing the Department of Education was his true preference.) Bush, however, didn’t need their support. Once he convinced key liberals such as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Education Trust’s Kati Haycock that he believed education reform was the new frontier in the civil rights struggle, a bipartisan effort then produced No Child Left Behind, the education law signed on January 2002. NCLB was a mirror image of what I saw in Houston that day. <br> The law judges schools by the job they do for all children, not just the easy-to-teach children. Suddenly, hundreds of schools that had been hiding their failures to teach poor and minority students behind school averages were outed, which was appropriate. That brand of school accountability, known to education insiders as disaggregated data, is not just George W. Bush’s education legacy; it’s the jewel of any domestic achievement. Over time, I’m guessing, it will trump any overseas accomplishments, such as ramping up the AIDS fight in Africa. 
To Democrats, he’s the second coming of JFK. His rhetorical gifts are Reagan-esque. Meanwhile Republicans are doing their best to depict him as Jimmy Carter 2.0. Everyone seems to have an opinion about which past president Barack Obama most resembles. But in some of the most important ways, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee resembles none of these past presidents as much as he does the one man who stands between him and the presidency: John McCain. <br> At first glance, such a comparison seems strained. Whereas Obama is young, black and cool-headed, McCain is seasoned, white and fiery. But looking beyond appearances and temperament to the substance of their policy goals, the candidates portray themselves similarly: as post-partisan reformers who are unafraid to stand up to special interests. <br> What’s striking, however, is that when it comes to accomplishing these goals, Barack Obama is a John McCain wannabe. <br> Obama has staked his candidacy on the notion that he alone can move America beyond the hyper-partisanship that dominates politics. He bolsters his assertion by touting his record of reaching across the political aisle. In July, he told National Public Radio, “Both at the state legislative level and at the federal legislative level, I have always been able to work together with Republicans to find compromise and to find common ground.” <br> But Obama was a reliable liberal vote in the Illinois Senate, supporting hundreds of tax increases and extreme gun control measures. He was the only senator to oppose a state law prohibiting early prison release for sex offenders and twice opposed bills requiring medical care for aborted babies who survive. On other key issues, Obama refused to take a stand at all, voting “present” more than 130 times, including on common-sense legislation to ban partial-birth abortion. <br> Since ascending to the U.S. Senate, Obama’s alleged aisle-crossing has been even harder to detect. In fact, Obama has proved the most dependably left-wing member of the Senate, according to the rankings of National Journal, which noted that in 2007, “Obama voted the liberal position on 65 of the 66 key votes.” <br> Obama has occasionally shown some bipartisan inclinations. But voting to provide combat gear for troops in harm’s way and expressing possible support for merit pay for public school teachers hardly sets him apart. As columnist Charles Krauthammer jabbed, “bipartisan support for apple pie is hardly a profile in courage.” And though histeaming with Republican Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) to pass ethics reform legislation is commendable, the bill was so popular that it passed the Senate 98-2. <br> Barack Obama claims that as president, he would place principle ahead of politics, but he has rarely, if ever, taken a position that hurt him politically. Even Obama's friend Coburn has said, “It’s easy to work across the aisle on consensus items. It’s when you demonstrate that you’ll stand in between, in no man’s land, between the two trenches of the Democratic and Republican base, and you’ll take the heat. We haven’t seen that from Barack. As much as I like him, he’s not ever rejected anything of his party to be able to stand in the middle.” <br> In contrast, McCain has worked with Democrats on tough issues including gun rights, campaign finance reform, immigration and caps on greenhouse gas emissions. 
While envy may well be a facet of every presidential campaign, it rarely appears in naked form. To be sure, rivalry, envy’s emotional cousin, is a central element of the competition. But once the primary season ends, the political rules call for rivals to spar chiefly across party lines. <br> These notions come to mind in light of the angry comments the Rev. Jesse Jackson recently made about Barack Obama that, to Jackson’s regret, became public. Much was made of Jackson’s vulgar remarks about Obama. Some accounts focused on Jackson’s charge that Obama was “talking down to black people.” <br> While both points were newsworthy, the real story is Jackson’s jealous rage at Obama’s emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee. It could well be that Jackson’s fury is fueled not only by his innate narcissism, but also by the notion that Democrats would have won the presidency in 1988 had he been on the ticket. <br> Similar hidden pangs of envy can be found throughout much of the nation’s political history. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, another prickly Democrat who had a good deal to say about race, once said, “We are all entitled to our own opinions, but we are not entitled to our own facts.” We need to focus on Moynihan’s dictum as we parse the Jackson-Obama controversy. <br> Few observers now recall just how close Jackson came to winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988. Before this year’s South Carolina primary, Bill Clinton cited Jackson’s success there, but merely to suggest that Obama, like Jackson before him, was a niche candidate with only a limited appeal to the broader electorate. <br> One need not gloss over Jackson’s documented character flaws to recall the breadth of Jackson’s support in the 1988 primary contest, which I covered for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Cox Newspapers. Although dismissed beforehand by some pundits as a one-trick civil rights activist, Jackson managed to win five primaries in that year’s version of Super Tuesday. He came in just behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, who won six primaries, and he was even with Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee. <br> Overall, Jackson captured nearly 7 million votes in 1988, winning at least 11 contests and perhaps as many as 13. For a time, after capturing 55 percent of the vote in the Michigan caucus, he was widely viewed as the front-runner, with a majority of pledged delegates. Writing in The New York Times, R.W. “Johnny” Apple called 1988 “The Year of Jackson.” <br> By the time the Democrats arrived in Atlanta for their convention, all the candidates had dropped out except Dukakis and Jackson, who was endorsed by, among other white politicians, Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. Jackson demanded a roll-call vote, although he realized he would come up short. And he did, with 1,219 delegates to Dukakis’ 2,877. <br> Jackson then told Dukakis that he was entitled to be his running mate. Dukakis, however, balked and chose Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. The so-called Boston-Austin axis was defeated in November after garnering Jackson’s lukewarm support. <br> Jackson’s whispered diatribe against Obama into a hot microphone reflects an unremarked-upon irony: If Obama, in Jackson’s mind, has been “talking down to black people,” then Jackson used much the same rhetoric in 1988. <br> He also ran, like Obama does today, as an economic populist. At a rally at an American Motors plant in Kenosha, Wis., Jackson spoke out against the decision by Chrysler, the plant’s new owners, to close it by the end of the year. With only a few blacks in the crowd, he said, “We have to put the focus on Kenosha, Wis., as the place, here and now, where we draw the line to end economic violence.” The United Auto Workers’ Local 72 thereupon voted to endorse Jackson’s candidacy, even though it was against union rules to do so. <br> Some critics believe Jackson has been cut too much slack and deserves his comeuppance. Jackson believes just the opposite. <br> Andrew Glass is a contributing editor at Politico. 
If you listen to most armchair pundits, you probably expect Virginia to be a pivotal swing state this November. But the truth is that while Virginia is purpling, John McCain has advantages in the Old Dominion that few other candidates would have. <br> To be sure, Virginia Democrats do have reason to be optimistic: They won the Executive Mansion in 2005, took a Republican U.S. Senate seat in 2006 and reclaimed the state Senate in 2007. But in 2004, George W. Bush walked to an 8-point victory in the commonwealth, which actually was a higher margin than the one by which he lost to John F. Kerry in the reliably blue state of New Jersey. Three and a half years later, Virginia will be more competitive, but Barack Obama — and the national media — shouldn’t underestimate how well-suited McCain is to win the state’s 13 electoral votes. <br> McCain starts with a strong base of military personnel, has solid support in Virginia’s key swing constituency of moderate Republicans and has a significant leg up over Obama in Appalachia. Hampton Roads alone is home to the Navy’s Atlantic fleet, NATO’s command center and hundreds of thousands of military personnel and veterans; Northern Virginia is home to the Pentagon, Quantico and Fort Belvoir. As a former POW and the son and grandson of admirals, McCain could boost turnout among this voting bloc. <br> A McCain presidency would mean steady defense spending, which would mean a sustained flow of money to Northern Virginia’s economy. Unlike funding for other high-tech areas such as Silicon Valley or the Research Triangle, the seed money for the booming Dulles Corridor in Northern Virginia came from Pentagon outsourcing that began in the Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton eras and accelerated with Homeland Security outsourcing in the George W. Bush years. <br> Major federal contractors set up shop in Northern Virginia and, in turn, subcontracted work to technology firms that hired accountants and lawyers. The young professionals who work at those firms in Tysons Corner, Reston and Ashburn are part of Obama’s core constituency. But the ideology and lifeblood of many of these firms is rooted in continued defense spending — one part of the Bush legacy that McCain would be sure to continue. In an election in which Republicans’ Iraq policy will hurt McCain in almost every state, his bullish foreign policy could actually help him in some quarters of Virginia. <br> Ironically, McCain’s reputation as a maverick and an occasional check against the Bush White House will score him some points among the moderate wing of Virginia Republicans. This group has historically been a key swing vote in statewide elections, breaking from the party several times in the decade, most memorably to side with then-Gov. Mark Warner on a $1.5 billion tax measure. <br> McCain’s popularity with these voters was apparent in his 2000 primary contest against Bush. Bush won every county west of Interstate 95 and south of I-66 and won by huge margins in reliably red areas such as the districts of Republican Reps. Eric Cantor, who was once a deputy whip for Tom DeLay, and Virgil H. Goode, who stirred up controversy when he criticized Rep. Keith Ellison’s swearing-in on the Quran. <br> McCain won the military-heavy 2nd District around Hampton Roads, the liberal 8th in Arlington and Alexandria and the suburban 11th, where moderate Republicans such as Rep. Tom Davis have thrived. <br> Many of the moderates who voted for McCain are the same ones who helped tip recent statewide elections to the Democrats. Gov. Tim Kaine won in part because GOP candidate Jerry Kilgore lost Fairfax County by 15 more points than Bush had a year earlier. The difference was probably backlash to Kilgore’s controversial Hitler and death penalty ads. Likewise, former Sen. George Allen lost only after moderate Republicans abandoned him following the “macaca” scandal. <br> But the Republicans running under those damaged candidates did fine. Every Republican congressman in Virginia was reelected in 2006, and Republican candidates for attorney general and lieutenant governor were elected in 2005, marking the first time in Virginia history that a Democratic governor had members of the opposite party serving in the two posts under him. It also suggested that elections in the state are more often than not referendums on the Republican candidate. 
If these seemingly endless Democratic primaries reveal anything beyond who has the most pledged delegates, it’s a blue-collar fault line that runs through the party. New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton dominates the archetypal older, white working-class vote, and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama does better with almost everyone else. But in contrast to conventional wisdom, this divide has less to do with race, guns, economic status and religion than with a larger worldview gap born of generational differences and technological change. <br> To blue-collar Americans, life is about paying one’s dues. Yes, they may want their kids to make it out of a steel town and get an Ivy League diploma, but at the kitchen table and the local tavern, the degree you receive is less impressive than the character education you earn at the school of hard knocks. This is the quintessential post-Depression narrative that gained hold in the ’50s: Men are sturdy and women are stoic, tradition and loyalty mean more than innovation and change, and what you accomplish is not as noteworthy as how hard you worked to get there. <br> In one of the more remarkable transformations in recent political history, Clinton has managed to morph her image in this campaign from that of a prototypical liberal elite into a working-class idol and waitress mom. The theme song from “Rocky” became her campaign anthem, and she has made it a point of pride to say that no matter how often she’s been knocked down, she has the grit and the will to keep getting up and, every time, it has made her stronger. <br> Clinton, once seen by conservatives as the bte noire of the ’60s, has become the candidate for an America of stalwart values, Rust Belt dreams and working-class determination. <br> To this America, Barack Obama may be an interesting and even attractive candidate, but largely because of his relative youth and his finely tailored demeanor, he seems to bear none of the scars that attest to an ongoing battle against the disappointment and frustration that are part of life. Those who have read his autobiography know he has not had it easy, but that doesn’t come through on the campaign trail. The Clintons’ charge that he’s inexperienced resonates with these voters not because it critiques his political bona fides but because it portrays his life as one lacking in tribulation and ordeal. <br> But all this gets flipped when the candidates are seen through the lens of the younger, more urbane and technologically savvy Democrats who tend to support Obama. To them, Obama is an inspiration similar to the high-tech and Internet entrepreneurs who have captured our imagination over the past three decades. If Clinton is U.S. Steel, Obama is Apple Computer. <br> What these voters prize is someone willing to break from the status quo, someone who values refreshing change over musty tradition, someone who promises a new paradigm rather than the old story line. If the old manufacturing sector was built on work rules, the new economy has thrived on tearing up those rules, on transparency and creativity and an end to hierarchy. It’s a culture in which a 20-something can become a CEO as quickly as a 50-something who has paid his dues. 
The last time the Higher Education Act was reauthorized, Bill Clinton was president, Apple had yet to unveil its iMac and public colleges cost about $1,636 annually. <br> In the 10 years since — and in the five years since the current law expired — our country and world have changed dramatically, and so have the needs of students, families and employers. It’s about time our higher education system caught up. <br> Earlier this month, the House overwhelmingly approved bipartisan legislation that would make the long-overdue changes needed to bring the Higher Education Act into the 21st century. The bill would address the obstacles that families face on the path to college, from soaring tuition prices at both public and private colleges, to an overly burdensome federal student aid application process, to student loan programs that have been mired in scandal. <br> The same morning we passed our bill, these pages ran an op-ed by Education Secretary Margaret Spellings that attacked our bipartisan effort over provisions in the bill that would ensure that the roles of the Department of Education, colleges, universities and accreditation agencies — the independent organizations that certify a school’s eligibility to receive federal funds — are clearly defined when setting accreditation standards. <br> Over the past year, Secretary Spellings has taken steps to override the roles of these accrediting agencies, institutions and Congress when it comes to the diverse needs of higher education. This centralized, cookie-cutter approach would ultimately lead to less innovation at campuses across the country — the wrong direction for our students and colleges. <br> Our proposal would strike a more reasonable balance to ensure that all stakeholders, including the secretary, have a seat at the table in ensuring that students and families can get the best possible education in return for their investment. <br> It’s deeply ironic that the same secretary who failed to conduct oversight during the worst financial scandals in the history of the federal student aid programs — scandals that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars — is now worried that our legislation will somehow undermine the accountability of colleges and universities. And it’s simply wrong for her to suggest that these proposals will somehow leave students and taxpayers in the dark. <br> In fact, this bill does just the opposite, taking a comprehensive, in-depth approach to provide consumers with much-needed transparency at every step of the higher education process. <br> H.R. 4137 would create an easy-to-use clearinghouse of information for students and families about college pricing. Consumers would be able to search for information based on their financial and academic needs, providing them with a more accurate view of their affordable college options. And for the first time, schools that raise their tuition well above the norm would be held accountable — an important step toward finally getting college prices under control. <br> The bill would also provide safeguards for borrowers of both federal and private student loans to protect them from deceptive and predatory lending practices. It would further simplify the federal student aid application form — which currently could confuse even the most savvy tax experts, let alone aspiring college students and their parents. <br> And the bill would help counter rising textbook prices, which have been driven up by publishers for too long. Just last week, Secretary Spellings argued that the federal government shouldn’t play a role in helping students better cope with these rising prices — a view that sums up just how out of touch this secretary and this administration are with the needs of today’s students and families who are struggling to pay for the cost of college. <br> We have an entirely different view: that it’s in the best interest of our country to remove any financial barriers standing between qualified students and a college education. We can’t afford to sit idly by as escalating costs make it more and more difficult for Americans to get a college degree. <br> The College Opportunity and Affordability Act will create the consumer-friendly, fair higher education system needed in today’s world. It will strengthen our work force and drive the innovation our nation needs to maintain our competitive edge. And it will ensure that, once again, the interests of students always come first. <br> The secretary should join a bipartisan majority of lawmakers in the House and the Senate, a broad coalition of organizations within the higher education community and, most importantly, students, in working to pass this bill into law. <br> Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) is the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. 
It’s just one presidential election cycle later, but the Swift Boat campaign that helped the Republicans sink Democratic nominee John F. Kerry in 2004 seems outdated in its chosen medium: television. <br> The dominance of the 30-second television ad may have peaked then, as the past three years have seen the action shift from the airwaves to cyberspace. <br> YouTube famously helped turn Virginia’s 2006 Senate race against Republican incumbent George Allen; his “macaca” comment helped cost his party control of that chamber. <br> So-called new media and virtual outreach are an increasing force in today’s political world, to the point that entire presidential debates are based around this rapidly growing medium. <br> All the major presidential candidates have tapped into social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook and LinkedIn in an effort to reach new voters. <br> Both Yahoo and YouTube (now a part of Google) have challenged the stale debate model. <br> Yahoo’s “mashup” format lets users pick an issue and a candidate and compare responses. <br> The questions in the YouTube-sponsored debate came from free-form videos submitted online. <br> Google and Apple lend their respective technological support to GenerationEngage, the civic engagement effort I co-founded. <br> Cell phones and viral video are further decentralizing political communication. <br> Independent political commentators are crashing the party, challenging the managed message of the traditional campaign. <br> Home-cooked videos such as “Obama Girl” and “Hillary 1984” have been as effective, if not more so, as the campaigns’ own productions. <br> Many candidates are giving in to this diffusion of influence. <br> The bloggers that were once independent commentators are now working for the political machine they once assessed — and often harassed — from the outside. <br> Yet while online outreach may be a necessary piece of the modern campaign, it is certainly not sufficient. Sure, YouTube (with the help of Allen) introduced macaca into the political lexicon and propelled Democrat Jim Webb to victory. <br> But that 2006 election also showed the limits of new media: The blogosphere could power Ned Lamont to an upset in the Connecticut Democratic primary, but incumbent Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman still won the general election handily as an independent. <br> And Howard Dean’s Netroots campaign generated drastically more buzz than votes in the race for the 2004 Democratic nomination. <br> The question is not whether these tools will continue to play a role in politics — they clearly will help shape political strategy and civic engagement, and increasingly so. <br> But whether they actually improve our democracy is an open question. <br> So far, Politics 2.0 has been as much about gimmickry and gaffes as it has been about raising the level of debate in this country. <br> But there is an opportunity for innovation to be a positive force in U.S. politics. <br> From blogs to social networking to file sharing, new participants — many of them young people who had previously been nonparticipants — are pushing the envelope of these tools for political outreach and communication. <br> With more and more people self-organizing and sharing information, the most effective campaigns will be driven by peer-to-peer mobilizations, autonomous and unbound by poll-tested stagecraft. <br> The financial markets were overcome with a comparable fascination with the power of the Internet during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. <br> To avoid a similar bust, perhaps there are lessons to be drawn. <br> Just as clicks and eyeballs were no substitute for profits, Facebook “friends” do not necessarily equal votes. <br> And virtual connections cannot take the place of actual contact with candidates. <br> The Internet has changed how politics is played. <br> But it cannot — and should not — change what political outreach should be about. That is education on the issues and vigorous assessment of candidates proposing to advocate for voters. <br> Technology should supplement the modern campaign, not take its place. If technological advances help produce more voters with more access to information, then our democracy will have made progress. <br> But, as old-fashioned as it may be, casting your vote on Election Day will remain the most important form of political participation. <br> Devin Talbott is co-founder and chairman of GenerationEngage, a grass-roots youth civic engagement effort. 
It’s no secret the U.S. economy is at a defining moment. From the subprime mortgage crisis to the rapid emergence of China and other quickly developing economies, America’s leadership will be tested as never before. <br> In the future, our place in the world will be determined less by the sweat of our brows and more by the value created with our minds — by the intellect and ingenuity of the next generation of American innovators. <br> Many of these future leaders can today be found at our nation’s institutions of higher learning, honing the knowledge, skills and worldviews that will guide their, and our, future. This so-called Net generation is different from those who came before, in no small way due to its fluency in all that the digital age makes possible — both legally and illegally. <br> As the digital future unfolds, it can be no surprise that colleges and universities — and the robust data networks they operate — are emerging as a pivotal petri dish in the vast global experiment under way to safeguard the value of intellectual property in the digital era. <br> We can’t afford to fail. It’s no secret the motion picture industry made fighting piracy its No. 1 priority — alongside producing great content for consumers around the world. <br> Causing annual losses totaling $18 billion, digital theft is no small matter to us. But more broadly relevant to the country, the motion picture, music, computer software, video game and publishing industries — intellectual property industries all — account for nearly 13 percent of U.S. economic growth. <br> Whether the issue is Social Security, health care or job opportunities, a healthy, growing national economy is central to how we address the important challenges before us — and our economic fate is increasingly tied to the future of intellectual property. <br> Today, we know that more than 40 percent of U.S. piracy losses — approximately $500 million each year — are attributed to college students illegally sharing files over peer-to-peer networks. In my view, it’s not an indictment of “kids these days.” <br> They are merely the first tech-fluent generation to be faced with this ripe, gleaming apple. What we see in this current dilemma is a glimpse of what is to come if we do not move very quickly to build a broad strategy for shoring up the intellectual property underpinnings of our digital economy. <br> Fortunately, the stakes are well-understood by many leaders in Congress. <br> Recently, House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller (D-Calif.) introduced the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which included appropriate, minimally invasive steps to enlist America’s publicly funded universities and colleges in this all-important effort. <br> The legislation will be considered by the full House soon, and the Motion Picture Association of America supports its passage. <br> This legislation calls on universities to educate students and staff on campus anti-piracy policies. It offers grants to those seeking new technology and educational solutions to help manage their networks with respect for copyright law. <br> And it asks universities to provide the secretary of education with a plan of action for addressing this challenge to their taxpayer-subsidized networks. (Universities already routinely produce similar reports on topics ranging from campus security to binge drinking.) <br> Intellectual property industries have a duty to aid these efforts. Companies such as those I represent are investing substantial resources in developing technologies that can help universities and all network operators quickly and seamlessly identify unauthorized content, protecting intellectual property and clearing a path to the growing array of legitimate (and often free) avenues to content. <br> These efforts are producing a variety of workable solutions that many universities already have deployed, saving them money while helping them effectively manage world-class research and education networks. <br> The MPAA also has created an education department to build its relationships with the higher education community and to explore additional opportunities to play a supportive role as universities engage in these efforts. <br> America’s institutions of higher education remain vital incubators of ideas and innovation. We need their participation and leadership on this central question of America’s economic future. <br> Congress is right to ask that respect for intellectual property rights register in a meaningful way on the radar of the nation’s publicly funded universities. I look forward to the day when the debate is not if we will work together but how we will do so most effectively. <br> Dan Glickman is chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America. 
Rudy Giuliani wants voters to ignore his personal life and elect him president based on his record as New York mayor. Recent data indicate that may not be a winning strategy. <br> Republican voters think his personal life is relevant and are skeptical about a candidate who — like he — has been divorced more than once or has a strained relationship with his kids. They also don’t see a stint as a big city mayor as the best training to be president. <br> Of course, Giuliani remains the GOP front-runner. He leads national polls, although in the early voting states — Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina — he is behind in many surveys. <br> But his numbers have dropped, while former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney have gained. Arizona Sen. John McCain, after a dip, has stabilized his position. <br> Giuliani leads because 82 percent of voters in last week’s New York Times/CBS poll say he has strong leadership qualities. But he is potentially vulnerable because his support for abortion rights, gay rights and gun control put him outside the GOP mainstream. <br> Moreover, in a nomination contest in which social conservatives carry great clout, his personal life is likely to be an issue. <br> Giuliani has been married three times, once to a second cousin. His second divorce was very messy amid allegations of infidelity that he has denied. Giuliani’s children have said they would not campaign for him. Their relationship appears, to put the best face on it, strained. <br> Giuliani uses public perception that he is a strong leader — perhaps the most important characteristic Americans seek in a president — at every opportunity. He tells voters that is what matters, not his personal life. <br> He also steers the conversation toward his record as mayor, claiming he turned The Big Apple into a decent place to live. <br> But he may be surprised that voters nationally don’t necessarily see his service as New York mayor — which Gothamites like to say is the second toughest job in the country — as the right preparation for the Oval Office. 
No one in his right mind would buy a television set that lets you watch only the channels that the manufacturer selects. In any case, the All-Channel Receiver Act of 1962 guarantees that no such sets are for sale. <br> But if you want to buy a cell phone that is guaranteed to work with whichever provider offers you the best deal, you are probably out of luck. <br> If you live in North America, it is impractical to buy an “unlocked” phone and hope it works with a wireless carrier of your choice. Nearly all of us buy a “locked” cell phone directly from a carrier. The Apple iPhone, for example, works only on ATT’s slower network — a sore point among consumers who would prefer to have an “open” phone. <br> Now the Federal Communications Commission, with a potentially valuable tool in hand, wants to shake up this cozy structure. The agency’s tool is a bill President Bush has signed into law that requires commercial broadcasters to digitize all 1,800 U.S. high-powered TV signals no later than 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 17, 2009. <br> Since nearly all of us have cell phones and televisions, we need to be more aware of an immensely important battle, involving huge legal and lobbying resources, that’s about to take place out of public view. <br> The government will reclaim a whopping 108 megahertz of spectrum in the transition. Public safety workers will be taken care of for free. <br> The FCC wants to lease the rest to the highest bidders in an anonymous auction next January. If it works out, experts say the swap may be worth as much as $20 billion. For one choice piece, known as “C Block,” the FCC has set a reserve price of $4.6 billion. <br> Enter Google, which maintains the lack of unified open standards in North America stunts the growth of handheld technologies. The search engine that has become a household verb proposes to meet the FCC’s reserve price and gobble up C Block — so long as the regulators open the spectrum to any application and any device that consumers select. <br> What’s more, Google says, this third-party software and hardware must work with whatever wireless network service users prefer. 
For the second time in three months, a voter-generated political video about the presidential race has made it past the million-view mark on YouTube. First came Phil de Vellis' Vote Different mashup of Apple's 1984 ad with an unflattering message about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.). That video took about three weeks to percolate online, hitting around 300,000 views before the mainstream media paid attention and vaulted it skyward. <br> Last week, the I Got a Crush … on Obama video topped a million views in just four days, according to our partners at TubeMogul.com, which tracks online video viewership. It didn't hurt, of course, that Crush features an attractive and scantily clad young woman, as well as an annoyingly catchy and funny song. That was catnip for cable news, which has played Crush over and over. <br> It's understandable why traditional media would mainly pay attention to the most popular online political phenomenon; in the few minutes or pages that they can devote to politics, they don't have the space to cover the horizon. But if you look at only super-popular videos like Vote Different or Crush, you will miss what is really going on with the new political world online. <br> Unlike the political discussion in print or on television, where space is scarce, there are no limits to what or how much can be posted online. Thus a conversation that was once dominated by former New York Times columnist Russell Baker's Great Mentioner (the unnamed Washington wise man who supposedly decided which presidential wannabes had the right timber), and more recently channeled by the Gang of 500 (coined by Mark Halperin, late of ABC's The Note), is now wide open to everyone and anyone. <br> Today, most people tune out paid marketing messages as fast as they can. Big media entities don't fare much better. We're far more likely to trust something a friend or acquaintance shares with us. So if someone posts a video with a statement about the campaign and shares it with 10 friends, who each tell 10 more, those 100 people may be more influenced by that one person than by any other political messenger they may encounter. <br> The same is true of the political blogosphere, where a handful of blogs may appear to have the lion's share of attention but a closer look shows that there are literally tens of thousands of sites that have at least 20 other sites linking to them. The amount of conversation going on in that arena is richer and, by sheer traffic alone, far larger than what you would find if you look at only the top 50 or 100 sites. <br> This is the long tail of online politics, and it is becoming as big in the videosphere as it is in the blogosphere. Chris Anderson of Wired magazine wrote the seminal article (and book by the same title) about this phenomenon, and his ideas as applied to commerce hold just as well for politics. In the world of bricks and mortar, where shelf space is scarce, retailers by necessity stock mainly best-sellers (the head of the long tail). But an online retailer like Amazon or Netflix can sell millions of titles, and the cumulative sales of all those little, unknown books or movies can be quite substantial. 
So will he or won't he? <br> Speculation about Fred Thompson's presidential intentions has suffused cable news, talk radio and the blogosphere ever since the former senator and actor dangled the prospect of entering the contest -- tantalizingly -- in March. <br> It's not exactly clear what has given rise to the Thompson boomlet. Roll Call's Stuart Rothenberg observesthat he isn't necessarily such a good fit for the role of presidential candidate. It's simply that none of the other cast members is a perfect fit either. <br> Role indeed: Pundits, rivals and friends have plumbed Thompson's every statement, Senate vote and acting part for insights into his political tendencies and governing philosophy. Is he a real Reaganite? Anti-abortion? A flip-flopper? <br> Thompson himself has taken to the airwaves (guest-hosting Paul Harvey's radio show) and the conservative public square (writing op-eds for National Review Online and Townhall.com) to share his beliefs. <br> But to understand the essence of the man, we needn't look any further than his performance as Manhattan District Attorney Arthur Branch on the long-running crime drama Law Order. Sure, Thompson has played numerous roles on the big and small screen. But Law Order -- in which he has starred as the DA in more than 100 episodes since 2002 -- has best showcased his talents, convictions and demeanor. <br> Like Thompson himself, the no-nonsense, dry-humored, folksy Branch arrived in Manhattan after a successful career somewhere in the South. During the past five years, he has ably fulfilled his prosecutorial duties, cleansing the Big Apple of its woes (like another candidate). <br> Branch has a decidedly conservative bent, yet one tempered by a willingness and an ability to mesh with his apolitical executive assistant DA ( played by Sam Waterston, who has embarked on a nonpartisan project of his own, the Unity08 alternative campaign) and a series of predictably liberal assistant DAs. <br> And over the past three months, the show has tested highly political waters, with episodes about stem cells, creationism, illegal immigration, evangelical churches, homosexuality, Islamofascism and even the aborted O.J. book. <br> In each instance, Branch has studiously adopted a pragmatic, right-leaning position, standing on principle while ensuring that the job -- nailing the bad guys -- gets done. <br> One particular example stands out. In Talking Points, which aired on Feb. 2, 2007, an Ann Coulter look-alike is assaulted on campus while delivering a vitriolic speech. In prosecuting her assailant, Branch refuses to allow the Coulter clone to testify, describing her as one of the most polarizing people on the planet and fretting that putting her on the stand would alienate the jury. In his down-home manner, the DA laments that, nowadays, political discourse has deteriorated into chickens chattering in the churchyard. <br> But Branch is just getting started. When the Coulter stand-in confronts him later in the episode, he likens her to a spider. She pushes back; he dismisses her, saying all you do is make people madder 'n a hound dog with a head cold, so along the way they miss the message completely. <br> The upshot: While he acknowledges being on the same side of the ideological fence, ideology is one thing (and) hyperbole is another. <br> This interaction reflects Branch's sensibilities and signals Thompson's intentions: He's a man of principle, but he's unafraid to rebuke extreme partisan allies who distort Republican values. <br> And in general, like Branch, Thompson has heterodox tendencies. He voted for the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill and against convicting President Clinton of perjury during impeachment. <br> These tendencies dovetail with the numerous challenges he faces, one of which is securing those conservative voters who are more susceptible than other Republicans to Coulterian hyperbole. He has caught flak for his openness to abortion in certain circumstances early in his political career. Focus on the Family's James Dobson reportedly said, I don't think he's a Christian. <br> Still, much like his doppelgnger, Thompson appears to be a legitimate Southern conservative but by no means puritanical or closed-minded. This approach is authentic, but it's also skillful positioning for both the primary and general elections. <br> In one final, telling analogy, Branch ascended to his position and rescued the stature of the office in 2002 by ousting a powerful but controversial woman -- the ineffectual Nora Lewin (played by Dianne Wiest). Maybe Thompson's looking for a rematch? <br> Michael M. Rosen is an attorney in San Diego. 
The only thing the Scooter Libby and Bill Clinton perjury cases have in common is the charge. They were both accused of lying under oath. Perjury, of course, is a grievous crime. Republicans who try to minimize the seriousness of perjury now -- just like Democrats who tried to do so then -- are either partisan hacks or unforgivably blind to the legal chaos of an unenforceable oath. <br> If, in fact, Scooter Libby lied under oath, then he broke the law and needs to pay a price for it. But, as with all crimes, the punishment ought to be proportional to the transgression. As best as anyone can tell, given the Byzantine complexity and minute stakes of the case, Scooter Libby and Tim Russert have different recollections about a conversation they had about whether someone had told one of them that someone's wife had recommended him for a job before a whole other series of lies cropped up about the nature of that job. If it's even possible to obstruct justice in such a ridiculous scenario and Scooter Libby did so, then those who want to lock Libby up have a point in their favor. <br> They must, however, reckon with several facts that are nothing if not mitigating. First of all, it is now clear to all of us that there was no underlying crime -- that is, if Scooter Libby lied about what he did or did not remember saying in conversations with reporters, he was not lying to mislead anyone about any wrongdoing. That is, if he lied, he lied about what he had heard from someone else in another conversation, and whatever that might have been, it was perfectly legal. <br> President Clinton, on the other hand, lied about everything, which ultimately resulted in an admission of what amounted to perjury and obstruction of justice. For his crimes, he was disbarred by the Supreme Court and the State Bar of Arkansas. He paid $25,000 in fines and an $850,000 settlement in the Paula Jones case, and he admitted to the independent counsel that he had intentionally given misleading testimony and undermined the administration of justice. History will also note that he was the first elected president ever to be impeached. Indeed, President Clinton's criminality is practically the only part of his legacy that is clear-cut. <br> Another glaring difference is Libby's immediate decision to resign upon his indictment. This is what scandal-poisoned government officials are supposed to do, rather than drag the country through their own personal dramas. As president, Clinton couldn't be indicted, so he never needed a pardon. He was able to settle his case before leaving office exposed him to criminal prosecution. <br> Libby has no such leverage over the system, and even so, few serious-minded people in the country seem to think he shouldn't be pardoned. The jurors in the case, even the ones who dislike President Bush and wanted higher-ranking officials brought to justice, have gone on record supporting the pardon idea. Libby is a victim of an out-of-control prosecutor -- something I know a little bit about -- and a politically hostile judicial system. It is almost impossible for a high-ranking conservative to get a fair trial in Washington, D.C. The media was howling for Libby's head for months, while leaving unfettered every hair on the head of Richard Armitage, the State Department official who actually outed Valerie Plame. Luckily for Armitage, he was against the war, a get-out-of-jail-free card for anyone associated with this idiotic scandal. <br> In fact, comparing the Scooter Libby and Bill Clinton perjury cases is like comparing apples and oranges, except the oranges are all rotten and sleazy and hire private investigators to dig up dirt on the women who credibly accuse them of unwanted sexual advances, harassment and assault, as well as order government officials to lie to the American people and slander anyone who calls the oranges out on the lying. <br> Of course Scooter Libby should be pardoned. He did nothing to deserve the shabby treatment he has received by the media and the criminal justice system. His true crime was supporting President Bush and his leadership in the war on terror. Pardoning Scooter Libby is the right thing to do, no matter what your definition of is is. <br> Tom DeLay, a Republican, represented Houston from 1985 to 2006.

 I've recently begun speaking out in a vocal way on politics for the first time, because I believe that a significant righting of our two-party system is in order. A new entity called Unity08 is the best idea I've encountered. <br> It's a thoroughly modern process for doing a very old-fashioned thing: giving the people in our democracy a larger say in whom they get to vote for. <br> Unity08 plans to host a political convention over the Internet in spring 2008 in which any registered American voter can become a delegate, no matter their political party or where they live. Unity08 envisions it being national in scope, less expensive than traditional political conventions and more participatory. It will be a people's convention. Any registered voter can sign up, right now, at www.Unity08.com. <br> The delegates who participate, numbering in the millions, will debate and agree on the questions for which they want clear answers from presidential candidates. And with that audience of millions, the candidates will have an opportunity to be honest about exactly what they think, on the most important issues of the day. Rather than candidates fearing the consequences of candor, candor will give candidates a chance to show how they would lead. <br> I'm finding that Unity08 has a lot of appeal for a lot of different reasons. It appeals to people who are fed up with their lack of say, and those who are sick of partisan bickering. It appeals to voters who are tired of inaction on crucial issues, tired of seeing the way money affects the behavior of politicians and those outraged at the disproportionate influence of small factions of people. It appeals to people who seek a powerful tool to encourage -- and oblige -- the parties to stop the endless grudge match and get the country's necessary work done. <br> I'm no political insider. Even though my face appears on TV quite a bit, I'm not otherwise different from any other concerned citizen watching politics from the outside. I'm frustrated at the obsessive playing for petty advantage that takes the place of doing the nation's urgent business. <br> Every day I read stories in the newspaper that tell me something is very wrong with the way we nominate our presidential candidates, articles about candidates abandoning campaign finance reform measures so they can raise unlimited amounts of money, or about the candidates designing and redesigning their statements to suit the money people, the partisans and voters in primary states. <br> I'm left without any certain idea of what the candidates represent, what they stand for, what their priority issues are and what they may be counted on to do. I crave their honest opinions on the issues that I think are crucial to the future of the country and our planet. <br> But the experienced men and women who designed and run Unity08 aren't reacting to headlines only. They have taken a long and deep look at causes, and they have a great idea. Not everything about our presidential nominating process needs to change, but some things need to change a lot. Unity08's plan will change only what needs improving; it aims at a moderate revolution, or a revolution of moderates, like the one that founded this nation. It doesn't intend to upset the apple cart. It means to set it right again, and put it back on track. With enough delegates signing on, it looks to me as if it has a really good shot at doing it. I hope a lot of people will join us at www.unity08.com. <br> Actor Sam Waterston stars on NBC's Law Order and is a spokesman for Unity08. 
There is a harrowing calm that can happen just before a situation suddenly turns dangerous. The environment around you gets brighter, the air is soft and quiet and the world becomes crystal clear. There's a raw heat in the back of your throat like you swallowed a coal. As an actress in horror films and thrillers, I had played this moment many times. But I'd never experienced it for real until I went on an elephant rescue in Southeast Asia. <br> I felt that danger the first day I met world-renowned Asian elephant conservationist Lek Chailert. We'd taken a helicopter over the Cambodian jungle to survey the severity of the deforestation that was plaguing an elephant sanctuary there. We flew over acres of clear-cut land and through plumes of smoke from burning trees. The scene illuminated how rapidly wild spaces for elephants are disappearing. <br> The helicopter carrying us had just been cleared to land. Or so we thought. I was relieved to be on the ground, but within seconds we were surrounded by Cambodian military outfitted with camouflage fatigues, flip-flops, Rolex watches and AK-47s. <br> Lek is dedicated to making sure that people know. While on that first day, my fear of the men with AK-47s, coupled with nausea from the helicopter ride, caused me to throw up. But when I glanced over at Lek, she had her hands delicately folded atop a DSLR camera hanging around her neck. <br> This was not the first time Lek had been in this situation. Lek had positioned the barrel of her lens straight ahead to keep the soldiers, their guns, and every move they made in her sights. She was filming. Keeping her eyes on the action but with a serene smile she said, "Just keep filming. If they kill us, we will have proof." <br> We ended up having to pay the soldiers a thick wad of US dollars for our freedom to leave. <br> We were 20 hours into a 23-hour rescue when the journey soured. Noi Na, who had not been eating or drinking water, was hit with heatstroke. Her trunk, a dry, gray hose, was mashed up against a beam of the truck bed. Lek called out to the driver and the truck pulled over. She ordered all the mahouts off the truck. I asked her why. "If Noi Na faints, the truck could tip over." <br> Then that silence hit. <br> Lek's smile dropped, but she didn't flinch. She called her sanctuary, Elephant Nature Park, to update them on Noi Na's status and make sure they were prepared for Noi Na's arrival. She had her iPad open on her lap to locate gas stations so we could hose her down with water. I had never been in a situation where your survival depended on being as focused as possible. I could not panic in the tight quarters of that truck. I could not dive into the pending wave of guilt and responsibility that I put a crew in danger. All we could do was keep filming. <br> Lek has used media as the most lethal weapon to defend and protect her person, and to expose truths about the plight of the Asian elephants to whose care she has devoted her life since the age of 15. She always surrounds herself with a video team, has a camera around her neck, or, for the last several years, an iPad wrapped in weather, element and elephant-proof armor tucked under her arm. <br> When you "crush" an elephant, you take the baby away from its mother, restrain it in a wooden box and beat it for 24 hours straight. This process lasts a week. The goal is to break the bond between the baby and its mother and replace it with the fear of man. If the beating doesn't work the first time, it will be repeated until it does. <br> The crush box footage was my "Aha" moment, the one that prompted me to make "Love Bananas: An Elephant Story." The images and the sounds from the footage I saw changed my lens on the world. It affected me on such a profound level that I needed to do what I could to get this information out, which was making my documentary. <br> As Lek has taught me, the media can be a powerful weapon. I recently called her to share the news that Noi Na's journey and "Love Bananas: An Elephant Story" will be released in theaters across the United States. I asked her if she would consider coming to Los Angeles and New York to do press. Lek's response: "Let's go to battle." <br> Lek has said the key to saving the Asian elephant is education. Her Facebook and YouTube channel Elephant News is an epicenter of pictures and videos of joyful elephants being elephants juxtaposed with elephants in jeopardy, each post inspiring and informative. <br> When asked what people can do to help, Lek recently said in a QA, "The most powerful tool to saving the biggest giants on Earth can fit in the palm of your hand." <br> When people know better, they do better. Doing one thing counts, especially for a species that's in such peril. Imagine what would happen if we all did one thing for an elephant. They won't forget.
Over 150 years since the founding of the Ku Klux Klan -- a white supremacist group that unleashed terror against African Americans across the South -- language and images of lynching are re-emerging as tools of violence, intimidation and oppression. Society must identify and address this form of hateful rhetoric, or ignore it at our peril. <br> Lynching holds a particular significance in American history. For decades, lynching took the form of ritualized killings performed by white supremacists to uphold their racial purity and ensure their continued political and economic domination. The violence associated with lynching was part of a larger system of Jim Crow segregation that kept people of color subjugated, stripped them of their voting rights and precipitated the mass migration of millions of black people from the South. <br> And this brutality was for one reason and one reason alone: the color of the victims' skin. Though white supremacists would argue it was because black people has sassed them, taken their place at a restaurant counter or dared to assert their civil rights, the underlying reason was always racism. <br> Today, in echoes of the Jim Crow South, laws that target racial minorities and stifle a representative democracy are gaining momentum. Several white politicians are promoting voter ID laws, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and deportations, the war on drugs and other policies that largely penalize minority communities. They claim these measures are designed to "Make America Great Again," but really they are enacted to intimidate, scapegoat and suppress the rights of racial, ethnic and religious minorities. <br> Fortunately, there are efforts society can take to prevent the normalization of this kind of hate -- and the subsequent racial violence that accompanies it. To begin, we can teach the dark history of lynching in this country -- both in the classroom and at home. If young minds learn the truth, they can play a part in preventing history from repeating itself. <br> Finally, we must reject the mainstreaming of extremism by ensuring districts are truly representative of all of their constituents. Eliminating voter suppression and gerrymandering will create more diverse constituencies that elect moderate, sensitive and accountable leaders. <br> Stemming the tide of racial violence requires solutions that treat everyone with dignity, equality and respect. These three actions are a step in that direction.
The past 11 weeks of the Trump administration have looked anything but normal, except for one thing: the nomination of judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. That announcement was rolled out with the traditional pomp by a President who followed the script, and a silver-haired nominee who spoke well and looked the part (insofar as such parts have always been cast with silver-haired white men). <br> But that's all that's been normal about any of this. And when things are not normal, you cannot behave as though they are. <br> That is why Senate Democrats were right to filibuster the nomination and reject it -- by 44 votes, which meant that Gorsuch failed to meet the 60-vote threshold to win the nomination. <br> That threshold no longer exists. Senator Mitch McConnell, predictably, led a GOP vote to change it to a simple majority confirming their nominee to the court. <br> The whole thing seemed inevitable, and many wondered: why didn't Dems keep their powder dry until it was really needed? <br> Because this time, it was really needed. Because "not crazy" should not be the new definition for "normal." <br> This is a Supreme Court seat. Gorsuch will likely be on the Court for decades, and influencing bedrock law and policy for even longer. And even though every step of that process has been overshadowed -- Comey! Nunes! Syria! -- it still deserves to be examined, and remembered, for just how not-normal it all was. <br> Follow the Dark Money: Gorsuch may not have talked much, but money sure does. <br> Each of these aberrations deserved further consideration by the Senate (and, it should be said, the media). Are they as bananas-nutty as Devin Nunes leaping out of his car to run to the White House for a cloak-and-dagger intel exchange? Obviously not. But when Nunes is a faded historical footnote, Gorsuch will still be on the Supreme Court determining the law of the land. <br> Gorsuch's SCOTUS appointment is for life. Dems were right to think of all the other lives that appointment will affect. And fight for them. That's the only normal any of us should be willing to accept.
Beyoncé sure knows how to get our attention. <br> She's done it again and again with her culture-stopping music, videos and and performances. <br> Predictably, the Internet went bananas. Her post zoomed to most-liked-ever status inside a day. Twitter was beside itself with bee emojis and "YASSS QUEEEN" updates. The joy was palpable. <br> Joy -- and relief. Because, man did we ever need some good news. <br> That was the theme of her photo collection. Called "I Have Three Hearts," it was paired with a poem of the same name by the Somalian poet Warsan Shire, who also wrote the poetry in Lemonade -- and who, I guess, would not be allowed to enter the United States. <br> It reads: "There's life growing inside of me and I'm beside myself with dreams." In a real and visceral way, Beyoncé has reminded us that even in times that feel broken, we are vessels of power and glory and hope. <br> Flowers grow wherever. When the books are written about this period in time, I believe that will be an enduring theme -- the hope that sprang up out of the chaos, and the real and visceral good that it created. Beyoncé just named it. Creators gonna create. 
This election has provided excellent sport for a certain type of pompous Englishman in New York. <br> For good measure I would add that for British voters, the description "presidential" remained a put-down of a certain, gleaming-toothed style of politics. <br> I was inundated with sympathy. At least from those who had avoided me at dinner parties. <br> And then came the overcompensation from hot-take columnists. If they had missed the rise of one right-wing populist movement, then they sure as hell weren't going to be wrong twice. Perhaps Trump was no political long-shot, but could upset the polls and win, ran the logic. <br> It was a trend: the year of the political outsider. Propelled by the anger of a forgotten underclass and a desire to turn back the clock, could the US be about to follow the UK in reaching an equally unlikely result? <br> The most Brit-literate commentators even threw in the example of lowly Leicester City winning the kick-ball series as additional proof that history was no longer a guide to the future. <br> All of which is tempting to believe but proof of nothing. <br> Of course there are parallels -- polarised electorates, concern about immigration and growing disdain for experts -- but the US isn't Britain, which lost its manufacturing base long before cheap Chinese imports and gave up its role as the world's policeman a century ago. British exceptionalism isn't what it was. <br> And Donald Trump isn't Boris Johnson, with his establishment credentials, or even Nigel Farage, who, despite his basing of the well-monied political elite, has sat in the European Parliament since 1999. <br> "Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the US." <br> In contrast, Brexit has been a long-standing article of faith for politicians on both the Left and Right in British politics. The two big parties have been split on Europe ever since Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973. A club for capitalists or socialism by stealth, depending on your view. <br> Euroscepticism suffuses life in the UK. Every time we buy a pint of bitter in a pub or ask for a pound of bananas (straight or otherwise) in a greengrocer's, we are sticking one to those Europeans and their newfangled metric system. And we pay in sterling rather than euros. <br> Sure, Brexit may not have been predicted by the polls, but any cause that wins the backing of The Daily Telegraph, The Sun and The Daily Mail -- as well as my mum's university-educated, affluent neighbours in Kent -- was never a no-hoper. <br> In contrast, Trump's ugly brand of politics may have taken him further than anyone predicted. But to make the leap from Brexit to a Trump White House is to ignore an ocean of context between the US and UK.
But you know what? Currencies rise and fall. Stocks go up and down. This is not a self-inflicted London Blitz. It's not a repeat of the worldwide depression of the 1930s, when Britain's industrial production fell by 16.2 percent. Nor is it a crisis on par with April 10, 1970, when Paul McCartney announced his solo album, signaling the breakup of The Beatles. <br> Let's understand this moment for what it really is: an opportunity for the United Kingdom to become the 51st state of America. <br> The EU's loss is our gain. Call it the "Brentrance." <br> As King George once said (at least in Broadway's Hamilton), "Oceans rise, empires fall / We have seen each other through it all." Isn't it time we joined forces again? <br> There are four irresistible reasons why the UK should join in a permanent political and monetary union with the United States. <br> First, there's trade. Why was the UK an EU member in the first place? It wanted easy access to a huge trading bloc — the biggest in the world. However, U.S. GDP is only slightly below the EU's economic output. We're No. 2! In fact, by some estimates, California by itself is the world's eighth-largest economy. <br> Second, there's regulation. The Brits were sick and tired of being told how curvy bananas could be and whether eggs could be sold by the dozen. But by becoming the 51st state, the Brits would get no-fuss trading with all other U.S. states, without the pesky regulations. We're so lax about regulation, we let kids eat mac and cheese with Yellow Dye No. 5 and No. 6 — both banned in Europe! <br> Third, there's travel. Sure, as EU members, Brits have been able to get into the fast lane at European airports, making it practically effortless to see the Parthenon in Greece or the Colosseum in Rome. But do they know there's a full-scale replica of the Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee? And did they forget about the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which has been called "the greatest stadium in the world" by the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum website? <br> And speaking of travel, let me say this to the Brits: Do you have any idea how easy it will be at American airports when you have a U.S. passport? Do you have any idea how much faster the verbal abuse will go by when you're American? The last time I traveled and was mocked by airport security for not knowing how many ounces my travel-size mouthwash could be, I thought to myself, "This would surely take much longer if I weren't a U.S. citizen." <br> Fourth, there's the overwhelming embrace Americans would give the Brits. We love everything the Brits do, everything the Brits make, and everything the Brits say (or at least the way they say it). I have friends on all sides of the political spectrum, and there's one thing they all agree on: The UK is awesome. From Shakespeare to Sherlock, from the Royal Albert Hall to the royal family. And speaking of the "royals," Queen Elizabeth II and company could simply merge with America's royal family — the Kardashians. They have about the same power over the government, and they're just as much fun to photograph.
It isn't hard to see why. Not only do the menacing fans, who were in the French capital to watch their team play Paris Saint-Germain, gruffly prevent the man from boarding the Metro; they then start to chant: "We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it!" <br> To behave in a racist fashion is bad enough; to boast of being racist takes things to a whole other level of wrongness. <br> So it's not surprising that everyone from the French press to FIFA -- the Federation Internationale de Football Association -- has condemned the men's behavior, and that the video of the alarming episode is trending on Twitter, accompanied by outraged hashtags. <br> Yet while it is right to find the conduct of these fans nauseating, it is wrong to hold this incident up as Exhibit A in a show trial of British soccer more broadly. <br> Sadly, that is what is happening. Many observers are using this incident as hard evidence that British soccer remains an unreconstructed backwater, a sport stuck in a past, malign time, followed by prejudiced people. But actually, soccer isn't like that anymore. <br> These shrill responses to one ugly incident do a grave disservice to both soccer and the millions of good people -- men, women and children of all races -- who follow it. <br> The truth is that racism and violence at British soccer games, which were big problems in the past, have thankfully become rarer and rarer. <br> As the number of black players increased, so the disgusting behavior of some fans of the past has declined. <br> We should not condemn an entire sport and its millions of followers on the basis of what a tiny number of men did and said on a train in Paris. <br> In fact, to do so is to promote another kind of prejudice, a view of the largely white working-class fans of soccer as uncouth, stupid, unenlightened. One commentary piece used the word Neanderthal to describe fans. <br> That's the great irony of much of the outrage over the Chelsea fans' terrible behavior: In seeking to expose the alleged prejudices of the soccer family, many observers end up exposing their own.
Before we jump into a debate about the environmental costs of eating meat, here are three things you should know: <br> 1. I've experimented with vegetarianism twice, but it's never really stuck. Round one ended when I had a dream about a spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy's, and then woke up to march zombie-style to that fast-food restaurant to order it. Round two may or may not have ended with the brunch I had Sunday, I'm still not sure. <br> 2. I ate chicken chilaquiles for brunch on Sunday. It was delicious. <br> Therefore, 3. This is not an anti-meat polemic. <br> "(S)omeone who regularly eats factory-farmed animal products cannot call himself an environmentalist without divorcing that word from its meaning," he wrote in that book. <br> Since it's Earth Day, I thought that last point might merit some dissection. Is it possible to eat meat in modern-day America, consider yourself an environmentalist and sleep soundly without being a hypocrite? Or, as Foer argues, are those terms increasingly incongruous? <br> Animal rights aside, there are plenty to consider. Here are a few: <br> At a time when rivers in the American Southwest are running dry because of drought and climate change, it's worth considering the impact our eating habits have on water use. <br> It's fallen slightly since then, which is good news. <br> I travel frequently, and value flexibility, so I've never really wanted to be too strict about my diet in the long term. But one day? One week? One month? It's not that hard. <br> To the minority of vegans and vegetarians who like to proselytize about their eating habits, I'm sure that seems like an annoying cop-out. But there are plenty of environmentalists who advocate a middle-road approach to meat consumption. <br> "Certainly there are modest steps we can all take that can really have a significant benefit if a lot of people did them," said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at NRDC, the environmental group. "We often fall into this mistaken all-or-nothing mentality." <br> I like that approach. It's one more people are likely to stomach. <br> And it's one that -- even for a day -- can have real impact.
This is a country which says races don't exist: there is only the human race, to which we all belong. <br> This is a country which, unlike the U.S. and Britain, has purposefully limited freedom of speech in order to criminalize verbal violence and incitement to hatred in all its forms. <br> The 12-year-old girl who uttered those words in the town of Angers on October 25 had come with her parents to protest against the same-sex marriage law of which the minister has become a symbol. In the crowd of protesters were a dozen children shouting the word guenon; their parents looked pleased, proud even. <br> And we thought, naively, and rather condescendingly, that this sort of racist abuse could only be found in a country like Italy, ethnically less diverse than France. <br> We all remembered Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi repeatedly describing U.S. President Barack Obama as "really much tanned". <br> We thought such coarse xenophobia could not take place here. No, surely not in France! How wrong we were. <br> It actually took many of us by surprise. The fact that parents asked their children to hurl racist abuse at a government minister added to the sense of shock. <br> The same sex marriage legal battle which raged on last year seems to have reopened a box we thought long shut: France has witnessed the resurgence of a far-right alliance between traditionalist Catholics and ultra-conservatives who suddenly see themselves as the new revolutionaries. At night, they dream of insurrection. It has sometimes felt like being thrown back in time, to the 1930s. <br> "We cannot let this pass," he said. "This is not just Christiane Taubira who has been attacked for her color. It is the Republic, it is France and its values that are under attack." <br> According to Jelloun, France is no more racist than its neighbors but the real problem is that, today, racism finds an ideal breeding ground on social networks where anonymity unleashes unrestrained violence. <br> In a famous recent case, the French justice system, often harsher on verbal violence than many other countries, has tried to stop Twitter from serving as a platform for all kinds of xenophobic abuses presented as "jokes." <br> In October 2012, racist hashtags in French such as #IfMyDaughterComesHomeWithABlack or #AGoodJew unleashed the worse examples of unrestrained racism. <br> In France, racial insults in public are punishable by up to six months in jail and fines of up to €25,000; French justice was determined to sanction the xenophobic twitterati. <br> At first, Twitter told the French justice it could not reveal its users' identities and would only obey the laws of California where it was based. <br> French judges should now turn their attention to the French parents who teach their children to shout racist insults at a government minister born in French Guyana. Punitive sentences would be welcome. As would the end of anonymity on social networks.
When Wendell Pierce opened a new grocery store in a tough neighborhood in New Orleans, what he did not put on the outside -- bars on the windows -- was as important as what he did put inside -- fresh fruits and vegetables, affordably priced. <br> With his Sterling Express convenience store and Sterling Farms supermarket, Pierce, who portrayed Bunk Moreland on "The Wire" and Antoine Batiste on "Treme," is turning food desert neighborhoods into food oases. <br> Through his neighborhood inquiry, Project for Public Spaces founder Fred Kent crafted a definition of placemaking: "Turning a neighborhood, town or city from a place you can't wait to get through to one you never want to leave." <br> So it's magical to have fresh papaya, melons and bell peppers in Pierce's supermarket, but it's not enough. <br> Pierce's team set up a technology-driven security system that lets the supermarket operate efficiently, without bars on the windows. <br> He saw neighbors walking home, loaded down with grocery bags in the New Orleans heat, and imagined an amenity. Now Sterling Farms offers free rides home for customers spending $50 or more. The branded SUV is a rolling reminder that the store is sensitive to neighborhood needs. <br> In his Sterling Express convenience store, the fresh bananas by the register signal an interest in healthy customers. The restrooms, which Pierce wants to show off, are about making the neighborhood a better place. They are brightly lit and spotless. <br> Pierce's passion for placemaking shows up when he extends our supermarket tour to visit Columbia Parc at the Bayou, a mixed-income development that replaced the old St. Bernard housing project. <br> Columbia Parc is a good lesson for charitable foundations that often parse life into a list of simple check-boxes, one for education, one for transit, one for arts and so on. <br> Placemaking recognizes that all these things, and more, are tied. <br> With a community kitchen, Columbia Parc can offer cooking classes to families that get new access to fresh produce, thanks to Sterling Farms, which is also generating jobs. The fitness center makes regular physical activity the norm, not the exception, and the design invites residents to walk, not ride, to school. The community garden lets kids put their hands in the dirt, which reinforces the science being taught from preschool through high school. <br> Around the country, the allure of placemaking is evident. <br> Perhaps a key to placemaking is the ability to see the potential for beauty in situations where others see a tangle of bad. Or, as Project for Public Spaces encourages, "start with the petunias." <br> This is how an abandoned rail line, a nuisance and a danger, becomes a space famous for its sunset views. <br> Pierce's vision for placemaking is rooted in recollections of the places of his youth. He grew up in Pontchartrain Park. <br> "It's the memory of that Friday night grocery trip that I used to take with my mother," Pierce told NPR. "It was the town square, you know, men and women getting off of work and you would see them at our neighborhood grocery store. For, you know, a little 8-year-old boy that was, you know, the fishmonger in the butcher, these were, you know, common people in my life on the beginning of my weekend, and I felt as though that was something culturally that everybody should have in their neighborhood." <br> It's one thing to see a supermarket as a great place to get healthy food. <br> It's even better to imagine how the supermarket can help make a place great.
A week before Barack Obama became the first U.S. president to mention gay rights in his inauguration speech, the French had already made history on that matter. Believe it or not, on January 13, there were half a million people on the streets of Paris, demonstrating against gay marriage. <br> The French Catholic church is supposed to be at its last gasp, but it seemed strong enough to mobilize parishes, religious school parents and the common conservative citizen against a project of "mariage pour tous" (marriage for everybody), that had long been part of the new Socialist President François Hollande's election platform. Now that the law is being debated in parliament, it will likely pass within a month, but the ruckus will have stripped it of provisions deemed essential to the gay community: the equal rights, even if they are married, to start a family and raise their children. It may also trigger off a new culture war. <br> The Church would not have enjoyed that success alone, had it not found the most unexpected and efficient leader, in the person of Virginie Tellenne, alias "Frigide Barjot." The nom-de-scène of this enterprising entertainer, known for her long-time connection to the RPR, the party of Jacques Chirac, means "cookoo," and was a rallying cry for silly demonstrations, in the 80s, against cold weather in Paris, before she met God in 2004, and proclaimed herself "Jesus's PR person." <br> I saw her recently on a French TV channel while, in her trademark miniskirt and fishnets, she was debating a lesbian activist named Caroline Fourest, who asked Barjot how she felt about "gathering hundred of thousand of people in a demonstration against the equal rights of another community." She answered that she "loved gays," reminding the audience she often "partied like crazy" at Bananas, a well known hangout of the hip Parisian LGBT crowd. Translation: gay was okay as long as it stayed in the "cage aux folles," in drag, in an entertaining margin, but certainly not in the mundane realities of everyday life, where it is way more complicated. <br> Indeed. Frigide, just like a majority of the French, supported the civil union enacted in 1999, the so-called Pacs, designed mainly for same sex couples. It gives some rights, but doesn't legitimate partners as parents. Marriage would. And there is the rub: adoption, medically assisted procreation. "What about the bloodline? What about mother nature, and the right of kids raised that way to know their true origin?, shrieked Frigide, oblivious to the fact that children adopted or medically procreated with donated eggs by straight parents have the same problem. It all boiled down, at the minute of truth, to that question: "What about their right to be raised normally? she asked. By a mommy and a daddy?" <br> Having witnessed the debate on same-sex marriage in the United States, that episode confirms one more difference between our cultures. Contrary to the Americans who, in spite of blunt evidence, still worship the act of marriage, with its fairy-tale rituals of proposing and funny kneeling, the French have a much more pessimistic, more realistic even, vision of the knot. But when it comes to families and raising kids, they seem to believe in the enchanted world of yore. <br> In America, the same-sex unions were often seen as the sinful problem, as the Christian banners, "Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve" proclaimed around the country. But children were nobody else's business for those willing to adopt, or procreate with the methods available to anyone able to pay for donated eggs, sperm or a surrogate mother. <br> France is another story. In a country where unrealistic conditions slacken usual adoption, gay prospective parents have had to act as any straight single person would, ask for an adoption authorization, and, to improve the chances ... get the child in another country. The law debated these days may grant their partner equal parental rights for adoption. As for medically assisted procreation, it is another problem: As of today, it is simply forbidden unless the couple is heterosexual and married or able to prove they has lived together for at least two years. Surrogate mothers are prohibited in France, plain and simple. <br> Hollande himself, though he promotes gay marriage as a progressive symbol, admitted he doesn't personally favor allowing medically assisted reproduction to homosexuals, and with the assent of many socialist party officials, had these corresponding measures postponed -- for parliament to decide -- as another law to a future debate, in March, or never. <br> One reason, besides the obvious fear of a culture war with the conservatives about sacred family values, maybe the fact that the government already pays four attempts of medically assisted procreation to heterosexual couples and doesn't wish to have to extend this costly favor to gays, nor, more importantly, does it want to change at any price the national moral doctrine. <br> Assisted reproduction is considered in France only as a way to treat the medical condition of infertility. Being gay is not an illness, neither is, for a woman, the fact that she has no man. As a consequence, French babies are born en masse from single and not-so-single mothers in nearby Belgium or Spain, where specialized services are legally available for a price. "These children already exist in France," concluded Caroline Fourest on the show."They were born from gay parents and they simply deserve to have it recognized."
That is part of it, to be sure. But there are many reasons America's 50th state doesn't vote as much as the other 49, plenty of them specific to Hawaii. <br> And, as if I'm not asking enough already, let me know what you think of this list in the comments section at the bottom of the story. If you have other ideas, I may add them. <br> 1. Surfer apathy: I'll start with the obvious one. It's true that some people are so wrapped up in Hawaii's beaches and waves that they don't care about politics. One woman told me politics don't "flow" in oh-so-laid-back Hawaii. A state representative in Maui said he looks at swell reports before Election Day. If the waves are big, he said, he knows turnout will be low.

Yes, CNN staffers have lost their minds. One year of Donald Trump’s America and he’s defeated them as thoroughly the New England Patriots beat, well, just about anybody. <br> We’re a year into the most-biased U.S. media in history – tracking at 90 percent biased against President Trump. But there appears to be lasting damage to journalists, their professionalism and even their ability to pretend they are rational. <br> Celebrity clown and CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta had repeated run-ins with whoever the Trump administration put at the podium. In each case, they smacked him down and showed the lack of depth of his reporting. <br> Acosta wannabe and CNN Political Analyst Brian Karem didn’t do any better when talking to the president’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn. Karem wondered about how we’ve witnessed, “a litany of – of businesses that are going to give back to the American people, but doesn’t – isn't it unfair to give the president credit for that?” <br> Cohn smashed back, pointing out that business executives “feel better about the U.S. economy … and they feel like the lower tax rate allows them to share more of their potential earnings with their employees.” <br> Last, but never least, CNN embarrassment and Anchor Don Lemon found one more way to blame Trump – for the man who made death threats to CNN. Lemon claimed “there’s nothing random about this. Nothing.” <br> Lemon took umbrage at Trump’s use of “fake news” for CNN, somehow forgetting that four of Trump’s Fake News Awards deservedly went to the network. <br> “Some people might try to tell you that this is an apple. It might even start as a joke. But when they say it over and over and over again, and people start to believe it, it's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt,” the ad warned. Then the screen flashed to “Facts First.” <br> 2. What FBI Memo? What Missing Messages? Journalists love to highlight the 18-minute gap in one of President Richard Nixon’s tapes. Give them 30,000 missing emails or 50,000 missing texts and they are less thrilled. Perhaps because both of those involved are liberal. <br> CBS and NBC tried to spin the story away from the missing texts. But when ABC finally decided to chime in, it went full bore against the GOP. Anchor David Muir echoed Democratic talking points about the FBI text messages: “This is a political battle, and ultimately, the American people will decide whether those personal text messages were appropriate or not.” <br> Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter Michael A. Fuoco wrote up his side of the subsequent controversy for Columbia Journalism Review. One thing to note, he’s also president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh/CWA 38061. According to Fuoco, “negotiations with BCI’s union-busting law firm, King Ballow of Nashville, have become increasingly contentious.” BCI owns the paper. The guild also “filed an Unfair Labor Practice charge against the company” because it changed health-care benefits “in the midst of ongoing, albeit glacial, bargaining.” <br> Fuoco quoted the editorial saying: “Calling someone a racist is the new McCarthyism,” and used the opportunity to bash ownership. The same owners who hadn’t agreed to a new contract. “By any objective measure, the editorial was intellectually dishonest and racist, twisting itself in knots in a colossally failed attempt to defend the indefensible,” he wrote <br> Two quick notes. 1) The mayor is Democrat Bill Peduto. Shocker that his former journalist spokesman is anti-Trump. The last time a Republican ran Pittsburgh was 1934. 2) The guild is part of the Communications Workers of America, which is part of the AFL-CIO. The union endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. <br> 4. You Actually Thought Journalists Were Neutral? Part II: The New York Times actually devoted some opinion space to Trump supporters. Naturally, it caused a firestorm with its lefty readers and journalists who think those readers aren’t left-wing enough. <br> CJR’s attack: “The Times’s pro-Trump editorial page is patronizing and circular” at least admitted that the paper has no pro-Trump voices. “In fact, the Times employs many conservative commentators. It just seems to be a requirement that those commentators are never-Trumpers.” <br> 5. To Infinity and Beyond: OK, this was a ridiculous week for journalism. You could hardly move two steps without finding embarrassing proof of media bias or at least evidence of a crazy leftward tilt. <br> Self-described “photojournalist” Askia Muhammad revealed he had taken an embarrassing photo of then-candidate Barack Obama with notorious bigot and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. Muhammad said he “basically swore secrecy” to protect Obama’s career. Proving once more that neither journalists nor Obama told the truth about who he really was.
The Russian nuclear deal continues to be kept under containment by media fearful that it might contaminate their ability to attack President Trump. <br> In the latest development, The Hill reported that, an FBI informant was cleared to testify on the issue. “The Justice Department on Wednesday night released a former FBI informant from a confidentiality agreement, allowing him to testify before Congress about what he witnessed while undercover about the Russian nuclear industry’s efforts to win favorable decisions during the Obama administration,” the newspaper said. <br> “Face the Nation” moderator John Dickerson did end the network blackout of the story Sunday. His CBS report was the first of ABC, CBS and NBC to note the scandal that other outlets have tried hard to discredit. Those 69 seconds continue to be the only mention of the story. <br> That’s 4 minutes, 11 seconds – or nearly four times as much coverage – for the Loch Ness Monster compared to this scandal. And, even if you don’t like the story, it is notable because of all the other media coverage of Russia – 1,000 minutes on Trump-Russia collusion in 2017. <br> 2. Sex Harassment Claims Increase: Claims of sexual harassment and assault are sweeping through the media. Two major names joined the growing list of those accused – NBC and MSNBC Senior Political Analyst Mark Halperin and prominent liberal and long-time New Republic Literary Editor Leon Wieseltier. <br> The allegations are disturbing. “Three of the women who spoke to CNN described Halperin as, without consent, pressing an erection against their bodies while he was clothed. Halperin denies grabbing a woman's breasts and pressing his genitals against the three women,” according to CNN. <br> New Republic’s Wieseltier was set to head up a new magazine named Idea before sexual harassment allegations surfaced. According to Politico: “Wieseltier was also accused of ‘workplace harassment’ on an anonymous list (of men working in the media) circulating … that’s having reverberations in the industry.” <br> HuffPost also targeted Wieseltier in a story headlined: “‘I Was Blind And Complicit and Just, Like, Did Nothing’: New Republic Staffers Speak Out.” <br> Those are far from the only new incidents in media. Director James Toback has more than 200 accusations against him. Celebrity photographer Terry Richardson and tech blogger Robert Scoble were two of the lesser names to be accused. <br> Oddly, in this time of heightened awareness of harassment, TV host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted a picture of herself ogling the breasts of singer Katy Perry. DeGeneres, who came out as gay 20 years ago, commented above the photo, “Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!” She was much criticized on social media after the posting. <br> News outlets celebrated yet another Trump opponent and used the opportunity to talk about the left’s favorite issue – impeaching or removing Trump from office. “CBS This Morning” co-host Norah O’Donnell asked Flake on air about Trump: “If he is dangerous to democracy, as you say, should he be removed from office?” <br> Preston then went on to treat Flake’s attack on President Trump like Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. “This is the type of speech that, I think, tomorrow that should be shown, should be listened to by every high school civics class, politics class, history class and the reason being is we're at a moment in time right now where there's so much divisiveness in the country,” he urged. <br> 4. CNN, MSNBC and Media Fails: Into every life a little rain must fall. That applies to news outlets as well. Both CNN and MSNBC had thoroughly humorous incidents this week in their quest to lead the anti-Trump resistance. <br> Both Daily Caller and BuzzFeed mightily mocked the commercial with the Caller adding to the CNN “Facts First” tagline: “UNLESS WE ARE REPORTING ON TRUMP.” The Blaze’s Dana Loesch won the Twitter commentary wars by snarking: “But what if it’s an apple that identifies as a banana.” <br> 5. Hurray for Hollywood: It’s a tough battle in Tinseltown this week over which star can say the most idiotic thing. First, there’s sometime comedian Kathy Griffin, fresh from hacking a phony Trump head. Now she’s angry at those who abandoned her, including CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who she called “The Spineless Heiress.” <br> Long-time liberal singer/actor Harry Belafonte made the now-common Trump era comparisons to Nazi Germany, noting that “the country made a mistake and I think the next mistake might very well be the gas chamber and what happened to Jews (under) Hitler is not too far from our door.” <br> The CW’s “Supergirl” continues to show its superpower is propaganda. The latest episode depicted Americans as anti-Mexican and anti-gay. The CW’s other superhero show “Legends of Tomorrow” introduced a Muslim superhero from the future. The character was added in a post-election fit of PC pique.
Editor's note:The following column originally appeared in The Washington Times. <br> How do you know when the liberal media meltdown is approaching an apex? Just look for apples, bananas and a strong smell of smug. <br> What CNN reveals with this abject sanctimony is their contempt for the viewers themselves. “This is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that it’s a banana. They might scream banana, banana, banana, over and over and over again. They might put BANANA in all caps. You might even start to believe that this is a banana. But it’s not. This is an apple.” And then the words “Facts First” appear on screen. <br> They must be feeling very, um, special right around now as sole possessors of the truth, as a Harris Poll in May found that 65 percent of voters feel that fake news in the mainstream news media is a big problem. <br> From May 2017, The Hill reported, “Nearly two-thirds of Americans say the mainstream press is full of fake news, a sentiment that is held by a majority of voters across the ideological spectrum. According to data from the latest Harvard-Harris poll … 65 percent of voters believe there is a lot of fake news in the mainstream media. That number includes 80 percent of Republicans, 60 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats.” <br> Consider some recent headlines: Huffington Post: “CNN mistakes sex toy flag for ISIS Flag at London gay pride.” Daily Mail: “CNN anchor mistakes Star-Spangled Banner for French national anthem.” <br> ” ‘Like we don’t have any big giant proof,’ he said. ‘I think the president is probably right to say, like, “Look, you are witch-hunting me. You have no smoking gun. You have no real proof.” ‘ “ <br> The New York Times referred to CNN as having a “unique role as nemesis forMr. Trump.” Really? Also The New York Times: “3 CNN journalists resign after retracted story onTrumpally.” A story with three reporters and one anonymous source. When the target of the hit piece, Anthony Scaramucci, threatened to sue, only then did the network retract and apologize. <br> National Review: “CNN calls attacked Jerusalem synagogue a mosque; equates terrorists with victims.” <br> The Hill reported on CNN’s bizarre reaction about the hunt for the person who dared to make fun of the network: “He is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.” The story, titled “How CNN found the Reddit user behind the Trump wrestling GIF,” quotes from CNN.com: “CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.” <br> The Federalist reminds us of another CNN banana: “A banana is when you run conspiracy-mongering pieces that assert Republicans want to make rape and domestic violence pre-existing conditions in their Obamacare repeal bill when there is not a single word or action that backs up the allegation.”
Editor's note:The following column originally appeared inThe Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com. <br> “He’s just like he is on TV...He’s an a--hole, but he’s our a--hole.” <br> That’s how Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., recently described President Trump to a group of young Republicans, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. <br> The disparaging assessment of Trump’s character came days before the president gave his approval for ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). <br> Now Trump has those young people and their families in emotional turmoil. Their fears are climbing as Trump ramps up deportations and falsely demonizes immigrants as stealing jobs and hurting the economy. <br> Having set off so much fright, Trump then promised that none of the young people would be deported until March. He tweeted: “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!” <br> If he was sincere, Trump could have asked Congress to act while leaving the Obama rules in place. That would have avoided the current waves of desperation among 800,000 young people trying to do their best in school, on the job and in the military. <br> Talk about reducing people to political pawns. This must be the kind of behavior that Hunter had in mind with his insulting description of the president’s character. <br> However, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders added the president will only sign a new plan as part of comprehensive immigration reform. <br> As recently as July he dismissed the chances of Congress passing any immigration reform: “Our country and political forces are not ready yet,” he said. <br> The big problem is that a GOP effort at immigration reform failed in 2006 and a bipartisan effort failed in 2013. In both cases, conservative talk radio attacked reform as “amnesty” for lawbreakers. <br> Conservative columnist Ann Coulter, once one of Trump’s most enthusiastic supporters, lit into the president on Twitter. <br> While the right remains set against immigration reform, the president is hurting himself with mainstream voters. <br> According to the poll, support for allowing DACA kids to stay in the country is bipartisan: 84 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of Republicans want the young people here. <br> Writing in the Daily Beast, Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, similarly branded Trump’s DACA decision a “national disgrace” on the order of the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War and the refusal to admit Jewish refugees from the Holocaust. <br> I know how important that “noble idea” is to a child. I came to the U.S. as a four-year-old immigrant from Panama. <br> My sister graduated from Harvard; my brother has a law degree; and I’ve been able to write this column and best-selling books, and succeed in American media. <br> The DACA decision was announced before Trump accepted the first deal on the debt ceiling offered to him by Senate Democratic LeaderCharles Schumer(D-N.Y.) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
Editor's note:Founded by avant-garde visionary Robert Wilson in 1992, The Watermill Center is an interdisciplinary laboratory for the arts supporting young and emerging artists through its year-round Artist Residency Program, International Summer Program (which has gathered more than 80 artists from 30 countries this year), as well as Education Programs, and open rehearsals. The Center also presents exhibitions, public programing, and offers tours of its 20,000-square-foot building, eight-and-a-half acres of grounds and sculpture gardens throughout the year. The following essay is contributed by a 2017 Watermill Center resident. <br> The stillness of my body not having to rush anywhere. Silence of the regular world with sole loudness and noise coming from birds and bamboo leaves. All that mundane emptiness that creates fullness - that is how my Watermill residency started. <br> After breakfast we start our day with what's known as morning meeting, during which more than 75 people take five minutes of stillness. <br> This may be my favorite ritual in the daily routine. Bob knows it. Bob knows stillness, he knows silence. <br> I always believed that stillness is the most important thing to understand in order to excel in the performing arts, either as author or performer. <br> You have to know how to stop and stay that way for as long as it takes. And it’s you, the artist, the author and performer, who decides how long it takes. <br> And then, people from different continents arrive. Many people. More than 70. <br> They’re my people – artists – a whole new extended family for the coming weeks. Immediately a rush of ideas, creativity, poetry, visuals, music, sketches and rubber gums and some more sketches. Followed by fabrics, wires, materials, cardboards, color cans, plaster, glitter and some bananas. <br> That is how we, the residents at The Watermill Center, spend our days in this green oasis while the day of the Annual Summer Benefit gala approaches. <br> As I switched from two airplanes and two trains to get here, I never anticipated how intense and different it would be compared to my usual artistic experiences. <br> A team of Summer Program Participants were assembled to replicate the walls from this factory. They put up plaster that will be torn down during the performance, as easily and as exhaustingly as the communism went down, and as dusty, dirty and chokingly as capitalism and fake democracy came to our everyday lives. <br> Do I get out of it? Or do I crash down similar to the plaster under my continuous and willful hammering? <br> Two hours later.
No, America, that wasn’t an earthquake. That was a media scream that registered 11 on the Richter scale as Republican Donald Trump defied media demands and went on to win the presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to concede. <br> When it appeared that Hillary would not concede, after campaign chairman John Podesta appeared before her supporters in Manhattan and told everyone to go home and get some rest, even some in media criticized her. USA Today Washington correspondent Paul Singer was typical: “Stunned that @HillaryClinton did not concede. If @realDonaldTrump pulled that, people would go bananas.” <br> The night went from what CNN’s Wolf Blitzer called a “real nail-biter” to one his co-anchor Jake Tapper said is, going to put the polling industry out of business.” Left-wing Fusion referred to a “Terrifying/exciting state-by-state #ElectionNight.” The New York Times prediction tracker went from overwhelmingly predicting a Clinton win to 94 percent for Trump as the clock neared 11 p.m. Even when Hillary won Virginia, the Times was sending out downbeat emails saying she “preserved a slim path to victory.” <br> What media and pollsters had predicted would be an early night turned into a long contest. Around 8:40 p.m., liberals and media staff started to panic. Huffington Post Senior Political Reporter and Politics Managing Editor Amanda Terkel showed the tension. “Office debate right now: ‘Trump might win!’ ‘Trump ain't going to win.’” <br> The media pointed fingers at FBI head James Comey. Pundit Michael Smerconishblamed him for the vote. “Changing my @TIME 2016 person of yr prediction (who most influenced news) to James Comey #ElectionNight.” Atlantic Senior Editor Adam Serwer put it succinctly: “Congrats to the New York FBI office.” He went further later: “Congratulations to Vladimir Putin, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” <br> Daily Beast columnist Jonathan Alter blamed it on masculinity. “Trump didn't win because of Comey. He won because he's a testosterone candidate and men weren't ready for a woman president.” He continued to hammer out hyperbole: “America has never faced such a crisis before. World War II was 4 years but US always fairly sure we would win. This will be a new menace.” <br> The New York Times showed that media bias remained an issue into election night, writing that, “an intense public distrust in the media is threatening the networks’ traditional role as election night scorekeeper.” In a think piece discussion about coverage of the race, the Times controversial media columnist Jim Rutenberg said Trump, “received coverage of a billionaire reality-television star who turned politics into performance art.” <br> Election Day brought out the strange in the media, as well. CBS Evening News veteran Bob Schieffer wondered if the nation were “enduring some kind of curse.” He added in nice biblical metaphor: “What should we expect next – that it will rain frogs? I wouldn’t bet against it.” <br> Washington Post quasi-conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin bashed the GOP in her election day screed, urging Republicans to help Clinton succeed. “Do I think all this is likely? No, but then we are among the thousands of center-right Americans who think the solution to the sclerotic GOP may very well be a new political party.” <br> The foreign press chimed in, too. German newspapers warned of a “Trumpocalypse” and called the GOP candidate a “Horror-Clown.” The Daily Mail described the vote as, “Clinton, Trump fight for soul of divided US before vote.” <br> As the perfect conclusion to the night, Huffington Post decided to stop using the controversial tagline it had on Trump stories. “The Huffington Post’s editor's note calling Donald Trump as a ‘racist’ and ‘xenophobe’ is no more, a source in the newsroom tells POLITICO.” <br> Dan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture.

Many have knocked on Pam Jones’ front door in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. She’s pulled it open to find family, friends, fundraisers, strangers and salesmen. Like most of us, nothing surprises her anymore. <br> No, she wasshocked. <br> Then on June 24 while putting away her Costco stash, Pam noticed she’d bought damaged, split bananas. Even though she accepted responsibility for not checking more closely, she was still irritated at the inconvenience. She hated to complain to her favorite store, but it was time for a phone call. <br> “He was the kindest manager I’ve ever spoken to,” Pam said of the man she’d not previously met. After sharing her story, Shake didn’t just apologize profusely, he refunded her for both purchases. <br> Surprising? Not really — isn’t this what any good manager would do? <br> Then, the doorbell rang. <br> After working a very long day, Shake had truly gone the extra mile on his way home to Berryville, Virginia to demonstrate that his apology wasn’t just about a hurried words on the phone. He didn’t just want to say Costco was sorry, he wanted to show it. <br> “What a breath of fresh air! It was so refreshing that someone would care enough to stop by our home to make something right. It was so highly unexpected and greatly appreciated.” <br> That’s not really surprising either, is it? We live in a contentious world saturated bad news and bad reviews. Everyone knows that social media can spread global fires from the tiniest of digital sparks. <br> As it should be, this remarkable Costco manager has no idea he’s being highlighted in this column. When I reached out to him to confirm the experience and inform him Jones had shared it on social media, he said humbly, “Wasn’t that nice of her?” Then he changed the subject. <br> Next time your doorbell rings and you’re in your PJs, check your bananas. You just never know who’s on the other side of the door.
My wife, Alissa, and I moved to Rwanda nearly a decade ago for what was to be a two-year stint. But we fell in love with the land, its people, and its progress, and we have stayed, now raising our three children here. Out of the ashes of genocide, the country has progressed tremendously––it offers one of the world’s fastest growing economies and least corrupt governments, and it has afforded me opportunity to work on one of sub-Saharan Africa’s best public health systems. <br> For the young American expat community in Rwanda, mostly recent college grads coming to do a stint of public health work, the hardest time is, of course, the holidays, as not everyone is able to fly home to America every year. This put quite a burden on our new little Heaven. It was clear from the beginning that holidays would be at Heaven: our outdoor terrace floats above the city, surrounded by lush trees and the sparkling lights of Kigali. <br> Turkey, our favorite holiday food, is not a traditional staple of the Rwandan diet. Thus for years U.S. embassy employees, who have always numbered among the expats around our bar and kitchen, used to import honest-to-God Butterball turkeys before we started serving it at Heaven around the holidays. <br> Under Heaven’s white-lighted trees, Americans, Europeans, and Rwandans enjoy Thanksgiving and Christmas. Even Hanukah gets a place, and my kids have improvised a Coke bottle menorah for just that purpose. For food, in addition to mashed potatoes, we serve matoke puree––mashed up green bananas with plenty of butter. And for drinks, we pour urwagwa, a local banana beer, in addition to the local regular beers and the American spirits in their proud bottles that are always a friendly sight, so far from home. The American ambassador and his wife always show up to offer thanks for our little community, which truly is dedicated to making a difference. <br> Over the holiday season, we can’t help but be moved to raise a glass to Rwanda’s remarkable progress and to all of the people from our own great country who have come to share their passions for enterprise, health, education, and stuffing that tastes like home.
I recently returned from a medical mission to Guatemala organized by the John Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah. <br> I met the Hernandez brothers when they were kids. They were led into the examining room by their foster mother. Though they were blind, both boys still worked together to bring water from the river for their family in a small village in Guatemala. <br> I met them because of the humanitarian work of Bill and Judy Schwank. Bill was born in Guatemala and came to the U.S. to practice neurosurgery. His wife, Judy, is an attorney and longtime advocate for adoption. <br> On examination, I found that they had mature cataracts. Juan could see hand motion and Andres light perception only. I explained that the vision center in the brain must be stimulated before age of 7 or vision isn't possible-- even if the cataracts are removed. Our hope was that the cataracts were not mature at birth and that the boys had some vision at an early age. <br> I remember them well because the boys had never before seen running water and they somehow stopped the drain and left the water running-- a mini-disaster for the foster family. <br> The boys would be able to perform basic daily tasks and would be of use in the fields. <br> Periodically, Judy Schwank would give me updates on their new life with vision. <br> Fifteen years later, in 2014, I was on my way to Guatemala and the Schwanks had arranged for me to see the Hernandez brothers and Juli. <br> The Academy of Cataract and Refractive surgeons also helped to organize the trip and brought along a renowned surgeon from San Francisco -- David Chang, M.D. <br> Reuniting with the Hernandez brothers and Julie was a special experience for me. The Hernandez boys' vision was about the same. Though they desperately hoped for some new miracle, the vision center in their brain had not developed and nothing could be done to further improve their vision. <br> Operating with some of the most talented surgeons in the U.S. was an incredible experience. Not only was I able to reinforce my skills, but I also learned new techniques from the masters. <br> But nothing compares to emotions of post-op day one when we unveiled the patches. Huge smiles, tears, and praise to God were heard each morning. <br> While the medical team operated, my son Duncan joined another group to install a water purification system for a local school. Duncan said he wasn't sure the kids understood the significance of the water project, but they certainly liked the soccer balls he gave them. <br> It was very moving to witness a husband and wife see each other clearly for the first time in years. <br> I responded, de nada but it wasn't just nothing --the smiles on the faces of previously blind patients is priceless and a reward in and of itself that I will never forget.
Editor's note: The following op-ed is based on a monologue delivered on the July 30, 2013 edition of Fox News Channel's The Five and an op-ed that appeared previously in Fox News Opinion. <br> Two of the worst: civil rights activist and MSNBC host Al Sharpton and Georgetown University Professor Michael Eric Dyson. Their goal: demonize white people, especially conservatives like Bill O'Reilly, so they don't have to deal with the real problems that continue to plague the black community. Making an older, conservative white guy like O'Reilly a boogie man is easy for these hustlers. <br> But do they ever confront the real problems and threats in the minority community? No. High murder rates? How about that? What about high dropout rates? What about the breakdown of the family? <br> “Why is it that when we say we want to have a conversation on race, you want a conversation on blackness? You don't want to have a conversation on race. You don't want to have a conversation on white privilege, unconscious bias. You don't want to talk about the collective world we made as black, brown, red, yellow and white people. You want to lecture black people. <br> Can you believe that? This is unbelievable on so many levels. But let me just start by saying this: Dyson is making the charge basically that O'Reilly is portraying black people as animals. And, of course, this never happened. This is not true. <br> Well, who does that help? Let's think about that for a second. If this is a real conversation about helping people, if you truly love people, and want to help those in need, how does it help to go after conservatives, O'Reilly, white people, rich people? Let's go to the people who need help and give them help. <br> What about the carnage on black streets with kids shooting each other? No. <br> So what we're doing here is a huge distraction. Yes, there's legitimate rage in the black community over the Zimmerman verdict, but the idea that we have to use the power that exists in this country to help people who are in need in the black community, that is an ongoing and longer story and you can't pull away from that by making Bill O'Reilly into your target and somehow beating him up. That's craziness. <br> Here’s the message I would like to see expressed in America today. I think it would be especially powerful if it could come from the black man with the highest level of credibility in black America since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. – President Obama. <br> 2. Take a job and hold it, no matter what job, no matter if your friends put you down for ‘flipping burgers.’ Use the job to get experience, make contacts with business people, and build a resume. <br> And the final step is important for you and for the future of your family and your community: <br> Imagine if President Obama repeated that message over and over, ignoring the phonies who want to focus only on “systemic” racism as the reason for high rates of poverty, involvement with crime, and incarceration among black men. <br> Imagine if he decided to deliver that message and by-passed the so-called ‘racial experts’ and academics who prefer to look at America’s troubled racial history – slavery and legal segregation. <br> Mr. President it is your move.
Imagine if Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King had referenced some particular body part when criticizing young African, Italian, Irish or Israeli immigrants, suggesting that something about the kids reminded him of a food group; say watermelons or bananas, potatoes or pasta. As your mind races, it will come up with invariably ugly possibilities; which makes the point of how obscene and racist Rep. King’s statement was when he used cantaloupes to make a vicious argument against President Obama’s leniency toward undocumented Latino youngsters. <br> Let us not forget that Mr. King led the Speaker and virtually the entire Republican caucus by the nose two months ago, convincing them to void legislatively President Obamas Executive Order to the Department of Homeland Security to delay deportations. <br> His inference that 99 percent of young immigrants are drug mules was chastised as “ignorant” and “wrong” even by his boss House Speaker John Boehner. But King is unrepentant, backing off only slightly on Thursday when he told ABC News, “We have young people that are being recruited from age 11 on up to increasingly smuggle drugs into the United States,” King said without citing his source. “We seem to want to be ignorant of that because there’s such a desire to pass a DREAM Act, which would include some valedictorians. We’re all sympathetic to those valedictorians, but it isn’t all going to be valedictorians.” <br> Cantaloupe King’s amendment to throw them all out of the country passed the House 224-201, with only six Republicans opposed. Speaker Boehner was not one of the six heroes. In backing King, the GOP leadership argued that they weren’t voting against the kids, they were voting against the arrogant president who did an end run around the legislative process in deferring the deportations. They may be right about President Obama’s motives. Maybe he did it just to get the Latino vote last November. But if you’re a kid being deported the politics are irrelevant. One party wants you thrown out, the other wants you to stay in the only country you have ever known. <br> The activists from groups like United We Dream and the United Farm Workers attached a message to every piece of fruit. It read, “This cantaloupe was picked by immigrants in California. You gave Steve King a vote. Give us a vote for citizenship.” As far as I know, Rep. King was not in his office to receive his fruit basket. But after another sit-in type demonstration in his office last week, he tweeted how “20 brazen self-professed illegal aliens have just invaded my DC office.” And about how, “Obama’s lawless order (to defer deportation for law-abiding youngsters brought here as children) gives them de facto immunity from U.S. law,” which of course is also untrue.
During the recently concluded U.S. presidential campaign, many Latin American journalists and academics asked why Latin America was hardly mentioned. Although Gov. Romney did mention the region in each of the three debates, the question deserves a more complete answer. This region is far too important to the U.S. to be ignored so widely by U.S. political leaders. Why is it? <br> Fearful voters do not always make the best choices. Sometimes they need a little help from friends that live in countries with a free press. <br> Seldom do serious, wise, or even honest faces symbolize the rich continent to our South. Is it any wonder then, that senior policy-makers in the U.S. Government have difficulty focusing on this region? It is especially hard when those policy-makers have access to information that documents the abuse of power, moral degradation and illicit enrichment in which many foreign “leaders” engage. <br> Besides being dishonest and dangerous (for example, all the above preside over rampantly corrupt governments and some have close ties with Iran, regional terrorist groups or organized crime) these rulers have something else in common: they were all originally elected in votes that were relatively free and fair. We must ask how is it possible that otherwise intelligent constituencies choose so poorly? One reason is that they lack in balanced information about their candidates and leaders. In Latin America the press is frequently afraid of reporting negative material about powerful people running for office (for good reason, since scores of honest reporters have been and continue to be killed while investigating wrongdoing). <br> Mr. Rosenthal is the scion of what is alleged to be the richest family in Honduras. The family conglomerate, Grupo Continental, owns some of the leading companies in Honduras: banks, insurance, engineering and construction, newspapers, television, cable TV, cement alligator skins, coffee growing, free zone assembly plants, food packing, sugar, residential developments, bananas, cattle and sheep breeding and cacao, among others. <br> Since 2007, the Rosenthal telecommunications firm Cable Color has been accused by Honduran and international authorities of illegal use of its telephone lines for “grey traffic.” Grey traffic is the false reporting of international long distance calls as domestic calls, thus avoiding additional charges associated with international calls, such as payment for the use of underwater cables, of international taxes paid to the foreign governments where the calls originate or terminate, etc. In Honduras, international traffic is controlled by the public telephone company, Hondutel, which is – or would be if were operated honestly and efficiently – the single largest source of revenue to the state. <br> Even in a country with a long history of high-level corruption, Chimirri and Zelaya’s avarice was unprecedented. In order to hide the plundering of Hondutel through the use of grey traffic by companies owned by their allies such as the Rosenthals, Chimirri and Zelaya designed a cynical smoke screen reminiscent of the famous order “round up the usual suspects” in the movie Casablanca. <br> That company still owes Hondutel the local currency equivalent of $259,044 for the use of submarine telephone cables. This figure is a pittance, however, in relation to the $5 Million per month – half its earnings - that Hondutel’s income dropped under Chimirri’s “management” because of the grey traffic scheme. <br> A pending lawsuit accuses members of the Board of Banco Continental and members of the board of the Rosenthal newspaper Tiempo (Editorial Honduras) of the crime of “infidencia,” or using the newspaper to publish confidential information to the detriment of official investigations of the National Banking and Insurance Commission. Moreover, the newspaper’s labor union has complained that the Rosenthals refuse to pay their “labor obligations” (equivalent to employees benefits in the U.S.). <br> The reason I am writing this article is because I was asked to do so by some honest persons I know in Honduras. When I inquired why they did not do so themselves, they frankly admitted that they are afraid. They point to cases such as a murder in 2007 of a telephone company owner, Alejandro Laprade, that threatened to blow the whistle on the Hondutel grey traffic scheme, from which the Rosenthal family prospered, but which in turn focused the attention of the country on out-of-control Zelaya corruption and led to his downfall. <br> Otto Reich is a former U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs and Senior Staff member of the National Security Council.

Editor's note: The following article is adapted from the summer 2011 issue of City Journal. <br> Abbassi and Kilkenny also check out sites that the public doesn’t visit—the army base at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn; the alleys, warehouses, and storage areas near LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy Airports; a power plant in Queens; the giant ventilator shafts that aerate the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels; and the entrance in Queens to the Buckeye Pipeline—which carries millions of gallons of jet fuel to JFK and which was the target of a foiled Islamist terrorist attack in 2007. From time to time, Kilkenny monitors his radiation detectors, technology so sensitive that it sometimes mistakes crates of potassium-rich bananas for nuclear material. It takes just 25 minutes for the chopper to circumnavigate the five boroughs of New York and the more than 100 “critical locations” that the 62-person aviation unit patrols day and night. <br> The fleet’s size, activity, and capabilities make it a good symbol of the NYPD’s relentless focus on counterterrorism since the attacks of September 11, 2001. No other city in America has a comparable fleet; then again, no other city faces comparable danger. Since 2001, at least 11 serious plots against New York have failed or been thwarted, police say. Preventing another terrorist catastrophe is Kelly’s paramount mission. A decade after 9/11, the NYPD has adapted to the challenge and become not just the nation’s most highly regarded police department but the nation’s most effective counterterrorism force. <br> A recent demonstration of the NYPD’s ongoing engagement with terrorism came on May 1, after Navy SEALs killed Usama bin Laden in Pakistan. The audacious raid, Kelly told his top aides, was “good news—with complications.” Those complications included the possibility that some of bin Laden’s followers would seek to avenge his death by attacking the global jihad’s top target: New York. By the time President Obama made the late-night announcement that bin Laden was dead, a message instructing police officers to prepare for trouble had already gone out to all commands, and precincts were heightening security around station houses and the city’s iconic sites. A midnight tour of cops working transit hubs was held over, almost doubling the number of officers deployed in subways and around the city’s train and ferry stations. The next morning, New Yorkers on their way to work found extra police, bomb-sniffing dogs, and bag-check posts in subway and train stations; a similar increase was ordered for the evening rush hour. <br> Ray Kelly begins each working day with a briefing on terrorist trends from two top aides: David Cohen, his chief of intelligence and a former chief of the CIA’s operations division; and Richard Daddario, his deputy for counterterrorism. Since early June, the sessions have taken place in Kelly’s sleek new Executive Command Center on the 11th floor of One Police Plaza, the department’s dilapidated 1970s-era headquarters overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. From 9 to 10 am, the three men sit at the center’s long oval table and pore over reports of terrorism incidents at home and abroad; ongoing investigations; splits and internal ideological shifts in militant jihadist groups; and developments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. As they talk, television broadcasts fill the giant wall-to-wall screens that surround them—Al Jazeera in English and Arabic; New YorkOne, which monitors developments in the city; breaking news from Fox, MSNBC, and CNN; and alerts from the all-important Weather Channel. The screens can also display live video feeds from some 200 subway cameras and from the NYPD’s helicopters. The windowless room, which can seat up to 40, is “secure”: with its own independent air and electrical supply, officials can seal it off in an emergency. <br> One morning in June, the official says, the trio discussed the commissioner’s plans for the NYPD’s World Trade Center Command, a temporary post of 200 to 240 cops and support staff assigned to protect the new memorial at Ground Zero, which is scheduled to open on the tenth anniversary of 9/11. Eventually, says Kelly, as many as 700 officers may be assigned to secure the 16-acre World Trade Center site, which, as currently configured, will house the 9/11 memorial, five towers, an arts center, and a transit hub that the NYPD will police in cooperation with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns much of the land. Terrorists have already attacked the World Trade Center twice, of course, and in 2006, the police disrupted a plot to bomb a train tunnel and a retaining wall at Ground Zero. Browne calls the site the “Number One target in the city that remains the nation’s top target.” <br> Last September, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the NYPD and the Metropolitan Transit Authority were extending the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative into midtown Manhattan. Ultimately, some 1,500 more cameras, license-plate readers, and environmental monitors will be integrated into the system. The cameras are now installed in some of the city’s busiest transport hubs—Grand Central Terminal, Penn Station, and the subway station at Times Square. Washington will pick up virtually all of the security initiative’s $200 million tab. <br> Browne says that the surveillance system has strict privacy safeguards. The pictures and data collected won’t be stored for longer than 30 days unless they’re part of an ongoing investigation, he notes. Further, he says, several agencies and individuals have the authority to investigate potential wrongdoing in the camera project and in the NYPD’s other counterterrorism programs: five district attorneys, two U.S. attorneys, and an independent Civilian Complaint Review Board, not to mention the city council’s oversight committees on finance and public safety. <br> However, two recently published reports have raised questions about whether the NYPD’s surveillance of Muslim individuals and groups violates federal civil liberties and privacy laws. Last month, the Associated Press reported that the NYPD had targeted ethnic communities “in ways that would run afoul of civil liberties rules if practiced by the federal government.” It also questioned the department’s relationship with the CIA, alleging that the NYPD’s intelligence division’s employment of CIA officials, as well as its undercover activities, had “blurred the line between foreign and domestic spying.” The NYPD strongly denied the reports, saying that no spying had occurred without a criminal lead. <br> While much of the press coverage of the NYPD has focused on the department’s cutting-edge technology—Kelly is a self-confessed “gadget guy”—he and other senior officials insist that the department’s true strength in fighting terrorism is its people. “The continuity of leadership is key,” says Cohen. “I’m in my tenth year in this job,” he says; so are at least half of the counterterrorism division’s employees. “There is no supervisor who doesn’t understand the mission; they are expert at what they do.” <br> The terrorism threat has evolved sharply since early 2002, when Kelly first sketched out his plan for countering it on a piece of paper for Mayor Bloomberg. Al-Qaida’s “core,” as counterterrorism experts call the organization that bin Laden headed, does remain a threat. U.S. intelligence officials guess that more than two-thirds of its leadership cadre have been killed or jailed during the past decade, but underestimating the organization could still be disastrous. Last May, Steve Kappes, a former deputy CIA director, told an NYPD gathering of public and private security professionals that al-Qaida was the “most adaptive terrorist entity” he had encountered in his 30-year intelligence career. Even without bin Laden, he said, its threat might not be “significantly diminished” for years to come. <br> Among the most ominous recent trends is the surge in “homegrown” terrorism, which was initially identified in 2007 by NYPD analysts Arvin Bhatt and Mitchell Silber. That threat came home dramatically to the NYPD in 2004, when it arrested two immigrants, Shahawar Matin Siraj and James Elshafay, for planning to bomb the Herald Square subway station during the 2004 Republican National Convention. Elshafay cooperated with prosecutors and got a plea deal; Siraj was convicted on four counts of conspiracy and received a 30-year prison sentence. The fact that Siraj had emigrated as a child from Pakistan, had grown up in the United States, but still wanted to kill Americans made a strong impression on the police department, Cohen recalls: “It was the first homegrown case against a U.S. target that resonated so deeply.” Homegrown terrorism captured headlines again in May 2010, when Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized Pakistani-American and middle-class Connecticut resident, tried to blow up his SUV in Times Square. Only luck and his insufficient training kept Shahzad from carrying out his martyrdom mission, the police concede. <br> What keeps Kelly and his team awake at night? Not the historical rivalries and resentments between the FBI and the NYPD, they say. Kelly maintains that the two organizations now work together well. The police department once had only 12 detectives on the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces; today, it has 120. “The major source of information for us is the JTTF,” Kelly says. Cohen agrees: “Cooperation today between the police and the JTTF is standard operating procedure.” Of course, the department still gets annoyed when the FBI decides not to pursue an investigation developed by the NYPD or asserts jurisdiction over one that the NYPD wants to lead. <br> And, of course, Kelly worries about an attack using nuclear weapons or other WMDs. Daddario, the counterterrorism division chief, has thought long and hard about how New Yorkers would evacuate the city in the event of a widespread biological or nuclear attack. The NYPD has drawn up evacuation plans, but they’re of limited value, he says; in such an emergency, the police department would have to rely on “self-evacuation”—individual decisions by hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers to leave the city, even on foot and across bridges. Daddario also admits that the state-of-the-art air sniffers that are supposed to detect anomalous airborne pathogens need improvement. “The technology is not there yet,” he says. <br> Perhaps the greatest challenge to the NYPD’s efforts, however, is the way we think about terrorism. “Americans like to see conflicts as finite, with a beginning and an end,” says Jenkins. “But that will not be the case in the struggle against terrorism. This challenge adapts and morphs and is constantly evolving. It won’t end. It’s hard for any individual or government agency to accept that.” Even in New York.
Tue, 05 May 2009 21:15:21 +0000 By Kathleen Troia K.T. McFarlandNational Security Expert/Former Pentagon Official <br> Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore. Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz <br> Once we got through emigration to the airport reception area, we were met by a private security services driver we had hired to drive us to Bagram Airbase, an hour and a half drive from Kabul. It was a ten-minute walk through the open air parking lot, which held few cars but dozens of idle mostly bearded young men -- all of whom started at us intently, without saying a word and distinctly unfriendly. There were probably two hundred people in that parking lot and I was the only one without a Y chromosome. Had I not been accompanied by a 6'2 highly decorated former Marine, who looked like a NY Giants linebacker, I would be been really spooked. <br> Suddenly the driver veered to avoid a small, light-blue bundle of rags in the middle of the busiest intersection in town. we looked closer and realized it was actually a small women, kneeling underneath a full body, head-to-toe burka, with a gauze grill where the opening for the eyes, nose and mouth should have been. When I looked at our driver with horror, he just shrugged. I later found out she was most likely a beggar, who would either be tossed a few coins or be run over -- and no one seemed to care much either way. <br> It was like that moment with Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, the Tin Ma and the Cowardly Lion arrived at the gates of Oz, and the movie goes from black and white to color.
Martin Chulov is theBaghdad correspondentfor theGuardianof London. This report appears in the winter 2009/10 issue of World Policy Journal and originally appeared on TomDispatch. BAGHDAD -- From his mud brick home on the edge of the Garden of Eden, Awda Khasaf has twice seen his country's lifeblood seep away. The waters that once spread from his doorstep across a 20% slab of Iraq known as the Marshlands first disappeared in 1991, when Saddam Hussein diverted them east to punish the rebellious Marsh Arabs. The wetlands have been crucial to Iraq since the earliest days of civilization -- sustaining the lives of up to half a million people who live in and around the area, while providing water for almost two million more. <br> The waters vanished after the First Gulf War due to a dictator's wrath; over the next 16 years, they ebbed and flowed, but slowly started to return to their pre-Saddam levels. By 2007, with no more sabotage and average rains, almost 70% of the lost water had been recovered. Now it's gone again. This time because of a crisis far more endemic: a devastating drought and the water policies of neighboring Turkey, Iran, and Syria. These three nations have effectively stopped most of the headwaters of the three rivers -- the Tigris, Euphrates, and Karoon -- that feed these marshes. <br> "Once in a generation was bad enough," says Awda, a tribal head and local sheikh in the al-Akeryah Marshlands, who also advises the Nasiriyah governorate on water issues. "Twice could well be God's vengeance." <br> In a land where fundamental interpretations of monotheistic scripts often determine the tone of public discourse, particular attention is now being paid to the biblical Book of Revelation, in which the Euphrates River drying up was prophesized as a harbinger for the end of the world. It is not doomsday yet in Iraq, but the water shortage here has not been worse for at least the last two centuries -- and possibly for several millennia more. Government estimates suggest close to two million Iraqis face severe drinking water shortages and extremely limited hydropower-generated electricity in a part of the country where most households get by on no more than eight hours of supplied power per day, in the best of times. <br> The flow of the Euphrates that reaches Iraq is down, according to scientific estimates, by 50% to 70% and falling further by the week. From his frugal office in Baghdad's National Center for Water Management, engineer Zuhair Hassan Ahmed has for the past decade plotted the water levels of the Euphrates and the Tigris, the latter of which bisects the Iraqi capital. <br> The hand-etched ink graphs show a black line that marks an average "water year," from October to May, superimposed over a green line, which shows the actual flow through the two rivers over the same time. The green line had been markedly lower than the benchmark for much of the past decade. But in 2007 -- the start of a serious drought -- it dipped sharply and has continued to fall. <br> In Baghdad, the lack of water has been an inconvenience, an eyesore, and a health hazard. Raw sewage and refuse pumped into the Tigris is not flushed downstream as rapidly as it once was. The Tigris is Baghdad's main artery, but it is also still a working river, long traversed by small commuter ferries, industrial barges, and, in the city's halcyon days, even pleasure boats. Giant mud islands now protrude from the once wide, blue expanse of the river, making it unnavigable for larger vessels. Further downstream, and especially along the Euphrates -- which runs roughly on a parallel track west though Iraq's bread basket -- the effects of the shortage are far worse. <br> Between Two Rivers <br> Here, in the land between the two rivers that was once the heartland of ancient Mesopotamia, the water crisis has ravaged agriculture, an industry still struggling to regain its footing after three decades of deprivation and war. This was the second mooted site (the other was the Marshlands themselves) of the fabled Garden of Eden -- a land so rich in soil and water that it would quench the needs of its dwellers throughout eternity. It doesn't look quite like that now. Crops of grain, barley, mint, and dates have failed almost en masse. Further west, in Anbar province, a prized rice variety that was once sold at a premium throughout Iraq and in the markets of neighboring countries has just been harvested. Like almost all other crops, this year's yield is a disaster. <br> "We blame the Turks for this," says Hatem al-Ansari, a local Anbar rice grower who claims to have lost half his family's life savings since January 2009 due to a lack of water to irrigate his rice. "We have been digging wells nearby, and so has the government, but it is not enough. Not even close." Shielding his face with a black scarf from a sandstorm blowing in on an acetylene desert wind, Hatem points in the direction of the Euphrates' upper reaches. "If you go down to the bank, you will see where the water was last year and last week," he says. "Our water pumps can no longer reach it. It's true it hasn't been raining, but it's just as true that even 30% of normal rainfall does not cripple a mighty river like this." He had to be taken on his word. The swirling sand and dust were starting to turn the sky an ochre-orange haze and was steadily closing like a shroud on us all, making an inspection of the river bank impossible. <br> Sandstorms have long been a fixture of Iraqi summers -- on average, there are about eight to ten each hot season. But this year they became a pandemic. Close to 40 sandstorms blew in during the five months from May to early October. Some lasted three days at a time, sheeting farms with suffocating silt, closing airports, and adding another layer of misery to a society that has been through hell. <br> Lack of water for irrigation, especially in Anbar, is a key problem. Iraq's water minister, Dr. Abdul Rashid Latif, says that the government dug an extra 1,000 wells over the past two years, taking advantage of a relatively high groundwater table. But drawing on a diminishing resource during a time of drought has proved costly. "We now have only around 20% of our original reserves left," he says. "And the thing about this water is that not much of it is being replenished." <br> "The Scent of a Dying Ecosystem" <br> Iraq's water numbers make for disturbing reading across the board. Government estimates put total reservoir storage at around 9% of nationwide capacity on the leading edge of a wet season that is not forecast to bring much relief. For the past two years, rainfall was some 70% lower than usual in most of Iraq's 18 provinces. <br> The snow melt that usually feeds the Tigris system from the Zagros Mountains in the Kurdish north was equally deficient. There are now seven dams on the adjoining Euphrates system, most in Turkey and Syria, with plans for at least one more. And then there are the rampant inefficiencies built into Iraq's antiquated 8,000 miles of canals and drains, which send countless millions of gallons gushing into parts of the country that have little use for the water, and no means to harness it even if they did. <br> Some have looked to the heavens to explain the lack of rain. Society here is deeply superstitious. Many Iraqis, from the Sunni Arabs of Anbar to the tribes of the Marshlands, believe the natural deficiencies are God-ordained -- and possibly a punishment for the sectarian ravages that have torn the country apart over the last three years. <br> "Droughts have happened before and will plague us again," says Awda as he surveys the vast expanse of hard-baked and cracked brown mud in front of him that used to be the Marshlands. "But not even in '91 was the water like this. Now there is nothing." The only water left in the maze of feeder streams that empty into this giant basin are pools of lime-colored stagnant ooze. Nothing flows. Ducks and geese sit listlessly on creek banks that have not been exposed in decades -- if ever -- to direct sunlight. <br> Infestations of flies circle like Saturn's rings around giant, steel barrels of drinking water, imported from the nearby city of Nasiriyah, that line village roads. Reeds that were once the staple of the agrarian peoples who worked this waterway through the ages jut starkly from the banks, nearly all of them yellow and hardened, looking more like medieval weapons of war than crops. <br> Earlier this fall, the major tributaries of the Euphrates were flowing at around 30% of their normal levels. "Look at that mark on the bank," says Awda, pointing to a stain on a corrugated iron beam at the base of the bridge. Not long ago, he notes, this had been a high-water mark. The waterline is now at least nine feet lower. The pungent murk of the riverbed lingers in the air. "Take a deep breath," says Awda. "That smell is the scent of a dying ecosystem." <br> Two fishermen, who had launched themselves into what remained of the waterway in a bid to net carp, return to the banks with their haul -- 12 fish, none bigger than 10 inches. The catch is not enough to feed their families, let alone take to market. Two years ago, the fish were fat and bountiful. <br> "Fishing is our staple here," explains one local man, Sheikh Hameed from Abart village, further north of the Marshlands. "That, and hunting water birds. But they've all flown away. I had a stall here for many years," he recalls, pointing to an abandoned roadside hut, where he used to sell his catch. <br> The white polystyrene crates that used to hold the fish on ice are now home to street cats and sand drifts. A giant water buffalo, which once spent the best part of the summer immersed in the water, is now making do with what remains. He stands motionless, buried to the midriff in a festering, black mud. The caked soil cast offers at least some respite from the heat, but with the temperature expected to hover between 118 and 124 degrees Fahrenheit for the following week, he doesn't have long left to wallow. <br> "We are digging wells for our own survival," says Sheikh Hameed. "And this in the most water-rich area of the country. This is not God's wrath. This is the work of people." <br> Tweaking the Tap <br> Over the past six chaotic years, new reservoirs have been built into the Euphrates system on both the Syrian and Turkish sides of the border. Iraq, as a downstream country, would have likely suffered from serious water depletion even if it had a government strong enough to assert its authority against two powerful neighbors. But with a political class struggling to win legitimacy amid a sectarian war that has torn the country apart along ancient societal fault lines, there has been little time to tend even to the bare basics of survival. Delivery of services has been close to non-existent, from the national government down to village mayors. Now, with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki claiming to run a credible sovereign state, work has begun in earnest on talking to the neighbors about many issues of Iraqi sovereignty, including border integrity, that have remained sidelined throughout the post-war turmoil. <br> "They should realize that we are an important neighbor and share many things in life," says Dr. Rashid, who has three times led Iraqi delegations to Istanbul and Damascus to beg for more water. He has returned with promises, but little fruit for his labors. With no treaties or agreements signed with either state, however, he has little leverage. "Our neighboring countries need to get the message that it is our right to get our share of water from these two international rivers and that we should have a say in their operational procedures because we are downstream. In our discussions they have never connected the water issues with any other issues." <br> There is trouble, too, from Iran, whose government earlier this year ordered the diversion back into Iranian territory of a key tributary of the Tigris -- the Karoon River, which enters Iraq just north of the southern city of Basra. Until early this year, the Karoon had sent regularly a vital flush of freshwater down the Tigris and into the Shatt al-Arab waterway at the northwestern end of the Persian Gulf. The freshwater pushed back the tidal effect and allowed tens of thousands of Iraqis from the southern Marshlands to make their livelihood through fishing and farming. <br> "There were 13 billion cubic meters of freshwater [annually] feeding into the Shatt al-Arab," says Dr. Rashid. "Now that has gone. We have asked them to sit down and talk but they won't even answer our requests." <br> In late October 2009, Iraqi technicians finally met with their Iranian counterparts. "They were told about the effect on the people in the south who are exclusively Shias -- their people," says Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari. "They were very embarrassed by this and promised to look into it." Today, the saltwater of the relentless tides around Basra is still winning the push-me, pull-you game and, like a rampaging army, has pushed farther north up the waterway than ever before. As a result, some 30,000 locals have left their land, some of which has now been heavily salinated, leaving it of marginal agricultural value at best. <br> Across Iraq, entire ecosystems are under threat. So far, redress from the Turks and the Syrians has consisted only of sympathetic words, followed by the occasional tweak of the tap. "We need 500 cubic meters per second," Dr. Rashid said in August. "We have been getting 350 meters on some days, but 150 meters on average. They have promised us more, but we have yet to see it." In the months that followed, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey three times announced a boost in the headwater flow from the Euphrates. But by late autumn, the downstream effect had been negligible. <br> The giant power station in the city of Nasiriyah was still using only two of its four turbines that are normally powered by the flow of the Euphrates. One had broken down, but could not have been used anyway because, along with a second turbine, there was not enough moving water to power it. Nasiriyah was getting by on about six to eight hours of power a day -- roughly the same as the rest of the country. <br> Throughout the summer and fall, engineers at the power station were desperately hoping the river would not fall another eight inches, to a level that would have left Iraq's fourth-largest city without any electricity whatsoever. "We saw it rise a centimeter or two, roughly two days after every announcement from the Turks, but it would soon drop away," says an engineer at the power station. "The figures we were being promised were not translating into tangibles." <br> The Rains Cometh Not <br> Both Turkey and Syria have been suffering from the same rainfall deficiency as Iraq. The winter storm fronts that once formed regularly near Cyprus and swept east through Syria, Jordan, and Iraq have been rare over the past three years, as have the low-pressure systems that could usually be counted on to dip south into Turkey from the Balkans and the Russian steppe. Cloud seeding and the contentious science of rain-making have been considered in all four countries. <br> Jordanians, in particular, remember the 1991 winter season, when seeding was attempted near Cyprus. That year, six separate snow-bearing storm fronts swept through the country, leaving yard-deep snow drifts on the streets of the capital, Amman, for many weeks. Heavy snow also fell across the Iraqi desert plains and the Zagros Mountains. The snow melt that autumn saw the Tigris burst its banks in Baghdad. Upstream in Turkey, there is still enough reliable winter rainfall to keep the dams brimming and make cloud seeding unnecessary. Downstream in Iraq, where the water is needed most, there is neither money nor interest for such an experiment. <br> Even the ancient ways are starting to fail. From June to August of this year, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conducted research into the status of ancient, natural subterranean aqueducts used both for human settlement and irrigation in the Kurdish north. The UNESCO results painted a bleak picture of water resources in northern Iraq, which had for centuries boasted relatively bountiful supplies, even during harsh times. The UNESCO study found that 70% of the aqueducts, known as karez, that were producing water in 2005 had since dried up and been abandoned. Of the 683 karez surveyed, most were not functioning, due largely to excessive use and ongoing drought -- only 116 still delivered water. The study claimed that 36,000 people were at risk of being displaced, while tens of thousands more had already left their lands. <br> Figures in Iraq are always open to a degree of conjecture, but one reality is now clear: the water crisis is leading to mass migrations of people and a renewed displacement at both ends of the country, just as some order was starting to replace the bedlam of the invasion and civil war. Iraqis have been returning to their homes in mixed neighborhoods in Baghdad, but now rural people, fleeing in droves from the increasingly arid provinces, are also showing up in urban centers. <br> The Marsh Arabs have left their lands in large numbers, according to Nasiriyah's governor, Qusey al-Ebadi, who has yet to find ways to accommodate them. "They are nomadic people and move around during difficult times," says al-Ebadi, "but I have never seen them coming into the cities with their animals like this." The men of the Marshlands -- now far from their ancestral lands -- mill around in small groups on street corners in Nasiriyah, many searching for laboring work, looking incongruous and desperate. <br> The people from the Shatt al-Arab area of the southern Marshlands also need accommodating. Government estimates suggest as many as 30,000 have left their lands, all but abandoning their agrarian livelihoods. Thousands more have been pushed to the brink of survival. If the Tigris and the Karoon do not flow again toward the Shatt al-Arab, the ecosystem they have relied on is all but finished. <br> The water crisis could not have come at a worse time for Prime Minister al-Maliki, who has spent much of his time and energy as leader attempting to win enough authority to assert his will. His formula had been security first and stability second, followed by delivery of services. So far, he has achieved qualified approval on the first two, but abject failure on the third. <br> Iraq's energy sector is in a desperate state of disrepair. In late October, a rare thunder and lightning storm that brought the first rains to Baghdad in seven months caused power to crash citywide for eight hours. Even without rain, or other disturbances such as dust or wind, most residents of the capital are getting by on no more than a half-day of regular electricity, the vast bulk supplied by coal-burning energy plants that generate power channeled by substations resembling museum pieces. What little electricity supply exists is frequently targeted by militias who boast of their intent to return the society (literally) to the dark ages. Sewer lines have only been dug in the most affluent areas and city roads are, at best, rudimentary. <br> With a national election looming in early March, al-Maliki knows that his current base of support across Iraq's religious and ethnic divides is fragile. Failure to give Iraqis the essential services they have long craved -- especially electricity, water, and sewerage --will likely spell his doom. Twice this fall, he has traveled to the Shia bastion of Basra to assess the plight of the Shatt al-Arab and to persuade locals that all is not lost. It is a hard sell for the people of the south, who collectively still see themselves as being as deeply deprived today as they were under Saddam. <br> For the prime minister to blame his nation's neighbors for water woes is unlikely to fly. Beyond the troubles over the water supply, al-Maliki has pointedly accused Syria of destabilizing Iraq by sheltering former Baathists, who, he claims, funded two bombing campaigns that targeted three government ministries and the Baghdad municipal government headquarters in August and October. All four buildings were annihilated, with almost 300 people killed and more than 1,000 maimed. While wagging his finger at Damascus, al-Maliki has also been constantly promising patronage to the southern tribes and an entre to state coffers if they fall in behind him. Months before a definitive election and amid an unparalleled ecological crisis, the tribes are, at best, restless. And water is near the top of their worry list. <br> Page Two: Enough Blame To Go Around
Attorney Andrew Cohen analyzes legal issues for CBS News and CBSNews.com.It starts off like a bad joke: what do you get when you have seven different opinions from nine judges? Only there is nothing funny about the weak, fuzzy and ultimately counterproductive way in which the Supreme Court has just handled the issue of how prison officials are supposed to lethally inject death-row prisoners on execution day. <br> It's one thing to unanimously punt the ball in a controversial case-the Justices unfortunately do that all the time. But in the closely-watched Baze v. Rees they couldn't even agree upon what they couldn't agree upon when it comes to the constitutionality of injection protocols in Kentucky. Seven different opinions! And not a one of them particularly profound. With neither the Court's right nor its left satisfied with the mushy result? That's not exactly making lemonade out of lemons, if you ask me. <br> Instead of issuing clear directives to the dozens of states eagerly awaiting instructions on how to implement execution protocols, the Court's majority mustered only this: lethal injection protocols in Kentucky are not "objectively intolerable," the majority declared, because they are "widely tolerated" in other states around the country and by the federal government. There you have it - the law is why it is because it is - the ultimate in judicial restraint with a Yes, We Have No Bananas flair. <br> Instead of announcing a legal standard that would narrow the pipeline of future litigation over injection procedures, the Court's feckless majority only invited future cases, a point brought out by one Justice who agreed with the result (Justice John Paul Stevens) and one who did not (Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg). Perhaps it was inevitable, as was made clear during oral argument a few months ago, that any ruling in the case would have generated a new generation of lawsuits about injection methods-how many drugs, the skill of the technicians, etc. But these hodgepodged rulings only guarantee that unhappy result. <br> Alas, it's arguable that things are going to get worse from here on in because the several of the Justices seemed to open up fresh wounds in the fight over capital punishment. Instead of the peace, love and understanding that Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. all but promised during his confirmation hearing a few years ago, the Court in Rees acted like a bunch of intemperate brats. Go ahead and read Justice Antonin Scalia's screed against Justice Stevens and tell me you think the Supremes were able and willing to keep their eyes on the ball in this case. <br> Reading the two opinions - Stevens and Scalia - makes you think of the family fight taking place at the dinner table or the great ESPN commercial feature Peyton and Eli Manning. In future lawsuits, advocates on all sides of the debate over capital punishment will cite chapter and verse their strong words. And if it weren't painfully obvious before now we surely can say that Chief Justice Roberts has been as unsuccessful in herding the eight other cats who make up the Court as almost all of his illustrious predecessors have been. If this is the Roberts Court, in other words, and I'm Chief Justice Roberts? I am asking for a do-over. <br> Of the impact of the ruling there is very little good to say. As a practical matter it opens up the spigot again for executions in this country; a practice that was effectively put on hold by the run-up to this ruling. The irony in this is that the Court Wednesday did not declare all lethal injection protocols to be constitutionally sound so, theoretically anyway, a man or woman might be executed over the next few weeks or months through methods that are actually worse than Kentucky's. Such is the crapshoot that capital punishment is and always has been in America. <br> From a legal view, officials in states which use lethal injection as the method of execution now have a choice to make. They can use this ruling to do nothing, figuring that by the time the legal challenges against them get any traction we'll be years down the road. Certainly the Court's majority did nothing to make them tremble that they'll ultimately have to pay a price. Or, these public servants can take the productive, constructive approach and fix their injection problems without a "court order" to do so. They can make sure - far more so than Kentucky has done - that there are no "substantial or imminent" risks inherent in the injection procedures. <br> This is a choice these men and women had last year and the year before that. The Supreme Court Wednesday refused to order them to make lethal injection more professional, more humane, and less susceptible to horrible abuse. The Court refused to require the states to lethally inject prisoners at least as humanely as Kentucky requires its veterinarians to euthanize the Commonwealth's beloved pets. But that doesn't preclude states from doing the right thing themselves, somewhat voluntarily. And, already, some are, including the biggies of Florida, Texas and California. <br> Proof, I suppose, that some public officials are able to fill the void when the highest court in the land falls flat on its face.
This column was written by Florencia Soto Nio-Martinez.Twenty minutes. That's how long it took the water to rise almost five feet in Las Lagunas, a small town in the south of Mexico's Tabasco state where Lucio Ramirez works as a first-grade teacher. Ramirez was sitting in his living room when a friend arrived with his entire family, seeking refuge. Their house had already been flooded, and they had nowhere else to go. <br> "I thought we would be safe at my place, the water wasn't supposed to reach that area," Ramirez said. "The government hadn't ordered us to evacuate, but that night I heard people screaming and running outside and I saw the water had started rising. In a few moments it was up to my waist. We had to leave quickly." <br> Ramirez and his family left the house that night. He barely had time to grab some clothes and important documents. They went to his mother's house, which had become a makeshift shelter, housing friends and relatives. "Every house in Tabasco that isn't flooded has turned into a shelter," said Tabasco's governor, Andres Granier, in a speech describing the disaster. <br> Lucio Ramirez is one of nearly one million people displaced by the Tabasco floods, one of the worst natural disasters in Mexico's history. Just a few days after Ramirez left his house, Mexico's President Felipe Caldern declared a state of emergency and sent hundreds of troops to evacuate half of the state, which is roughly the size of Belgium. <br> The floods started on October 28, and 70 percent of the state is still under water. Images of people living on their rooftops and hanging from lampposts have shaken the nation. To date, 20,000 people are stranded and as many as ten have died. These numbers are expected to increase once the waters recede. Tabasco has effectively turned into a "water-state," where many areas are only accessible by helicopter or boat. <br> Tabasqueos are used to floods. The seven rivers crossing the state overflow once or twice a year, and residents know how to deal with the excess of water. Many people automatically started moving their furniture to their rooftops, but refused to leave their houses, thinking the water level would soon subside. <br> "We know how to live with the water, we've had floods before, but this was completely unexpected," said Jenny Garcia, who left her home as soon as her town was ordered to be evacuated. She has not been able to return, and authorities have said that it might be at least a month before she can go back. "Of course I am worried about my house and the things I left, but overall, I've been lucky," she said. "[As a nurse] I can still work; some people -- farmers, fishermen -- they lost everything." <br> Farmers are undoubtedly the big losers from the floods. Rafael Tosca, deputy director for the trade department of the Tabasco Economy Ministry, announced that 100 percent of the state's crops and agricultural fields were lost. There are not precise numbers for lost livestock, but he said that "thousands of heads of cattle" had drowned. This is a catastrophe for a state whose economy largely depends on agriculture. About 30 percent of the state's population depends on agricultural jobs or subsistence farming for their survival (Tabasco is a major exporter of bananas, cocoa, beef and the famous Tabasco pepper). <br> "While the government is worried about cleaning up the capital and its surrounding areas, there are still people who haven't gotten any aid," said Chris Bessenecker, an international public health and development specialist who works as a consultant for Project Concern International, a non-governmental organization specializing in disaster aid relief. "Rural areas are hard to access, so assistance is just not getting there." <br> Mexicans have responded vigorously to the needs of their fellow citizens. More than 2,000 tons of goods have been shipped to Tabasco in the past two weeks. Schools, supermarkets and even coffee shops have turned into collection centers, where people donate basic supplies like bottled water, food and blankets. Concerts and movie theaters have donated their ticket sales to the cause. <br> Mexico has also received help from the international community. Ireland gave about 1 million euros just three days after the president declared a state of emergency. Cuba sent fifty doctors to treat Tabasco residents, the UK provided boats and France sent 20,000 water purification tablets. In total, the European Union donated 3 million euros, an astounding sum compared to the $300,000 that the US government has given thus far. <br> For a disaster of this magnitude, the floods have received very little attention from the United States media. While the BBC and The Guardian websites headlined Tabasco just twenty-four hours after the floods broke out, encouraging readers to share pictures and stories, it took two more days before the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times picked up the story, which never made it to their front pages. Major broadcasters like CNN and Fox News are no longer covering the aftermath of the floods, and donations to the cause were scarcely publicized. Mexico is experiencing its own Hurricane Katrina, and its closest neighbor has hardly heard about it. <br> The Mexican government estimates the economic losses to be nearly $5 billion -- and costs will rise, as Tabasco now faces new challenges. The Ministry of Health announced that there is a high risk of dengue and cholera epidemics because of water pollution. An epidemic would easily spread, since medical facilities are scarce with more than 100 of the region's health centers still under water. <br> People in rural areas waiting to be evacuated might still get some help before it is too late from the few organizations that are trying help Tabasco's most isolated areas. Project Concern International Mexico plans to donate seeds and livestock to farmers so they can recover quickly. "Getting these people seeds to replant so that in a month they can have food they can eat and sell is important," said Bessenecker. "It's not only about giving goods but about being able to give people the necessary tools so that they can reactivate Tabasco's economy." <br> It will take months before Tabasco recovers completely. In 1999, floods of a lesser magnitude damaged the state's infrastructure and set back its economic growth for about a year. Although the government pledged millions of dollars to strengthen the state's dam and pump system, the project was not completed and not all of the money has been accounted for, raising the question of whether this disaster -- like Hurricane Katrina -- could have been prevented. President Caldern has pledged to oversee the reconstruction of Tabasco until the very end, "regardless of the cost." <br> Lucio Ramirez has now returned to his house and is trying to clean up and save what the water didn't wash away. "It's sad to see how you can lose so much in so little time, but we're all still optimistic, we're all helping each other." By Florencia Soto Nio-MartinezReprinted with permission from the The Nation
This column was written by Mona Charen. Oregon's governor, Theodore Kulongoski, called a gaggle of his closest friends to a photo op Tuesday that few could pass up. As part of his "Food Stamp Challenge" week, the governor is attempting to live on a food budget of $21 per week, which is about the average benefit for an Oregon food stamp recipient, according to the governor's press release. <br> Associated Press photos showed the governor pushing a shopping cart and ostentatiously relinquishing a noodle cup and two bananas at the checkout counter when his total topped $21. "Could you feed yourself for $3 a day?" demanded headline in the next morning's Oregonian. <br> Let us stipulate that in a country as wealthy as ours, the idea that anyone should go hungry is unacceptable. <br> But is that what's really happening? Why is it that whenever you listen to a Democrat you feel that the year is 1966? They seem to live in a time warp in which no progress has been made on race relations, poverty, childhood malnutrition, and on and on. <br> Let's start with some numbers. If you go the state of Oregon's Web site and calculate your eligibility for food stamps, you will find that a family of four with no income (and 70 percent of food stamp recipients do not work at all) is entitled to $518 monthly or about $32 weekly for each person. This is a very rough estimate because all sorts of factors are taken into account in calculating eligibility, including number of dependents, housing costs, expenses, and other income. Perhaps the governor's office is correct that the average food stamp allotment in the state is $21. But that means some get more and some less. Eligibility is based on need. <br> Now even $32 seems like a very small amount of money per person, but that is only a small part of the largesse provided by the U.S. government, which spent $522 billion on low-income assistance programs in 2002. It doesn't count hot breakfasts and lunches at school (which push high-calorie, high-fat diets on kids). It doesn't count the Earned Income Tax Credit by which the working poor get cash back from the federal government ($41.4 billion went to 22.2 million recipients last year, according to the Los Angeles Times). It doesn't include housing subsidies, Medicaid, or the Supplemental Security Income program, which can free up funds for food. Nor does it count the WIC program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. <br> The WIC program provides highly caloric packages of juice, cereal, eggs, and other food to pregnant women, nursing mothers and children up to the age of 4. WIC also provides baby formula, thus discouraging the poor from breast-feeding their babies. About 50 percent of the formula sold in the U.S. goes to families using WIC. Formula-fed babies are more likely to be overweight, suffer ear infections, have allergies, and, if you believe some of the data, have lower IQs than breast-fed infants. <br> Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute notes that while he can recall visiting rural Mississippi in the 1960s and seeing severe cases of malnutrition, the problem among the poor today is more likely to be obesity. Today, 70 percent of low-income Americans are overweight, compared with 60 percent of the non-poor. The mean intake of poor children aged 6-11 was 2,000 calories a day in 1994 compared with 1,969 calories for non-poor children of the same age. President Bill Clinton's secretary of agriculture, Dan Glickman, acknowledged that "The simple fact is that more people die in the United States of too much food than of too little, and the habits that lead to this epidemic [obesity] become ingrained at an early age." <br> We are pushing food at the poor as if hunger and malnutrition still crouched at the door when the bigger threat these days is saturated fat and excess sugar. The Food Stamp program arguably needs a massive reform, offering cash grants instead of vouchers or credit cards, which encourage over-consumption. Is it too much to ask that politicians and journalists (that photo of Gov. Kulongoski showed up everywhere) address today's problems and not those of 40 years ago?By Mona CharenReprinted with permission from National Review Online

And it wasn't because of her teaching; rather, it had more to do with her extracurricular activities. <br> Austin High School officials considered Hoover a model art teacher with a knack for helping students find their creative streaks ... until they found out about her topless photos, that is. <br> The photos, which were posted on Flickr.com by her partner, show Hoover in the shower, lifting weights, getting dressed, in bed and doing other routine activities. <br> Hoover stands by her photos as genuine works of art, but the school district said the photos were inappropriate and violate the "higher moral standard" expected of public school teachers. As a result, she was dismissed, escorted out of class last month. <br> Many bloggers are outraged at the school, and support Hoover's stance that her photography is art. <br> On Hoover's MySpace profile, she defends her work, "The First Amendment serves not only the needs of the polity but also those of the human spirit a spirit that demands self-expression," Hoover blogs. <br> "I'm an artist and I'm going to participate in the arts," Hoover told the Associated Press. "If that's not something they want me to do then I want to be told that. I don't feel as if I was doing anything that was beyond expectations." <br> But, as the Longhorn Law blog notes, "The First Amendment and teaching in public schools don't always mesh." <br> As the Green Llama writes, there may be a special consideration given she is teaching young students. "Too bad her students don't live under rocks, and do in fact have access to the internet," Green Llama writes. <br> Some bloggers are hardly surprised. "Hey, big surprise! Our fascist society/school system is now firing art teachers for being, um, artistic," No Matter, Ron blogs. "Maybe it's just me, but I don't really see how appearing topless in an artful pic (or a pornographic one, for that matter) is at all a reflection of one's 'goodness or badness.'" <br> SaveManny agrees the photographs are "artful." "These pictures are done by what looks like a professional photographer and have artistic value. Further these pictures were taken during her free time and have nothing to do with her ability to effectively teach a high school art class," Manny writes. <br> Plus, Big Damn Heroes says Hoover's firing sends the wrong message to students. "Way to go, Austin High School! Make it clear to any good-hearted person coming out of college with a desire to help (and no sense of financial self-preservation) that teaching is a spit-upon, worthless exercise in catering to the lowest of common denominators," the blogger writes. <br> Gates Channeling Spider-Man? <br> Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates announced last week that he will be leaving his daily responsibilities at Microsoft to concentrate on the charitable work of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation. <br> But while experts in the fields of business and technology were off analyzing the impact of Gates' semi-retirement on their industries, bloggers took notice of Gates' not-so-unique turn of phrase during his press conference. <br> Explaining his rationale for devoting more time to his charitable work, Gates noted that "with great wealth comes great responsibility"eerily similar, bloggers say, to Spider-man's dictum, "With great power comes great responsibility." <br> Coincidence? Maybe not, some bloggers say. <br> "Perhaps the choice of quote might offer a clue as to how Gates sees himself: The vastly misunderstood Peter Parker type, who just wants to do good but is routinely vilified by the very public he wants to help," Steve Fox wrote on Infoworld. <br> Bertrand also notices the similarities. "Gates is now in the unique position of being able to dramatically improve the welfare and lives of the millions of suffering peoples in the third world nations of the world," he writes on The Ramblings of an Itinerant Vagabond. <br> "Holy Tingling Spider-Sense, Spider-Man," EJ Wise exclaimed. "I suppose all we need look out for is a Hobgoblin or two, waiting in the wings, to swoop down on Mr. Ballmer once he's at the helm." <br> Aside from the Spidey-connection, many bloggers also praised Gates' charitable inclinations. "The bit I admire most about him is his sense of noblesse oblige [or, in Spider-Man terms, that "with great power comes great responsibility"], and his willingness to act on that," Alex Mallett blogs at Malletrivia, summarizing what many bloggers were filling the blogosphere with. <br> A Blog And A Dream <br> Bloggers were envious of two people this week, who represent one very good reason to blogit could lead to your dream job. One blogger will be paid to snowboard around the country and hand out Snickers bars, and the other will be paid to follow around the Dixie Chicks. It's good to be a blogger. <br> Blogs Snickered <br> Many candy-lovers and skaters are already jealous of Jake Levine. The 25-year-old Cherryfield, Maine native was selected by Snickers to become the ambassador for the candy company and Burton, the maker of snowboards. As Adrants notes, it's an effort to reach an audience usually immune to traditional media. <br> Jake will be a "Rover," crossing the country for a year in an all expenses paid position as board sports ambassador, hanging with riders and boarders, attending events...and, of course, blogging. <br> As he writes on his blog, "Over the next year, I'll live every amateur rider's dream as I hang out with riders throughout the country, meet pros and demonstrate my techniques at popular venues, giving away tons of cool stuff from Rover sponsors along the way." <br> Bloggers are smitten with the job. "Imagine the best job you could ever think of in the whole wide world. Jake Levine's new job as the Burton Rover is oh, about ten times cooler," Snowboard 360 writes. <br> "Whatever your passion in life may be, imagine being given the opportunity to live one perfect, all-expenses-paid dream year in which that's all you did," Stephen Harris at BostonHerald.com adds. <br> Blogging About Chicks <br> The Dixie Chicks have sure had their share of controversy in the blogosphere, but one recent move has garnered them many online fans. <br> In another dream job, (for some that is), Junichi Semitsu, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, has become the official blogger for the Dixie Chicks. <br> As the Washington Post reports, Semitsu, 32, will spend his summer armed with a laptop and an all-access tour pass on the road with Natalie Maines, Martie Maguire and Emily Robison. He is one of the music industry's first embedded bloggers, assigned to be everywhere and write whatever about the country-music group. <br> His posts are cleared by the Chicks' camp before appearing online, but Semitsu insists he has free rein to write what he wishes. <br> As the Washington Post notes, Semitsu's position is unique in the music world. Sure, plenty of musicians like Radio Head and even Neil Young have their own blogs, but few, if any, have hired a blogger to write for them. "I can't even name all the bands doing it, there are so many," Antony Bruno, digital/mobile editor at Billboard magazine told the Washington Post. "But I haven't heard of an individual artist bringing a blogger on board to do it for them." <br> Bloggers cheered the development, and Semitsu is equally proud of his cool new summer gig. <br> "To respond to the article, yes, I believe I have the greatest summer job in the history of summer jobs," he writes on his Dixie Chicks blog. <br> And in his personal blog, which helped him land the gig, Semitsu blogs, "Being referred to as a "Chicks Magnet" in the Post is an especially huge accomplishment for a short and stocky Asian guy with an enormous Pez collection.In any event, this whole gig continues to be banana split: bananas, nuts, and pretty sweet." <br> Hadji Girl <br> A Marine corporal seen in a video singing about killing members of an Iraqi family says the song was a joke. <br> "It's a song that I made up and it was nothing more than something supposed to be funny, based off a catchy line of a movie," Cpl. Joshua Belile, 23, said in Wednesday's Daily News of Jacksonville. <br> The Marines are now investigating the video. But while some bloggers are not amused, many (especially on the right) side with the Marine. <br> In the four-minute video called "Hadji Girl," a singer who appears to be a Marine, tells an audience about gunning down members of an Iraqi woman's family after they confront him with automatic weapons. <br> Belile said he wrote the song in September while stationed in Iraq. He said his buddies pushed him on stage with his guitar. Someone taped the performance and posted it on the Internet, but it has since been removed. He only learned it was on the Internet after returning from Iraq in March. <br> "I will never perform this song again, and I will remove all video and text in relation to this that I have control of," he said. <br> In a press release, which also links to the video, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) "called on the Pentagon and Congress to investigate a music video posted on the Internet that seems to show U.S. Marines cheering a song that glorifies the killing of Iraqi civilians." <br> But in the blogosphere, Belile has many defenders. <br> Some think he will soon be in the clear. "This Marine is guilty of bad taste and bad taste is not listed in the Manual for Courts Martial. His Commander needs to explain the significance of the 'Strategic Corporal,'" Oak Leaf at PoliPundit blogs. <br> Others blame the mainstream media for blowing the story out of proportion. Writing a "Letter to the Brass," The Laughing Wolf writes, "Is the song politically correct? No, then again war is not either, nor should it be. Could the song be used by our enemies against us? Yes, with your full help and collaboration, it is being done so in the media and elsewhere." <br> A blogger at Little Green Footballs agrees. "The four-minute song includes graphic descriptions of killings, real or imagined. The horror! We would never want anyone let alone soldiers on a battlefield to hear such things. Except of course in every movie made for the last ten years," he writes. <br> Scroff, a liberal, understand some may consider the song offensive, but also appreciates the circumstances under which they were likely written. "While I can certainly see how it can be found offensive, I don't think Cpl. Joshua Belle had that in mind when he wrote it.But, to the raving maniacs on the left I say, chill out. It's called stress relief," he writes at Any Which Way. <br> Blogophile RSS Feed <br> By Melissa McNamara 
With millions of sites floating through the blogosphere, who really has time to peek at even a fraction of them? Blogophile reads them for you and presents a weekly roundup of the buzz on must-read blogs. Blogophile appears new each Wednesday, and is written by CBSNews.com's Melissa P. McNamara. <br> Bloggers sing the praises of the "Eurovision Song Contest" winner. Read what they say about Finland's new hero. And, an article about doctors treating women as "forever pregnant" has riled up feminist bloggers. Plus, what happens when you fight back against spammers? Find out below. <br> Bloggers Take On Eurovision <br> I confess that when "Eurovision Song Contest" popped up as a most searched topic on the blogs for almost a week straight, I was puzzled, having never heard of it. Apparently I'm not alone, at least among fellow Americans. <br> "The annual Eurovision Song Contestnow in its 51st yearis one of the world's most watched regular music event," Mike Atkinson writes on Slate.com. "Despite this, the show remains entirely unknown to all but a handful of Americans." <br> But the annual contest has taken over the blogosphere. For those not in the know, Eurovision seeks to discover "the best song in Europe," with Europeans voting by telephone. But it basically turns into a kitschy, campy television show. Since most people hear the competing songs just once before casting their votes, each performance must create an instant (good) impression to ensure that it stands out. <br> The Guardian's CultureVulture blog describes it simply as "a combination of Star Trek convention, Atlantic City floor show and Lourdes." <br> The basic requirements are that no song can exceed three minutes and the winning country must host the next year's contest. This year, Athens hosted the wacky contest. Previous well-known winners include ABBA in 1974 with "Waterloo," and Celine Dion, who won for Switzerland in 1988. <br> This Saturday's showdown was broadcast live in 38 countries to a TV audience estimated at 100 million. And about 13,000 fans packed the indoor arena used during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, to see the spectacle live. <br> And in what many bloggers viewed as a stunning upset, Lordi, a Finnish metal band with monster masks and apocalyptic lyrics, won the contest with their "Hard Rock Hallelujah." <br> Among some of the early acts was Spain's Las Ketchup, performing "Un Bloody Mary Por Favor." And Germany's entry also drew particular attention from Americans because of its Texas-named artists, Texas Lightning, who performed, "No No Never." <br> But for many bloggers, the contest was not simply about geography. As a Swedish blogger writes on Andreasviklund.com, "I love listening to the entries from the other countries. And it is always fun to guess which ones that will score high." <br> And bloggers had lots to say about Lordi's triumph. As Attu Sees All describes it, "The band members wear scary masks, which they refuse to take off, and the lead singer wields a chain-saw. Their song Hard Rock Hallelujah is a radical departure from the folk songs usually associated with Eurovision." <br> Toni, a Finnish blogger, describes reaction out of Finland. "Our country went absolutely BANANAS after our monster-of-an-artist LORDI did the unthinkable and ranked #1! People went out in the streets, celebrating together, singing the winning song and a bunch of other national party anthems... I can't even imagine the sheer amount of press coverage next week! Whoah," he writes. <br> John, blogging from the UK, writes, "My hat goes off to any band who can get great lyrics such as 'the day of rockening' into their songs somehow. Never have lyrics been so rockin' great since examples from Twisted Sister ('I pledge alligence/ to the United States of rock...')." <br> But some Russians sensed a scandal was afoot, claiming the vote was skewed against their country's group, Bilan. Bilan's performance of "Never Let You Go" featured an white-clad actor climbing out of a white piano and received one of the highest finishes for a Russian performer in the history of the 51-year-old contest. <br> Kittan-Man explains the voting is largely political. "The problem with this scheme is that the voting then becomes political, so the East Block all vote for Mother Russia, the Nordic Countries support each other and countries such as Greece and the other Mediterranean countries share votes too. Resulting in some rather strange results," he writes. <br> Americans may soon learn what the contest is all about. NBC announced it will be developing a U.S. version of Eurovision, in which the 40-odd competing European nations will be replaced by the 50 states of the union. <br> Forever Pregnant <br> One of the most trafficked stories in the blogosphere this week is a Washington Post article, "Forever Pregnant," that has enraged feminist bloggers. <br> The Post reports that new federal guidelines ask all females capable of conceiving a baby to treat themselves -- and to be treated by the health care system -- as pre-pregnant, regardless of whether they plan to get pregnant anytime soon. <br> Or as Pandagon summarizes it, "The general gist of the article is that America's high infant mortality rate is best addressed by scolding women for not acting like they are pregnant all the time or about to be." <br> According to the article, women "between first menstrual period and menopause" are supposed to take supplements of folic acid, refrain from smoking, maintain a healthy weight and watch chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes. Women are also advised to stay away from cat feces and "discuss the danger alcohol poses to a developing fetus." <br> "Pause. Breathe. OK. What?," Rebecca Traister writes on Salon.com. "So even when we're not pregnant, or have no intention of becoming pregnant, or have already been pregnant and are done having babies, we should make our theoretically possible but wholly imaginary fetuses our priorities." <br> But is this what the CDC really recommended, some bloggers like Amanda at Pandagon ask? She say the CDC is only asking doctors to get women to plan their pregnancies and be aware of how to manage their health when those pregnancies are planned to occur. <br> Amanda says the Washington Post ignored this detail fearing a political backlash. "I think it's because it's a political hot potato to openly admit that the two most important steps towards reducing the infant mortality rate and improving the health of newborns in general is to get health care to every woman and to empower women with the knowledge and tools they need to get pregnant only when they want to," Amanda says. <br> Majikthise agrees there's politics at play. "The political climate in Bush's America is such that we can't even discuss public health, let alone women's healthcare, except under the pretext of making women better baby factories," she writes.
This column from The Nation was written by Katha Pollitt.Women don't shout. Women don't like politics. Women shrink from intellectual debate. Women don't try. It's time for another round of "What's Wrong with Women?" Last month's category was science. This month it's punditry, sparked by a testy (well, nasty) letter from syndicated columnist and FOX-TV commentator Susan Estrich to Michael Kinsley, the courtly editorial and opinion editor of the Los Angeles Times, pointing out the lack of female talent on his op-ed pages: In nine weeks, only 20 percent of pieces were written by women. Now everybody's jumping in: "Feminists Get Hysterical" (Heather MacDonald in City Journal) is a typical sentiment. <br> "There ought to be more women on op-ed pages in general. Over time, I intend to make that happen," said Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor of the Washington Post, which counts one woman, Anne Applebaum, among its nineteen pundits; in the first two months of 2005 one in ten op-ed pieces were by women. Take your time, Mr. Hiatt! As Applebaum warns, you don't want to hire untalented women who'll just write about "women's issues." Her friends got their bylines by "having clear views, knowing their subjects, writing well and learning to ignore the ad hominem attacks that go with the job." And you know how few women meet those lofty criteria! "The pool of available people doing opinion writing is still tilted toward men," said New York Times editorial page editor Gail Collins. "There are probably fewer women, in the great cosmic scheme of things, who feel comfortable writing very straight opinion stuff, and they're less comfortable hearing something on the news and batting something out." Come April, the Times will have seven male op-ed columnists, plus Maureen Dowd. Not to worry though, Dowd writes, there are "plenty of brilliant women.... We just need to find and nurture them." <br> Oh, nurture my eye. It may be true that more men than women like to bloviate and "bat things out" -- socialization does count for something. So do social rewards: I have seen men advance professionally on levels of aggression, self-promotion and hostility that would have a woman carted off to a loony bin -- unless, of course, she happens to be Ann Coulter. But feminine psychology doesn't explain why all five of USA Today's political columnists are male, or why Time's eleven columnists are male -- down to the four in Arts and Entertainment -- or why at Newsweek it's one out of six in print and two out of thirteen on the Web. According to Editor and Publisher, the proportion of female syndicated columnists (one in four) hasn't budged since 1999. The tiny universe of political-opinion writers includes plenty of women who hold their own with men, who do not wilt at the prospect of an angry e-mail, who have written cover stories and bestsellers and won prizes -- and whose phone numbers are likely already in the Rolodexes of the editors who wonder where the women are. How hard could it be to "find" Barbara Ehrenreich, who filled in for Thomas Friedman for one month last summer and wrote nine of the best columns the Times has seen in a decade? Or Dahlia Lithwick, legal correspondent for Slate, another Friedman fill-in, who actually possesses a deep grasp of the field she covers -- which cannot always be said for John Tierney, who begins his Times column in April? What about Susan Faludi? The Village Voice's Sharon Lerner? Debra Dickerson? Wendy Kaminer? The Progressive's Ruth Conniff? Laura Flanders? Debbie Nathan? Ruth Rosen, veteran of the LA Times and the San Francisco Chronicle? Our own Patricia Williams and Naomi Klein? Natalie Angier, bestselling author and top New York Times science writer, would be a fabulous op-ed columnist. And, not to be one of those shrinking violets everyone's suddenly so down on, What about me? Am I a potted plant? <br> You'll note I've mostly named liberals and feminists -- I'm sure there are good women writers on the right out there, too, and their job prospects are probably a lot rosier. A conservative woman who endlessly attacks feminists, like The New Yorker's Caitlin Flanagan or the Los Angeles Times's departed Norah Vincent or the Boston Globe's Cathy Young -- what could be hotter than that? <br> Besides being false and insulting, all this fuss about women not having the cojones for no-holds-barred debate overlooks the fact that, as Deborah Tannen pointed out in the LA Times, there are many ways to write political commentary. Not every male columnist is a fire-breather, an instant expert, a tub-thumper, an obnox. Think of the Washington Post's E.J. Dionne Jr. or USA Today's Walter Shapiro, both mannerly and sweet-natured to a fault. Some columnists use their perch to do crusading reporting -- Bob Herbert's great strength -- to tell stories, to analyze ideas and policies, to ask questions, to skewer received opinion with wit and humor. And then there are the ones who just drone boringly on. Surely there are women capable of that! <br> That opinion writing is a kind of testosterone-powered food fight is a popular idea in the blogosphere. Male bloggers are always wondering where the women are and why women can't/don't/won't throw bananas. After all, anyone can have a blog, right? In the wake of the Estrich-Kinsley contretemps, the Washington Monthly blogger Kevin Drum mused upon the absence of women bloggers and got a major earful from women bloggers, who are understandably sick of hearing that they don't exist. "I'm staring you right in the face, Kevin," wrote Avedon Carol (sideshow.me.uk), "and even though you've said you read me every day you don't have me on your blogroll. It's things like this that make me tear out my hair when people wonder why women are underrepresented...." There are actually lots of women political bloggers out there -- spend half an hour reading them and you will never again say women aren't as argumentative as men! But what makes a blog visible is links, and male bloggers tend not to link to women (to his credit, Kevin Drum has added nineteen to his blogroll). Perhaps they sense it might interfere with the circle jerk in cyberspace -- the endless mutual self-infatuation that is one of the less attractive aspects of the blogging phenom. <br> Or maybe, like so many op-ed editors, they just don't see women, even when the women are right in front of them. <br> "Subject to Debate" columnist Katha Pollitt has written for The Nation since 1980. <br> By Katha PollittReprinted with permission from the The Nation
For the past week or so, the press has been reporting that monkeys are not as good at writing plays as humans. Surprisingly, the experiment that yielded this startling result was not paid for by United States taxpayers. Researchers at Plymouth University in England were behind this one. The idea was to test the old saying that if you give an infinite number of typewriters to an infinite number of randomly typing monkeys, they will eventually produce the entire works of Shakespeare. <br> This famous supposition supposedly demonstrates the role of chance in evolution and the creative process. However, when six monkeys at the Paignton Zoo were given a computer for a month, they didn't come up with Shakespeare. They didn't come up with a single word. All they produced were five unintelligible pages. This result has been perceived by many as proof of monkeys' inferiority to humans. I don't see it that way, and think the monkeys deserve another chance. <br> I admit that the six hairy writers Elmo, Gum, Heather, Holly, Mistletoe, and Rowan did not write a single play in a month. But what does that prove? Would anyone seriously suggest that Shakespeare wrote his plays in the very first month that he was given the opportunity to write? Like all writers, he probably wrote a lot of gibberish in the beginning, too. <br> Then there is the issue of six monkeys and only one computer. Would Shakespeare have come up with his plays if five other writers had been fighting him for use of his quill? Isn't it possible that Holly might have been the monkey who was good at dialogue, but was pushed aside by Heather, who just got the typing job because she was good-looking? <br> The most unfair aspect of the experiment was that the monkeys were not given the same incentives that human writers have. Writers need pressure. There was no gorilla of a producer, editor, or network executive standing over the monkeys, saying that they wouldn't eat unless they wrote something good. There wasn't a more successful writer monkey in the cage next door who always seems to get the good jobs just because of his connections. <br> Did these monkey writers come from dysfunctional families? Had they been politically, religiously, or sexually oppressed? Had they been through tragic love affairs? Had they been told, over and over again, that there's no chance that they would succeed? Did they get kicked out of school by a mean fifth-grade teacher who should have given me, I mean, them one more chance? Writers are often inspired by a desire to prove wrong those who doubted them. Were the monkeys given this motivation? No, they weren't. <br> Many people feel that procrastination is a necessary part of the writing process. Hemingway supposedly sharpened dozens of pencils before he would start writing. Some current writers check their e-mail repeatedly, make unnecessary phone calls, and re-arrange their desktops before they begin writing. Were the monkeys taught that they should arrange their bananas in perfect little stacks before they try to produce literature? No, they weren't. <br> So, the only fair thing to do would be to repeat the experiment. Give the monkeys more time. Let them use their past struggles. Teach them how to rationalize watching SportsCenter one more time before beginning the next paragraph. Have a pretty actress monkey sashay into their cage and tell the monkey writers that they're geniuses. They'll start writing. <br> Maybe it won't be Shakespeare, but given a fair chance, I see no reason why these monkeys won't be able to grind out TV reality shows. Unless they're already more evolved than that. <br> By Lloyd Garver
For all of last week, I worked hard to live on the budget of a minimum wage worker. That meant I had $77 to spend on food, transportation, activities and other personal expenses for the week. I didn’t make it. <br> Most mornings started with eggs and toast, bought last Sunday during a grocery trip costing more than $15. Lunches were normally leftovers, macaroni and cheese or McDonald’s. There were no big dinners or coffee stops on a whim. But the challenges were beyond food. <br> Wednesday morning, I had a meeting about a mile from my apartment, but in the opposite direction of my office. I would normally take a cab, but this time, I took off my jacket and walked the mile in 90-degree heat, then walked back almost 2 miles to my office. Walking made me late to my meeting, but a minimum wage budget doesn’t allow for extra transportation costs, making it my only option. <br> And early in the week when I actually caught a cold, I felt lucky to already have medicine at home that would help with the symptoms. Medicine, along with any other unexpected or additional expenses, often prevents the budget from stretching as far as it needs to stretch. That was a lesson I learned when my budget ran out on Thursday evening. <br> These are just some of the small realities I have learned about life on the minimum wage. <br> Washington is in a bubble that keeps our representatives away from the experiences of those they actually represent. We need to understand the challenges faced by Americans who are being left behind in our economy. That’s why I joined members of Congress and dozens of organizations in taking the Live the Wage challenge (www.LivetheWage.com), and asking those in Congress to actually try living on the minimum wage for a week before opposing an increase that would help millions of Americans who currently live in poverty. <br> For the week, I walked as much as I possibly could to avoid paying for transportation, skipped meals to save money — and I ate much smaller and less healthful meals when I did eat. Because fresh fruits and vegetables are hard to find at a price within a minimum wage budget, I turned to bread, peanut butter, bananas and bologna more than anything else. That was what I could find when I took this budget to the grocery story last Sunday. And that’s why I ate lunch from the McDonald’s dollar menu. 
T he right statistic is often worth a thousand words—and sometimes much more than that. These five weekly data points, put together by Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the risk consultancy Eurasia Group, provide a glimpse into global trends, political dangers and international power dynamics. Some are counterintuitive facts. Others are small stats that tell a big story. This week, Bremmer looks at figures from American strategic interests in Nigeria to the end of bananas—and what they mean for everybody else. <br> The end of bananas? <br> Currently, a single type of banana—the Cavendish banana—accounts for about 45 percent of the fruit’s global production. In recent years, a deadly disease has decimated the Cavendish in Asia and Australia and now, it has spread to Mozambique, an important player in the banana industry. The end of bananas could have grave implications around the world. Bananas generate $8 billion annually, and more than 400 million people rely on them as their primary source of calories. In countries like Rwanda and Uganda, average banana consumption is roughly 500 pounds per capita per year; that’s 20 times the figure for Americans. For the United States, the acute threat would come if the disease—incredibly virulent, able to spread from just one clod of infected dirt and usually transported by farm workers—spreads to Latin America, which grows the bananas that Americans consume. <br> ( Popular Science) <br> A turning tide in Iran? <br> Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Iranian women have been legally forbidden from leaving their homes without headscarves. But if social media is any indication, opposition to the law might be growing. A new Facebook page entitled “My Stealthy Freedom” invites women to post photos of themselves without their hijabs. The page garnered about 130,000 “likes” in a little over a week, almost all of them coming inside Iran. <br> (CNN, BBC) <br> The big picture behind Boko Haram <br> Beyond the moral reasons and the national security motivation, the United States also has an economic reason for assisting the Nigerian government in rescuing the 276 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country by a wide margin. It has sustained GDP growth rates above 6 percent every year since 2003; this year’s growth is projected to be 7.1 percent. Every year, the United States sends the country $5 billion in private investment and $700 million in aid. It’s the fifth largest oil exporter to the United States. And 1.5 million Nigerians live in the United States, sending remittances and maintaining close ties to Nigeria. <br> ( Politico, The Fiscal Times) <br> The $100 billion price tag of cyberattacks <br> In a first-of-its-kind disclosure, the White House recently announced that in 2013, federal agents notified more than 3,000 U.S. companies that their computer systems had been hacked. But that number is just a miniscule fraction of the year’s total number of cyberntrusions perpetrated by both criminal groups and foreign governments—all of which cost U.S. companies and consumers an estimated $100 billionannually. The announcement came after President Obama’s February 2013 executive order to share more information on cyberattacks with the private sector—and before last week’s indictment of five Chinese military hackers. <br> ( The Washington Post) <br> Is Europe out of the woods? <br> In the Eurozone, the group of 18 European states that have adopted the Euro as their currency, it seems the economic pressure is off. Low yields signal that bond markets think the crisis is over. Yields on Irish government bonds have fallen below 3 percent, Portugal’s 10-year bond yield has fallen below 4 percent and Greece has proved able to sell five-year bonds at rates below 5 percent. The IMF has raised its growth forecast for the Eurozone to 1.2 percent—up from 1 percent last year. Even Greece is expected to grow (albeit by just 0.6 percent). March unemployment figures for Germany and Austria were a manageable 5.1 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. <br> But there are still a lot of alarm bells. Public debt is still at 90 percent of Eurozone GDP. Officials have proposed a plan that would reduce that figure to a target rate of 60 percent … over a couple of decades.And the unemployment figures still tell a tale of two Eurozones—the stable core and the struggling periphery. In March, the Eurozone’s overall unemployment rate was 11.8 percent, but Greece’s was 26.5 percent and Spain’s was 25.3. <br> ( Project Syndicate) 
My country, Ecuador, recently found itself in the crossfire over a request for asylum from Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor at the center of a raging global controversy. We are one of more than 20 countries with which he registered a formal application. While his fate remains uncertain, and there are strong opinions on whether he is a hero or a villain, the affair has put a needed spotlight on the little-understood asylum process. <br> Ecuador didn’t choose this controversy; it chose us. We are bound by international and domestic law to thoroughly consider any and all applications for asylum we receive on the basis of the likelihood of persecution, not politics. Regardless of our personal views on the applicant, our asylum process remains agnostic. Our commitment to due process does not afford us the luxury of being selective in how we comply with our obligations. Doing so would weaken our system of fair, transparent justice and the trust that the world — most importantly our own citizens — have in it. <br> At the same time, as Ecuador and other countries have stated, an individual cannot apply for asylum from abroad; the law only allows for such a request to be processed if that individual is within the territory of the nation he is petitioning. Ecuador also bears no responsibility for any potential travel by Snowden. <br> Our country does, however, have a responsibility to follow the law. Ecuador has proudly signed and ratified every applicable international convention and treaty on human rights and refugees. As a signatory to the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for instance, Ecuador recognizes that “everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.” This principle is embodied in our constitution, which obligates us to review all applications. National legislation strictly regulates the formal asylum process, which is based on protocols outlined in the United Nations Refugee Convention and other international instruments. According to the convention, asylum should be granted if an individual has a “well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality membership of a particular social group or political opinion and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.” <br> That is a strong test. It should therefore not be surprising that the vast majority of the applications we receive — 78 percent in 2011 — are rejected. <br> Snowden is not alone in his request for asylum in Ecuador. Ecuador received more than 1,000 asylum claims per month last year and hosts the largest population of refugees in Latin America. Asylum-seekers all over the world look to Ecuador because our constitution protects their rights and allows applicants to be integrated locally. We do not have refugee camps. <br> The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has praised Ecuador’s system, calling it an “example” for asylum-seekers in the region. It’s a system whose integrity relies on its protection from outside pressure and political manipulation. Human rights are non-negotiable, nor are they up for selective application. Ecuador’s sovereignty is unbreakable. The message to asylum-seekers worldwide is that they will have a fair hearing in Ecuador, and those whom we accept have met the highest international standards. <br> As President Rafael Correa told Vice President Joe Biden during their phone call, Ecuador will consult closely with the United States in weighing Snowden’s application, should he arrive on Ecuadorian soil. We value a close relationship with the American people: Nearly 2 million Ecuadoreans live in the United States, and we share nearly $20 billion in annual bilateral trade, including many products Americans hold dear, from roses to bananas to broccoli. This interaction provides mutual benefits in both countries — supporting small-business owners in the United States who depend on access to our high-quality products and empowering thousands of workers, many of whom are women heads of households, in Ecuador. <br> No matter the outcome of Snowden’s case, we hope and expect the relationship will endure. Our people are engaged in promoting and defending the same principles and values and share the same aspirations for democracy, peace and prosperity. But there must be equal treatment and a fundamental respect for the rights of all. <br> Nathalie Cely is Ecuador’s ambassador to the United States. 
The most important policy imperative in the world today is for the United States to balance its budget. Though the reasons we must do so are economic, the reasons we should are fundamentally moral. <br> Everything our republic means to our citizens, and everything America means to the world – friend and foe alike – depends on our ability to pay our bills and honor our debts. <br> The full faith and credit of the United States — on which depends our reputation and, ultimately, our security, prosperity and freedom — is at risk today as never before. In recent years, under presidents and Congresses of both parties, we have racked up yawning deficits and mushrooming debt that now pose a danger to America as we know it. <br> Without immediate action to control federal spending, deficits will continue to grow as a proportion of gross domestic product, and our accumulated national debt will soon reach world-destabilizing levels. <br> Washington can no longer afford to delude itself or the American people about the threat of the looming debt crisis. Our choice is no longer between a (seemingly) painless status quo and painful budget cuts. The status quo is crumbling. <br> Major credit agencies have already downgraded our once-untouchable credit rating. Europe, just a few years ahead of us on the path toward big government utopianism, is a fiscal basket case. Yet, even as our unreformed entitlement programs threaten our economic future, the Obama administration steams full speed ahead to implement another trillion-dollar entitlement we will never be able to afford: “Obamacare.” <br> Our course is unsustainable. The Congressional Budget Office has stated it can no longer make long-term budget estimates because our projected level of debt causes the computer models to break down somewhere in the 2040s. These trends aren’t those of a super power in decline, but a banana republic in the making – and a global economic anchor. <br> That’s why last year we co-sponsored a balanced budget amendment that would have, for the first time, not only forced Congress to get control of spending, but bound future Congresses to do the same. <br> We called on Congress to cut unnecessary, and unconstitutional, spending immediately, cap future spending in line with average historical revenues and send a balanced budget constitutional amendment to the states for ratification. <br> As Congress begins a new budget season, we stand by that call. 
President Hu Jintao of China is due in Washington on Wednesday, and both nations are hoping to put an end to recent acrimony. <br> This summit most likely will succeed in changing the tone of the relationship — at least for a time. The two powers may come to cooperate more deeply on North Korea, Iran, trade, climate change and a host of other issues that can only be tackled by the United States and China working together. <br> At base, however, Washington and Beijing have divergent ideas about how a great power should conduct itself in the 21st century. In that battle of ideas, China gets support from an unlikely corner: American neoconservatives. <br> China ducks international responsibility by citing its sovereignty. Neoconservatives unwittingly support that view when they insist the U.S. compromises its own sovereignty if it engages fully with today’s international institutions and abides by international laws. This sends Beijing a dangerous message: Stewardship of the international order is not the business of a great power. <br> In fact, a central object of U.S.-China policy for the past 40 years has been to encourage China to join the international system of norms, rules and institutions that Washington and its allies built after World War II. If Beijing joins these institutions and follows the rules, this logic goes, the U.S. will have little to fear from a strong and successful China. Better to have China in the tent, as the expression goes. <br> Indeed, China has come a long way, joining just about every international institution it could and working well within the system in a number of areas. It is a strong supporter of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, for example, and recently played a constructive role in addressing North Korea and Iran’s nuclear programs. <br> But in other areas — including human rights, global economic imbalances and maritime law — China has consistently rejected international norms and obligations. <br> China justifies its decisions to defy international standards, in part, by citing national sovereignty. Though its actions demonstrate more flexibility, China maintains a fierce rhetorical devotion to an absolutist, 19th-century view of countries as autonomous entities, free of interference from other nations or international institutions. <br> In fact, most Chinese analysts insist the whole concept of the international system and global governance is a Western attempt to undermine Beijing’s sovereignty. Awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to the jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo, one Chinese foreign ministry official asserted, was “a violation of China’s judicial sovereignty.” <br> Similarly, until the Cancun summit on climate change, a major sticking point in negotiations had been China’s refusal to allow international inspectors to verify reductions in its carbon-dioxide emissions. The head of its delegation at the Copenhagen summit had explicitly invoked sovereignty to explain that stance. <br> Chinese leaders also have stated that the value of China’s currency, the renminbi, is a sovereign issue for Beijing. Though other countries, notably the United States, suffer from its artificially low level. 
I’m amazed at how we have all gotten sucked into the health care debate over a “public option.” People, there is not going to be a public option. There was never going to be. That was just a red herring, created by Rahm Emanuel or someone else in the White House who likes to play mind games with those who lose their minds at the prospect. It’s a decoy; it’s not real. Get over it. <br> Between the lines of President Barack Obama’s health care speech last week before Congress, it was clear there will still be only one option: the insurance company option. Even those who had been allowed to take their chances with no coverage, particularly the young, will lose that option. They will be required to buy policies. The insurance giants will be swollen with even more billions in revenue. No wonder they have been playing ball with the White House. <br> What does the president, and what do we, get in return? <br> Insurance companies will not be allowed to deny coverage to those who have “pre-existing conditions.” <br> Be very careful about this one. After all the final secret deals are made, will the lobbyists have succeeded with slipping in language that permits the companies to still impose prohibitively higher rates? Will the proposed requirement that they cannot cancel a policy after someone gets sick contain a similar loophole that allows them to charge much more? <br> That’s it, folks. In a nutshell, that’s the Faustian deal. Do not expect “health care reform” to mean “insurance company reform.” Insurance companies will still, willy-nilly, deny payments to millions who have valid claims, knowing full well that they can wear down the hapless souls who dare challenge them, only to get lost in the maze of Audix messages, dropped calls and unhelpful bureaucrats. <br> They will still deny coverage for lifesaving procedures and medications they have arbitrarily designated as “unnecessary” or “experimental” or “cosmetic.” They will still make doctors’ practices such a living hell that many will refuse to be part of their networks. They will still do whatever they want, knowing they can get away with it, no matter how many lives are lost in the name of profits. <br> None of that will change. A public option is not possible in our country. It is consumed by the flames that erupt at the first mention of the word “socialism.” Even those who benefit from Medicare or Medicaid or Veterans Affairs care — public options, by the way — go bananas every time they hear the S-word. <br> We’ll have legislation, all right. It will be called “health care reform.” Then someone can explain how we can have “reform” without real change. <br> Bob Franken is a syndicated columnist and a frequent guest on MSNBC and other TV news networks.

Thomas J. Whalen, professor, Boston University “The real difference revealed in the Obama vs. Cheney public showdown is that the president is the true conservative of the two. He stands firmly for the rule of law and the sanctity of individual rights over those of the state. Cheney is the radical here. He would have Americans believe that public concerns involving the routine suspension of habeas corpus and the use of physical torture in prisoner interrogations are ‘utterly misplaced.’ In his mind, the ends justify the means. This kind of morally retrograde thinking may fly in a banana republic but not in the world’s oldest and most enduring representative democracy.” <br> Stephen Hess, Brookings Institution <br> “For all those who teach, study or simply care about rhetoric, Obama vs. Cheney is a classic lesson in swordplay: The saber challenges the epee. Two masters. Two totally different choices of weapons. The debate will be which was the most appropriate for this situation.” <br> Ross Baker, professor, Rutgers University <br> “Obama may be thinking philosophy, but Cheney is operating in the realm of tactics. Cheney is not so much interested in protecting the reputation of the Bush administration as he is in using a time-tested weapon on the Democrats: that they are undependable stewards of national security. It goes back at least as far as FDR, who was attacked for the sellout of Poland at Yalta and then again with Harry Truman and ‘Who lost China?’ Spiro Agnew summed it up with memorable eloquence when he accused Hubert Humphrey of being ‘squishy soft on communism.’ The national security issue has been an electrified third rail of American politics fully as much as Social Security has high-voltaged the GOP. Obama may be thinking philosophy, but Cheney is operating in the realm of tactics.” <br> Stephen M. Walt, professor, Harvard University <br> “The real difference? Simple. President Obama appealed to our sense of reason and our hopes for the future. I disagree with some of his conclusions, but it is refreshing to see a public official grapple with difficult issues in a sophisticated way. Cheney appealed to our sense of fear and counted on his listeners having forgotten what actually did and did not happen on his watch. Obama is encouraging us to live up to our highest ideals; Cheney wants us to base policy on our darkest instincts.” <br> David Boaz, executive vice president, Cato Institute “Obama is closer to Bush-Cheney than either side wants to admit, as Jack Goldsmith notes. He’s keeping a lot of Bush’s illiberal policies on detention, surveillance and habeas corpus. And perhaps unsurprisingly, President Obama seems decidedly less enthusiastic about rolling back the executive powers accumulated during the Bush years than candidate Obama did.” <br> Maria Cardona, Democratic strategist <br> “What’s the real difference? That’s simple. Everything. I know there have been numerous opinions written and expressed about how Obama is just continuing the same old policies of his predecessors, blah, blah, blah. The truth is, nothing could be further from the truth. President Obama and this administration have a fundamentally different way of looking at the world and of their treatment of the American public.” 
Have you heard the old joke about the old joke? <br> It goes something like this: An old guy runs for president. He makes fun of himself for being old. Everyone laughs. <br> Hi-yo! Kills every time. <br> Take John McCain. Please. <br> During this season’s finale of “Saturday Night Live,” McCain appeared in this campaign ad parody: “I ask you: What should we be looking for in our next president? Certainly, someone who is very, very, very old.” <br> Very old indeed — like the technique of using self-deprecating humor. And very effective. <br> The Arizona senator is hardly the only one making old McCain jabs. Everyone’s in on the joke. It’s the easiest material around. David Letterman: “I like John McCain. He looks like an old guy in a coffee shop who’s still complaining about the designated hitter.” Jay Leno: “John McCain is now crisscrossing the United States campaigning or, as they’re calling it, ‘Antique Roadshow.’” <br> But McCain — who would be 72 on Inauguration Day — is funniest with it, because it’s him telling the jokes. And acting the part. Earlier this year, a reporter sniffed: “Voters may reject you because they feel you’re too old to be president.” McCain’s response? He didn’t move for a second, pretending to be asleep. <br> Great gag. It reminded me of a real-life episode involving Ronald Reagan. In 1982, Reagan dozed off while posing for photographs in the Vatican with Pope John Paul II. That incident triggered an outbreak of jokes about Reagan’s age, already well-trodden territory. One of my favorites from the era went along these lines: I don’t mind Reagan taking naps during the day. But does he have to wear pajamas? <br> But Reagan then, like McCain now, reached for and grasped the mocking-yourself grail of modern presidency humor. <br> You remember this classic zinger at Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale’s expense during a 1984 debate: “I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” <br> Game, set, match, Reagan. <br> Of course, sometimes the self-deprecating humor doesn’t work. It just looks odd. Sen. Bob Dole never seemed to get anywhere with it, despite numerous tries during the 1996 presidential campaign, when he was 73. Maureen Dowd captured Dole this way: “He vows to ‘put Strom Thurmond on the ticket for age balance’ and says he follows the older man’s example at Capitol Hill receptions. ‘If he takes a shrimp, I take a shrimp. If he takes a banana, I take a banana.’” <br> The premise of sharing a banana experience with Thurmond certainly comes off as funny — but probably not in the way Dole intended. <br> No wonder Dole instead got skewered by President Bill Clinton’s skillful scalpel. Here’s Dole debating the then-50-year-old Clinton. <br> DOLE: Well, I think age is very — you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence. And if you have some of each, and have some age, some experience and some intelligence, that adds up to wisdom. <br> CLINTON: I can only tell you that I don’t think Sen. Dole is too old to be president. It’s the age of his ideas that I question. <br> Game, set, match, Clinton. 
The dust-up over junior Sen. Barack Obama's big slip on the foreign policy banana peel in the CNN/YouTube marketing venture debate and former first lady in chief Hillary Rodham Clinton's faux shock at Obama's comparing her to George W. Bush for her vote in favor of the Iraq war may have scored Clinton first-round points on who is best equipped to face off against the world's bad guys. But it might be Obama who is going to rope-a-dope in round three or four. <br> If the specter of years 2009 to 2017 of the Bush-Clinton dynasties continues to scare voters away from the inevitability of Clinton II, the stubbornness similarity between Hillary and Lil' Bush could add serious fuel to that fire while reminding Democrats of Clinton's pro-war vote. <br> Just a few months ago, the Achilles high heel of the senator from New York was her refusal to apologize to anti-war lefties for voting to authorize Bush's elective misadventure into Mesopotamia. <br> Like the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., the former resident just couldn't bring herself to admit she had ever done anything stupid with regard to authorizing the geographically misplaced attack on The Terrorists. She acted on the best intelligence she had at the time, the apparently brainwashed but ber-intelligent, foreign-policy-experienced Clinton protested in her unapologetic reaction to the Daily Kos-acks and others in the noninterventionist wing of the Democratic Party base. <br> Let's just move on, Sen. Clinton conveniently insisted, as she attempted to recast herself from tough Armed Services Committee warrior princess in 2003 to strong, have-it-both-ways feminist peacemaker in time to claim her rightful crown in 2008. (If you thought Annie Leibovitz had problems with Elizabeth of Windsor and her outfits, just picture poor Annie trying to deal with Her Majesty from Westchester and all the ideological wardrobe changes she's gone through.) <br> If I were Obama consultant David Axelrod -- or even the water boy in that corner of this slugfest -- I would be pounding away at Sen. Clinton's obstinacy as the best way to question the awesomely poor judgment she and so many other neo-con-lite Democrats in the Senate showed in writing a blank check for this misprojection of American military power. <br> I'm no foreign policy expert, just a humble teacher of college journalists, but I knew a WMD marketing ploy when I saw one. I recognized that Saddam Hussein was a two-bit thug like Charles Taylor of Liberia, not Osama bin Laden. And without a day in the United States -- or even the Illinois state -- Senate and having never attended a single World Affairs Council luncheon, I had read enough about the tribal culture of the Arab world to understand we couldn't spread individual-liberty-loving pluralistic democracy in a state where Islamists demand a rigid theocracy. <br> So why didn't a woman with all of that self-proclaimed international affairs wisdom know enough not to vote for this war? And why can't she bring herself to say she was wrong? <br> Were I Obama, who opposed the madness from the beginning, I would hammer Clinton from Manchester, N.H., to Des Moines, Iowa, and from Columbia, S.C., to Reno, Nev., with a demand to know why she isn't woman enough to humbly express regret for such amazing misjudgment. <br> Obama made a stupid mistake in not qualifying an otherwise sane acknowledgment that he'd be willing to talk with our enemies. But that error of omission in the heat of a piece of cable TV theater pales in comparison to Clinton's complicity in sending thousands of young Americans to their deaths in the desert. <br> A former Democratic National Committee press secretary, Terry Michael is director of the nonpartisan Washington Center for Politics Journalism and writes personal opinion at his libertarian Democrat blog .

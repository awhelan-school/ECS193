I recently returned from a medical mission to Guatemala organized by the John Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah. <br> I met the Hernandez brothers when they were kids. They were led into the examining room by their foster mother. Though they were blind, both boys still worked together to bring water from the river for their family in a small village in Guatemala. <br> I met them because of the humanitarian work of Bill and Judy Schwank. Bill was born in Guatemala and came to the U.S. to practice neurosurgery. His wife, Judy, is an attorney and longtime advocate for adoption. <br> On examination, I found that they had mature cataracts. Juan could see hand motion and Andres light perception only. I explained that the vision center in the brain must be stimulated before age of 7 or vision isn't possible-- even if the cataracts are removed. Our hope was that the cataracts were not mature at birth and that the boys had some vision at an early age. <br> I remember them well because the boys had never before seen running water and they somehow stopped the drain and left the water running-- a mini-disaster for the foster family. <br> The boys would be able to perform basic daily tasks and would be of use in the fields. <br> Periodically, Judy Schwank would give me updates on their new life with vision. <br> Fifteen years later, in 2014, I was on my way to Guatemala and the Schwanks had arranged for me to see the Hernandez brothers and Juli. <br> The Academy of Cataract and Refractive surgeons also helped to organize the trip and brought along a renowned surgeon from San Francisco -- David Chang, M.D. <br> Reuniting with the Hernandez brothers and Julie was a special experience for me. The Hernandez boys' vision was about the same. Though they desperately hoped for some new miracle, the vision center in their brain had not developed and nothing could be done to further improve their vision. <br> Operating with some of the most talented surgeons in the U.S. was an incredible experience. Not only was I able to reinforce my skills, but I also learned new techniques from the masters. <br> But nothing compares to emotions of post-op day one when we unveiled the patches. Huge smiles, tears, and praise to God were heard each morning. <br> While the medical team operated, my son Duncan joined another group to install a water purification system for a local school. Duncan said he wasn't sure the kids understood the significance of the water project, but they certainly liked the soccer balls he gave them. <br> It was very moving to witness a husband and wife see each other clearly for the first time in years. <br> I responded, de nada but it wasn't just nothing --the smiles on the faces of previously blind patients is priceless and a reward in and of itself that I will never forget.

Editor's note:The following column originally appeared inThe Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com. <br> “He’s just like he is on TV...He’s an a--hole, but he’s our a--hole.” <br> That’s how Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., recently described President Trump to a group of young Republicans, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. <br> The disparaging assessment of Trump’s character came days before the president gave his approval for ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). <br> Now Trump has those young people and their families in emotional turmoil. Their fears are climbing as Trump ramps up deportations and falsely demonizes immigrants as stealing jobs and hurting the economy. <br> Having set off so much fright, Trump then promised that none of the young people would be deported until March. He tweeted: “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!” <br> If he was sincere, Trump could have asked Congress to act while leaving the Obama rules in place. That would have avoided the current waves of desperation among 800,000 young people trying to do their best in school, on the job and in the military. <br> Talk about reducing people to political pawns. This must be the kind of behavior that Hunter had in mind with his insulting description of the president’s character. <br> However, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders added the president will only sign a new plan as part of comprehensive immigration reform. <br> As recently as July he dismissed the chances of Congress passing any immigration reform: “Our country and political forces are not ready yet,” he said. <br> The big problem is that a GOP effort at immigration reform failed in 2006 and a bipartisan effort failed in 2013. In both cases, conservative talk radio attacked reform as “amnesty” for lawbreakers. <br> Conservative columnist Ann Coulter, once one of Trump’s most enthusiastic supporters, lit into the president on Twitter. <br> While the right remains set against immigration reform, the president is hurting himself with mainstream voters. <br> According to the poll, support for allowing DACA kids to stay in the country is bipartisan: 84 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of Republicans want the young people here. <br> Writing in the Daily Beast, Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, similarly branded Trump’s DACA decision a “national disgrace” on the order of the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War and the refusal to admit Jewish refugees from the Holocaust. <br> I know how important that “noble idea” is to a child. I came to the U.S. as a four-year-old immigrant from Panama. <br> My sister graduated from Harvard; my brother has a law degree; and I’ve been able to write this column and best-selling books, and succeed in American media. <br> The DACA decision was announced before Trump accepted the first deal on the debt ceiling offered to him by Senate Democratic LeaderCharles Schumer(D-N.Y.) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Thursday released an estimate of the House Republican bill to fully repeal Obamacare. It found that doing so would increase the deficit by $230 billion. <br> 1. It reminds us of what we already knew. The health care law is full of budget gimmicks, and even if CBO is right about its fiscal impact, we can’t afford it because Uncle Sam is broke. <br> We can compare apples to apples by looking only look at the 2010-19 period in both estimates. Doing so, we see the new savings figure is almost identical to the old one: $145 billion, compared to $143 billion. <br> 4. CBO has warned us not to over-rely on its numbers for Obamacare. Back in March, the agency was extremely tentative in its prediction that passing Obamacare would produce any savings, and refused to make any specific prediction beyond the law’s first decade. In today’s estimate, CBO says, “The projections of the bill’s budgetary impact are quite uncertain and have a roughly equal chance of turning out to be too high or too low. <br> • CBO assumes only 19 million workers will be dumped by their employers into the government exchanges in 2019, when there will be 111 million workers in the pool of potential “dumpees.” Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former CBO director, thinks that’s way too optimistic. He predicts 35 million workers will be dumped. If so, it would add another trillion dollars to the law’s costs. <br> • Britain's National Health Service cost 38 percent more than projected in its first year. <br> • Medicare's kidney dialysis program, created in 1972, cost 2.3 times as much as projected in its first year. <br> (Source: Joint Economic Committee, Republican Staff, Are Health Care Reform Cost Estimates Reliable? July 31, 2009.) <br> If we did, we’d have a first-10-year cost of not $1.3 trillion but $9.1 trillion. Ah, you say, 700 percent seems outlandishly high (even though that’s what actually happened with Medicare). OK, fine, let’s assume the program will only cost twice the official estimate (200 percent). That would be a cost of $2.6 trillion, or an over-run of $1.3 trillion. Still seem too high? How about a 50-percent over-run ($1.95 trillion, $650 billion over budget). Still too high? <br> That, of course, would eliminate almost all of CBO's $145 billion in estimated savings. <br> Does anybody really believe Obamacare cost estimates will turn out to have been too high? <br> Dean Clancy Legislative Counsel and Vice President, Health Care Policy for the grassroots organization FreedomWorks

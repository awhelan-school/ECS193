Politicians and talking heads are doing their best to make us confused about gasoline prices. Here’s a little clarity. <br> “Supply” is the willingness to sell at a given gasoline price--which is determined by the ability to make a profit at a given price. “Demand” is the willingness of consumers to buy at a given gasoline price. <br> Secret 2: We get a great deal on gasoline. <br> But the reason gas prices can go up more rapidly than other prices is this: when demand for other goods goes up or supply goes down, it’s easy to substitute--you can buy apples if the price of oranges goes up. <br> Instead of being angry, why not be thankful we’re getting such a great deal? <br> Since oil companies are producing the best portable fuel on the market, without them we would have much higher transportation prices. <br> Secret 4: “Windfall” profits mean windfall savings in the future. <br> If gasoline was barely profitable at current prices, that would mean less investment and higher prices in the future. <br> The most promising substitute for gasoline may well be natural gas--whether compressed, liquefied, or diesel-ized natural gas--since gas is at incredibly low prices right now. <br> Why? Because you can't run from competition if the market is free. <br> Those speculators who “drive up” prices are really just fellow buyers and sellers of oil. <br> Good for them. The rising price is a signal that our government needs to end its interventionist ways. Why are we shooting the messenger instead of criticizing our government's policies? <br> There is no right price for portable fuel. There is only the price that reflects supply and demand. <br> In other words, 70s-style shortages. That means delays on moving everything, from food to medical supplies. Cheaper gasoline would be far more expensive in its consequences than today’s gasoline. <br> The only thing the government should do about gasoline prices is liberate energy production of every kind as quickly as possible, to maximize competition and lower prices. Instead, it is holding up drilling projects on the grounds that they will not immediately bring $2.50 gasoline. <br> Alex Epstein is the founder of the Center for Industrial Progress.

The past 11 weeks of the Trump administration have looked anything but normal, except for one thing: the nomination of judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. That announcement was rolled out with the traditional pomp by a President who followed the script, and a silver-haired nominee who spoke well and looked the part (insofar as such parts have always been cast with silver-haired white men). <br> But that's all that's been normal about any of this. And when things are not normal, you cannot behave as though they are. <br> That is why Senate Democrats were right to filibuster the nomination and reject it -- by 44 votes, which meant that Gorsuch failed to meet the 60-vote threshold to win the nomination. <br> That threshold no longer exists. Senator Mitch McConnell, predictably, led a GOP vote to change it to a simple majority confirming their nominee to the court. <br> The whole thing seemed inevitable, and many wondered: why didn't Dems keep their powder dry until it was really needed? <br> Because this time, it was really needed. Because "not crazy" should not be the new definition for "normal." <br> This is a Supreme Court seat. Gorsuch will likely be on the Court for decades, and influencing bedrock law and policy for even longer. And even though every step of that process has been overshadowed -- Comey! Nunes! Syria! -- it still deserves to be examined, and remembered, for just how not-normal it all was. <br> Follow the Dark Money: Gorsuch may not have talked much, but money sure does. <br> Each of these aberrations deserved further consideration by the Senate (and, it should be said, the media). Are they as bananas-nutty as Devin Nunes leaping out of his car to run to the White House for a cloak-and-dagger intel exchange? Obviously not. But when Nunes is a faded historical footnote, Gorsuch will still be on the Supreme Court determining the law of the land. <br> Gorsuch's SCOTUS appointment is for life. Dems were right to think of all the other lives that appointment will affect. And fight for them. That's the only normal any of us should be willing to accept.

Before we jump into a debate about the environmental costs of eating meat, here are three things you should know: <br> 1. I've experimented with vegetarianism twice, but it's never really stuck. Round one ended when I had a dream about a spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy's, and then woke up to march zombie-style to that fast-food restaurant to order it. Round two may or may not have ended with the brunch I had Sunday, I'm still not sure. <br> 2. I ate chicken chilaquiles for brunch on Sunday. It was delicious. <br> Therefore, 3. This is not an anti-meat polemic. <br> "(S)omeone who regularly eats factory-farmed animal products cannot call himself an environmentalist without divorcing that word from its meaning," he wrote in that book. <br> Since it's Earth Day, I thought that last point might merit some dissection. Is it possible to eat meat in modern-day America, consider yourself an environmentalist and sleep soundly without being a hypocrite? Or, as Foer argues, are those terms increasingly incongruous? <br> Animal rights aside, there are plenty to consider. Here are a few: <br> At a time when rivers in the American Southwest are running dry because of drought and climate change, it's worth considering the impact our eating habits have on water use. <br> It's fallen slightly since then, which is good news. <br> I travel frequently, and value flexibility, so I've never really wanted to be too strict about my diet in the long term. But one day? One week? One month? It's not that hard. <br> To the minority of vegans and vegetarians who like to proselytize about their eating habits, I'm sure that seems like an annoying cop-out. But there are plenty of environmentalists who advocate a middle-road approach to meat consumption. <br> "Certainly there are modest steps we can all take that can really have a significant benefit if a lot of people did them," said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at NRDC, the environmental group. "We often fall into this mistaken all-or-nothing mentality." <br> I like that approach. It's one more people are likely to stomach. <br> And it's one that -- even for a day -- can have real impact.

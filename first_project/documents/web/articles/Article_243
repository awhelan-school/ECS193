No one in his right mind would buy a television set that lets you watch only the channels that the manufacturer selects. In any case, the All-Channel Receiver Act of 1962 guarantees that no such sets are for sale. <br> But if you want to buy a cell phone that is guaranteed to work with whichever provider offers you the best deal, you are probably out of luck. <br> If you live in North America, it is impractical to buy an “unlocked” phone and hope it works with a wireless carrier of your choice. Nearly all of us buy a “locked” cell phone directly from a carrier. The Apple iPhone, for example, works only on ATT’s slower network — a sore point among consumers who would prefer to have an “open” phone. <br> Now the Federal Communications Commission, with a potentially valuable tool in hand, wants to shake up this cozy structure. The agency’s tool is a bill President Bush has signed into law that requires commercial broadcasters to digitize all 1,800 U.S. high-powered TV signals no later than 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 17, 2009. <br> Since nearly all of us have cell phones and televisions, we need to be more aware of an immensely important battle, involving huge legal and lobbying resources, that’s about to take place out of public view. <br> The government will reclaim a whopping 108 megahertz of spectrum in the transition. Public safety workers will be taken care of for free. <br> The FCC wants to lease the rest to the highest bidders in an anonymous auction next January. If it works out, experts say the swap may be worth as much as $20 billion. For one choice piece, known as “C Block,” the FCC has set a reserve price of $4.6 billion. <br> Enter Google, which maintains the lack of unified open standards in North America stunts the growth of handheld technologies. The search engine that has become a household verb proposes to meet the FCC’s reserve price and gobble up C Block — so long as the regulators open the spectrum to any application and any device that consumers select. <br> What’s more, Google says, this third-party software and hardware must work with whatever wireless network service users prefer.

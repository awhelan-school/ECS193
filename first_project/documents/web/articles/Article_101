It's not what we don't know that causes us trouble. It's what we know that isn't so. Whichever famous writer said that (it's been attributed to many), what he said carries truth. <br> Michael Pollan, the prolific food author and activist, wrote in The New York Times that what was once a solar-powered ruminant [a grass-fed steer] [has been turned] into the very last thing we need: another fossil-fuel machine. How so? Farmers burn fossil fuels to ship corn to feed cows instead of letting them eat what's naturally under their feet. <br> People believe. -- Nobody likes the idea of cattle jammed into feed lots. <br> Free roaming. <br> Free-roaming grass-fed cows, because you've got happy cows. <br> It's logical to think that grass-fed steers might be better for the environment, but so often, what sounds logical is just wrong. <br> Capper said: There's a perception out there that grass- fed animals are frolicking in the sunshine, kicking their heels up full of joy and pleasure. What we actually found was from the land-use basis, from the energy, from water, and, particularly, based on the carbon footprints, grass-fed is far worse than corn-fed. <br> Simply because they have a far lower efficiency, far lower productivity. The animals take 23 months to grow. (Corn-fed cattle need only 15.) That's extra eight extra months of feed, of water, land use, obviously, and also an awful lot of waste. If we have a grass-fed animal, compared to a corn-fed animal, that's like adding almost one car to the road for every single animal. That's a huge increase in carbon footprints. <br> Absolutely right, Capper said. Every single day, they need feed, they need water, and they give off methane nitrous oxide -- very potent greenhouse gases that do damage. <br> There is absolutely no scientific evidence based on that. <br> But what about those hormones the cows are given? Surely that cannot be good for us. <br> So the next time you reach for that package of beef in the grocery store tagged with all the latest grass-fed, free-range lingo, remember: Not only does it often cost twice as much, but there's no evidence it's better for the environment or better for you. <br> John Stossel is host of Stossel on the Fox Business Network.

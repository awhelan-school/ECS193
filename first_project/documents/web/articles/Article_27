Yep, you read that right. <br> Half of the world's vertebrate animal populations are gone. <br> That's mind-blowingly infuriating. <br> And it's worse for some species and regions, in particular. <br> The report overall considers 10,380 populations of 3,038 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, and says populations have declined by 52% between 1970 and 2010. <br> But for freshwater fish and other species, the drop is 76%. And for for species in the Neotropics, which includes Central and South America, the decline is 83%. <br> Just wow. <br> Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF, writes that, "This has to make us stop and think." He's correct, of course. But we can't stop at the thinking. We need prompt, dramatic action. <br> All that, and we must take swift action to curb carbon pollution. <br> "Climate change has already been linked to the population decline and possible extinction of a number of amphibian species in the Neotropics and in Australia," the Living Planet Report says. "In the Arctic, the effects of a rapidly warming climate have been suggested as likely causes of decline in body condition and numbers in many polar bear and caribou populations." <br> This stuff is depressing, but the report does offer signs of hope. <br> It relays a case study from Belize, for example, which started estimating the financial value of protecting ecological resources, particularly those along the coast. "Belize's coastal and ocean ecosystems provide services worth up to $559 million per year -- equivalent to 43% of GDP," the report says. Facts like that make it clear why there's a financial as well as moral incentive to protect our remaining natural resources. <br> The authors cite wind farms in Denmark as another success. <br> "December 2013 marked a significant milestone, when wind power provided an equivalent of 57.4% of Denmark's electricity consumption -- the first time ever that wind power supplied more than half of a country's electricity needs for a whole month. December 21 set another record, with wind turbines generating the equivalent of 102% of Danish electricity consumption," the authors write. <br> But things aren't as bad as the WWF report makes it sound, he said. <br> "Overall, there is no question that the status of biodiversity is going down -- that things are not improving," he told me. "That said, I'm not a fan of this Living Planet Index. The reason is it sort of mixes up apples and oranges and lots of other fruit, too, for that manner. It's a little difficult to unpack exactly what it means. There are many people in the media who assumed it means 50% of species have gone extinct in the last 40 years -- and that's not true." Instead, the report claims 50% of some vertebrate populations have disappeared. But a single species could still exist with a smaller population size. <br> Assessing individual ecosystems and species is more useful, he said. <br> The risk of considering so many species -- and so many types of data -- in a single report, Pimm said, is that it can make action seem impossible. <br> And, for him and others, that's not the case. <br> There's much to be done. <br> We can set aside protected habitats, put firm caps on carbon emissions, break up gangs that trade in illegal wildlife parts and continue to fund scientific exploration to ensure their safety and continued viability. <br> We should move urgently in that direction. <br> The point is that we know which direction to move in. <br> It's bad out there, but it's sure not hopeless. <br> This report -- and a host of others -- shouldn't be a total downer. They should be read as a clarion call for action.

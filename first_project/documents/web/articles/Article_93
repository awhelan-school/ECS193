Did you see President Obama's new 2013 budget? It's filled with $1.5 trillion in tax increases for the rich. <br> The reality is taxes are not low at all. If you think they are, you've either been brainwashed, or you aren't paying taxes. The truth is: The taxes are too damn high.We do have a serious problem in this country. But it's not a tax problem. It is a spending problem. <br> Government is a spending addict and needs rehab. If you don't believe me, look at Europe. <br> Yet President Obama continues to claim in every speech that taxes on the rich are too low and we therefore desperately need to raise taxes. <br> Let’s examine the bold faced lies of Obama and the left, who try to justify tax increases on the rich on a daily basis:First, Obama quotes the dollars earned by the top 1% of income earners to prove that “the rich” are making too much and being taxed too little. That’s sleight of hand. <br> How can you use billion dollar stock gains, or $100 million hedge fund incomes, or $20 million Wall Street bonuses, to justify raising taxes on a small businessman who makes $250,000 to $500,000 per year by working 16 hours a day? <br> President Obama is comparing these individuals to billionaires who share the same tax bracket. Mr. Obama claims that everyone in the top 1% tax bracket is making too much, and paying too little in taxes. <br> Separate from federal income tax rates, U.S. taxpayers now pay the highest FICA and Medicare tax rates ever; the highest state, local and property taxes ever; the highest sales taxes ever; and the second highest business income taxes in the industrialized world. <br> Therefore quoting higher rates is a distortion of the truth. A tax rate of 70% from decades ago might actually be lower than today's rates once you include these factors. <br> Fourth, Obama constantly reports that tax rates were once much higher. Another distortion. <br> Only one man in the entire United States of America paid a penny at that rate in 1935: John D. Rockefeller. <br> But he quotes robber baron” rates to sell his bait and switch scheme. In the private sector you face civil or criminal charges for misleading investors like that.President Obama also purposely leaves out a very important fact -- that only in the last 30 years have we moved away from a cash economy. <br> Does anyone- including President Obama -- believe that restaurant owners, bar owners, or retailers paid huge taxes on their cash incomes 30 years ago? <br> If President Obama got his way federal income taxes would hit 40% or higher. And he'd take the cap off FICA taxes. And he'd dramatically reduce or eliminate mortgage, charitable and business deductions. And then just for fun, he'd add a national VAT tax. Now add in the new taxes for ObamaCare. Add it up. <br> Our government is heavily in debt, and Obama needs to find targets of opportunity (i.e. victims) to pay the bills, so America doesn’t go bankrupt on his watch. <br> Third, by targeting, demonizing and punishing small business owners and high-income earners (the people who make almost all the contributions to conservative causes and candidates), Mr. Obama can starve his political opposition. If taxes are higher on the rich, then the president's opposition has no money left to give to conservative candidates. <br> Mr. Obama's plan is is the polar opposite: to raise taxes dramatically on the rich, so he can feed the beast of big government, and at the same time, starve his political opposition.

Rep. Mike Honda
The reorganization of President Barack Obama’s economic team is exactly what’s needed now. <br> All groups benefit from periodic renewal and the fresh perspective it brings. The president’s timing is perfect. We are turning a crucial corner in our recovery from the unmitigated disaster of the Bush-GOP economic meltdown. <br> Thanks to the Obama administration’s previous economic team and the Democratic Congress these past two years, we have staved off a second Great Depression. Job losses seem to have plateaued, and unemployment is beginning to slow. <br> The team’s task now will be to institute policies that lead to a dynamic high-growth economy, placing us at the forefront globally. <br> The president was absolutely right in his State of the Union address to cite American innovation as a key area for investment. His challenge to scientists and engineers to invent clean energy technologies is an ideal example of effective leveraging of limited federal dollars to produce big results. <br> When Obama’s new team devises a game plan to spur innovation, however, it is critical that these advisers do not overlook the challenges of “scaling up” — the process by which innovation is brought to the market. <br> Policies that favor scaling up domestically, as opposed to overseas, are essential to ensuring that American ingenuity generates U.S. jobs — not just a high Dow Jones Industrial Average. <br> Representing Silicon Valley in Congress, I have seen the price Americans pay when scaling up occurs overseas. It undermines our domestic manufacturing. <br> Apple Computer, for example, has long been a darling of the stock market, with good reason. Its innovative products have consistently led the technology market. Apple changed the way we listen to music, use our cell phones and look at e-mail and other media.

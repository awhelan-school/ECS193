Here's a look at the intersection of the business of sports and business by Rick Horrow and Brian Finkel of Horrow Sports Ventures. <br> As NFL fans eagerly flocked back to their big screen TVs on yesterday, so too did advertisers. The league is seeing some of the heaviest activation around NFL football in many seasons, with ESPN providing one of its biggest platforms. <br> NBC, the NFL’s partner for “Football Night in America” every Sunday, is certainly not left out in the cold. The network announced that it has just five spots left for February’s Super Bowl broadcast, despite a record price tag of $3.5 million on average for a 30-second spot. Last season’s game on Fox averaged $3.0 million per spot, but did not sell out until late October. <br> We know the U.S. Open means millions of dollars for the greater New York economy, but how much might shock you. According to a study a commissioned and released by the USTA, the U.S. Open generates $750 million in annual economic impact for New York. The total dwarfs the projected $550 million the 2014 Super Bowl could bring to the region, though it isn’t exactly apples-to-apples when comparing a two-week tournament to a one-night game. The Open’s economic impact was last measured at $420 million in 2001. <br> League TV Networks <br> NFL Network grew to 60 million subscribers this summer signing a carriage agreement with Charter Communications. The network now is on seven of the top eight U.S. TV providers. League officials continue negotiating with Time Warner Cable, which could increase NFL Network’s carriage by another 12.5 million households. <br> League Sponsorship Deals <br> In the NBA, the league signed Sprint Nextel to a four-year, $250 million sponsorship deal despite the ongoing lockout. Sprint reportedly is paying 15-20% more than the league’s previous wireless sponsor T-Mobile did. Sprint subsidiary Boost Mobile recently signed a big sponsorship with the WNBA. <br> Rick Horrow is the Sports Professor, and is the Sports Business Analyst for Fox Sports.

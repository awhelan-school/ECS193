Beyoncé sure knows how to get our attention. <br> She's done it again and again with her culture-stopping music, videos and and performances. <br> Predictably, the Internet went bananas. Her post zoomed to most-liked-ever status inside a day. Twitter was beside itself with bee emojis and "YASSS QUEEEN" updates. The joy was palpable. <br> Joy -- and relief. Because, man did we ever need some good news. <br> That was the theme of her photo collection. Called "I Have Three Hearts," it was paired with a poem of the same name by the Somalian poet Warsan Shire, who also wrote the poetry in Lemonade -- and who, I guess, would not be allowed to enter the United States. <br> It reads: "There's life growing inside of me and I'm beside myself with dreams." In a real and visceral way, Beyoncé has reminded us that even in times that feel broken, we are vessels of power and glory and hope. <br> Flowers grow wherever. When the books are written about this period in time, I believe that will be an enduring theme -- the hope that sprang up out of the chaos, and the real and visceral good that it created. Beyoncé just named it. Creators gonna create.

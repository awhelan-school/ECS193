At the White House male staffers earn more on average than female staffers. That is not news. <br> However, it is ammunition for those looking to take a shot at President Donald Trump using the charge that this administration doesn’t care about women. But a closer look at the White House wage gap reveals that the Trump Administration – like other recent administrations – pays women fairly. <br> CNN decided to analyze this year’s White House salary data (a curious decision since they had not analyzed the previous administration’s staff data). They found that the average salary among male staff was nearly $104,000 compared to $83,000 for female staff. The Trump White House pays women 80 cents for every dollar they pay men. What’s worse, this is 2 cents bigger than the reported national average pay gap. <br> According to analysis by the Washington Post in 2009, women earned $72,700 on average and men earned $82,000. By 2014, both men and women earned about $6,000 more on average, but a $10,000 gap persisted ($78,400 for women and $88,600 for men). By President Obama’s final year in office, all salaries had declined on average ($76,928 for men and $68,658 for women), and the gap remained. <br> Men earned more working under other Democrats as well. Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, Senate office, and the Clinton Foundation all had gender pay differences. Michelle Obama’s White House office paid men significantly more as well. <br> Calculating averages conceals the nuances of the pay at the White House and in the workforce at large. The White House data don’t show that men and women working in the same jobs are getting unequal pay. They do show that there are more men working in higher-paying positions. An apples-to-apples comparison of positions at the Trump White House confirms what previous White Houses have said: there is equal pay for equal work. <br> When the Department of Labor controlled for other factors such as occupation, the number of hours women and men work, and the time women they take off from the workforce, the difference in pay shrinks to a few cents.

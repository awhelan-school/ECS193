Lisa Belkin, chief national correspondent for Yahoo News and former New York Times correspondent, wrote this week that 29 years ago, Donald Trump made a pass at her at a party in New York. <br> Is this relevant to Trump’s suitability as president, she asks rhetorically, and answers with a resounding, “of course it is. “The argument to the contrary —which comes down to ‘but everyone from Jack Kennedy to Bill Clinton’s 'cherished’ women”— is specious.’” <br> “[Trump’s] I’m-rubber-you’re-glue approach to bad behavior around women has a few weak spots, however. First, two clear wrongs don’t make anything right. Second, Bill Clinton is not running for president. And, finally, times have changed. What Bill Clinton did was clearly unacceptable at the time, but it is even less acceptable now, an ironic legacy of his behavior.” <br> Take a look. <br> We all learned that saying in second grade. At the same time we learned that two rotten apples and an overly fresh orange don’t make three oranges. <br> 2. Bill Clinton isn't running for president. <br> 3. If Belkin's changing times, changing mores argument means anything, it is a defense of Trump, not an indictment. <br> 3.5 Chief correspondent Belkin did not mention, by the way, that when The Donald attempted to hit on her, he was a Democrat.

It’s just one presidential election cycle later, but the Swift Boat campaign that helped the Republicans sink Democratic nominee John F. Kerry in 2004 seems outdated in its chosen medium: television. <br> The dominance of the 30-second television ad may have peaked then, as the past three years have seen the action shift from the airwaves to cyberspace. <br> YouTube famously helped turn Virginia’s 2006 Senate race against Republican incumbent George Allen; his “macaca” comment helped cost his party control of that chamber. <br> So-called new media and virtual outreach are an increasing force in today’s political world, to the point that entire presidential debates are based around this rapidly growing medium. <br> All the major presidential candidates have tapped into social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook and LinkedIn in an effort to reach new voters. <br> Both Yahoo and YouTube (now a part of Google) have challenged the stale debate model. <br> Yahoo’s “mashup” format lets users pick an issue and a candidate and compare responses. <br> The questions in the YouTube-sponsored debate came from free-form videos submitted online. <br> Google and Apple lend their respective technological support to GenerationEngage, the civic engagement effort I co-founded. <br> Cell phones and viral video are further decentralizing political communication. <br> Independent political commentators are crashing the party, challenging the managed message of the traditional campaign. <br> Home-cooked videos such as “Obama Girl” and “Hillary 1984” have been as effective, if not more so, as the campaigns’ own productions. <br> Many candidates are giving in to this diffusion of influence. <br> The bloggers that were once independent commentators are now working for the political machine they once assessed — and often harassed — from the outside. <br> Yet while online outreach may be a necessary piece of the modern campaign, it is certainly not sufficient. Sure, YouTube (with the help of Allen) introduced macaca into the political lexicon and propelled Democrat Jim Webb to victory. <br> But that 2006 election also showed the limits of new media: The blogosphere could power Ned Lamont to an upset in the Connecticut Democratic primary, but incumbent Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman still won the general election handily as an independent. <br> And Howard Dean’s Netroots campaign generated drastically more buzz than votes in the race for the 2004 Democratic nomination. <br> The question is not whether these tools will continue to play a role in politics — they clearly will help shape political strategy and civic engagement, and increasingly so. <br> But whether they actually improve our democracy is an open question. <br> So far, Politics 2.0 has been as much about gimmickry and gaffes as it has been about raising the level of debate in this country. <br> But there is an opportunity for innovation to be a positive force in U.S. politics. <br> From blogs to social networking to file sharing, new participants — many of them young people who had previously been nonparticipants — are pushing the envelope of these tools for political outreach and communication. <br> With more and more people self-organizing and sharing information, the most effective campaigns will be driven by peer-to-peer mobilizations, autonomous and unbound by poll-tested stagecraft. <br> The financial markets were overcome with a comparable fascination with the power of the Internet during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. <br> To avoid a similar bust, perhaps there are lessons to be drawn. <br> Just as clicks and eyeballs were no substitute for profits, Facebook “friends” do not necessarily equal votes. <br> And virtual connections cannot take the place of actual contact with candidates. <br> The Internet has changed how politics is played. <br> But it cannot — and should not — change what political outreach should be about. That is education on the issues and vigorous assessment of candidates proposing to advocate for voters. <br> Technology should supplement the modern campaign, not take its place. If technological advances help produce more voters with more access to information, then our democracy will have made progress. <br> But, as old-fashioned as it may be, casting your vote on Election Day will remain the most important form of political participation. <br> Devin Talbott is co-founder and chairman of GenerationEngage, a grass-roots youth civic engagement effort.

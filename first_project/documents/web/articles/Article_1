Despite long and detailed lists of the obvious benefits of diversity, those two words, inclusion rider, could revolutionize Hollywood and transform all of America -- because we have a national problem that spans far beyond the red carpet. <br> This is where inclusion riders of all shapes and forms come in. As a nation we need to lift each other up. We need to understand that if one of us can't rise, all of us are kept down. <br> This is similar to what inclusion riders can do by having one person, the person with pay privilege, demand that others should be included, represented and paid fairly. But doing this individually won't solve all our problems. To state the obvious: This won't fully work if only women step forward. People of all genders in Hollywood should be using inclusion riders. <br> It also won't work if only Hollywood moves toward fair pay and inclusion. <br> After all, it's not just women in Hollywood who need a lift. Women across America would be better off if we were all treated, paid, hired and promoted fairly. <br> We have a situation. <br> Too many women are being excluded from fair pay and representation to the tune of billions of dollars. <br> But the examples don't stop there. <br> Quite simply, women are being excluded from economic security on more than one level. Improving inclusion while addressing wealth inequality will be crucial in the years to come. The need for universal protections and benefits that stay with the worker instead of being tied to a specific workplace, which everyone -- at every wage level -- can access, is becoming increasingly urgent. <br> But women don't. <br> So in honor of International Women's Day, on Thursday, we need people of all genders to stand up -- whether they stand on a red carpet or on a regular floor -- and demand inclusion and equity for each and every person in our nation.

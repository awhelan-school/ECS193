Republicans tried to manufacture a controversy out of first lady Michelle Obama’s trip with her daughter Sasha to Spain. But national attention should not be diverted from the monthlong vacation that Congress is set to take, even as the struggles of working families in today’s troubled economy remain unaddressed. <br> This summer, Congress is due to join nearly 15 million men and women who also have August off from work — including the 6.6 million who have had 27 weeks or more off from their jobs. And they didn’t even ask for it. <br> Why? Because they’re unemployed. And for workers lucky enough to have jobs, the outlook this August isn’t much sunnier. <br> Unlike Congress, more than 25 percent of employees receive no paid vacation time. For young workers, the statistics are even worse. <br> And wages? From 2000 to 2009, median weekly wages actually fell for high school and college graduates, according to the Economic Policy Institute. With stagnant or falling earnings and an uncertain financial future, few can afford to take unpaid time off this summer. <br> So who, besides Congress, is enjoying summer vacation? You guessed it: Wall Street. <br> Companies are raking in record profits, with the top 500 nonfinancial firms sitting on nearly a trillion dollars in cash as of the second quarter. But instead of doing their fair share to bring us out of this recession — a recession that Wall Street’s recklessness helped create in the first place — many businesses are taking advantage of the economic climate to squeeze workers for more hours with less pay. <br> Take Mott’s, for example. The juice and applesauce manufacturer earned $555 million last year, and its parent company, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, has seen its stock rise a whopping 180 percent since March 2009. Rather than reward the employees at its Williamson, N.Y., plant for their hard work, however, Mott’s decided to slash wages and benefits. <br> In May, Mott’s workers took a stand and declared a strike. But instead of bargaining with its workers, Mott’s has opted to leave them — and hundreds of New York apple farmers — in jeopardy, without a fair contract. The standoff continues. <br> Sadly, Mott’s is by no means the only company using such tactics to take full advantage of today’s harsh economic landscape.

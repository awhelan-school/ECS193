 What POLITICO described as “ Tech firms behaving badly” (April 23) could more accurately be described as “regulators gone wild.” <br> For whatever reason, the Obama administration is using ambiguous antitrust laws as a club against America’s top technology companies who are trying to serve consumer needs. We need some introspection when ATT pays $4 billion to a foreign company because our government surprisingly nixes a merger, and our Justice Department sues Apple for providing consumers with cheaper eBooks and accuses Google of “monopolizing” the highly competitive world of search. <br> These are just some in a long line of misguided attacks on successful technology firms (see Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm, etc.) and further evidence of misplaced priorities in Washington. <br> The rest of the world envies our tech prowess even as our own government leads the attack on these same world-class firms. This is national economic suicide. We need first to do no harm to our own national competitiveness, rather than lead the world in attacks on our best companies. <br> Gary Shapiro <br> President and Chief Executive Officer <br> Consumer Electronics Association

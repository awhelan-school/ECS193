The motive in Goforth's death has not been determined, but according to the Harris County sheriff, the killing was linked to the broader national conversation about police shootings of African-Americans --sometimes armed and sometimes unarmed. <br> The police community was hit as hard by this disgusting act as the journalism community was by the WDBJ-TV killings last week. Let's acknowledge that. Violence is out of control, and I agree with the sheriff that "#livesmatter." It is time to drop any other descriptive adjectives -- journalists' lives matter, black lives matter, police lives matter, every single life matters. <br> If you don't believe me, just ask Kathleen Goforth, the widow who says she was "lucky to have him" or ask Andy Parker, the grieving father who lost his daughter Alison in the WDBJ shootings, or ask the families of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Michael Brown or any of the other countless surviving family members of human beings who have lost their lives due to violence. <br> Not all violence is criminal -- but all violence is violent and all pain is pain and all suffering is suffering. Life is precious and life matters. Life is short enough as it is so let's allow each other to live, because life matters.

It isn't hard to see why. Not only do the menacing fans, who were in the French capital to watch their team play Paris Saint-Germain, gruffly prevent the man from boarding the Metro; they then start to chant: "We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it!" <br> To behave in a racist fashion is bad enough; to boast of being racist takes things to a whole other level of wrongness. <br> So it's not surprising that everyone from the French press to FIFA -- the Federation Internationale de Football Association -- has condemned the men's behavior, and that the video of the alarming episode is trending on Twitter, accompanied by outraged hashtags. <br> Yet while it is right to find the conduct of these fans nauseating, it is wrong to hold this incident up as Exhibit A in a show trial of British soccer more broadly. <br> Sadly, that is what is happening. Many observers are using this incident as hard evidence that British soccer remains an unreconstructed backwater, a sport stuck in a past, malign time, followed by prejudiced people. But actually, soccer isn't like that anymore. <br> These shrill responses to one ugly incident do a grave disservice to both soccer and the millions of good people -- men, women and children of all races -- who follow it. <br> The truth is that racism and violence at British soccer games, which were big problems in the past, have thankfully become rarer and rarer. <br> As the number of black players increased, so the disgusting behavior of some fans of the past has declined. <br> We should not condemn an entire sport and its millions of followers on the basis of what a tiny number of men did and said on a train in Paris. <br> In fact, to do so is to promote another kind of prejudice, a view of the largely white working-class fans of soccer as uncouth, stupid, unenlightened. One commentary piece used the word Neanderthal to describe fans. <br> That's the great irony of much of the outrage over the Chelsea fans' terrible behavior: In seeking to expose the alleged prejudices of the soccer family, many observers end up exposing their own.

Despite some bad apples, the United States is not a corrupt country. Among more than 180 other nations, the U.S. ranks in the top 15 percent of government cleanliness, according to the 2011 Corruption Perception survey. <br> So we have the absurd case of members from the Federal Communications Commission trying to meet their counterparts from Canada, Europe and Asia by standing outside the perimeter of our cocktail party so they do not violate the presidentâ€™s order. Silly but true. <br> President Obama rails against lobbyists, except of course union lobbyists. True to his word, I have not been in the White House since the waning days of President Bush. Yet, a recent report notes that those with relatives in the White House formed a new trade association so business members could access Obama officials. How is that advancing ethical government?These examples cry out for some common sense in ethics laws.On the state level, Virginia is a great example of a government that has found the right balance. It tops several surveys as a business-friendly environment, has low unemployment and has almost no recent cases of corruption. <br> Meanwhile, other countries continue to foster a healthy relationship between government and business, one where each side learns from the other.

Gov. Jan Brewer
If there is one group that best represents the need for high, consistent educational standards in our public schools today, it is the military family. <br> Military families, like others, want their children to have the best education possible. But consider this fact: Military families move an average of six to nine times throughout a child’s K-12 life. That’s a new school every year and a half to two years. <br> Having grown up on a military base, I know this places significant stress on military children. <br> If moving was not bad enough, military families know the quality of the public schools surrounding our bases is extremely uneven. This makes the strain even worse. After all, no one wants to send their kids to a bad school. <br> Fortunately, the military has heard these concerns. Now, the branches are starting to do something about them. <br> For example, say a child receives a passing grade in algebra in Arizona. If the family moves to Georgia, the Compact ensures the student doesn't have to retake the class. The Compact finally went into effect in all 50 states in January 2015. <br> At apressevent with militaryfamilies,Odierno was asked what local politicians could do to keep military bases open. He responded, “[T]hey better start paying attention to the schools thatareoutside and inside our installations. Because as we evaluate and we make decisions on future force structure, that will be one of the criteria.” <br> Thestudy had one major conclusion. Itfound that since every state uses different standards, it was impossible to compare the schools across borders. In short, you couldn't compare Arizona's nine schools with those in Texas or any other state. <br> The Common Core lays out a path that ensures students gain the knowledge and educational skills necessary to succeed in college, career and life. It also allows for apples-to-apples comparisons of school performance across state borders.

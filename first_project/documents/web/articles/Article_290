Have you heard the old joke about the old joke? <br> It goes something like this: An old guy runs for president. He makes fun of himself for being old. Everyone laughs. <br> Hi-yo! Kills every time. <br> Take John McCain. Please. <br> During this season’s finale of “Saturday Night Live,” McCain appeared in this campaign ad parody: “I ask you: What should we be looking for in our next president? Certainly, someone who is very, very, very old.” <br> Very old indeed — like the technique of using self-deprecating humor. And very effective. <br> The Arizona senator is hardly the only one making old McCain jabs. Everyone’s in on the joke. It’s the easiest material around. David Letterman: “I like John McCain. He looks like an old guy in a coffee shop who’s still complaining about the designated hitter.” Jay Leno: “John McCain is now crisscrossing the United States campaigning or, as they’re calling it, ‘Antique Roadshow.’” <br> But McCain — who would be 72 on Inauguration Day — is funniest with it, because it’s him telling the jokes. And acting the part. Earlier this year, a reporter sniffed: “Voters may reject you because they feel you’re too old to be president.” McCain’s response? He didn’t move for a second, pretending to be asleep. <br> Great gag. It reminded me of a real-life episode involving Ronald Reagan. In 1982, Reagan dozed off while posing for photographs in the Vatican with Pope John Paul II. That incident triggered an outbreak of jokes about Reagan’s age, already well-trodden territory. One of my favorites from the era went along these lines: I don’t mind Reagan taking naps during the day. But does he have to wear pajamas? <br> But Reagan then, like McCain now, reached for and grasped the mocking-yourself grail of modern presidency humor. <br> You remember this classic zinger at Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale’s expense during a 1984 debate: “I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” <br> Game, set, match, Reagan. <br> Of course, sometimes the self-deprecating humor doesn’t work. It just looks odd. Sen. Bob Dole never seemed to get anywhere with it, despite numerous tries during the 1996 presidential campaign, when he was 73. Maureen Dowd captured Dole this way: “He vows to ‘put Strom Thurmond on the ticket for age balance’ and says he follows the older man’s example at Capitol Hill receptions. ‘If he takes a shrimp, I take a shrimp. If he takes a banana, I take a banana.’” <br> The premise of sharing a banana experience with Thurmond certainly comes off as funny — but probably not in the way Dole intended. <br> No wonder Dole instead got skewered by President Bill Clinton’s skillful scalpel. Here’s Dole debating the then-50-year-old Clinton. <br> DOLE: Well, I think age is very — you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence. And if you have some of each, and have some age, some experience and some intelligence, that adds up to wisdom. <br> CLINTON: I can only tell you that I don’t think Sen. Dole is too old to be president. It’s the age of his ideas that I question. <br> Game, set, match, Clinton.

Look at recent polls asking American voters about the 2012 the presidential race. They are all over the place. Some have President Obama ahead of Mitt Romney out beyond the margin of error– Fox News, AP and Reuters. Other pollsters – Rasmussen and CBS/New York Times – have Romney slightly ahead but within the margin of error. <br> Well, some polls, like Gallup, survey only registered voters. Some, like Rasmussen, poll only likely voters. <br> And then there is the issue of whether pollsters have access to cell phone numbers. Gallup polls by reaching out to Americans using cell phone numbers as well as landlines. <br> Rasmussen polls only using landlines. <br> All these problems are minor in comparison to one larger uncertainty for pollsters working on the 2012 election. <br> Those are big questions and the pollsters have no definite answers. <br> Frey created three models for polling based on three different sets of possible voters in this year’s election. <br> For Hispanics the yield is even lower, as only 44 eligible voters can be found for every 100. Among whites, however, there are 78 eligible voters out of every 100. <br> These new factors born of the changing demographics of the country have to be considered in order to do accurate polling this year. <br> One important note —Frey stayed away from voter turnout data for the 2010 mid-term elections. He decided it would be an apples and orange scenario to compare a high profile presidential election campaign with a mid-term congressional election. <br> Here is what he found: <br> In the second scenario — let’s call it “B” — Frey applies 2004 turnout and voting patterns to the 2012 electorate. Under this assumption, Romney beats Obama with 286 electoral votes in 30 states. The model assumes stronger white support for the GOP than in scenario “A.” Lower minority turnout dooms the Obama campaign. <br> Under this model, 230 votes come from 14 states where minorities are responsible for an Obama victory. Frey says that under this scenario four-fifths of Obama’s electoral votes will be in states won by minorities. <br> It just so happens these are five states where voters have rejected gay marriage when it has been put to a referendum – North Carolina being the most recent to do so. <br> If demography is destiny, then Mitt Romney and the GOP are destined for an uphill battle as they try to retake the White House. Still, 1 out of 3 is not bad odds for a presidential contest. <br> This column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.

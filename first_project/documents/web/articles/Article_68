A pair of deputy sheriffs got a hankering for some chicken the other day so they decided to drop by a Zaxby’s in Shelby, North Carolina. <br> Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a must-read for conservatives! <br> Several workers in the back of the kitchen allegedly began hollering at the law enforcement officers and calling them names. And one of the workers allegedly tampered with one deputy’s meal. <br> “It is tough enough to watch my husband put on his uniform and go out into a world full of hate towards cops, all the while I sit home and worry if he will return home safely,” she wrote. <br> “I have pretty much kept my mouth shut, publicly, about the status of our country these days – but enough is enough,” she declared. <br> She went on to describe how the workers did something to her husband’s lunch – making it inedible. <br> Capt. Joel Shores said the department reached out to Zaxby’s and they’re mighty sorry about what happened. <br> The workers were not identified – but it’s safe to say if the allegations are true, their chickens are about to come home to roost. <br> Sounds to me like somebody just got thrown under the chicken coop. <br> The owner of the local franchise told The Shelby Star that they are “very big supporters of the community and law enforcement and all first responders.” <br> The sheriff’s department seems to be satisfied with Zaxby’s handling of the issue. <br> “Zaxby’s cannot be judged on a few bad apples,” he added. <br> But if it’s all the same – the next time the deputies get a hankering for the Gospel Bird – they should consider dropping by Chick-fil-A.

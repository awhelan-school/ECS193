Cardinal George Pell, former archbishop of Sydney and Melbourne and current head of the Vatican's Secretariat for the Economy, denied the allegations that will require him to return to Australia from Rome to face multiple charges of sexual assault. <br> Certainly, the early 2000s were the peak, with the Boston Globe bringing the issue to national prominence, resulting in lawsuits, criminal charges and the Academy Award-winning movie "Spotlight," about the journalists who uncovered both the abuse and the coverup by the church hierarchy. <br> That's 101 too many. <br> Despite his association with the more open-minded Pope Francis, Pell rose to prominence under Pope John Paul II, who named him a bishop and eventually a cardinal. Of course, John Paul II — his elevation to sainthood notwithstanding — will be remembered for having a blind spot when it came to the sex abuse crisis. <br> Pell's star rose in the church in part because of his reputation as an orthodox watchdog, regularly denouncing homosexuality, divorce and women's ordination. If the charges against him are found to be true, it would be further evidence that this issue crosses the traditional so-called "liberal" or "conservative" lines in the church. <br> Sadly, even our current, popular pope has a mixed record on responding to what is clearly more than a few individual "bad apples." Catholics — at least those who have not already left the church over this issue — are right to trust the criminal justice system more than their church. With Pell, we shall soon see what that system ultimately discovers and decides.

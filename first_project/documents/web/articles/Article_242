Rudy Giuliani wants voters to ignore his personal life and elect him president based on his record as New York mayor. Recent data indicate that may not be a winning strategy. <br> Republican voters think his personal life is relevant and are skeptical about a candidate who — like he — has been divorced more than once or has a strained relationship with his kids. They also don’t see a stint as a big city mayor as the best training to be president. <br> Of course, Giuliani remains the GOP front-runner. He leads national polls, although in the early voting states — Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina — he is behind in many surveys. <br> But his numbers have dropped, while former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney have gained. Arizona Sen. John McCain, after a dip, has stabilized his position. <br> Giuliani leads because 82 percent of voters in last week’s New York Times/CBS poll say he has strong leadership qualities. But he is potentially vulnerable because his support for abortion rights, gay rights and gun control put him outside the GOP mainstream. <br> Moreover, in a nomination contest in which social conservatives carry great clout, his personal life is likely to be an issue. <br> Giuliani has been married three times, once to a second cousin. His second divorce was very messy amid allegations of infidelity that he has denied. Giuliani’s children have said they would not campaign for him. Their relationship appears, to put the best face on it, strained. <br> Giuliani uses public perception that he is a strong leader — perhaps the most important characteristic Americans seek in a president — at every opportunity. He tells voters that is what matters, not his personal life. <br> He also steers the conversation toward his record as mayor, claiming he turned The Big Apple into a decent place to live. <br> But he may be surprised that voters nationally don’t necessarily see his service as New York mayor — which Gothamites like to say is the second toughest job in the country — as the right preparation for the Oval Office.

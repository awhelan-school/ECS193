The holiday season is in full swing. There's already been Black Friday and Cyber-Monday shopping. And now there’s a day to think about giving back: #GivingTuesday. <br> #GivingTuesday invites you to think of yourself as a philanthropist, even if you’re not a millionaire, even if you’re struggling to make ends meet. (The word philanthropist actually comes from the Greek words for “loving” and “people.” At its most basic, it’s about kindness and what we do for others.) <br> This year, national and regional #GivingTuesday campaigns are running in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Kenya, Latin America, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain and the United Kingdom. <br> 1. Volunteer at a local shelter. On the very first #GivingTuesday, there was a contracting company in Philadelphia that volunteered its staff to clean windows at a local homeless shelter. One of the volunteer workers said he had never been asked to be part of the “giving chain,” and he wouldn’t have to be asked again. He would be returning to help on his own next time. So if you’ve never been asked, we are asking now: Get together with friends or colleagues and volunteer your time (and elbow grease!) with a local shelter or food bank. (And if you can’t actually volunteer on #GivingTuesday, make a public pledge to do it when you can.) <br> 3. Give at the office. If you know a co-worker is having a rough time, ask her to take a walk around the block with you at lunchtime; a little fresh air, some pleasant conversation and maybe some window shopping will give her a chance to recharge. Bring in some of the extra apples you picked over the weekend or a bunch of flowers you plucked from your garden — a healthy treat will brighten up the whole office. <br> If you have a personal story about supporting a nonprofit, enter the #MyGivingStory contest at GivingTuesday.org/mygivingstory.

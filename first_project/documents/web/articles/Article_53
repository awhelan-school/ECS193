Occasionally, I will buy a bag of apples from the local grocery store. Most often one can get through the bag without stumbling upon a sour apple, but occasionally, you’ll get a bad apple. It happens. <br> News this week that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly obtained data of more than 50 million users is troubling, but it’s nothing more than a bad apple. Now there are calls to delete Facebook profiles and turn away from authorizing the respected outlets with our data. To that I say, resist. <br> This, of course, only works if there are enough data points to define correlations and predict human behavior. <br> Some internet-ready appliances can alert you when you’re getting low on milk, eggs or even laundry detergent. <br> In short, we are living in a society that values big data and the conveniences that it affords us. As intelligent consumers, when we use Facebook or a loyalty card, we are making a tradeoff between privacy and the value we obtain. <br> In the Masters in Business Analytics program at Wake Forest University School of Business, the ethics of big data is a concept we have imbedded in our program. In our course Analytics in Society, we discuss data privacy, legal issues around data and ethical frameworks for evaluating ethical challenges in the collection and usage of big data. These important concepts should be a part of an analyst’s education.

The Tennes family has been farming in Michigan for generations. <br> They grow all sorts of crops at theCountry Mill Farm– organic apples, blueberries, pumpkins, sweet corn. <br> And for the past seven years, Steve Tennes and his family have sold their produce at the farmer’s market owned by the city of East Lansing. <br> Last year, someone posted a message on Country Mill’s Facebook page inquiring about whether they hosted same-sex weddings at the farm. <br> Tennes told the individual they did not permit same-sex marriages on the farm because of the family’s Catholic belief that marriage is a sacramental union between one man and one woman. <br> It was brought to our attention that The Country Mill's general business practices do not comply with East Lansing's Civil Rights ordinances and public policy against discrimination as set forth in Chapter 22 of the City Code and outlined in the 2017 Market Vendor Guidelines, as such, The Country Mill's presence as a vendor his prohibited by the City's Farmer's Market Vendor Guidelines, read a letter the city sent to the family. <br> “We were surprised and we were shocked,” Steve told me. “My wife and I both volunteered to serve in the military – to protect freedom now we come home and the freedom that we worked to protect – we have to defend in our own backyard.” <br> “Whether you are a Jew, Muslim or Christian – people of faith should not be eradicated from the marketplace simply because they don’t share the same thoughts and ideas that the government is choosing to promote,” Steve told me. <br> Alliance Defending Freedomfiled a federal lawsuit Wednesday alleging East Lansing violated the constitutional rights of the Tennes family. <br> I warned you about this kind of attack in my new book,“The Deplorables’ Guide to Making America Great Again.”The attacks on religious liberty did not end just because a Republican is in the White House. <br> I commend the Tennes famly and Alliance Defending Freedom for filing a lawsuit. Don’t let up until every last kernel of sweet corn has been restored to its rightful place in the farmer’s market.

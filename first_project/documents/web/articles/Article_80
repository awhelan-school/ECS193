Editor's note: The following column by Ben Velderman's column originally appeared on EAGnews.com, the website of the Education Action Group. <br> Bush was a charter school advocate years before most Americans had even heard about the alternative public schools. Through the work of Bush and other leaders, there are more than 5,200 charter schools in the U.S. that serve an estimated 1.7 million students. The schools can be found in 41 states, including Florida, where Bush helped establish the very first charter back in 1996. <br> [pullquote] <br> And to benefit those students who stay in the traditional system, Bush has been a champion for tougher teacher evaluations and merit pay plans to ensure that government-run schools are being staffed by the best individuals possible. <br> However … Bush is jeopardizing 20 years’ worth of hard-won school choice successes by stubbornly promoting and defending the Common Core math and English learning standards. He doesn’t seem to realize that the one-size-fits-all standards are likely to have the practical effect of making instruction in all types of schools – public, public charter, private and even home schools – depressingly similar and mediocre. <br> A high price to pay <br> They’re also convinced Common Core will lead to more “rigorous” instruction, which will produce high school graduates with better “critical thinking” skills. Those better-prepared graduates, the theory goes, will boost the struggling American economy. <br> Common Core supporters spend much less time talking about the other, larger goal of the nationalized learning standards, which is to create a uniform K-12 system that synchronizes grade-level instruction among the states. <br> According to this theory, public education is just a few years away from historic possibilities that could finally restore America’s K-12 greatness. <br> Meanwhile, implementation of the standards throughout the nation has not gone well. Teachers don’t understand much of the material, so students have little chance of grasping it. Standardized test scores have dropped significantly in early Common Core states. Millions of concerned people, including teachers, union officials, school administrators and parents have become highly critical of Common Core over the past year or two, and numerous state legislatures are debating the idea of dumping the standards altogether. <br> As writer James Pethokoukis put it last summer, “In a startling turnabout, an education record that has looked to be an unvarnished plus for Bush may now be a liability. Long viewed as a potential contender in the 2016 presidential race, Bush has taken considerable heat from activists on the right in recent months for his support of the Common Core. <br> And even if Common Core were to prove ultimately successful, it will come at a huge cost. <br> Creating carbon copy schools <br> Hillsdale College professor Terrence Moore argues the Common Core could conceivably lead to the creation of fewer “classical” charter schools – those steeped in the classics of Western thought – throughout the U.S. <br> Moore also warned existing classical schools might become so consumed with trying to meet the expectations of the Common Core-aligned state assessments that they might have to “stop what they’re doing and have to teach to the test in order to prepare students.” <br> That reality is already settling in for at least one charter school leader. <br> “PARCC (a Common Core-aligned test) is truly the enforcement mechanism that will coerce schools into adopting the Common Core curriculum,” Anderson wrote in an email to conservative columnist Michelle Malkin. “We cannot do this. It is entirely against the mission and philosophy of our school.” <br> Schools will be pressured to cooperate <br> “Students in every state take the high-stakes college admissions exams, the SAT and the ACT, as well as the newly designed GED, the high school equivalency test used as an alternative way to get a high school diploma. And all of those exams are going to be aligned to the Common Core standards, at least that is what their respective owners say.” <br> The unavoidable effect of Common Core on all types of schools is obvious: Any institution worth its salt will do whatever is necessary to help students continue their education at a college or university. And according to the new rules of the game, that means making students fluent in Common Core, if for no other reason than to pass the ACT and SAT tests. <br> The bottom line is this: Jeb Bush has spent a career extolling the right of families to send their children to the school that best meets their needs. <br> What’s the point? <br> We suppose that’s true. You can’t harm something that no longer exists.

Is what Abbott said in a July 2016 traffic stop -- recorded on a dashcam -- worse than what Officer Michael Amiott did last month to Richard Hubbard III in Euclid, Ohio? <br> Hubbard, who was charged with driving on a suspended license and resisting arrest, is shown cooperating with Amiott -- and then the officer slams him against the car. After telling Hubbard to face away from him, he gives him no time to comply before applying force. Amiott said in a police report, "I began using closed fist strikes to the face and head of the suspect in order to end his resistance." <br> Watch the video to see how this really went. <br> Harris County attorneys deny this, saying her pants fell down and that they conducted a visual strip search. Watch the video and judge for yourself. <br> My money is on Corley's version of events. Why? Just think about it. In the best-case scenario, police in Houston are arguing they held a pants- and underwear-less woman down on the ground for several minutes and forced her to spread her legs while they visually examined her most intimate parts. That's how they are defending what they did! <br> Imagine the outrage if a frat boy told a prosecutor he didn't do anything wrong by holding down a woman and examining her vagina because her pants happened to fall in front of him. The claims by police in the Corley case are just as absurd. <br> It can't be true that sarcastically saying cops only kill black people will get a police officer in Cobb County, Georgia, fired more quickly than actually brutalizing black people. <br> Corley was initially charged with possession of 0.02 ounces of marijuana and resisting arrest, charges that were dropped. Two of the officers, who were indicted by a Harris County grand jury on charges of official oppression, were cleared of wrongdoing and remained on the force. A federal civil rights trial is scheduled for January. <br> If you really want to know why black Americans are so angered by the kinds of conversations we've been having these past few weeks, including watching President Donald Trump equate those confronting racial bigotry with the bigots themselves, watch these videos. <br> It is an unbroken string. The monuments were often erected when black progress was becoming most evident, as a way to re-assert white dominance, to remind black people to stay in their place. They were designed as state-sponsored intimidation. Police brutality has long served a similar purpose. <br> The brutality is awful enough -- it is made worse when so many people, so frequently, make excuses for it. They either look away or claim it is only a few bad apples, no matter how many times it happens, no matter the presence of enduring racial disparities. <br> It's time to stop looking away.

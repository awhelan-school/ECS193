Like to read other people's mail? Well, have at it. The Against the Grain inbox is open for your perusal. And by the way, this is not a blog.Bringing Guns To Work <br> A great many readers took me to task for my column on guns in the workplace, saying I was treading on the 2nd Amendment. And it appears a lot of people go hunting after work. However, I stand by what I said. <br> Our laws should be to protect our citizens, not punish them. What Ted Kennedy and your correct "spineless democrats" should stop their agenda of back door entry to have gun control by any method. The 2nd Amendment has guaranteed my right since its writing and once you change or re-write out constitution we will not be free men anymore. What would the liberal press do if we didn't have the 1st Amendment? <br> Paul Bartos <br> Joseph K. Smith (no relation) <br> Russel Rodeback <br> Gun control? It's the best thing you can do for crooks and gangsters. I want you to have nothing. If I'm a bad guy, I'm always gonna have a gun. Safety locks? You will pull the trigger with a lock on, and I'll pull the trigger. We'll see who wins. <br> Sammy "The Bull" Gravano, whose testimony convicted John Gotti. <br> Other than the snide cynicism, this is a good discussion to get into about individual rights (both first and second amendment) on private property. Indeed a gray area. <br> An inaccuracy, however. <br> There is more than pollsters telling the Democrats 'the smart thing to do is not address gun control'. The voting populace in the southern states traditionally supported conservative Southern Democrats in the house and senate until 1994, when in a backlash to Brady, they converted to conservative Republicans. Just this last election, 4 out of 5 open slots went to the Republicans. The one remaining Democrat said the reason Democrats are losing is they were 'not representing their constituency', so she decided to and won. <br> Dean's (new DNC head) take on this was that the Democratic Party must do better to 'educate their constituency'. <br> That's a big disconnect. <br> Robert A. Sutherland <br> Luckily we have a "no guns at work" policy so we're safe, right? <br> Frank Clarke <br> Since governments rule by fear, I'm sure that the thought of all those nasty guns in the hands of the citizens scare all of the liberals who, after all, know what is good for the entire population. Why don't some of these hanky-stomping, take-a-punk-to-lunch liberals leave everybody alone? <br> Lee Salmon

The Beatles wrote, “Money can’t buy me love.” And they’re right — particularly in politics. <br> It’s not that unusual for a candidate to significantly outspend his opponent — and lose. <br> This happened recently in the Democratic congressional primary for the new 33rd District in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area of North Texas. <br> A wealthy Dallas trial lawyer, Domingo Garcia, spent $1.8 million of his own money, first in the primary and then in the runoff election there. Ft. Worth State Rep. Marc Veasey, who is African-American, ran against him and raised $950,000 for the two races. He defeated Garcia 53 percent to 47 percent in the runoff. <br> The district is more than 80 percent minority, so the winner of the Democratic runoff will be the new congressman. <br> On paper, the new district appeared to favor Garcia. It was 61.8 percent voting age Latino and 17.8 percent black. Even when citizenship was factored in, the district was 39 percent Latino and 25 percent black. However, a strong, smart turnout effort in the black community could make up the difference. <br> Veasey worked on my congressional staff for six years before winning a seat in the Texas Legislature in 2004. He had to accomplish three things this year to defeat his wealthy opponent: (1) raise enough money to be competitive (2) maximize the black vote, which was largely in his current State House district and (3) carry the white vote, potentially the swing element. <br> Though the Latino population significantly outnumbered the African-American vote, the Lone Star Project, run by a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee staff director, Matt Angle, predicted early on that Veasey could win with the right kind of campaign — given the high turnout nature of his current State House district in Ft. Worth. <br> Garcia, it turned out, wasted much of the total amount he spent. He ultimately raised another $300,000, bringing his total outlays to $2.1 million. But he committed major blunders that helped Veasey level the playing field. <br> First, Garcia helped Veasey raise the critical mass he needed to be competitive (a candidate generally can be outspent 2-1 and still have a reasonable chance) by attacking two of the district’s largest employers, General Motors and Lockheed Martin, as being greedy corporations. Both companies have large unionized workforces. So this galvanized labor’s financial support for Veasey and helped him raise even more money in Ft. Worth — where the local business community views Lockheed Martin as apple pie and motherhood all rolled in one.

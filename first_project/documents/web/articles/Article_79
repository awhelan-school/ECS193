Much is being made of HGTV’s decision to cancel a previously announced new series, Flip it Forward, because its stars, twin brothers David and Jason Benham, had expressed their faith-based, pro-life values and belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman. <br> Look… HGTV is a private entity that can make whatever decision it chooses regarding its network and business operations, however, it has become extremely disturbing to me that media personalities and social groups have equated the Benham brother’s support for traditional marriage to racism. <br> The same race/gay comparisons were made after the firing of Mozilla CEO, Brendan Eich, who supported California’s Proposition 8 campaign to not redefine marriage. <br> I am a registered Democrat, I love gays, I have gays in my family, and I value tolerance and inclusion, but the national dialogue regarding gay rights, abortion, and free speech have gone way overboard. <br> There are millions of religious Americans, like me, who love gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, and love women who’ve had abortions, but believe that heterosexual relationships are biologically, physiologically, and spiritually unique and therefore should be reserved for the union identification of marriage and that life begins at conception. <br> Societal structures exist throughout our culture and I believe heterosexual unions should be one of those structures that are preserved for marriage between a man and woman. <br> The argument that race and sexual orientation are the same is like comparing apples and oranges. Just because civil rights for gays and ethnic cultures have been debated in public policy doesn’t make them the same. <br> However, sexuality, including homosexuality and heterosexuality, refers to intimate personal behaviors. <br> Thankfully, our nation has moved away from its hateful past regarding slavery, and we rightly speak out against discrimination. But holding to traditional marriage is not discriminatory, it is respectful of an important societal structure that has been recognized throughout our world’s entire history. For example, I’m not allowed to use the women’s restroom… that rule isn’t discriminatory, it is respectful of a societal system and structure. <br> America’s First Amendment gives us the right to disagree on marriage and abortion, so we should learn to coexist and live together in harmony. <br> I’d personally like for everyone to be a Christian, but that doesn’t mean that I criticize those who don’t agree with me. <br> It is my First Amendment right to live out my faith-based conviction on marriage and abortion, and I would ask the media and the nation to be tolerant of me and the millions of other Christians who share my belief.

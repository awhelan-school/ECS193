tax reform
#Summary
On April 15, many Americans will join Tax Marches in cities in almost every state to tell Trump that we do, in fact, care a great deal about his taxes. Though folks may grouse, most people in the United States take very seriously our collective responsibility to pay our taxes. We know that taxes help provide clean air and water, safe food and drugs, passable roads and bridges, protective police, successful schools and so many things that make our communities livable. We, therefore, need to create a more equitable system that closes loopholes, invests in communities and puts money in the hands of working Americans. Trump's tax returns -- or lack thereof -- cannot be excluded from any discussion of a more equitable system. His returns are critical to understanding the true state of Trump's financial affairs. Without complete returns, we won't know whether he owes money to foreign governments or their leaders, how much he has given in charitable contributions, how much (if anything) he has personally paid in taxes and what some of his assets really are. On the matter of international entanglement, a surprising new buzzword -- "foreign emoluments" -- has entered the political lexicon. This phrase refers to any payments from foreign governments to the president, as our founders had the foresight to include a clause in the Constitution prohibiting foreign nations from bribing our top executive. The people really do care -- if he has benefited from the many tax breaks afforded to the rich, his gains would reflect a fundamental inequity in the American tax system and a driver for the weekend march. So Trump can be sure that Americans won't stop marching, chanting and demanding his tax returns until he finally releases them.

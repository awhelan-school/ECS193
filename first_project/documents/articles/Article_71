tax reform
#Summary
Democratic lawmakers representing liberal parts of America habitually denounce this sort of thing: Spending reductions combined with tax cuts benefiting upper incomes. The question is, "should they?" and the answer is "no." The blue states should take the money and run.  Most of the proposed federal tax reforms would leave more wealth in the affluent blue states. They could capture some of it through their own taxes and economic activity unleashed by residents with more money in their pockets. The federal income tax has been called a blue-state tax because the higher incomes tend to cluster in Democratic strongholds. What's especially unfair about this is the federal tax code does not account for cost of living, which is highest in the elite coastal cities.  There's no reason why like-minded states can't get together and solve problems, including local challenges and international ones like climate change. For the richer blue states, a reduced federal tax burden would leave them with the added means to address these challenges.  And the nicest part: They can spend the money at home.

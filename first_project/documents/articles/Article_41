tax reform
#Summary
The Trump administration has shifted its approach on health care repeal, tax reform, infrastructure and other major campaign promises. That's not going to happen with immigration. Why? Trump's avid support of newly proposed immigration legislation reflects a longstanding fear among some conservative Republicans that our current, family-based immigration system will result in millions of new African, Asian and Latin American newcomers -- people who will eventually acquire full citizenship and end up voting for Democrats. The solution, according to Coulter and other movement Conservatives, is to change the rules of the system, which, they say, encourages so-called "chain migration" by giving preference in the immigration system to family members of current immigrants. For many Republicans, changing the rule is a political life-or-death issue. As Coulter warns, "there's no sense in arguing about any other political issue. If we lose immigration, we lose everything." That logic means Republicans will likely put up a ferocious battle to change the rules on immigration. This will engage not just the White House, but the broader party, which sees the fight as a matter of political survival.

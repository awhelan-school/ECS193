tax reform
#Summary
When Senator Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, a longtime "deficit hawk," or so-called fiscal conservative, voted against the Senate version of the Republican tax plan, it seemed as if principle might prevail -- at least among Republicans not facing re-election. That particular fantasy did not last long. But what makes this process especially maddening is that Trump is violating one of his most fundamental campaign promises: to drain the swamp. This massive tax legislation is being developed and brokered in haste and secrecy -- fundamental ingredients of a thriving swamp. Just like Corker did not see a last minute provision vastly benefiting him, we will likely never know about the myriad of deals brokered in darkness over the last few weeks in Washington. That's the way swamps work. And they stink.

tax reform
#Summary
As a CPA, I could be celebrating these loopholes. After all, I would be able to save my clients a lot on taxes and could be invited to fly along to, say, the Cayman Islands to set up an offshore account under the new regulations. Four days at the beach with a fully-stocked hotel minibar and all the HBO and Showtime programs I can watch -- all fully deductible for me and my client. Sounds nice, right? Wrong. As someone who has served small businesses for more than 30 years, and co-chair of an organization called Businesses for Responsible Tax Reform, I am not cheering. Small business owners aren't cheering the bill either. This change, if enacted, would encourage wealthy businesses to learn how to go offshore to gain a more favorable tax rate than is available within our borders -- giving them a significant financial and competitive advantage over our neighborhood mom and pops trying to stay afloat onshore. As professionals who parse the concrete numbers, not the airy promises of our leaders in Congress, accountants like me are in a position to know the truth about this bill. You can't fool the accountants. At the same time, no one should be trying to fool America's small businesses, either. The GOP tax plan does little to help America's small businesses. Instead it is an enormous transfer of wealth to large companies and wealthy families paid for by the middle class and America's hardworking small business owners. Congress must stand up and do what's right for small businesses, the backbone of our economy. This means lawmakers need to end this charade, go back to the drawing board, and thoughtfully and deliberately develop a plan based on sound economic policies that actually help real small businesses.

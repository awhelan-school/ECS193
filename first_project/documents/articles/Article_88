#Summary
People running for president might be expected to focus on issues like the economy, national security and foreign policy.  Sure, religion has to come up sometime, and candidates on both the left and right have discussed faith, but in America, well, we try to leave religion out of government. But not Mike Huckabee. He sounds more like he's running for Pope than President of the United States. It seems like faith is all he wants to talk about. He went on: "I'm less concerned about what faith the person has. I'm more concerned about the authenticity of their faith."  This is a jaw-dropping -- and disturbing -- statement. The "authenticity" of a person's faith?  Juxtapose this against the apparent belief of Huckabee, who would like to be our president.  According to him, your faith is no longer between you and God; it is now between you and Mike Huckabee. Huckabee appears to the judger in chief. Huckabee, however, has done more than just call for religious liberty in this campaign, he has actually questioned our entire system of government. Huckabee has even injected religion, instead of sensible policies that could save American lives, into the aftermath of tragedy. I'll reiterate: He wants to be president. If only he were alone among the GOP presidential candidates in putting religion front and center, but he's not. But it will be impossible to judge his competence as a potential commander in chief if he continues to define himself pastor in chief.

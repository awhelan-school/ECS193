tax reform
#Summary
It wasn't supposed to be this way. It  seems like a distant memory now, but it was only about six months ago that Republican leaders were giddily proclaiming a new political era. What a difference half a year makes. Ethical stumbles, rookie errors and sheer political arrogance have left the Republican agenda -- and the GOP legislative majority itself -- in grave peril. That virtually guarantees the Senate will kill or substantially rework the legislation, leaving the Republicans' No. 1 promise -- shouted daily on the campaign trail by Trump and virtually every Republican lawmaker -- unfulfilled.  The second main agenda item, tax reform, also looks shaky: Congressional leaders have already fallen behind the aggressive schedule needed to produce a bill by August. These aren't just gossipy distractions. Enacting major legislation requires a White House that is focused, confident and coherent. That is how the Reagan administration led a divided Congress to tax reform in 1986 and how the Obama White House won passage of a stimulus bill, auto industry bailout and health care reform. It remains to be seen whether voters will punish Republican members of Congress for the problems of the man in the White House. But while the Trump-Russia investigation grinds on, congressional Republicans would do well to find other ways to enact their agenda, mostly by working closely with GOP governors. Congress will need substantial buy-in at the state level to enact many of the big-ticket Republican agenda items, from reforming health care to building a border wall and other infrastructure. Now would be a good time to work with GOP governors on Republican agenda items like state-run high-risk health insurance pools and shovel-ready infrastructure projects.

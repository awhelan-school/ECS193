tax reform
#Summary
Cassidy's resistance to using health care reform as a front to slash taxes for the wealthy is not a popular position in his own party. But he is absolutely right about the true intentions behind this proposal: Republicans are jamming through a massive tax giveaway under utterly false pretenses. With the process now moving behind closed doors in the Senate, and Washington increasingly consumed with investigating the troubling links between the President and Russia, it is critical that Democrats expose and defeat this cynical ploy. Cassidy agreed with Kimmel. "Tell the American people to call their senators," he urged. We must take him up on that. As the Senate begins considering -- in secret, at the moment -- what to preserve and what to eliminate from the House bill, we should deliver a loud and clear message to Washington: leave those wasteful tax cuts on the cutting room floor. These giveaways are a feature, not a bug, of the House health care plan as intended by its authors. In the rollicking negotiations that led up to the House bill's passage, many provisions underwent major changes, but the tax cuts remained intact throughout. These tax cuts also actively thwart the objectives of making coverage more accessible and affordable. There are literally millions of lives at stake when it comes to the issue of health care. Congress should be ashamed of itself if it treats this as just another opportunity to provide a tax windfall for the fortunate few.

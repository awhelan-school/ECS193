tax reform
#Summary
There are two key lessons in this. Yet the truth is that Clinton's just-released 2015 return is fully open to being audited. For the next three years, the IRS could challenge Clinton on anything that anyone -- an eager press, an active "right-wing conspiracy" -- might find in those returns. How would Trump's tax plans affect him, personally? Hillary's tax returns showed that she and Bill earned about $10.6 million in 2015, and paid $3.24 million in taxes for an effective tax rate of about 31%. Hillary's tax reform plans would raise her own family's taxes, by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Trump does tout how he is closing the "carried interest" loophole that Wall Street hedge fund managers use to reduce their taxes, but it is not clear that their taxes will in fact go up at all. It is also not clear if any of this is relevant to Trump, personally.  Trump and his fellow Republicans like to lambaste Clinton for her alleged "pay-for-play" schemes. Is Donald Trump paying to become president so he can play trickle-down-tax-policy for himself and his family, to make the Trump brand rich again? If that sounds crazy, then Don't-Disclose-Donald can prove it is indeed crazy by one simple step -- releasing his returns.

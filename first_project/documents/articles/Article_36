tax reform
#Summary
President Donald Trump is in for a bumpy political ride when Congress reconvenes after Labor Day. A remarkable number of leaders of the President's party have begun sharply criticizing Trump, signaling that he can no longer expect lawmakers to follow the White House's lead on major legislation. The latest blast from Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who was elected to his sixth term in the Senate on the same day Trump won last November. "We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don't answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power." In political terms, that's a declaration of independence -- one that could, over time, turn into a declaration of war. "Hill Republicans are increasingly worried that Trump's penchant for drama -- and the constant bickering in the West Wing -- is going to crush their agenda," Politico reports. There's a reason for the growing distance between Trump and Capitol Hill Republicans. In the tough jungle warfare of Washington, professional politicians of both parties are quick to sense weakness and tend to move with ruthless speed to fill power vacuums.  Experienced legislators look at Trump's tumultuous eight months in office and see weakness. Washington politicians have clearly sized up those kinds of problems and concluded that the Trump White House is in no position to dictate the shape or speed of legislation to Congress. That was tame compared with what McCain wrote. Concerns about getting tax cuts and other legislation passed goes hand in hand with the hard reality that Trump's low approval numbers could spell political trouble for Congressional Republicans in next year's midterm elections.

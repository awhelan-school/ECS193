tax reform
#Summary
If passed, the bill would eliminate a deduction on interest paid on student loans, a move that has borrowers up in arms. And while the student loan interest deduction could certainly stand to be improved, eliminating it entirely is the wrong approach. In other words, someone who took on large debts to pay for an advanced degree is likely making much better money than a person who never enrolled in college at all, and the student loan interest deduction benefits only the former. These differences are not just theoretical: Despite income limits on who can claim the student loan interest deduction, actual tax claims support the idea that high-income borrowers benefit more. It's clear the deduction could do much more for low-income families. But that's not what the GOP has proposed. Some of these are indeed aimed at middle-class taxpayers, including an increase in the standard deduction, but the combined changes make it hard for the average Americans to fully understand how their net tax liability will change if the GOP bill becomes law.

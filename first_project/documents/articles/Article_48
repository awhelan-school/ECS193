#Summary
While Washington fiddles, the American people are angry. While our elected officials descend further into frenzies of partisanship, voters feel left out. Their kitchen table concerns are repeatedly ignored, forcing many families to face the twin economic disruptions of globalization and the advance of technology on their own. But in an era of partisan media, unchecked Internet trolling and ideological polarization, the Constitution's blueprint for balanced government has been lost in a political fog. Unlike the parliamentary systems that provide for one-party rule, our system is based on checks and balances. In other words, American democracy centers on the expectation that the two parties will resolve their differences to move the country forward. By all means, Congress should carry out its function of investigating important matters such as Russian covert activities and the possible illegal unmasking and leaking of classified information. But these investigations cannot be allowed to take a car already moving at only 5 mph and grind it to a halt. I was there in the Senate in 1998 during the impeachment inquiry and trial of Bill Clinton, and we learned to investigate and legislate at the same time. We didn't stop what we were there to do -- we put progress over partisanship. It's an important lesson for today. The Problem Solvers are bringing a common-sense approach to the nation's toughest problems. It's time for the rest of Washington to catch up. When in power, neither party will win enduring victories without reaching across the aisle. When in opposition, neither party will leave an imprint if it resists every proposed initiative regardless of merit. Enough of the partisanship that only weakens our country and emboldens our adversaries. It's time for the nation's leaders to put country before ideology and party.

tax reform
#Summary
Still, Trump is correct that the GOP Senate passed this budget Thursday to pave the way for massive tax cuts. And Trump is also correct that the "MSM" -- the mainstream media -- has not covered this story the way it deserves. But that's where we part company. Trump wants the media to pat him on the back for the budget passing and for his proposed tax cuts. In contrast, I want the media to highlight for our fellow Americans that the budget passed by the GOP-controlled Senate would massively cut both Medicare and Medicaid in order to give the richest Americans a big, fat and unnecessary tax cut.  And as Trump stated in his tweet, all of these proposed budget cuts are designed to give "the biggest tax cut in U.S. history." And who will benefit from this gargantuan tax cut? Well, again, you don't need to be an expert to know that when the Republicans are in control of government, the rich often benefit the most.  Recent reports indicate that House Republicans may simply adopt the Senate approved plan because they are feeling pressure not just from Trump but also from wealthy GOP donors, who have threatened to put up challengers against sitting congressmen if they fail to deliver.  The reality is that if American citizens don't vocally oppose the proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, why wouldn't the GOP Congress simply approve it? As a reminder, the GOP's attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace with a far inferior plan was only defeated because Americans -- both on the left and the right -- stood up and objected. That is why those who oppose these cuts must speak up now. If not, then expect Medicare, Medicaid and other safety net programs to be slashed so that the GOP can give a tax cut that primarily benefits the top earners in America -- the ones who need it least.

tax reform
#Summary
What do we see? The same old, same old: massive treats for the rich and confusing tricks for the rest of us. These treats for the rich go a long way to adding $1.5 trillion to our national debt -- a trick for the future to figure out how to pay.  How can we tell who "wins" and who "loses" in a very narrow, immediate sense? To be precise, most ordinary folk likely will have to wait until April, 2019 -- after the midterm elections -- when we fill out tax returns for the 2018 year.  Trick or treat? You be the judge.  When all the dust settles, we end up where we started, where Republicans have always been. As confusing as it is to figure out the many losers from this proposed law, it is abundantly clear who the winners are: America's plutocrats, including the man in the White House.  Happy Halloween, rich kids.

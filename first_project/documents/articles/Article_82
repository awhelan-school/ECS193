#Summary
With increasing awareness in the electorate about the implications of global warming, these shifts may open up political space after the elections in November and pave the way for a new, bipartisan U.S. climate and energy policy framework. Such a framework should provide a predictable, level playing field that factors in the social and environmental costs resulting from carbon emissions. It should put a heavy emphasis on research and development of cutting-edge energy technologies that will enable the full decarbonization of the energy sector. It would propel energy efficiency investments and enhance the competitiveness of carbon capture and storage techniques that could provide a long-term future for gas. A carbon fee would also go a long way toward helping revive the commercial prospects of zero-carbon nuclear power. Finally, but most importantly, carbon revenues could also boost research and development spending on breakthrough energy technologies needed to make full decarbonization by mid-century easier, in line with the goals of the U.S.-led Mission Innovation project announced in Paris. Without bolder public policies in place, the United States risks losing out on the energy revolution -- one of the most consequential transformations of this century. It is time to start constructing a new U.S. energy edifice.

 Speaker Paul Ryan's announcement that he is not seeking re-election shocked a Republican Party already facing severe midterm headwinds. His decision will drive down morale in the GOP conference -- and perhaps convince other fence-sitting members who have yet to decide to call it quits themselves. These additional open seats would increase the likelihood that Democrats will take over the House. <br> Ryan's move accelerates a GOP leadership battle between California's Kevin McCarthy and Louisiana's Steve Scalise, both able men who are well-liked by their colleagues (it feels like McCarthy's race to lose at this point). No matter who becomes the next Republican leader, they will sit atop a smaller conference that is likely to be in the minority. <br> Despite the chaos his departure will cause for the party, there are obviously larger issues at play for Ryan that convinced him now is the time to go. <br> Sometimes we forget -- congressional leaders have districts and constituents to think about, too. Ryan's deference to the people of Wisconsin, by not asking them to vote for him when it was very likely he wouldn't serve out his term, is an honorable move. <br> 3. He achieved his dream of tax reform. Ryan is a policy wonk at heart, with a lifelong belief that lower taxes are better for America's working families. He has been a member of Congress for two decades, and his crowning achievement was holding the House together in December for the sweeping tax cuts. <br> Ryan's announcement will signal to Republican donors and activists that the House is most likely lost, which should refocus everyone's attention on holding the US Senate. Losing one chamber will introduce a high level of policy and investigatory paralysis to the Trump administration; losing both would feel like getting sucked into the tenth level of hell for the President. <br> We haven't seen the last of Paul Ryan. He's 48 and I'd bet dollars to donuts he's a future presidential candidate. Leaving now helps his family and will give him some space to prep a run for The White House sometime down the road. 
 Originally, I had decided not to watch the reboot of "Roseanne" because of Barr's vocal and bizarre worship of Donald Trump. <br> I make no apologies for not being a Trump supporter. Moreover, I don't subscribe to the belief that we who oppose Trump should try to "understand" the "misunderstood" Trump supporter. No one called for people to try to "understand" President Obama's supporters when he was in office. No one said Obama supporters were "ignored" over the years. No one gave Obama supporters the title of working class -- as if only white men in red states are the working class. <br> The column inches, airtime, and dissertations given to Trump supporters are by comparison astounding. <br> Within 10 minutes of Tuesday night's reboot, I had to admit, the show was damn good -- and not because of Roseanne. <br> Thirty years later, the Conners' kitchen isn't renovated. They haven't bought a new couch (maybe it was reupholstered?) and the house wasn't even freshly painted. That is the reality of poverty. If I venture back into one of my old neighborhoods, it's shocking how little has changed -- it's as if I was transported back in time. <br> The jokes about financial woes, health care, and the issues that hurt American families are where the show delivers the best laughs. The second episode tackled Darlene's son wearing girls' clothes, something I have never seen on network television and exactly the type of dialogue Trump supporters, if they are watching, would need to see (I hope the show properly unpacks DJ's black daughter as well). <br> In some ways, the show was a billion miles away from the perspective of Trump, Barr and Fox News. As Dan Conner said, "God didn't give me a head this big to have me be narrow-minded." Hopefully, Sean Hannity or Laura Ingraham heard that line. 
 Thanks to the Internal Revenue Service, many dread the month of April. In fact, if given the option between (a) dealing with the IRS or (b) undergoing a root canal, most would probably go to the dentist. That's because the IRS is anything but user-friendly. Trust me, as a certified public accountant, I've heard all the horror stories and have helped taxpayers through a good number myself. <br> Last December, Republicans passed historic tax reform legislation, which President Donald Trump signed into law. With a reformed tax code, it's now time to fix the tax collection agency. <br> The goal for the IRS is to provide first class service to American taxpayers, rather than the dysfunctional service too many have come to expect. Through this legislation, taxpayers will be able to easily access their information, day or night, readily have their questions answered and quickly resolve issues. The IRS should educate and provide guidance to taxpayers on what is required to comply with the tax code -- making the process of paying taxes as painless as possible. <br> Our plan will also protect low-income taxpayers by extending the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Matching Grant Program (VITA), which will provide tax preparation assistance to low-income taxpayers and those in underserved populations. <br> The IRS must work for, not against, the taxpayer. That is why our IRS plan also establishes an independent office of appeals to ensure that taxpayers pay exactly what they owe and receive a fair and impartial review of disputes they may have with the IRS. It provides many important clarifications regarding IRS enforcement powers. This includes reining in civil asset forfeiture authority and also creating new safeguards for taxpayers' private information. <br> It is important to remember that the IRS does not wield ultimate authority in America -- taxpayers do. <br> As we work toward the first revamp of the IRS in 20 years, these reforms must be built upon IT systems that are modern and up-to-date (sorry, fax machine repairmen). The bill also ensures that the IRS is held accountable if modernization efforts fall short by stipulating that funds spent must produce measurable results. <br> Americans must be able to trust that their private information is secure. Although the number of reported identity thefts has recently dropped, the IRS still received a startling 242,000 reports of theft from taxpayers in 2017. It is essential for the IRS to have the capacity to remain ahead of evolving threats posed by bad actors and to be able to proactively combat identity theft refund fraud. Most importantly, the IRS must be able to readily assist taxpayers when they are victims of fraud. <br> We are thinking boldly about the IRS's future -- in order to return the IRS to its service-first mission. Whether it is online, in-person or by phone, taxpayers deserve a tax collection agency that is focused on them. 
 Ask around about Donald Trump's time as an Atlantic City mogul and the stories are legion: A-larger-than-life figure whose casinos were all about him. Some mistakes he would forgive. But according to one story -- maybe urban legend -- there was one unforgivable sin: If you forget to call it Trump's casino, as one employee apparently once did, you're gone. <br> Rex Tillerson made that same mistake: He forgot it's not his casino. <br> It belongs to President Trump. And now more than ever, or so the President believes. <br> In conversations with people who know the President well, one point seems clear: The President thinks the turmoil is great. It shows he's in charge now, for real. <br> "He thinks he's got it," says an ally. "I can tell when he's concerned and when he's not. He's not. He's on cloud nine." A man in full. <br> Trump now figures he knows how to do this presidential thing after a year on the job. "He thinks 'I've come into my own,'" says this friend. "I don't need anybody to tell me how to do this anymore." <br> Sure, Trump is lonely. Sources always say that he doesn't have a lot of friends, save for his family. And lately, with Stormy brewing, Melania is surely less dependable. And the President still gets frustrated by the forced solitude and thinking time imposed on him by chief of staff General John Kelly. <br> But now, after a win on tax reform under his belt and with a good economy, there is a newfound muscle-flexing. Trump is now the CEO. He can rely on basic instinct. And, predicts this ally, "it's not over." <br> Well-founded rumors are flying about Trump's unhappiness with Kelly and his National Security Adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster. But he let his differences with Tillerson fester for months before acting, right? So why wouldn't that delay happen again? <br> Because this version of Trump is apparently more self-assured. He wants to really bring in his own team, not a team he picked when he did not know what direction he would take on foreign policy or anything else. "I'm really at a point where we're getting very close to having the cabinet and other things that I want," Trump told reporters on Tuesday. <br> Besides, now he knows he can say one thing on gun control one day, and do something else the next, and his base will say it's OK. He is more sure. He's "confident," as the friend puts it, even at 38% popularity. "He thinks he's penetrated the BS." <br> So is the Cabinet also on the firing line? Probably. Will Attorney General Jeff Sessions be the next to go? Friends caution that while that could happen (under the anything-is-possible-in-Trumpworld caveat), the Tillerson saga doesn't mean the attorney general is next. Sessions has his own conservative political constituency and still tries to be a respectful ally to the President. Trump considered his secretary of state arrogant, even disrespectful. I mean, he did call Trump a moron, or at least he never denied it. <br> And what about the rest of the Cabinet? The high-flying, pricey-decorating, taxpayer-soaking folks? Sure, anything can happen, especially if Trump is made to look bad -- as with the drama surrounding Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, who CNN reports is on the chopping block. But there also seem to be more important fish to fry. As the Trump friend puts it, "Next to him is what matters," as in the White House staff. So get ready for him to take care of that too. It's about his comfort level, not anyone else's. <br> And never mind the bad form. The Tillerson saga played out for months, and then, in the end, it was still a mess. It's just a Trump pattern, as suggested by that story about the Atlantic City employee who found himself out of a job. <br> It is, as ever, Trump's casino. 
 It comes at a bizarre time, in fact, given that the GOP-led House Intelligence Committee concluded on Monday night that it would be ending its investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The committee determined that there was no evidence to support collusion. <br> The White House was served a win on a silver platter, a narrative it should've let play out over the next few days amid the stories of chaos in the White House and Stormy Daniels' getting closer to her alleged tell-all about her time with Trump. <br> However, in true Trump fashion, he had to make headlines, instead. <br> So, about all of those best and brightest he was going to surround himself with? Well, they either don't want to stay or find themselves at odds with their boss, and out the door. <br> Within the past two weeks alone, there has been chaos and unraveling, as well as three high-profile exits from the White House. <br> People of talent won't work for a boss who discredits and undermines them in public, meaning that the candidate pool for open posts will be very slim or come from within the White House. Even without the blunders, awful rhetoric, Twitter rants and legislative ignorance, the turnover alone is enough to make any sane person reluctant to submit a resume. <br> And the chaotic and uncertain environment that has been described by current and former staffers surely portrays us in a poor light to the rest of the world. <br> On the campaign trail, candidate Trump made it clear that he didn't know much about public policy or the legislative process but that he would surround himself with the best and the brightest in order to legislate effectively and successfully. <br> But while he has surrounded himself with trusted cabinet members and advisers, he often clashes with them publicly on policy and ends up losing them. <br> Just when this administration seemed to be getting a grasp on things by rounding out 2017 with a legislative victory on tax reform, it seems as though the President couldn't resist stirring things up again and sending the media, as well as the general public, into a tailspin in the new year. <br> As Trump pushes forward into the second year of his presidency, particularly with the looming 2018 midterms, he would be wise to start showing some stability within his administration, instead of continuously rocking the boat. 
 Our expectations have sunk so low that a major victory for the Trump team at the State of the Union speech on Tuesday night would consist of the President successfully walking down a long hallway and then reading for an hour from prepared remarks without going off script. <br> If he can accomplish those two things, you can anticipate that the speech will be lauded by many pundits and commentators as a "bright moment in his presidency" and a possible "turning point." <br> In summary: he is facing some serious headwinds. <br> The test for Trump and the White House is not whether he can read from a Teleprompter and look "presidential," but whether he and his team have the discipline and the capacity to use this as a moment to reset. Here are the three real questions the White House should be judged on: <br> 1. Does the speech provide clear policy marching orders? <br> For any State of the Union, the policy is the meat of the sandwich and the focus is almost always domestic. Typically, the process of preparing begins months in advance with large binders and lengthy meetings in the Roosevelt room, as the policy and communications team determines which policies to include. <br> First, what is new and will make headlines and drive an agenda. Second, what Congress might be open to taking up in the year ahead. <br> The White House has already put forward a dead-on-arrival immigration proposal written by none other than Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller. This was supposed to be a framing piece for the State of the Union, and may still show up in the written remarks, but cutting legal immigration back by an estimated 50% and going back to the age of immigration quotas in the 1920s is not going to sail through Congress. <br> The White House has also hinted that infrastructure will be a central focus of the speech. On the surface, that sounds reasonable and it would be hard for Democrats to remain seated during the obligatory standing ovation. But deficit hawks including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan may not be eager to put a big package of spending on the table, especially after the tax reform bill. A good applause line, but hard to see the path forward. <br> So where does that leave the policy marching orders? <br> But the White House has not said that this will be a part of the speech, and members in vulnerable House and Senate districts will not be rushing to sign up to cut social safety net packages in a year when they could lose their seats for far less. <br> Will anything proposed domestically on Tuesday night have the shelf life and momentum to actually move forward in Congress? As of now the answer appears to be no. <br> 2. Does it provide a blueprint for candidates running for office? <br> Barring a surprising legislative surge this year, Trump's success in 2018 will be judged in large part by how congressional candidates fare in November. <br> While his popularity and scandal-ridden administration don't make him the most appealing surrogate for vulnerable members, he is still the head of the Republican Party, which is in charge of both houses of Congress, and he continues to have a strong and loyal following from his base. As we have already seen in special elections, his message will have an impact on both vulnerable incumbent members and candidates running. <br> There is no doubt he will spend a good portion of the State of the Union speech highlighting positive economic indicators and taking credit for the low unemployment rate and the surging stock market. While Democrats accurately argue that these numbers and trends have long been underway, that some of the economic indicators under Obama were actually stronger and that the stock market surge is not helping real people, this will already be a prominent talking point on the campaign trail. <br> Trump may not do any damage in the speech, but it is hard to see what new proposal or new message will emerge as a blueprint candidates can take with them in their march to November. And in an unpredictable environment where Trump may well attack Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell with new cutting nicknames on Twitter by Wednesday morning, it is hard to see how a unifying party message in the speech on Tuesday sticks. <br> 3. Does the speech help expand his base and unify the public? <br> Of all people, the Twitter President recognizes that. And the White House has sold the speech as "unifying." That would certainly be an improvement. Recall just one year ago, Trump delivered one of the better speeches of his presidency to the joint session of Congress. But the speech, described as "optimistic" in advance, quickly made way for one of the darkest and most divisive first years of a presidency in modern American history. <br> While a unifying tone would be smart, recent history tells us that the connection between the tone of the speech and the tone and actions afterward is negligible. <br> The State of the Union has never been about the ability of the President of the United States to read words on a page, but whether the speech has shelf life afterward in the days, weeks and months ahead. Count me as a skeptic that the administration and Republicans will be able to deliver. 
 In his first State of the Union address on Tuesday night, President Trump will have an opportunity to outline his vision, and his apparent goal will be to advocate "bipartisanship." But it is the President who will need to demonstrate that he will retreat from his divisive path and begin to move America forward by putting bipartisan government ahead of political extremism. <br> Obviously in a divided nation, with extreme feelings of alienation on both sides of the political spectrum, it is the overwhelming and festering national need. Racial, religious and political tensions are ripping apart American society. <br> The Founding Fathers stitched together an exquisite fabric to connect a land of different people into one community through balance of power and respect for diversity. The first year of the Trump Administration has weakened those links. E pluribus unum, our nation's founding premise stitched on the seal on the flag behind the President's desk, has been made a mockery. <br> But the President's words alone advocating "bipartisanship" will not fix the problem he created. <br> If the President, who now needs Senate Democrats to pass a continuing resolution and then a budget in February, wants any degree of reasonable cooperation, he will need to make the first moves. <br> The President's State of the Union address must show that he will abandon the extreme conservative orthodoxy he adopted to win the Republican presidential primaries and that he is now ready to govern. He has a large credibility gap that he must cross, as just last week the President's immigration proposal reinforced his extremism and his anti-immigrant philosophy.‎ A State of the Union call for "bipartisanship" must be matched with actual policy proposals that reflect a dramatic shift in his approach to be taken seriously. <br> The President must appreciate the anger and resentment he has caused. On immigration, he has unilaterally ended DACA and now holds it hostage. His proposal on immigration is tantamount to saying, "I will release the hostages but we must close the door to immigration." He may as well ask the Democrats to take down the Statue of Liberty. <br> The President's insistence on a $25 billion "wall" is like asking the American people to finance a campaign poster for his polarizing politics. Saying we should build a wall on the border with Mexico like the Great Wall of China was ridiculous as campaign rhetoric and is even more absurd as government policy. Parts of the Great Wall date as far back as 700 BC. No nation today would employ such an ancient strategy. Security should rest on new technology, motion sensors and infrared cameras at a fraction of the cost. Trump can get a bipartisan agreement on border protection, but let the experts design a real security system at the most efficient price, and not a political icon. <br> His tax reform plan was the most egregious violation of "bipartisanship" in modern history. Rather than gifting corporations a 40% tax cut and hoping their generosity would transfer down to workers, he should amend the bill and say corporations MUST give the windfall to workers by raising their wages or creating new jobs. Tax reform is a $1.5 trillion gift to wealthy corporations that will increase the national debt. It was trickle-down economics on steroids. <br> ‎If the President truly wants to repair relations for a functioning bipartisan government, he must call for a repeal of the vile provision in his tax reform that curtailed the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). It targeted 11 states (and the District of Columbia) -- all Democratic, all states President Trump lost, all states without a Republican Senator and a small minority of Republican representatives in the House. <br> Why did the Republicans do it? They did it because curtailing SALT was a key part of a package of deduction limits and eliminations that provided $668 billion in funding for the tax cuts. Yet these 11 states and the District of Columbia represent 40% of the national Gross Domestic Product. Does any reasonable person believe that damaging 40% of the nation's economy is good for the country? <br> They robbed blue states to pay for the tax cut in red states. It was the declaration of an economic civil war. It has devastating consequences for those targeted states like New York and California, and we are scrambling to rewrite our tax codes in its wake. We believe it is unconstitutional and we will go to court to stop it. <br> How can the Democrats from those states, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer from New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi from California, "compromise" without the SALT provision being repealed? How can they abandon their constituents? <br> The President must be credible on a seemingly incredibly sudden change of perspective. A disingenuous State of the Union is the worst course that the President could take. Judging by his record low-approval ratings, most Americans already doubt his credibility and sincerity. Offering a "do as I say but not as I do " State of the Union would be the height of hypocrisy. <br> As Governor, I have worked with a Republican Senate and a Democratic Assembly for seven years. The transition from campaigning to governing is essential. Governing is effectuating positive change. President Trump cannot do that without Democrats, and his past scorched earth, hyper-partisan approach will not work. He needs Democrats now, and he knows it. But he should know that even in politics, action speaks louder than words. 
 The World Economic Forum just concluded in Davos, Switzerland. As a longtime participant in the annual gathering, I know that some years are good, some years are great. And in some years, history is made. <br> At this year's event, President Donald J. Trump shared with major business and political leaders from around the world his vision for and optimism in the American economy. They can once again look to the United States as one of the most competitive and lucrative places to invest in the world, because "America is open for business." <br> Many people heard President Trump's message that he will always put America first -- just as all leaders must put their own citizens first. <br> Because he spent the last year putting America first, our economy is now resurgent. Massive tax cuts, deregulation, pro-growth energy policies and stronger trade practices are finally lifting the American economy out of a long period of stagnation. Growth is back, and millions of Americans are personally reaping the benefits. <br> For example, since we passed tax reform a little over a month ago, more than 255 companies (and counting) have announced significant new benefits -- including bonuses, higher wages, and better retirement options -- that benefit at least 3 million workers around the country. <br> When combined with America's great workforce, commitment to innovation and strong rule of law, the opportunity to invest and grow here is unprecedented. <br> Investment in America does not just benefit the United States -- it benefits the world. When our economy grows, it is good for the world. When the world economy grows, it is good for the United States. <br> Our pursuit of excellence, our creativity and our culture of innovation help drive change that improves lives around the world -- and creates countless jobs on distant shores. Our belief in free markets and a level playing field are values that make the world more free, fair, and prosperous. Under President Trump's leadership, we are trying to steer the world back to those principles. <br> He also talked about a world where all countries treat each other fairly and where hard work, ingenuity, and natural resources determine economic outcomes -- not protectionist laws and policies distorting what should otherwise be market-driven results. <br> Since taking office, President Trump has taken the principles of his America First vision to many corners of the globe. If this year's World Economic Forum participants truly heed the President's call and work together, this year's meeting will not only have been meaningful -- it also will be a moment of truly positive change for our world. 
 If 2017 is remembered as the year of major tax reform, let 2018 be remembered as the year that the nation's infrastructure was finally recognized as a priority for federal investment. <br> For several weeks, there has been talk that infrastructure could form a cornerstone of the President's new agenda. So, what infrastructure priorities would be top of my list? In no special order, I'd spend our money on the following: <br> 1. Interstate and long-distance rail: Funding for Amtrak, our national rail carrier, has long been a battleground between the political parties. Supporting Amtrak's nationwide operations is not a political sin, but rather a necessity to ensure continued service between cities or towns with insufficient traffic to pay their own way. <br> 2. Bridges and roads: The federal formula for funding roadways, including bridges, is complex -- and few outside of the transport world understand it. Suffice it to say that the lion's share of the cost of our interstate highway system -- of which major bridges are often a part -- has historically been paid for by federal, rather than state, dollars thanks to a burst of federal spending during and following the Eisenhower administration. <br> 5. Ports and port cities: As our appetite for foreign goods has grown, the ships delivering these good to our shores have too -- some of them doubling in capacity over the course of the last generation. Yet our willingness as a nation to invest in the changes necessary to handle these behemoths -- deeper harbors, higher bridges, better intermodal connections and more efficient security systems -- has not. <br> Once upon a time, our nation built the interstate highway system -- and it has paid dividends ever since. Today, however, we rely almost exclusively on the vagaries of state funding, resulting in a prolonged period of declining service across far too many forms of infrastructure. When will we realize that the costs -- in reliability, productivity and safety -- of not investing in these critical areas far outweigh the costs to the nation of doing so, even belatedly? 
 The ongoing conservative civil war came to a head Tuesday with the ouster of Steve Bannon at Breitbart News. This latest twist comes in the wake of a dispute between President Trump and Bannon, triggered by bombshell quotes in Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" book. <br> By separating himself from Bannon, Trump is continuing to govern more like a traditional conservative than many observers expected. Bannon embodied the ongoing strife surrounding the conservative movement, and he sought to circumvent the President and become a movement by himself, in spite of Trump. <br> Yet Bannon's fortunes only rose because of Trump, and he joined the Trump campaign in the homestretch, more than a year after the candidate descended the Trump Tower escalator. Bannon's attempt at internal guerilla warfare is harmful for the future of the conservative movement. If Bannon helped sound the war cry that led to Trump's victory, he failed to understand that to everything there is a season, including peace. <br> If conservatives are smart, Bannon's departure will be a turning point to move beyond the contentious climate of a conservative civil war launched amidst the 2016 election among the Never Trump "Establishment" types, the bomb-throwing, anti-establishment Bannonites and the growing body of conservative Trump supporters. <br> Congress hangs in the balance with November's elections, and ongoing fracturing will be a stumbling block to advancing a conservative policy agenda. Trump was the most non-traditional candidate in modern history, with no elected public policy track record and an aggressive tone. But now a year later, he's delivered in big ways that even the most ardent Never Trump conservatives must acknowledge. <br> Trump has succeeded in placing stalwart conservative judicial nominees at all levels, spearheaded the most robust tax reform in a generation, protected Internet freedom by rolling back flawed net neutrality, and let the world know American energy policy is made in Washington, not on foreign soil. Abroad, Trump continued the efforts that led to ISIS' defeat, stood up to Pakistan on terrorism, rightfully acknowledged Jerusalem as Israel's capital, successfully pressured China to support tougher North Korea sanctions, bolstered the Ukrainians against Russia, and more. <br> It's time for the Never Trumpers (who are my former 2016 compatriots -- I wrote in Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) as a protest presidential vote) to stop living in a fantasy world: Trump isn't going anywhere. The criminal Russia collusion investigation against Trump has not yet turned up evidence of criminal collusion by the President. <br> The way conservatives transcend the tumultuous political climate is to help Trump, and therefore America, succeed. That doesn't mean lawmakers should agree with the president on everything, but the continued Never Trumpers are rejecting William F. Buckley's mantra to back "the rightwardmost viable candidate." Turning your back on a Republican president in office undermines the spirit that Buckley supported. <br> Trump's victory blindsided many "Establishment" conservatives, but that doesn't mean they and MAGA foot soldiers can't and shouldn't work together. Rather than stubbornly clinging to preconceptions about each other, dialogue and respectful understanding of differences will move us forward. A reconciliation could take us a long way back toward Ronald Reagan's Shining City on a Hill. 
 In a year dominated by the beginning of the Trump presidency, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the man occupying the highest office in the land. But Donald Trump's many actions and tweets weren't the only subjects of interest. Stories of racism and white supremacist groups, workplace sexual harassment, freedom of the press and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too. <br> Here are excerpts from a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2017. <br> David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact <br> January 31 <br> I woke up this morning as an alternative fact. <br> In justifying the appointment of Steve Bannon, the President's chief strategist, to the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited my role in the Obama White House as a precedent. Spicer said press secretary Robert Gibbs and I attended classified National Security Council meetings "all the time." <br> That is simply not true. <br> As a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his National Security Council Principals committee over the strategy the United States would pursue in the war with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. <br> I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the President's decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it. <br> Dean Obeidallah: Donald Trump's most bone-chilling tweet <br> February 6 <br> Here is Trump's truly jaw-dropping tweet from Saturday morning: "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!" <br> Why is this so concerning? It's OK to argue about whether the judge should or shouldn't have issued this order. But Trump is apparently attempting to delegitimize our federal judiciary by calling Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush-appointed judge, a "so-called" judge while arguing that his decision is "ridiculous." <br> Let's be blunt, because the stakes demand it: An independent federal judiciary is our last, best hope at preventing Trump from violating the US Constitution and illegally grabbing power. And Trump has to understand that, hence his attempt to undermine it. <br> George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past <br> February 19 <br> I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets. <br> I remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead. <br> That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion. <br> Peter Bergen: Why the 'mother of all bombs' and why now? <br> April 13 <br> The dropping of a "mother of all bombs" Thursday by the United States on an ISIS cave and bunker complex in Achin district in eastern Afghanistan should be understood as part of an effort to reverse a war that is not going well for the Afghan government and, by extension, the United States. <br> The non-nuclear 21,600-pound GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) "targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters use to move around freely," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. <br> Thursday's bombing had a feeling of deja vu. A decade and a half ago the US Air Force dropped massive 15,000 pound "Daisy Cutter" bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001. Achin district is only a dozen or so miles from the Tora Bora region. <br> Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights <br> April 19 <br> The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted. <br> As the US ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming. <br> Sarah Lenti: Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option <br> April 25 <br> It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids. <br> My heart dropped. She didn't know me at all. <br> I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family. <br> Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me -- and it isn't the first. <br> John McWhorter: A man who is tragically unfit to be president <br> May 2 <br> When President Donald Trump revealed that he doesn't know why the Civil War was fought, or at least figures it could have been averted by the kind of deal-making he supposedly excels at, it was revealing in ways beyond the ones easy to glean. <br> The ignorance is, as usual, stunning for someone in the public spotlight. "People don't ask that question, but why was there the Civil War?" Trump asks rhetorically, which is like saying no one has bothered to study anatomy or physics. <br> Yet this sort of thing should no longer surprise us from this man. He doesn't read and lacks curiosity, but that's hardly rare among human beings. A college teacher friend of mine the other day noted that no one in his class could name who was president in the 1980s, nor, upon being told who it was, could they name his political party. People like this don't mysteriously develop an interest in civics after college. Sometimes they become president. <br> Michael D'Antonio: The little boy president <br> May 16 <br> Like most little boys, Donald Trump can be disarmingly honest, as when he once said, "When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same. The temperament is not that different." The trouble is that the first grader is now President of the United States, and his temperament is on display for the world to see. <br> Unpredictable, impulsive and immature, Trump acts in a way that would be expected of a 6-year-old boy, but is terrifying in a man whose moods dictate decisions carried out by adults on behalf of the most powerful nation in the world. <br> Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey offers a sterling example of the childish -- and reckless -- Trump style. When Comey broke with bureau tradition and spoke negatively about Trump's rival in the election, though initially he was criticized by candidate Trump, he was later praised -- and effusively. Over and over again, the soon-to-be-president described how Comey had done the right thing in criticizing Hillary Clinton. Comey remained in Trump's good graces after he was inaugurated, and Trump's team expressed confidence in him up until last week. <br> Anushay Hossain: The ugly truth behind Saudi Arabia's love for Melania Trump <br> May 23 <br> Donald Trump's first major trip overseas may be fraught with diplomatic land mines for the President, but the Trump administration can at least comfort itself with the clear hit that Melania Trump has been with the Saudi press. <br> The fact that Melania is communicating with the media and the public in Saudi Arabia -- mainly through what Saudi news reports have deemed her "classy and conservative" fashion choices -- works well in the notoriously anti-woman kingdom. Her intense appeal makes sense, considering the first lady represents so much that Saudi citizens find familiar and can relate to, especially visually. Melania walks behind her husband, is quiet and reserved, does not make obvious demands (at least not ones we can hear), and most importantly, she looks beautiful and polished... <br> In Melania, the Saudi press and the Saudi government found the perfect spokeswoman, who projects a glamorous image that glosses over one of world's most autocratic and oppressive regimes. <br> Gloria Borger: Trump, home all alone <br> May 30 <br> So Trump returns to the White House this week just as he left -- lonely, angry and not happy with much of anyone. The presidency, Donald Trump is discovering, is not an easy or natural fit. <br> "He now lives within himself, which is a dangerous place for Donald Trump to be," says someone who speaks with the President. "I see him emotionally withdrawing. He's gained weight. He doesn't have anybody whom he trusts." <br> The question, he adds, is whether Trump will understand the enormity of what he faces or will instead "be back to being arrogant and stubborn." He will have to realize that "all this trip really did was hit the pause button." <br> Douglas Heye: After baseball attack, the hate in politics has got to go <br> June 14 <br> Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an art form. But what we've seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others' motives and legitimacy. <br> On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate -- or a blind "us versus them" tribal mentality -- stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks. <br> Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues. <br> We know what we will do today. We will pray and we will come together. But what we do tomorrow is even more important. <br> John Kirby: Here's what we're sure of in the USS Fitzgerald collision <br> June 17 <br> First, we know the crew fought heroically to save their ship and the lives of their shipmates. We know that from early reports by Navy officials but also from the images that flashed across our screens, our tablets and our phones after the incident happened early Saturday. <br> One look at the crushed, twisted starboard side, the hoses flaked about, the water being discharged, the frantic work being done tells you all you need to know about the stuff you can't see in those same images: a fiercely brave crew working together to staunch the flooding, to rescue their shipmates and to save their ship. <br> You can be certain they ended up drenched, exhausted, scraped and bruised -- but not broken. They kept that ship from foundering for 16 brutal hours. And they brought her back into port. <br> Jen Psaki: Putin set a trap and Trump fell into it <br> July 7 <br> The Russians just played the President. It was predictable. And he let it happen. <br> On paper, Vladimir Putin should not have had the upper hand going into the meeting. <br> To start with, Russia has been living with sanctions put in place more than three years ago because of its annexation of Crimea. <br> And most Americans, save a few people including the President of the United States, are confident that Putin led the Russian intervention into the American election and into many other elections around the world. <br> President Obama booted out nearly three dozen spies in December and closed two compounds, and there are many, from both parties, calling for an additional round of sanctions on Russia. <br> We should have had some leverage. So what happened? <br> Jane Carr: What the white supremacist view of history leaves out <br> August 18 <br> The white supremacists in Charlottesville said they wanted to "defend history" by protesting efforts to take down Confederate monuments. They say they feel threatened. They fear the removal of "white stories" from our culture. <br> I used to teach African-American literature and cultural history. I wish I could tell them what real erasure looks like. I'd ask them to think about the memorials that never existed in public spaces in the South -- noting Richmond's past as a slave market, or the communities of free blacks who were terrorized by the installation of these Confederate monuments in the first place. To take down Charlottesville's statue of Robert E. Lee will not change the fact that all Virginia schoolchildren know his name, while the names of those who lived in the lost Charlottesville neighborhood of Vinegar Hill are forgotten. <br> I keep returning to the question: How can people who claim to love history get the meaning of history so very, very wrong? <br> Lev Golinkin: Jared and Ivanka are failing a basic moral test <br> August 19 <br> But the silence emanating from Jared and Ivanka was exponentially more powerful than any I'd heard before. To me, as a Jew, seeing nothing but two tweets from Ivanka brought the kind of pain I'm sure is echoed by African-Americans anytime Ben Carson defends the President, and Asian-Americans in the wake of Elaine Chao's and Nikki Haley's equivocations: condemning hate in general terms while carefully avoiding criticizing the very administration they're part of. <br> No press conference was forthcoming, no rejection of Donald Trump's words; there was no statement from Jared about the horror his grandparents had survived; nothing from Ivanka, who had spoken about standing up for mothers on the campaign trail, about defending today's Jewish children -- her children; indeed all children -- from intimidation and violence. There was nothing, but the sound of steady clicking on Ivanka's electronic device as she wrote two tweets. <br> It was like listening to the fabric of Judaism tear at itself. <br> Peniel Joseph: Can 'I Have a Dream' help us heal after Charlottesville? <br> August 26 <br> Fifty-four years later, King's legacy offers concrete ways of dealing with a contemporary racial landscape that has produced a sense of vertigo in large swaths of the American public. King's words remain a singular anchor for all those who believe in freedom; by speaking truth to power in a political climate more racially toxic than our own, King did more than dream about racial justice. <br> He challenged all of us to embrace a vision of a liberated future capable of touching individual hearts and minds as it traversed through the blood and veins of the body politic, on the way to creating a nation as good as the best of its citizens. <br> Alice Stewart: What Trump got right in Texas <br> August 30 <br> Hurricane Harvey is historic, not just in its size and scope, but in its significance as Donald Trump's first natural disaster test as President. His "darned if you do, darned if you don't" decision to visit South Texas on Tuesday, away from the rescue efforts, was the right call. Trump is demonstrating he has the compassion and commitment to meet the needs of victims of the deadly storm. <br> Critics blasted Trump for not meeting with victims directly to offer his personal condolences. Look, there's plenty of time for the powerful photos showing comfort, but now is the time for action -- not optics. These people are in the rescue and recovery mode, which can only be hampered by the distraction of a presidential visit. They need homes, not hugs; they need structure, not selfies, and they need funds, not a presidential flyover. <br> Unfortunately, every president has been forced to lead this country through natural or man-made disasters and faced the challenges of serving as consoler in chief: President Barack Obama had the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings; President George W. Bush had 9/11; President Bill Clinton met the challenge after the Oklahoma City bombing. All rose to the occasion. <br> Likewise, Trump is stepping up to the challenge, reassuring storm victims that resources are on the way. <br> LaQuishe Wright: Harvey survivor: The loss is hitting me in waves <br> September 1 <br> I woke up Friday morning and looked outside at a deceptively beautiful day. Beautiful because my two sons, Bry and Ryan, two dogs and I are safe and dry and the sun is shining again after days of endless rain. Deceptive because our entire life as we know it is submerged in 4 feet of water less than 20 minutes away. <br> To experience devastation like that brought by Hurricane Harvey feels very different from what you've probably seen on television. I was lucky enough to make it out of my house in Katy with my kids, my dogs, our cars and at least some of our belongings and memories. My neighbors' harrowing evacuations make me feel even luckier to have made it out safely, but I can't help but be concerned about what comes next for us. <br> Brooke Baldwin: Speaking like this to women in 2017? No way <br> September 18 <br> The newsroom around me fell silent. I was staring into the camera trying to make sense of what was unfolding on live television. I even caught my cameraman Jay's eyes in disbelief. I thought again: "It is 2017, and this grown man is on my show talking with me -- a female host -- about boobs. Is this seriously happening?" <br> And then I did something I've done only a handful of times in my career. I told the control room to kill his mic and said "bye." I invite a variety of people on my show with wide-ranging opinions -- sometimes even my jaw hits the floor, too -- but I let them speak. Whether it's left, right or center -- I want to expose my viewers to other perspectives. Agree with them or not, the nation needs to listen. <br> But this ... was different. <br> Eleanor McManus, Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin <br> October 26 <br> Fast forward several months later to when I graduated and asked for an informational meeting. I reached out to Mr. Halperin and he asked me to come see him. I was thrilled that someone from ABC News was willing to meet with me -- perhaps that was my way in the door. It was my first official meeting; I even had to buy a suit for the occasion. <br> I don't quite remember what we talked about, but I do remember him asking me to sit down next to him on the couch. I thought it was awkward to sit on the couch when I was perfectly comfortable sitting in the chair across from his desk. But I complied, and I also remember him sitting a little too close to me... <br> I'm telling my story publicly now because I hope that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not be so courteous and apologetic. I'm hoping women today will finally speak out in real time -- when this behavior happens. Women cannot stay silent for fear it will damage their careers, because that only allows the aggressor to continue his behavior with other women. <br> Marvin Washington: Kneeling isn't about patriotism -- it's a distress signal <br> October 14 <br> I spent 10 years playing in the NFL, won a Super Bowl and have been blessed beyond imagination -- in no small part because of the best fans in professional sports -- fans of multiple races, genders, religions and political persuasions. <br> I'm not confused about the role the fans played in my success and neither are the current players in the league. I understand that many NFL fans on both sides feel strongly about the National Anthem protests and the issues of race that underlie them -- so do I and so do the current players. I am an African-American who grew up in the 1960s and the vitriol that surged two Fridays ago, stoked by a speech delivered in Alabama no less, is eerily reminiscent for me of that dark time in our history. <br> Some players had been engaging in periodic protest long before President Donald Trump's fateful rally, but it's also fair to say this wasn't top of mind for most people before that rally. Trump suggested (mostly white) owners should fire any of the (mostly black) players on their teams who engaged in protest during the National Anthem, and he called them a profane name. <br> The protests, begun by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and now being carried on by current players, are not about patriotism -- they are about systemic racial inequality in the criminal justice system. They are about how communities of color are policed -- problems that experts on both sides agree on. <br> Nicole Stamp: What decent men can do in response to #MeToo <br> October 21 <br> 8. Don't use gendered or misogynist insults. Words like bitch, cunt, or slut only target women. Sissy, fairy and cuck demean feminine traits as lesser, weak and undesirable in men. Avoid those words. If you must insult someone, focus on their actions, not their body or their gender. <br> 9. Free kids from rigid gender roles. For boys and young men, you can role-model that activities and traits traditionally coded as "feminine" are valuable. Challenge dismissive ideas around what counts as "girl stuff." Delight in stories with strong female characters. Give a toddler boy a baby doll and praise his gentleness. Race trucks with a little girl. Give kids the tools and confidence to challenge and defy gender stereotypes. <br> 10. Don't focus on little girls' looks. Many people's first interaction with a young girl is to compliment her cuteness, prettiness or clothing. But this tells her -- and any boys nearby -- that beauty is her most interesting trait. Instead, ask little girls engaging, gender-neutral questions, like "What kind of toy is that? What subjects do you like in school? What's your favorite animal? Hey, what are you reading?" There are so many things to talk about. <br> Brianna Keilar: With my husband deployed, covering the news hits home <br> October 25 <br> The last few days the news has been dominated by a controversy over Trump's call to Myeshia Johnson, a Gold Star widow. She is just 24 years old and pregnant with her third child, mourning her husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in an ISIS ambush in Niger. ... <br> Moments of dignity and solemnity have been interrupted over and over by politics and vitriol and today, it seems, is no different. <br> I turn the television off and retweet the President's tweet, commenting, "As I'm watching 'Taking Chance' this tweet alerts on my phone. And that about sums up this week for me." <br> A few minutes later a man tweets at me: "It's telling that you are only now watching this. Been out for years. More evidence U and other media R in a bubble don't know real people." <br> I just can't let it go. <br> "My husband is on his sixth deployment right now. You don't know anything about me," I reply. <br> Don Lemon: Open letter to Trump: Please stop! <br> October 26 <br> Mr. Trump, please stop it. Please stop! <br> Think of what Sgt. Johnson would want. You are putting his widow in the terrible position of having to fight for her dignity when she should be concentrating on taking care of herself, her health, her two children, and the one on the way. <br> Listen to what Myeshia Johnson said this morning in an interview on ABC. <br> "The President said that he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways and I was -- it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband's name. The only way he remembered my husband's name because he told me he had my husband's report in front of him and that's when he actually said La David." <br> I know you have children -- and two daughters. <br> Can you imagine Ivanka or Tiffany in Myeshia's shoes? <br> Mel Robbins: Why Americans don't give a damn about mass shootings <br> November 6 <br> One month ago, the worst mass shooting in US history took place at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 people injured. Bill O'Reilly boiled the massacre down to six words: "This is the price of freedom." <br> I hate to say it, but he is right. Sunday, just 34 days after Vegas, 26 people were gunned down and about 20 others were wounded during a church service in Texas. And here's what is really sick -- we won't be surprised when there's another mass shooting next month. Maybe it'll be your church, your mall, your concert or your movie theater. That's the price of freedom. <br> In America, we are free to stockpile weapons. We are free to order ammo online. We are free to outfit our guns with bump stocks, like the Vegas shooter did. This is the price we pay for freedom, alright. The freedom to not give a damn. <br> Jessica Barth: We could have made Weinstein powerless <br> November 9 <br> It has taken me a few days to process the sudden explosion of allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and assault made against Harvey Weinstein. Each woman who steps forward leaves me with a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, I feel an overwhelming sense of relief and pride when I see women joining together to share their stories. On the other, I experience a sense of horror over the staggering number of accusers. Women stripped of their power, silenced and shamed. <br> I was one of them and recounted my own experience publicly last week. <br> In my own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, I have been made to feel as if I had to compromise my own convictions for the advancement of my career. I was made to believe that my talent and experience should take a back seat to my physical appearance. I was manipulated into believing I had "asked for it." And I was made to feel that if I spoke out or fought back, the repercussions would make me regret it. <br> Ann Moses: I watched fame take its toll on young David Cassidy <br> November 22 <br> When he got the "Partridge" gig, David was barely 20, and had very little life experience. He also had little or no support system when he became an overnight sensation. I watched it all happen, and later saw it all unravel, as I spent several days a week on the Partridge set, covering David and his co-stars, real-life stepmom Shirley Jones and Susan Dey. <br> At first, David was giddy to be appearing on a prime-time television series. He was cheerful and cooperative, which made my job easier as I worked every angle to come up with stories about this shiny-haired young man. ... <br> A few months later, the nice young man who'd kissed my mom on the cheek in thanks for looking after his puppies was pretty much gone. Whenever I appeared on set, David began to disappear between scenes -- during the times he had once joined me for interviews. I couldn't write about David's favorite snack food (dry-roasted peanuts) or his favorite color ("It depends on my mood") or how he felt about his neat new sports car if he was hiding from me all the time. <br> David Gergen: Trump's foolish war with the press <br> November 27 <br> In other words, we are witness to a war between Trump and the press, playing out every day in newspapers and television. Each morning brings a new revelation; each evening touches off a shouting match. It is difficult to remember any press secretary since Nixon's Ron Ziegler who has faced so much suspicion from the Fourth Estate. <br> Yet what is equally surprising is how oblivious this White House is to what has gone wrong and how to fix it. His team is as disdainful of history as it is of time-honored traditions about press-government relations. Either they suffer from massive incompetence or extraordinary arrogance. <br> History has been quite clear: The presidents who have built the best relationships with the press are those who respect its place in American life, have enjoyed a give and take with reporters and care about the truth. From Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt and Jack Kennedy to Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, press coverage has been much more favorable because those leaders in the Oval Office were not only good copy but men of character in their public lives. <br> Mark Bauerlein: Why Trump is still winning <br> December 5 <br> This is the real battle going on in D.C. today: not Democrats vs. Republicans but President Donald Trump vs. establishment Republicans. Trump is trampling upon every taboo and sensitivity that liberalism has erected in the last 50 years, and Republican leaders have learned to get by in that uptight habitat. ... <br> And now, the needle seems to tilt Trump's way. <br> This correction is not that hard to understand. You see, Trump has an invincible ally at the far end of the ideological spectrum. I don't mean the extreme right, the nationalists, paleoconservatives, and fringe groups that the media relentlessly tie to the President. He has better friends at the other pole, people on the far left who see the world only through the lens of race, gender, sexuality and victimhood. <br> Arianne Zucker, I have no fear, so 'Access Hollywood' tape will never define me <br> December 6 <br> Now that the "Access Hollywood" tape is back in the news after reports that Donald Trump questions its authenticity, I am puzzled for this reason: Just from experience, anyone who has ever been on television before, with a microphone pinned to them, should always assume that someone is listening. And when you get caught speaking poorly about someone, at least own up to it. <br> People ask me whether I need or want an individual apology from either now-President Trump or Billy Bush. Well, apologizing to me would be the appropriate thing to do. Am I losing sleep over it waiting for one? Absolutely not. <br> I refuse to let a situation such as this one take away my emotional power. You are who you allow yourself to be and I did not and will not let this event or any of its aftermath affect who I am as a woman, mother, daughter, friend and partner to a great man. 
 Republicans are euphoric. <br> After years of talking about tax reform on the campaign trail, a bill that cuts taxes, simplifies the code, and primes the American economy for more growth has passed the House and the Senate and is on its way to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. <br> This achievement was years in the making for House Speaker Paul Ryan, solidifying his place in history as a policy wonk with the political skills to see through something as complicated as changing the US tax code. He found enough common ground for what is often a fractured group of his party members to deliver a win on what is perhaps the last unifying issue for Republicans of all stripes: the idea that taxes should be lower. <br> As for Mitch McConnell, he erased the Steve Bannon-fueled narrative that the majority Republican conference isn't delivering for President Trump. Thanks to McConnell, Trump can claim victory on taxes and health care, as this bill achieves what some are calling a "stealth repeal" of Obamacare through the elimination of the individual mandate. <br> Watching the Democrats talk in cursive, warning of the End Times, should tell us what we need to know about their ability to credibly weaponize taxes for the midterms. I used to think Democrats would fall back on the same old tired class warfare bologna, but seeing their new rhetorical arsenal makes me almost pity them as they try to rekindle any sort of relationship with middle America. 
 As a CPA, I could be celebrating these loopholes. After all, I would be able to save my clients a lot on taxes and could be invited to fly along to, say, the Cayman Islands to set up an offshore account under the new regulations. Four days at the beach with a fully-stocked hotel minibar and all the HBO and Showtime programs I can watch -- all fully deductible for me and my client. Sounds nice, right? <br> Wrong. As someone who has served small businesses for more than 30 years, and co-chair of an organization called Businesses for Responsible Tax Reform, I am not cheering. Small business owners aren't cheering the bill either. <br> This change, if enacted, would encourage wealthy businesses to learn how to go offshore to gain a more favorable tax rate than is available within our borders -- giving them a significant financial and competitive advantage over our neighborhood mom and pops trying to stay afloat onshore. <br> As professionals who parse the concrete numbers, not the airy promises of our leaders in Congress, accountants like me are in a position to know the truth about this bill. You can't fool the accountants. <br> At the same time, no one should be trying to fool America's small businesses, either. The GOP tax plan does little to help America's small businesses. Instead it is an enormous transfer of wealth to large companies and wealthy families paid for by the middle class and America's hardworking small business owners. <br> Congress must stand up and do what's right for small businesses, the backbone of our economy. This means lawmakers need to end this charade, go back to the drawing board, and thoughtfully and deliberately develop a plan based on sound economic policies that actually help real small businesses. 
 How sad is it that the party that brought us John F. Kennedy's tax cuts, economic growth and higher wages is now the party that puts redistribution ahead of prosperity. <br> JFK knew that America's biggest problem was not the budget deficit but a growth deficit. And based on Donald Trump's proposed tax cuts, he seems to share JFK's wisdom. <br> In 1997, Bill Clinton -- who admittedly raised taxes in 1993 -- signed into law one of the biggest bipartisan tax cuts in history, including a slashing of the capital gains tax. Although some argue that Clinton's tax cuts were not the cause of the economic prosperity that followed, I don't think it was a mere coincidence that America experienced a growth and employment boom so great that the budget reached a surplus. <br> Question: does that sound like Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer, or Donald Trump? 
 Tax plans can be hard to decipher, but with each passing day, women and moms across the country understand more clearly how the GOP tax plans — both the US Senate and the House versions -- will affect their families and our economy. <br> At MomsRising, we hear from moms -- from Alaska to Alabama -- every day and they are telling us they are terrified. Over the last few weeks, we've seen rumblings of concern turn to full-fledged alarm about what this tax plan will mean for America's women. Their worries are certainly justified. <br> Economic inequality for women is a huge weakness for our nation, and the GOP proposed tax plans in the US House and Senate could turn that disaster into a national calamity. <br> The women of America know that it's not OK to raise taxes for millions of people while gutting essential provisions that boost our access to health care, education and housing, and that fuel our economy. That's not smart economic policy. We also know that it's not OK to starve the federal budget in ways that are sure to put Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Head Start and other essential programs on the chopping block. <br> It's also not OK to pretend trickle-down economics is going to work now, when it never has before. <br> The women of America also know these GOP tax plans don't reflect our values, don't recognize our contributions, and don't boost our economy. Most heartbreaking of all, we know that the GOP tax plan, which is being rushed through even though it's the most comprehensive tax reform bill in decades, takes an ax to the American dream for many of our children. <br> Members of Congress who vote to pass the GOP tax plan do so at their own risk. Women are watching, counting this vote, and will remember this at re-election time. It's time for congressional Republicans to rethink their approach, invest in programs that help reduce income inequality and boost our economy, and open the doors to opportunity, instead of slam them shut. 
 This isn't some "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" faux idealism; it's actually happening and there is a growing group of us who believe that progress is more important than partisanship. We believe that getting to "yes" where it makes sense -- on health care, DACA and border security, infrastructure, and the budget -- is more important than obstruction just for the sake of it. <br> Earlier this year, we used this approach to engage our House colleagues in discussions about how to form an organized bipartisan bloc. Eventually, these efforts culminated in creating the Problem Solvers Caucus, the first bipartisan caucus of its kind. Some scoffed. For the better part of the last quarter century, they pointed out, the House of Representatives has been defined by a winner-take-all mentality. The majority holds the gavels and the power, rarely even acknowledging ideas from members across the aisle. So, how would a bipartisan caucus wield any real influence? <br> But that wasn't their only objection. Even if the Problem Solvers managed to drive bipartisan action in the House, many doubted the Senate would ever follow suit. If the House is dominated by majority rule, then the Senate is known for the fact that one person can stop the body in its tracks. In short, there was little reason to believe we could effectively counteract an entrenched system that drives the majority party to ram through its agenda and compels the minority party to exert maximum resistance. <br> Today, we can say proudly that our detractors were wrong -- even if our Caucus and this Congress still have a great deal of work left to do for the American people. The bipartisan health care proposal the Problem Solvers Caucus unveiled in July, designed to stabilize the individual health care marketplace and lower premiums, was the very first bipartisan plan to fix health care. <br> The work put in by our bipartisan members over many late nights and long meetings paved the way for those on the other side of the Capitol to come to the table, too. And now, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray released a plan last month, proving our bipartisan work could break through institutional barriers on Capitol Hill. <br> As the Alexander-Murray plan weaves through Congress, the Problem Solvers Caucus has been meeting for months on how best to bring tax relief to hardworking families, small businesses and the American people. The House has passed its plan and the Senate is considering its own version. <br> We will disagree with certain tax policy changes, but we firmly agree on this point -- the best way to achieve lasting tax reform is on a bipartisan path. It worked three decades ago for President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill, when a plan for a simpler tax system was signed into law with support from both parties. Depending on what happens this week, our Caucus may still play a role in bridging a divide. <br> Now that Senators Collins and Manchin have agreed to become honorary co-chairs of No Labels, we will be working closely with them -- this represents a rare opportunity for a bipartisan bridge between the House and Senate. <br> Here's the hard truth everyone needs to acknowledge: The absence of bipartisanship has made it almost impossible for either party to govern. We saw that with health care, and now we need to avoid a similar path with tax reform. It's a vicious cycle. <br> Now we are weeks away from all federal funding expiring. The need for a long-term bipartisan budget agreement couldn't be more clear. Neither party wins when nothing gets done. But the real victims are the American people who depend on Washington to tackle the nation's big challenges with a common sense approach. <br> This is why you'll find Problem Solvers, even at long, odd hours in the Capitol, seated together around a large table, debating and negotiating to solve the issues that will shape the future of our America. It's also why we're so grateful to Senators Collins and Manchin for taking up the same cause of bipartisan cooperation in the Senate. Whether or not our cause is popular inside the Washington beltway -- it's liable to be pilloried by those who do better the worse Washington gets -- we now know it can work. We're not giving up on governing to get things done for the American people. 
 This commentary contains graphic language. <br> Like most women (and, I hope, most men), I have read the recent torrent of sexual harassment and abuse stories with horror and dismay. The graphic detail of each incident shocks and infuriates me. I usually can't get through an article in one sitting. It's like watching a horror movie: I instinctively cover my eyes at the scary scenes. Sadly, after 25 years in politics, the "movie" is quite familiar. <br> Each time I stop reading, my thoughts turn first to my children. I have a 19-year old daughter and a 15-year old son. I ask myself if I've done enough to give my daughter the strength and confidence to know what to do if a colleague, a boss, a boyfriend, or anyone ever assaults or harasses her. <br> Have we told her enough times that her father and I will support her and be prepared to fight alongside her (or just kick his ass)? Have I told my son enough times that he should never, ever force a girl into doing anything that she is uncomfortable doing? That he should step in if he sees anyone attempting to assault another person? Have my husband and I explained enough times that he should ask permission to kiss or even hold a girl's hand? Does he understand that sexual assault is really about power, not sex? <br> Have we told them all this enough? <br> My worry for my kids soon turns to anger at these powerful men. As I read, I see my younger self in the victim's stories. Certainly, any woman over 40 probably has her own "Me Too" story. Not all of us have stories of assault or rape. But, I believe we each have a story of a time we were sexually demeaned or humiliated by a superior. And like these women who have come forward, I remember every detail of those incidents. Incidents that are decades old stick in your brain, which is why I believe the women. <br> I am profoundly grateful to the brave women who have told their stories. They have changed the way that we, as a society and culture, look at sexual harassment. Powerful men have been fired, ostracized and ruined. They are finally paying a price for, in some instances, decades of abuse. Yes, you can feel the sea change. <br> As more politicians face allegations, we cannot apply traditional partisanship in our reactions to their stories. I cannot read the stories about Roy Moore and John Conyers (both accused of accused of sexual harassment; both deny it) and react as anything other than a mother. To truly hear these women -- to honor their courage -- I have to put my partisan hat far, far away. <br> The response from the White House on Roy Moore is tragic. Sarah Sanders argues the difference between Sen. Al Franken and Donald Trump is that "Franken admitted to wrongdoing and the President hasn't." Sanders reminds me of Roy Moore's comments to one of his alleged victims, Beverly Young Nelson. After allegedly assaulting her in his car, Nelson said that Moore told her: "You're just a child. ... I am the district attorney of Etowah County and if you tell anyone about this, no one will ever believe you." <br> Later, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway argued that a vote against Roy Moore is a vote against tax reform -- saying, in essence, that by standing up for an alleged child molester, Republicans in Alabama can help deliver the political win Republicans need for the 2018 midterms. <br> We are truly in a bad place when the President of the United States would rather elect a man accused by two credible women of allegedly assaulting them sexually when they were young teenagers than lose another legislative battle before the 2018 midterms. Note to Trump: Write a tax bill that actually helps the middle class, and you won't need the alleged child molester. <br> Of course, putting away my partisan hat means I have to acknowledge my own decisions over the years. I worked on Bill Clinton's 1992 and 1996 campaigns and in the Clinton White House. Like every Clinton White House staffer I know, I'm proud of my service and President Clinton's record. Like every Clinton White House staffer I know, I never took the allegations against him lightly. But that doesn't mean I took them seriously enough. <br> I lumped Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky in with partisan attacks about Whitewater and crazy Vince Foster murder plots. I saw Clinton as "the Comeback Kid" and our White House as a continuation of the famous "war room" that elected him. When it's all "us" vs. "them" polarization, you lose perspective. <br> Each of us who defended President Clinton by dismissing his accusers needs to reckon with it. <br> I'm not sure what there is to do about Bill Clinton now. He paid a steep price, was impeached, humiliated his family, and tarnished an otherwise impressive legacy. He is not on any ballot, nor will he ever be again. <br> One thing we can do is drop the nonsense of minimizing his relationship with Monica Lewinsky as a "consensual blow job." The issue, then and now, is not sex. It is power. That is the common factor in all these allegations of sexual harassment by men in high places, including President Clinton and President Trump. <br> Sexual harassment is not a political issue. It's not about Democrat vs. Republican. It's about the victim. The stories of the victims are horrifying, scary, and disgusting. We need to listen. We need to believe them. We need to talk to our daughters and our sons about them. We, as a society, need to do better. 
 When I was little, my family spent some time on public assistance. So I learned at a young age that the best way to lift people out of poverty and into the middle class is to expand economic opportunity. Creating well-paying jobs allows for the social mobility that is often unattainable for families when they are dependent on government assistance. People thrive with the dignity of self-reliance. <br> The US tax code works against this principle. <br> The tax code is built upon bad fiscal policy, which is, needless to say, bad for the nation. We have to find a better way to operate. <br> On Thursday, the House passed a tax reform bill, and the Senate has advanced its own tax proposal, both of which would be a big step toward remedying some of these ills. <br> In different ways, the House and Senate bills would cut back on the deductibility of state and local taxes (SALT). This provision has generated some strong pushback, but let's consider what this means for a minute. <br> How is it fair that residents of low-tax states are left subsidizing the bad choices made by lawmakers in other states? Why should two people with similar incomes and similar life situations who live perhaps miles apart near a state line be treated so differently? <br> The answer, of course, is politics. <br> Talk about immoral. That's time parents could be spending with their kids. That's money small business owners could be investing in their stores, their employees, their futures. <br> Then there's the unfairness of it. <br> What we're left with is a two-tiered system in which some are the movers and shakers, and the rest of us are just left shaking with rage at the injustice of it all. <br> Will either the Senate or House tax reform measures fix all these problems? Of course not. What legislation ever solved a problem completely? Deals are cut, compromises are necessary, politics continues to be played. <br> But both bills include provisions that constitute an improvement over the status quo. <br> Lower rates on individuals mean more money in the pockets of taxpayers, and corporate rate cuts benefit everybody. These reforms should not be viewed as "tax cuts for the rich." Instead, they are tax cuts that enrich us all. <br> Bitter partisanship should not preclude Washington from doing the right thing and fixing the unfairness that permeates the tax code. It's time to move away from a convoluted and arcane system that discourages economic growth and baffles most of us, toward a simpler, fairer system that creates opportunity for all. 
 Dear Sens. Susan Collins, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, Ron Johnson, John McCain and Lisa Murkowski: <br> I fear for the future of our country. I know that you do as well. You are patriots first and partisans a distant second. <br> We are at a defining moment in our history: The tax cuts just passed by the House and the last-minute changes to health care proposed by the Senate leadership could put our country into a tailspin. <br> Congress members and pundits tell us that Republicans need to pass tax cuts to appease their party's mega-donors. Senators, patriots need to protect the future for our children and grandchildren. <br> I also opposed the bipartisan deal in 2012 to make permanent most of the Bush-era "temporary" tax cuts, for the same reason. My Democratic friends took exception with me both times. I told them that the country's future comes before the party. <br> This CBO projection is actually too optimistic. It assumes modest interest rates for decades and no major new outlays for the military or for coping with climate change, and no meaningful increases in federal spending on science, technology, education, labor, infrastructure, low-income families, children in poverty and other pressing needs. It assumes no major stumbles in the economy, such as occurred in 2008. <br> By some estimates, the long-run "fiscal gap" between outlays and taxes, measuring both in net present value, is now more than $100 trillion. That is more than five times today's national income. <br> Perhaps taxpayers have come to believe that the public debt and unfunded liabilities not yet on the books do not matter. Too many politicians of both parties have pretended as much over the years. Yet debts must be paid and unfunded net liabilities must be closed. <br> This may make it seem that poor taxpayers will gain slightly while rich taxpayers would obviously gain a lot. In fact, the poor and working class will almost surely end up far worse off than now. When steps are taken to close the deficit, programs like Medicare will face the ax, or payroll taxes will rise. The bottom half will end up paying much more than they gain in the meager tax cuts allocated to them. <br> This is just basic fiscal arithmetic: If you make massive transfers to the rich, the rest of society will pick up the bill. <br> As you know well, senators, most economic models show large and persistent budget deficits as a result of the House proposals.Even if there is some modest economic growth down the road, the tax losses will come up front while any growth effects will come later. In fact, we should not expect much, if any, added growth. Some sectors might benefit slightly (manufacturing) while others (commercial and residential buildings) are likely to be hit. <br> Even the Senate legislation would make many of the incentive provisions temporary, raising uncertainty and limiting or eliminating any incentive effect from the very start. The only sure effect would be the enormous tax saving of the rich and the enormous rise in the budget deficit. <br> Even worse, our competitors are likely to match the US corporate tax cuts in a global race to the bottom. All countries will end up losing tax revenues with no net gains in growth. <br> Rather than slashing the statutory tax rate, the best tax policy to spur new business investments would be to expand the provisions for accelerated depreciation and expensing. <br> The high statutory rate would continue to collect federal revenues on pre-existing investments and on monopoly profits; the accelerated depreciation and expensing would lower the marginal effective tax rate on new investments. <br> Yet such a preferred policy would also have to be made up by raising tax revenues elsewhere, both to pay for the accelerated depreciation and to move towards closing the long-term fiscal gap. <br> Real tax reform would also include an end to the abusive transfers of intellectual property to overseas tax havens by America's largest companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Facebook, and Microsoft; an end to the carried interest loophole by wealthy CEOs of hedge funds and private equity funds; an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers; and a tax on carbon emissions so that fossil fuels pay their true social cost. None of these are in the House tax cut. <br> Real tax reform certainly would not repeal the estate tax paid by the mega-rich, a clear and ruthless wealth grab by the President and his Cabinet of billionaires. <br> Real tax reform would not make incentive effects temporary, such as the Senate proposal to eliminate expensing of investments after five years. The phase-out of key incentives exposes the hypocrisy of the tax-cut effort. If the real goal is to improve incentives, then do so, but pay for them honestly. To propose eliminating incentives within a few years makes clear that the real aim is to transfer trillions of dollars to the richest Americans. <br> Americans want a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, as expressed by the great Republican President, Abraham Lincoln. They do not want a government of the ultra-rich, by the ultra-rich, and for the ultra-rich. Americans want to be able to compete in world markets without the government suffocated by debt. Please protect our nation from fiscal disaster at the hands of a few greedy donors to the Republican Party. <br> With respect, <br> Jeffrey D. Sachs, university professor, Columbia University 
 This reform proposal makes it clear that Republicans are not interested in advancing policies that benefit anyone but their most deep-pocketed donors. Meanwhile, Asian-Americans watch as Trump and the party he leads continue to threaten trade war with China, nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and a war on the basic American values of birthright citizenship and family reunification immigration. It doesn't sound like they'll be winning back the vote of the fastest-growing population in America anytime soon. 
 And local groups around the country have been watching closely to see if success in Maine could herald potential success in their own states. <br> Take Kathleen Phelps of Wilton, Maine. <br> Now Phelps will finally be covered by Medicaid. There are millions of Americans just like her, having to make life or death choices because they can't get coverage. Our elected leaders have a moral obligation to fight for people without care, and when they avoid that responsibility, citizens will take action to control their own destiny. <br> There has been much debate in Washington about what "the people" want. But the people have been quite clear. Americans of every political persuasion want affordable and comprehensive health care for themselves, their families and for the most vulnerable in their communities. In fact, just this week, with no marketing or publicity from the federal government, a record number of people signed up for health coverage under the ACA in the first few days of open enrollment. <br> It was such "repeal and replace" attempts this year that sparked a national awakening, showing that our collective voices can have real power: Supporters of the Affordable Care Act blocked an effort in Congress to overturn it and dismantle our nation's safety net. It felt like the entire nation was sitting on the edge of its seat in July as Sen. John McCain followed his colleagues, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, and delivered the last word with his thumbs down vote. <br> And more recently, President Donald Trump bluntly called for undermining the ACA by eliminating the individual mandate as part of the tax reform package, which would raise the cost of health care for those who need it most. <br> Fortunately, in the face of this relentless attack on our health care, Maine has demonstrated that ballot initiatives are a powerful way for Americans to go on offense in support of their quality of life. At a time when everyone expects health care to go in one direction -- with fewer people getting more expensive coverage -- voters stood up with one voice and said "no" to political gamesmanship and insisted on taking care of the most vulnerable. It won't be the last time. 
 How do you run in the era of Trump? As a Democrat, evidently.   <br> The first two gubernatorial elections since President Donald Trump took office went in favor of Democratic candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. The lesson to be learned is that this is not about the personalities; it's about the base. Clearly, the Democratic base is more motivated. <br> In Virginia, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam beat former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. Two blue states, serving up a black eye to the GOP in this off year election. <br> The Virginia and New Jersey races are a shot in the arm for beleaguered Democrats still reeling from the 2016 presidential loss. <br> As for the GOP, this double defeat is another wake-up call for Republicans in the House and Senate to work together on meaningful tax reform. Democratic momentum in the absence of GOP legislative accomplishments is not a good way to kick off a midterm election year. <br> Democrats realized this was not a margin to take for granted, especially with the late-breaking momentum behind Gillespie. <br> Despite the results, Gillespie did run a smart campaign. In a state where Donald Trump is not popular, Gillespie kept the President at arm's length. He did not bring President Trump into Virginia to campaign and did not seek his support. He did, however, work to rally Trump supporters by focusing on issues that are important to them: immigration and protecting Confederate statues. <br> As soon as the dust settled and the race was called for Northam, President Trump didn't waste any time before criticizing Gillespie, tweeting that he "worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for." <br> In essence, he was sending the message that "Trumpism without Trump will not work." <br> This was a hard-fought loss. The Republican National Committee did spend nearly $5 million dollars on helping to elect Gillespie, putting 100 staffers on the ground, and making nearly 3 million door knocks, RNC officials tell me. <br> Democratic leaders in Virginia tell me their get out the vote effort was also strong. They knocked on more than a million doors, made more than a million calls and sent out more than a million-and-a-half texts. <br> It helped that Virginia is a blue state, led by current Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is term-limited out. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in the Old Dominion by five points. Former President Obama won Virginia in 2008 and 2012.    <br> Northam, a pediatrician and former Army reservist, connected with Democrats with his low-key demeanor and ability to moderate some positions. 
 If passed, the bill would eliminate a deduction on interest paid on student loans, a move that has borrowers up in arms. And while the student loan interest deduction could certainly stand to be improved, eliminating it entirely is the wrong approach. <br> In other words, someone who took on large debts to pay for an advanced degree is likely making much better money than a person who never enrolled in college at all, and the student loan interest deduction benefits only the former. <br> These differences are not just theoretical: Despite income limits on who can claim the student loan interest deduction, actual tax claims support the idea that high-income borrowers benefit more. <br> It's clear the deduction could do much more for low-income families. But that's not what the GOP has proposed. <br> Some of these are indeed aimed at middle-class taxpayers, including an increase in the standard deduction, but the combined changes make it hard for the average Americans to fully understand how their net tax liability will change if the GOP bill becomes law. 
 What do we see? <br> The same old, same old: massive treats for the rich and confusing tricks for the rest of us. <br> These treats for the rich go a long way to adding $1.5 trillion to our national debt -- a trick for the future to figure out how to pay. <br> How can we tell who "wins" and who "loses" in a very narrow, immediate sense? To be precise, most ordinary folk likely will have to wait until April, 2019 -- after the midterm elections -- when we fill out tax returns for the 2018 year. <br> Trick or treat? You be the judge. <br> When all the dust settles, we end up where we started, where Republicans have always been. As confusing as it is to figure out the many losers from this proposed law, it is abundantly clear who the winners are: America's plutocrats, including the man in the White House. <br> Happy Halloween, rich kids. 
 Thirty-one years ago this week, President Ronald Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 into law. This date is particularly significant: It was the last time Congress and the president worked together to overhaul our tax code. <br> The world today looks vastly different from the world in 1986. It is much more connected, globalized and driven by new technologies and the internet. But our tax code is stuck in the days where the Chicago Bears were winning the Super Bowl and "Top Gun" was number one at the box office. <br> We need a simpler tax code that puts more money back into the pockets of workers and families. <br> Our sky-high corporate rates, combined with our outdated global tax system incentivizes companies to ship jobs and capital overseas, directly contributing to lagging economic and wage growth. <br> Our updated system would provide clarity and simplicity. Under our proposed plan, the vast majority of taxpayers would be able to fill out their returns in a matter of minutes. <br> This change would make the United States a more attractive place to grow and start a business, meaning more investment and innovation here at home. <br> Tax reform was important in 1986, and it is equally important today. We cannot maintain the status quo, and failure to enact meaningful tax reform would mean further damage to our economy and a lower quality of life for Americans. <br> The American people need us to succeed. And we don't intend to let them down. 
 Still, Trump is correct that the GOP Senate passed this budget Thursday to pave the way for massive tax cuts. And Trump is also correct that the "MSM" -- the mainstream media -- has not covered this story the way it deserves. <br> But that's where we part company. Trump wants the media to pat him on the back for the budget passing and for his proposed tax cuts. In contrast, I want the media to highlight for our fellow Americans that the budget passed by the GOP-controlled Senate would massively cut both Medicare and Medicaid in order to give the richest Americans a big, fat and unnecessary tax cut. <br> And as Trump stated in his tweet, all of these proposed budget cuts are designed to give "the biggest tax cut in U.S. history." And who will benefit from this gargantuan tax cut? Well, again, you don't need to be an expert to know that when the Republicans are in control of government, the rich often benefit the most. <br> Recent reports indicate that House Republicans may simply adopt the Senate approved plan because they are feeling pressure not just from Trump but also from wealthy GOP donors, who have threatened to put up challengers against sitting congressmen if they fail to deliver. <br> The reality is that if American citizens don't vocally oppose the proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, why wouldn't the GOP Congress simply approve it? As a reminder, the GOP's attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace with a far inferior plan was only defeated because Americans -- both on the left and the right -- stood up and objected. <br> That is why those who oppose these cuts must speak up now. If not, then expect Medicare, Medicaid and other safety net programs to be slashed so that the GOP can give a tax cut that primarily benefits the top earners in America -- the ones who need it least. 
 Why? Because our problem is not our tax burden. Our problem is low wages. If economic growth is truly the goal, raising workers' wages should be our national focus, not cutting taxes. <br> The debate over economic growth, then, should really rest on three simple ideas. We have plenty of money in the richest nation in human history. We should not cut taxes if we want to have a society that works. We should make sure everyone earns a decent paycheck. 
 "Saturday Night Live" typically satirizes the political events of the previous week. But this weekend, "SNL" took a shot at forecasting what Trump's next culture war will be: Demanding every store employee say "Merry Christmas" this holiday season. <br> And if Trump's record is any indication, "SNL" is probably spot on. <br> Later we see "Pence" at a Starbucks on the phone with Baldwin, who asks, "Do the cups say 'Merry Christmas' or 'Happy Holidays'?" "Pence" explains that it's still too early in the year for Christmas cups -- and that instead the cups read, "'Pumpkin Spice is back'" To which Baldwin replies, "Get out of there, Mike!" <br> In this sketch, "SNL" makes it clear what we can expect from Trump this holiday season: a war on "Happy holidays." In fact, Trump insinuated as much on Friday when he spoke at the Values Voter Summit, a right-wing event sponsored by the Family Research Council -- an organization committed to upholding "traditional" family values. <br> And when Trump thinks his base likes something he is saying, he will double, triple and even quadruple down on it. <br> In this same vein, there's little doubt that come this holiday season Trump will use Twitter to attack stores that don't mandate their employees say "Merry Christmas." We may even see Trump declare that stores saying "Happy Holidays" are losing business and possibly suggest a boycott of those stores until every employee wishes shoppers "Merry Christmas." <br> The reason we can expect Trump's war on happy holidays is simple. Like with the NFL controversy, it's part of Trump's twofold strategy. First, it plays to his base. With the NFL debate, Trump framed it as an issue of patriotism and respect for our flag and armed forces. That plays well with his right-wing base the same way demanding everyone say "Merry Christmas" will play well with his conservative Christian base. <br> Second, these issues distract from Trump's failed record of legislative accomplishments. There has been no Affordable Care Act repeal as Trump promised (though his recent executive orders have certainly undermined it). There has been no comprehensive tax reform yet. There is no shiny new wall along the Mexican border. And the list goes on. <br> So, come this December, don't expect a politics-free holiday season. Prepare for divisive and ugly partisan divides in stores across America. After all, in Trump's America, why should we expect the holidays to be any different than the rest of the year? 
 The emergence of two new fronts in President Donald Trump's war on the Republican establishment endangers his ability to deliver on his campaign promises. <br> Last weekend may prove to have been a pivotal moment in the Trump presidency. It might determine whether he succeeds in enacting his agenda -- or if his presidency will simply be a series of reactions to weather emergencies and world crises. <br> Trump needs Corker more than Corker needs Trump, especially now that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman has announced his retirement. In fact, Trump needs all Senate Republicans (minus two) to enact tax reform, which was already on life support before the social media slap fight. <br> That makes six of 52 Senate Republicans whose relationship with the President (or disdain for his agenda) has endangered the GOP's ability to keep its campaign promises. <br> Only Ted Cruz is getting a pass from Bannon, according to reports, which is curious since he actually votes with Trump less frequently than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. <br> That's 12 of 52 Republicans who find themselves in Trump World's crosshairs in one way or another. And that doesn't even count McConnell, who has voted with the President 96% of the time, led the charge on filling a Supreme Court vacancy, tried mightily to repeal Obamacare, and is now working feverishly to cobble together the votes on tax reform. <br> The President attacked McConnell this summer and apparently holds him responsible for the times when McCain, Collins, and others on Trump's naughty list didn't go along with his program. I suspect the President's relationship with these wayward senators has more to do with their voting records than their relationships with McConnell. <br> These people are supposed to be one big happy Republican family, although some are distant cousins who have clearly never met and are now forced to sit next to each other at Thanksgiving dinner. To succeed in passing an agenda, this family must pull itself together sooner rather than later. Trump's war on Corker and Bannon's war on the establishment complicate matters even further. <br> Meanwhile, the average Republican voter, who cast a vote for sweeping change in 2016, must be thinking: "What the hell is going on here?" 
 America is standing at a crossroads. We face a historic opportunity to lift American workers up, grow paychecks, create more jobs and out-compete the rest of the world. We have the chance to boost manufacturing in the United States and strengthen the backbone of our economy: American manufacturing workers. Tax reform is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. <br> In addition to the personal toll of high taxes, which raise the costs of living for everyone, American manufacturing workers face increasingly fierce competition from overseas. This threatens both job creation and economic growth here at home. There is no question that federal tax policies put American companies at a clear disadvantage. <br> Our international competitors know this. They have modernized their tax systems to make it more attractive to do business in their countries. The United States, on the other hand, hasn't reformed our tax code since 1986, when the world looked dramatically different. <br> If you're like me, you look at today's outdated tax code and ask: What are we doing to ourselves? What are we doing to American businesses and workers? We get to write our own rules, so why are we writing rules that penalize success, harm families and give our competitors an advantage? <br> The longer we fail to act on tax reform, the more time other countries have to gain an edge on the United States. The more we wait, the less money we will invest in research and development for new technologies or lifesaving breakthroughs. <br> Those who defend the current tax code are defending a manufacturing worker in Ohio losing a job to a worker overseas. They are defending less innovation and fewer technological and medical discoveries. They are defending years of tightening family budgets, stagnant wages and communities losing hope. <br> In a country with so much incredible potential, it's indefensible. But we can do something about it by modernizing our tax code to promote the type of economic growth and job creation that will raise personal incomes, reduce the costs of living and make lives better for everyone. So many Americans are struggling to get by, with no hope for saving for the future, much less retirement. We can change this -- and fast. <br> First, to stay ahead of the curve, we must cut tax rates for all businesses. Manufacturers have long championed a 15% rate for those organized as corporations. We are encouraged that the framework agreed upon by White House and congressional leaders has gotten close to that. <br> We also need similar significant reductions for the two-thirds of manufacturers -- mostly small businesses -- that are organized as pass-throughs and pay taxes at the individual rate. Small manufacturers are the heart of our industry, and small businesses drive our economy, so it's time for the tax code to stop treating them like an afterthought. <br> Second, the United States needs to catch up with the rest of the world and implement a territorial tax system, which would allow companies to be taxed once on overseas earnings. Today, if a US company wants to reinvest its overseas earnings in our American facilities, workers and communities, we get hit with a second, hefty tax bill that many of our overseas competitors do not. Why would we want to discourage companies from investing more in American workers? <br> Third, we need a system that encourages businesses to make the kind of investments, such as new equipment, that empowers them to expand their companies, sell to more customers and ultimately create new jobs. Manufacturers also need strong research and development incentives to promote the kind of innovation that drives our country forward. <br> That is why manufacturers are all in on tax reform. If our leaders can improve the tax code for American workers, we will be able to tackle so many more of the challenges our country faces -- from job creation to community development, from health care to education. <br> It is up to President Donald Trump and Congress to seize this opportunity to modernize the tax code. They said they will -- and said they will do so this year. On behalf of the more than 12 million Americans who work in manufacturing, we encourage our leaders to be bold and determined and do what is right and best for all Americans: Reform the tax code -- now. 
 While much of the American public never ceases to be amazed at the President's tweets, antics or declarations from the stump, those who have known him for years take it in stride. "This is who he is," says a longtime ally, referring to the NFL take-a-knee conflict. "He triples down, and he thinks this all is great." <br> Huh? He's got a disaster in Puerto Rico (not to mention two others in Texas and Florida), a failed health care bill, a pending tax reform fight, a potential deal on Dreamers that could anger his base -- oh, and by the way, a confrontation with North Korea that reaches new rhetorical excesses daily. <br> But he's obsessively tweeting about the NFL -- or Steph Curry refusing to pay homage at the White House (President to Warriors: Don't come). Over and over again. More than 20 times. <br> So what's he thinking? First, says a friend, "he thinks all of this is great for him. He says that his base and most of America agree with him." Indeed, the President told this friend, "I say what they all want to say." The feeling, he adds, is that the President believes he is "doing what he was sent to Washington to do, to chip away at all of these establishment notions in places where people are afraid to go." <br> But not brave Donald Trump. He's so brave that he's willing to cast aside the First Amendment so those "sons of bitches," as the President calls them, don't take a knee as a form of protest when the anthem is played. Instead, he'd like them fired. Maybe it's not such a brave move, especially considering that what he cares about is deeply political: playing to his base of support with his version of patriotism. He knew it would play well when he campaigned in Alabama the other night. That way, if his base is jittery over his deals with the Democrats, he can throw them a bone. Or a flag. <br> It's intuitive, this Trump MO. When doing the CNN documentary on candidate Trump last year, I spoke with Louise Sunshine, a vice president of the Trump Organization for a dozen years in the seventies and eighties. Something she said about Trump's management style stuck with me: "Donald has always managed to walk into a meeting and say something nobody else ever expected him ever to say, upend the entire meeting, leave everybody agog and control every situation that way..." <br> Well, there you go. Only now it's not a small business meeting, but a national conversation. And we follow him around like moths to a flame. One minute, it's North Korea. But wait. There's an incendiary tweet on the NFL. Onto that field. <br> Unfortunately for Trump, criticism is impossible to avoid if you're president. And so this President becomes consumed by grievance. And he's equal opportunity: whether it's about his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, or about Hillary Clinton or the NFL or the size of the crowd at his inauguration. No slight is too small to be dealt with by the most powerful man in the world. <br> He'll come at you, as he did in his real estate glory days when he even posed as his own press secretary to sing his own praises and critique others in Trumpian fashion. But there's a difference: Former employee Sunshine recalled that, back in the day, when he got bad press, she would run into his office and say, "Look, Donald, this is terrible," and he would tell her to calm down, reminding her that all publicity is good publicity. <br> This is a different time and a different job. Somehow, the man can't match this moment. 
 It's not that nothing has been done on the Hill. However, the American people are not enthralled with what we've accomplished so far. To this point, we've come up short and our voters have every right to demand not just the goals but the strategy and the action steps to fulfill these past promises. <br> We can parse the meaning of the 2016 election all we want, but one thing is clear: it was a mandate election. <br> Republicans need to remember the corollary to any mandate: if you do not deliver, voters will find others who will. I know that this message was clear to my colleagues during the August district work period. Even supporters and friends are confused at why the significant items we promised have not been written into law. <br> I am confident that the American people will deliver their final grade on Republicans over the next three months based on three things: repealing and replacing Obamacare, passing tax reform, and increasing border security. If Republicans cannot achieve results on these endeavors, do we deserve our majorities in both houses? <br> The group which I lead, the Republican Study Committee, is renewing these promises to the American people. We are calling on all Republicans in Congress and the White House to do the same. We must deliver before the calendar reads 2018. <br> Repeal Obamacare <br> Obamacare should be the easiest of the three. After all, the House of Representatives voted more than 50 times to repeal the law that destroyed our health insurance markets through skyrocketing premiums and fewer options. If we cannot deliver anything on Obamacare, Republicans are guilty of false promises and political malpractice. To be fair, the House already did our job in passing the American Health Care Act this year. <br> We must continue to push for repeal, including dismantling the most damaging aspects of the law like the individual mandate, employer mandate, medical device tax, and the provision that gives employers an incentive to use part time workers rather than hire full timers. <br> We should also pass common-sense replacement policies, like expanding how much money employees can contribute to their health savings accounts (HSAs) and selling insurance across state lines, which would increase competition. We have just a few days before Mitch McConnell's September 30th deadline to enact health care changes with a 51- rather than 60-vote majority in the Senate and the Graham-Cassidy bill is in trouble, but regardless of whether Congress can come to a solution in that time, we cannot turn our backs on our promise to the American people. <br> Fixing Obamacare is not an option. We cannot pass any type of "stabilization" package that only cements this horrific legislation further. Obamacare repeal and replace is not merely a political goal. There are Americans suffering immensely from this broken law, and we have a moral obligation to act by replacing it with patient-centered health care that prioritizes quality of care over anything else. <br> Tax reform is a must <br> Tax reform is another must-pass item before the end of the year. <br> After years of stagnant growth due to ever-expanding government and regulations during the Obama years, our economy needs a jumpstart, and tax reform is the solution. <br> Tax reform needs to be pro-growth, comprehensive, and permanent. We need our tax code to let Americans keep more of their paycheck and give companies an advantage compared to their overseas competitors. <br> We need to show the world once again that America is a place where businesses can thrive. <br> Border security <br> In a time of increased threats to our national security by those that will do us harm, President Trump ran on a simple idea: border security. Securing our southern border is a must-do for Congress -- we cannot idly sit by while our nation's laws are flagrantly ignored, allowing potentially dangerous individuals to enter the United States with zero repercussions. <br> Democrats try time and time again to have an immigration "fix" now and secure the border later. We cannot fall into this trap again. We need a real fix to our immigration challenge, not a band-aid that exacerbates the problem. <br> While Republicans need to channel our legislative efforts into a long-term solution focusing on border security first, keeping America secure does not end at our borders. Republican solutions must include strong immigration enforcement mechanisms, including e-verify, entry-exit tracking, and cracking down on sanctuary cities. <br> This three-pronged mandate does seem more daunting at this point, but Republicans are only in this situation because Congress did not do its job the first nine months. If members cannot get the job done, voting Americans might find representatives who can. 
 People are scratching their heads, hard-line conservatives are pulling out their hair and Republican leaders are watching from the sidelines as President Donald Trump negotiates directly with Democrats on some of the major issues facing the nation. <br> Even though President Trump indicated that he is more willing now to work with Democrats, the answer is we really don't know. We are just one tweet away from the President changing his mind. <br> But House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has witnessed five presidents come and go during her time in Congress (Donald Trump is the sixth), suggested the President may be coming to grips with the reality that he cannot govern by decree. <br> "I would say that President Trump is, I think, understanding better that it isn't just what the President says, this is not a parliamentary system, that the Prime Minister says something and then his party endorses it. This is a presidential system," Pelosi said in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday that will air this weekend on SiriusXM's 'Full Stop with Mark Preston.' <br> "So I think that he's learning now that he not only has to reach out across the aisle, but he has to have the vote on his own side, and that's something that is, I think, quite obvious," Pelosi said. <br> Forget about great ideas. True success in Washington can only be achieved by securing a majority of votes in the House and Senate, and sometimes that means breaking bread with political enemies. <br> But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Nothing is ever done in Washington until it is done and Donald Trump still needs the support of the GOP leadership, which controls the congressional agenda. <br> Pragmatism over partisanship <br> While President Trump is bombastic in his political pronouncements, he is still an opportunist at heart and when presented with the chance to score a win, at least seven times out of 10 he will take the victory (I would've said 10 out of 10, but again, we are talking about the unpredictable Donald Trump). <br> For Donald Trump, the most pragmatic thing to do was buy some breathing room. He did just that. <br> But don't misinterpret the recent cozying up to Pelosi and Schumer as a sign the President has newfound friends in Washington. By his very nature, personality and actions, President Trump doesn't have any natural allies in the nation's capital, and he never will. <br> Pelosi noted that her relationship with the President "may be something different" depending on the day. <br> "I respect the office he holds, I respect the people (who) voted for him," Pelosi said. "We have a responsibility always to find our common ground; if not, we have a responsibility to stand our ground. What I would hope we can arrive at is a place where there is an understanding of what is at stake and that our decisions would be evidence-based and not based on a notion." <br> So much for the long, warm embrace from the House Democratic leader, who understands, perhaps better than anyone, that political alliances in Washington are often situational. <br> Friend today, enemy tomorrow <br> Pelosi may find compromise with Donald Trump on DACA, but as the Democratic leader said, she is more than willing to "stand her ground" against the President when she disagrees with him. And cooperation between the White House and congressional Democrats is likely to dissipate soon after the calendar page flips to 2018. <br> If Democrats take back the House in 2018, the Trump administration will no longer be shielded by a Republican-controlled Congress. <br> "I think that the power of subpoena is a very important power that the Democrats would then have, and that is something to take very seriously in terms of the executive branch," Pelosi said. "It would give the Democratic Party much more leverage in Congress." <br> Democrats' ability to force the Trump administration to comply with congressional subpoenas is one of the things his supporters fear most. With the exception of the Russia investigation, oversight of the Trump administration has not been, let's say, robust. <br> Democratic control of the House would press an already embattled White House up against the wall. Investigative inquiries would double, maybe triple -- dare I say quadruple -- consuming the time and energy of a barely functioning White House. On a personal level, it would drive President Trump crazy. <br> Cracking the whip <br> Likely leading that charge in 2018 would be the then-78-year-old Pelosi, who learned the rough-and-tumble world of politics from her father, a former congressman and Baltimore mayor. <br> "I remember staying up late or listening from the other room when they would just get out the yellow legal pads and go over, 'This is how many votes we need, this is where we will get them and this is where we have to do more,'" recalled Pelosi of the late-night political discussions between her father and mother. "That had to add up, so you never overestimated what your vote count might be." <br> "I am a good vote counter, I would say that," she said. <br> But it is not just Pelosi who believes this -- former aides, current lobbyists, and even GOP strategists acknowledged that the California Democrat is one of the best in Congress at whipping votes. <br> And like any old-school politician, Pelosi knows her friends and her foes, particularly those in her own political party. <br> These political skills helped Pelosi make history in 2007 when she was elected to be the first woman ever to serve as speaker of the House -- a position she held until 2011 when the GOP took back control of the chamber. <br> Friendly fire <br> Over the years there have been calls for Pelosi, as well as other Democratic leaders, to step down, move aside, make room for the next generation of House Democrats to move up. <br> The Democratic leader said Republicans are targeting her because of her role in helping pass Obamacare, and at the same time the GOP is unfairly criticizing her liberal, San Francisco constituency. <br> "I don't think our caucus should support that," said Pelosi. <br> "The thing is that you can't let the opposition choose your leaders, you can't feed into that. Now there is personal ambition in our caucus, there's no question about that, but I feel very confident in the full support that I have in my caucus." <br> Pelosi would not specifically say whether she has spoken directly to Moulton, Rice or her other Democratic critics, but did take the opportunity to cast some shade on them. <br> "I discuss matters with members who are constructive on how do we go forward," she said. "I will always have a conversation with any member who wants to have a conversation. But I wouldn't elevate them to a high level in our caucus, because they really don't have much of a following." <br> Still, the NRCC told CNN to expect more of the same next year: Pelosi will play a starring role in many of the opposition ads that air against Democratic candidates in the midterm elections. <br> "She is a very polarizing figure," said Matt Gorman, spokesman for the NRCC. "People have very acute memories about what a Pelosi speakership means." <br> Clock is ticking <br> When Donald Trump cut the deal with Pelosi and Schumer last week, he bought time not only for himself but also for Congress, whose members were under pressure to reach an agreement on the 2018 budget and debt ceiling increase by September 30. <br> With the new date now December 8, the clock is reset and ticking again. Failure to find a resolution on these two issues in time could result in a government shutdown and an inability for the U.S. to pay its creditors. <br> At the same time, Pelosi is preparing for a political battle with Republicans over tax reform. <br> The Democratic leader noted her "biggest fear," in terms of domestic issues, is if Republicans are successful in passing their tax reform legislation. And she is hoping to see the same grassroots opposition to the GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare in action during the tax debate. <br> "Hopefully the American people will pay very good attention, because the American people are in charge," Pelosi said. "They saved us from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, people speaking out." <br> How grassroots Democrats mobilize or fail to do so could be an early sign about the voter intensity heading into the midterm elections. The same can be said for Republican voters, as the House GOP leadership prepares to defend the 24 seats Democrats need to take control of the chamber in 2019. 
 A new administration in Washington is something like a new high school freshman class. They arrive full of energy and ambition, but in a short time the system reveals who is who, and the sorting begins. <br> In the case of the Trump administration, the "troublemaking" kids -- Stephen Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Michael Flynn and others -- formed a clique with the President that made life hard for everyone, including him. But now they are gone, and he has found new friends named Sen. Charles "Chuck" Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who may help him to apply himself to the work at hand. <br> Sen. Schumer is, like Trump, a New Yorker who can talk tough and doesn't take it personally when others do, too. Rep. Pelosi is also a big city politician who doesn't mind a scrap. Although they are both Democrats -- the sort many Republicans consider denizens of the Dark Side -- they are practical-minded politicians who understand they lead the minority in Congress. <br> They also may understand Trump better than the Republican leaders who have failed to deliver for the President on Capitol Hill. <br> These activities gave Trump something to do as his inexperienced team groped its way around the White House without detailed policy plans or governing expertise. <br> Former National Security Adviser Flynn, who came to power as a controversial figure, became the first victim of the scandal surrounding Russia's aid to the Trump campaign. Factions gathered behind the co-chiefs, Bannon and Reince Priebus, and the President relied on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan to deliver legislative achievements. <br> In the chaos, an order banning Muslim visitors, fashioned by the Bannon crowd, was rejected by the courts, leaving the President humiliated. The promise to "repeal and replace" the health care system known as Obamacare was supposed to be fulfilled by Ryan and McConnell in consultations with Priebus, who was one of the few in the administration with mainstream credentials. <br> Ryan struggled to get a compromise, which Trump vainly celebrated with a party at the White House, through the House. Then, demonstrating his own ineptitude, Trump managed to alienate the fence sitters McConnell needed to finish the job in the Senate. <br> After repeal and replace died, Trump's sliding poll numbers continued to drop, which meant that the brand he had cultivated for decades was in danger of being ruined. He may have been heartened by what he heard while tuned in to "Fox Friends" in the morning, but he knew he wasn't winning. <br> Today, the President, who knows his poll numbers, has freed himself of Bannon, Priebus, Flynn and others who were less than helpful playmates. Ryan and McConnell, who don't seem to fully grasp that Trump is more interested in personal popularity than policy, are watching as the President seeks success through alliance with people he once verbally tormented. <br> Pelosi had the foresight to use the opening to press for help for the Dreamers and now she and Schumer are collaborating with Trump on it. <br> This is the kind of thinking that could make Donald, Chuck and Nancy BFNs -- best friends for now-- while leaving Paul and Mitch on the outside of the cool kids' clique. 
 We are living through a historic shift: there are more natural disasters, they are coming more frequently, and are fundamentally altering our economy and the way we live. <br> We can no longer view natural disasters through the singular lens of "disaster -- recovery." Rather, a complete paradigm shift is necessary. We must adjust to this new norm of major natural disasters by paying radical attention to resilience. <br> Certainly, discussing future preparedness in the middle of a crisis seems off the mark. But that, actually, is part of the point: America is often at its best when it's being challenged. From confronting world wars to reacting on 9/11, Americans have been clear-eyed ready to hear what needed to be done to prevent a tragedy from occurring again. <br> Here today, the public is ready to respond to the immediate disaster, but also needs and wants to hear the reality of what must be done moving forward. Our elected officials must be honest about the changes the nation needs to make as a result of climate-related disasters. <br> So, as funds are dispersed for recovery from the twin disasters of Harvey and Irma, keeping track of how best to build back will be the central focus of many agencies -- not just FEMA. The federal attention that will be required to respond to and help these communities recover will cost hundreds of billions of dollars -- that's right -- hundreds of billions of dollars, spread across agencies. <br> Third, the Trump administration needs to help keep our country focused. While tax reform undoubtedly affects millions of Americans, speeches in Missouri and North Dakota in the middle of preparations, response, and recovery to Harvey and Irma, distract from the need to bring Americans together to help. Yes, the President can walk and chew gum at the same time. That's not the point. The point is that now is the time for the President to bring Americans and Congress together to do something big. <br> The American people are generous and more than able to bounce back from all manner of trials, but during a time of national crisis, they rely on encouragement from elected leaders. <br> The real cost will come later on, when the American taxpayer is footing the bill for future disasters that our leaders failed to plan for. Now is the time to use the power of the presidency to rally the American people, to prepare them for the long road ahead, and for a more resilient future. <br> That is the only way to continue to keep America great. 
 "Daddy, can I go with you?" <br> With that introduction, little Ivanka took the stage. <br> Among the many confounding aspects of the Trump presidency has been the role of Ivanka, his elder, and clearly favored, daughter. (When's the last time you heard him talk about Tiffany, his daughter with ex-wife Marla Maples, never mind trot her out before a crowd of voters?) Ivanka and her husband are official White House advisors -- and two of the President's closest. <br> Ivanka Trump presents herself on social media and elsewhere as socially progressive. And she has been pegged by many as a (notably female) counter to Trump's more openly conservative stances on everything from immigration and national security to, yes, women. <br> But whether she's actually succeeded in pulling her father away from the strongest impulses of the right remains up for debate. This was perhaps never more clearly seen than in her father's bumbling post-Charlottesville attack statements. After all, if ever there was a time for Trump's Jewish daughter to sway her father to moderation, it was then. Instead, he chose to defend the "good" people among the white supremacist crowd. <br> But then, how much pull could we actually expect her to have with a man who refers to himself as her "Daddy?" The moniker, used in relation to a person on one's senior staff, is unprofessional at best, demeaning and infantilizing at worst. <br> One could argue that sometimes, "Daddy" is just a name, a term of endearment -- not an indication of some perceived immaturity. <br> The difference, of course, is that Trump has made his little girl one of the more powerful women in Washington, at least by title. When you do that, you don't get to bring your family nicknames, especially if they can be read as juvenile, onto the national stage. <br> The Trumps don't have the luxury of not being examined. Having a Commander in Chief refer to himself as the "Daddy" of a 35-year-old woman, having him assert that she -- one of his most important advisors -- pleadingly called him that as she asked be taken along on a trip, is off-putting to say the least. <br> We don't know how she felt about being a character in his "Daddy" story -- many daughters would be mortified. But by parading her in this way, he not only risks people not taking her, or women in general, seriously -- he does the same to himself. Behind every powerful woman is her ... daddy? What a great message to be sending to our young girls. Daddy-in-Chief? Not comforting. <br> To be fair, Ivanka has assumed a role that, while not uncommon between generations of powerful people, is far more common between men and their adult sons. Consequently, there is an element of progress, and progressiveness, in all of this, deep down. <br> The catch-22 for Ivanka, of course, is that her ability to make change is both enabled, and threatened, by her father. Or, that is, her daddy. Can she overcome? It's a tough job for a little girl. 
 Don't hold your breath. <br> Just to clear this up: No, we are not headed toward a blissful and cooperative relationship between Donald Trump and Democratic leadership for the next three-plus years. <br> The agreement to a three-month extension of the debt limit, instead of the 18 months Republican leadership smartly wanted to get this past the 2018 congressional election, was a bad deal for Trump. <br> There is not a lot of power in the hands of minority leaders, but what the deal guarantees is another bite at the apple for must-pass legislation in December. In other words, it's an opportunity for Pelosi and Schumer to attach an authorization of the DREAM Act or another priority important to Democratic leadership to the next debt ceiling extension. <br> Despite that, in Trump's eyes, it was a still a deal. And for an hour or two he could bask in the glow of striking his first deal in quite some time. <br> Second, he is not exactly thrilled with the leadership and work of House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. <br> While President Trump may not score well on a test about how a bill becomes a law, it was understandable that he was stunned, not unlike many Democrats, that seven years after Obamacare passed, the Republicans did not have a viable plan on the shelf for repealing and replacing. And was less than pleased that attempts to repeal his predecessor's signature achievement failed not once, but twice. <br> So did he poke McConnell and Ryan in the eye on purpose? Maybe, but we probably won't know until he tells us during his next press availability. <br> Third, even the White House is not spinning the deal with Schumer and Pelosi as the beginning of a new strategy to reach across the aisle. They were in the unenviable position of explaining why their boss agreed to a proposal made by the Democratic leadership, that the Republican speaker of the House called, "ridiculous and disgraceful" just hours earlier. And their answer? According to the White House director of Legislative Affairs, the deal will "clear the decks" for tax reform. <br> That might have merit, if... there was a tax reform package, not just principles, that had been heavily litigated through the web of tax lobbyists, interest groups, and members of the Republican caucus who viscerally disagree on rates, how to pay for the tax cuts and which loopholes should be on the chopping block. None of those things have happened. <br> And finally as a heavy consumer of media, President Trump is unlikely to be pleased by how his Wednesday morning deal-making is playing -- as a big victory for the people he negotiated with. Even that alone will be a big deterrent to going down the road of deal-making with the Democrats anytime soon. <br> And all of this is bad news for a DACA deal. For Democrats, immigration advocates, and people with a shred of a soul, President Trump's comments about DACA on Air Force One were encouraging. "Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I. <br> "I think they're going to make a deal. I think Congress wants to do this." <br> But here is the rub. <br> If Schumer and Pelosi have their way, there would be a clean authorization of DACA. There would be no funding for a wall on the Mexican border attached to it. In fact, it is hard to believe they would accept funding for a wall in any form given that it would be perceived as a big victory for Trump and a promise delivered. And the scope of other "border security" options that would be acceptable to Democrats and pro-wall building Republicans is narrow at best. <br> Trump ran as the law and order, anti-immigrant candidate who wanted to build a wall and round people up to kick them out of the country. And there is a faction of the country that voted for him as a result. Trump can't and won't be the arbiter of a deal on DACA. He may hold his nose and sign it, but he won't be striking a deal on it. His politics won't allow it. 
 President Donald Trump is in for a bumpy political ride when Congress reconvenes after Labor Day. A remarkable number of leaders of the President's party have begun sharply criticizing Trump, signaling that he can no longer expect lawmakers to follow the White House's lead on major legislation. <br> The latest blast from Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who was elected to his sixth term in the Senate on the same day Trump won last November. <br> "We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don't answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power." <br> In political terms, that's a declaration of independence -- one that could, over time, turn into a declaration of war. <br> "Hill Republicans are increasingly worried that Trump's penchant for drama -- and the constant bickering in the West Wing -- is going to crush their agenda," Politico reports. <br> There's a reason for the growing distance between Trump and Capitol Hill Republicans. In the tough jungle warfare of Washington, professional politicians of both parties are quick to sense weakness and tend to move with ruthless speed to fill power vacuums. <br> Experienced legislators look at Trump's tumultuous eight months in office and see weakness. <br> Washington politicians have clearly sized up those kinds of problems and concluded that the Trump White House is in no position to dictate the shape or speed of legislation to Congress. <br> That was tame compared with what McCain wrote. <br> Concerns about getting tax cuts and other legislation passed goes hand in hand with the hard reality that Trump's low approval numbers could spell political trouble for Congressional Republicans in next year's midterm elections. 
 What do you say to someone who's lost everything? <br> At this moment in Houston and other places affected by Hurricane Harvey, parents are sitting in emergency shelters wondering: How will we rebuild our home? How will we get to work? How will we get the kids to school -- and is there a school to go to? <br> This is the scene President Donald Trump flew into Tuesday. And to be sure, the people who have suffered in Harvey's wake needed to hear from him. In a national disaster, the words of the President of the United States matter. He needs to be reassuring to survivors. <br> But there is something else he must do. He needs to help set realistic expectations for the long road to recovery. He needs to tell them the truth. <br> The truth is that over the course of the storm, more than 24 trillion gallons of water have fallen on Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana. This recovery will take years and billions of dollars. People continue to be evacuated and tens of thousands of residents will need temporary shelter and transportation to jobs and schools. <br> The truth is, actually, that he would do well to take a page from President Barack Obama. As Hurricane Sandy made landfall in 2012, those of us at FEMA knew that any failure on our part would be directed at the President. He had an election just weeks away, but his only message to us was to save lives. <br> He hugged survivors. He called local leaders every day. He made Hurricane Sandy about all of us and led us in how to help them begin the recovery process. Trump faces an even bigger disaster. <br> It is easy to see why President Trump must show full engagement. He, too can lead by example, by making this -- not other issues -- his focus, and the nation's focus. He can set aside tax reform for the moment, and tell people how to get involved, where to donate money and volunteer. He has the most powerful bully pulpit in the world and he needs to use it to drive attention and aid to the region. He needs to show that he's pushing hard -- every day. <br> Words -- and the "optics" meant to telegraph them -- are equally as important in recovery. <br> Recovery will not be "quick" as President Trump said. And his waving a Texas flag, as he did Tuesday in Corpus Christi, won't help the people standing in lines to register for FEMA assistance. <br> On Wednesday, floodwaters were still rising and people continued to be rescued by helicopter. Yet President Trump went to Missouri -- to talk about tax reform -- with a brief prelude to acknowledge the heroic work of first responders, and add that "recovery will be tough but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand all over this country." <br> This was an improvement on his tone-deaf remarks the previous day, but he needs to show he is focused enough on Harvey. <br> As Americans, we will all have to bear the burden of recovery and rebuilding, so it is critical that the President leads by making Houston's success an American success. That starts by staying on topic as the nation's 4th largest city reels after a storm of biblical proportions. He must remind us that we're in it together, not change the subject. <br> From my years at FEMA, this I know: Having a realistic perspective is as much a part of recovering from a crisis as the giant to-do list that face most families. Having a realistic understanding about how Hurricane Harvey will transform our country will force those of us not in harm's way to take a serious look at our own priorities and preparation. <br> President Trump must get survivors ready for the long haul, convey a clear understanding of the immense challenges ahead, not use his time before the cameras to set timelines for self-congratulation for his administration's job well done, as the President alluded to in Corpus Christi, or spend Twitter time politicking about NAFTA and tax reform. <br> Regardless of what the President tweets, the survivors of Harvey will rebuild their lives, but they will be different than before. Trump himself set the expectation that his way will be the best way. We should hold him to that. 
 As Congress returns next week, attention will turn to matters of budget, spending and taxes. The tax reform package that legislators will take up will have major implications for years to come, and we should get it right. <br> Unlike health care, tax reform can be simple, but I'm afraid those who are in charge will make it unnecessarily complicated, especially when coupled with an alarming timidity that could render the reform's impact nearly meaningless. <br> Revenue neutral ultimately means that someone pays more for someone else to pay less. It means tax "reform" without real tax cuts. <br> Let me ask you a serious question. If someone has to pay more for someone else to pay less -- which category do you think you and other Americans might fall into? I fear that tax reform that mandates revenue neutrality will result in those with the best lobbyists, lawyers and accountants being the winners, while most everyone else either gets nothing or largely loses out. <br> It doesn't have to be that way. We can be bold yet simple. We can cut taxes, and promote jobs and growth, without picking winners and losers. <br> To get this done, our tax reform needs to have three main areas of focus. <br> First, every American who pays taxes should get a tax cut. Every rate should be lowered by a percentage. What percentage? That's where we conservatives can negotiate with fence-sitters if necessary. I'd favor a large cut of at least 15% for every taxpayer. But the main and important thing is that everyone gets a tax cut. <br> Next, we need to simply slash the corporate tax rate to 15%, and not worry about any complicated reform that no one will agree on, or that takes 500 pages to explain. <br> Let's cut the rate to 5%, make it voluntary and get that money home to create more jobs. A 5% voluntary rate still brings in billions of additional revenue, which could be targeted to building and repairing infrastructure. <br> Three simple items. Every Republican and even some Democrats agree with the basic premise of this plan, and we can get down to arguing about the exact numbers. <br> We can do this, but not if we operate the way the Swamp normally does. Secret meetings. Leaders writing complicated bills no one sees. Lobbyists getting their pet provisions in bills. <br> If tax reform is run like most things around here -- like Obamacare repeal, for example -- then I can't predict what will happen other than it will be complicated, won't help much and could even fail. There's no excuse for that. <br> I urge President Trump and his advisers to heed this warning. Do not let what happened during the last battle up here happen again. You'll get the same results, and no one should want that. <br> Lead with boldness and vision. Lead with simple ideas. And make sure your simple ideas don't get hijacked by others' agendas. I'm right here, ready to fight. 
 It will be remembered as one of the most awkward scenes of an administration replete with them. Two Cabinet members of the Jewish faith standing at President Donald Trump's side as he drew a moral equivalence between the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who rallied in Charlottesville and those who came to protest their hate-filled message. <br> Standing to the President's right, National Economic Council director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin looked stricken. They had shown up for a press conference on infrastructure, only to be cast as supporting actors in a bizarre and distasteful scene. It was as if they had been invited for a ride, only to discover, to their horror, that they suddenly were involved in a stickup. <br> Mnuchin made a vain effort to defend the President's comments on the Sunday shows, undoubtedly winning points for loyalty from the boss, but earning the disapprobation of many others in and out of the Jewish community for failing to roundly condemn the indefensible. <br> In contrast, Cohn, whose pained expression was most evident at the President's press conference, said little after that August 15 debacle. <br> "I'm a patriotic American," Cohn said, explaining that he felt a duty to continue to serve the country despite his anger and unhappiness with the president's remarks. <br> Cynics may conclude that Cohn's decision to hang on might also have something to do with rumors that he is in line to succeed Fed chair Janet Yellen when her term expires next year. Others would point to the seductive nature of power. For my part, I tend to believe published stories that Cohn wrestled with leaving, even going so far as drafting a letter of resignation, but pulled back because he felt he could do more good -- or, perhaps, prevent more bad -- by staying inside the turbulent White House. <br> When rumors swirled about Cohn's imminent departure, the markets, which have been on an ebullient trajectory, took a dive. He is in a widely reported battle with economic nationalists who resonate with Trump over protectionist policies. He is the point man on the President's looming campaign for tax reform. A Democrat, he sees himself as a moderating influence in the White House. <br> So it's easy to see how Cohn might have been persuaded -- or persuaded himself -- to stay, in the same way the President's national security team of Mattis, Tillerson and McMaster and chief of staff Kelly seem determined to tolerate Trump's tantrums in order to prevent more cataclysmic eruptions. <br> Perhaps they see themselves as the thin line -- not simply between America and an inherently dangerous world but between the world and an impulsive, dangerous president. <br> The price Cohn apparently demanded for staying was the freedom to make his own displeasure clear over the President's offensive remarks. And Mr. Trump uncharacteristically may accept this small bit of apostasy to keep Cohn, his key link to Wall Street and the markets. <br> But for Cohn and the remaining establishment pillars within the administration, the road ahead likely will get harder. <br> This President is not going to change and they will be forced to confront over time whether by staying, they are managing his worst instincts -- or simply enabling them. 
 House Speaker Paul Ryan used his televised town hall meeting Monday to gingerly walk across the tightrope congressional Republican leaders will face this fall: how to put distance between themselves and President Donald Trump without alienating the White House. <br> The goal of this Republican political unity, Ryan also made clear, is passage of a federal budget full of tax cuts for the wealthy and deep reductions in social service programs. <br> Ryan went out of his way to praise Trump's latest attempt to undo the damage caused by his statements suggesting "both sides" of the recent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville were at fault for the resulting violence. <br> But when asked if he would take steps to hold the President accountable by supporting a resolution for censure, Ryan firmly refused. <br> "I will not support that. I think that would be -- that would be so counterproductive," he said. "If we descend this issue into some partisan hack-fest, into some bickering against each other, and demean it down to some political food fight, what good does that do to unify this country?" <br> Pressed on whether he'd go as far as his former running mate, Mitt Romney, in demanding an apology from Trump, Ryan again refused. <br> "It is very, very important that we not make this a partisan food fight," he said. "It is very important that we unify in condemning this kind of violence, in condemning this kind of hatred. And to make this us against them, Republicans against Democrats, pro-Trump, anti-Trump, that is a big mistake for our country, and that will demean the value of this important issue." <br> Ryan's take-home message is that people can disagree with Trump's comments and actions individually, but he won't use the power of his office to voice a collective objection. <br> "The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 22.5%. And we are taxing American businesses 35% to almost 45%? That is a recipe for disaster," Ryan said. "The biggest business we had in Wisconsin, publicly traded, was Johnson Controls. They are now an Irish company. Their worldwide tax rate is 12.5%... We're losing businesses left and right. And this is among the reasons why we have to have fundamental tax reform. " <br> "We're in the 32nd year of (the) War on Poverty. Trillions spent, and guess what -- our poverty rates are about the same as they were when we started this war on poverty 32 years ago. So the status quo isn't working, sister," Ryan said. "We are not solving the problem of poverty." <br> That's highly debatable, and mostly wrong. <br> Beyond the income debate, measuring the War on Poverty requires taking into account what really matters: whether people have been helped to live better lives since Johnson launched the crusade in 1964. <br> Ryan's remarks aren't just a political debating point. Conservatives who think government has done little to improve life for the poor are likely to try and defund key programs. <br> That's a battle that will be joined in earnest as Ryan tries to pass a budget later this year. Democrats will fight ferociously for the social programs they've created, and Ryan will try to reduce or gut them -- and also continue to tread carefully to avoid antagonizing the White House. <br> It should be quite a tightrope act. 
 The Trump administration has shifted its approach on health care repeal, tax reform, infrastructure and other major campaign promises. <br> That's not going to happen with immigration. <br> Why? Trump's avid support of newly proposed immigration legislation reflects a longstanding fear among some conservative Republicans that our current, family-based immigration system will result in millions of new African, Asian and Latin American newcomers -- people who will eventually acquire full citizenship and end up voting for Democrats. <br> The solution, according to Coulter and other movement Conservatives, is to change the rules of the system, which, they say, encourages so-called "chain migration" by giving preference in the immigration system to family members of current immigrants. <br> For many Republicans, changing the rule is a political life-or-death issue. As Coulter warns, "there's no sense in arguing about any other political issue. If we lose immigration, we lose everything." <br> That logic means Republicans will likely put up a ferocious battle to change the rules on immigration. This will engage not just the White House, but the broader party, which sees the fight as a matter of political survival. 
 It's an alarming read, particularly when you remember that the person who is struggling to speak authoritatively or coherently on virtually any topic is the same person that is in charge of America's military might and its nuclear launch codes. <br> There are three main takeaways from the interview. <br> First, Trump has, at best, an extremely thin understanding of every major policy issue, from health care to tax reform. When pressed for any details, Trump retreats to empty platitudes and deflects by saying: "We'll see what happens." <br> Second, the interview is a window into a mind that is singularly obsessed by his election victory last November -- which took place 268 days ago. Repeatedly, Trump is stuck in a distant past that he perceives to be glorious, which is distracting him from creating a better future for America. <br> Third, Trump makes demonstrably false statements with incredible frequency -- even about trivial matters. <br> His casual relationship with the truth, as though it's a pesky but disposable annoyance, has destroyed the credibility of the White House in just six months. <br> Let's take a closer look at the key takeaways from this strange interview, with direct quotes from the President himself. <br> The reporter asked Trump several policy-related softball questions -- questions that any normal politician would hit out of the park with ease. Trump's responses whiff instead, meandering around the question nonsensically without answering it. His response to a basic question (What are the main goals of your tax plan?) starts like this: <br> "I want to achieve growth. We're the highest-taxed nation in the world, essentially, you know, of the size. But we're the highest taxed nation in the world [note: this isn't true]. We have -- nobody knows what the number is. I mean, it used to be, when we talked during the debate, $2.5 trillion, right, when the most elegant person -- right? I call him Mr. Elegant. I mean, that was a great debate. We did such a great job..." <br> This doesn't make sense. This would fail an elementary school test for lack of clarity, non sequiturs and rambling incoherence. But beyond the hard-to-follow twists and turns of this answer, the interview also shows an astonishing shallowness to his understanding of enormous policy debates. He repeatedly makes mistakes when he does provide detail, but most of the time he steers clear of detail and retreats to safer ground he knows well -- his election victory. <br> When asked if he hopes to work with Democrats in Congress to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill (which Democrats have indicated they are willing to work on with President Trump), his response begins as follows: <br> "Well, they tried -- they tried it with me. She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads. She didn't do a positive ad, virtually. And she lost easily, you know, 306 to 223 I think, right, -- 223 something like that." <br> The question was about infrastructure. It was about bipartisanship. Trump turned it into an opportunity to discuss his defeat of an election opponent last November. Imagine if President Barack Obama had fixated on beating John McCain in August 2009. It would have been perceived as being unhinged, because it is. And yet, time and again, Trump singularly fixates on the election, mistaking the starting gun of his presidency for the finish line. <br> The credibility of the White House matters. Trump has willingly sacrificed it, tossing it away for no reason, to boast about matters as a trivial as a speech to Boy Scouts. The loss of credibility for America's President will have serious consequences, both for Trump's domestic agenda and for the standing of the United States in the world. It's not an amusing matter. <br> This latest rambling interview is yet another window into the White House. It makes clear that the recent staff changes will do little to rescue the Trump presidency, because the real problem with the Trump presidency starts at the very top. 
 Here's hoping Mr. Trump knows how to use him. <br> Because if he taps into General Kelly's inherent qualities, the President could actually come out on the far side of these first six tumultuous months looking pretty good. Well, better than that, actually. He could come out with a plan to achieve a heckuva lot in his next six months ... and longer. <br> He could make a full-court press for an infrastructure bill, make some progress on tax reform. <br> He could get his hands around a strategy for Afghanistan and maybe even sharpen the effort against ISIS in Syria. <br> He might finally find a road ahead with Russia, and he will certainly find in General Kelly a man who will contribute meaningfully to the very complex challenges North Korea poses. <br> And here's another item worth mentioning: with Kelly at the helm, the President might finally get his house in order. <br> He'll be able to do all these things with General Kelly and more, because Kelly is a leader. A natural leader. It's not even something I think he thinks about much. He just does it ... wouldn't know how not to lead, quite frankly. <br> And Kelly is a believer, too. People closer to the general than I am tell me he is unabashedly committed to President Trump's agenda, if not also President Trump the man. He has worked assiduously at the Department of Homeland Security to execute Mr. Trump's immigration and border objectives, and he believes in his heart that Mr. Trump has exactly the right vision for the country. <br> There will be a lot of things the President has to worry about in coming months. General Kelly's personal loyalty does not appear to be one of them. <br> I worked with General Kelly on the staff of Leon Panetta, then-secretary of defense. Kelly, a three-star at the time, was Mr. Panetta's senior military assistant. He was a marvel of organization and efficiency, of candid counsel and dogged persistence. <br> Here he was, a combat veteran, a man who had seen the hell of war and the pain of losing his own son to it ... a man with, understandably, strong views about terrorism and extremist violence. And yet he did that job with all the flash and flair of a man stooping to sweep off his front porch. <br> To him, drama is a movie genre he can choose on Netflix -- if he even watches movies much -- not a way of life. <br> Kelly doesn't suffer fools, and he sure as hell doesn't suffer individualism, ego and anything less than 100% teamwork. <br> I remember asking the general to write a note of encouragement to my son, who was then just about to ship off to Navy boot camp. I won't betray the contents of exactly what he wrote; that should stay in our family. But basically it was about the importance -- the privilege -- of sacrificing one's personal needs and desires for the greater good. It was about duty. <br> And I guess that's the only thing I really worry about. His sense of duty is so clear that Kelly could fall easy prey to those in the West Wing who ascribe to, shall we say, less exalted motives. <br> He's no shrinking violet, mind you, and certainly no stranger to staff shenanigans. But, in addition to being loyal to Mr. Trump, he knows and professes a higher loyalty to country. <br> Would that everyone in the West Wing could take that same approach. <br> In the end, I suppose, it will come down to how much Mr. Trump invests in Kelly ... in how central to the effort he deigns to make the White House chief of staff. <br> At the Aspen Security Forum last week, panel moderator Pete Williams, of NBC News, noted Kelly's penchant for beginning every set of public remarks by praising the men and women of DHS. <br> "Well," replied Kelly, "it's called leadership." <br> So, there's your new chief of staff, Mr. President ... if you're wise enough to use him. 
 President Donald Trump is undermining his party's ability to succeed. The President, who has squandered five months of united government, has single-handedly made the entire legislative process more difficult for Republicans. <br> While Trump maintains strong support from his base, congressional Republicans are struggling to work with him on substantive legislative change -- most recently, the repeal and replace of Obamacare. <br> During the important weeks when Republicans are trying to build support for a major change in health policy, he keeps distracting Americans with one outrageous statement after the other. That's hardly the kind of inspiring oratory that will motivate nervous legislators. <br> More broadly, there has been no effort to build a message in the last few months on what should be the party's signature legislation. Contrast President Barack Obama, who delivered numerous speeches on his health care bill, including an address to Congress and a televised exchange with Republicans. <br> Rather than taking the time to build a case with the public like Obama did with the Affordable Care Act or Lyndon B. Johnson did with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or Ronald Reagan did with tax reform in 1981, Trump has been consumed with tweeting about what he brands as fake news and reiterating that he really did defeat Clinton. <br> Indeed, right when Republicans need Trump to help put a new health care bill together, he sent an explosive and outrageous tweet about Mika Brzezinski, which caused an uproar Thursday. <br> But all this might be unfair to Trump. It could be that the substance of this legislation is so problematic and so unpopular that even the most engaged and charismatic president could never have saved this bill. Maybe, just maybe, enough Americans don't believe it's acceptable to strip away health care coverage from millions of Americans whose only crime is to face illness. <br> Regardless, Trump has not helped Republicans on the Hill make their case. <br> If health care passes the Senate and then survives the conference committee, it will be in spite of the President's leadership skills. <br> Republicans like Nebraskan Ben Sasse are desperately trying to salvage the situation. He admitted that Trump's latest tweet was "not normal," and then proposed repealing the ACA -- with a one year delay in implementation. Trump seemed to like the idea, tweeting "if Republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately repeal, and then replace at a later date!" <br> If the bill fails, a large part of the burden will rest squarely on his shoulders. This is something the elephants in Congress certainly won't forget. <br> This piece has been updated to reflect Sen. Ben Sasse and President Trump's latest comments on health care.</div> 
 Many Americans may not believe it, but most public servants in Washington are here for the right reasons. Republican or Democrat, we all want to build a stronger country. None of us would run for office if we didn't believe we could contribute to the greater good. <br> But that spirit is all too often shrouded in the vitriol that seems to worsen by the day in Washington. Members of both parties feel blindly compelled to attack the other party's approach to nearly every problem. There is a constant political incentive to attack first and consider the consequences later; it is much safer to not reach a hand across the aisle. <br> Then tragedy strikes. A terrorist group launches an attack against innocent civilians. An angry psychopath terrorizes a college campus. A madman tries to assassinate one of our peers. <br> In the days that follow, our rhetoric changes. We note, as both Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi did, that "we are one House." <br> We remind ourselves that Congress is a family. Families have disagreements—sometimes they bicker. But in trying moments, they come together. And that's exactly what many in Washington have done since the shooting attack in Alexandria, Virginia. <br> Unfortunately, as the memory of each shock fades, the two sides quickly retreat into their respective corners and Washington returns to the status quo—at least until the next tragedy. But we want it to be different this time. We don't want the spirit of solidarity on display in the aftermath of the shooting to fade back to the old routine. <br> When we talk about the need for unity, let's really mean it. It's what the American people want. It's what the times demand. <br> Earlier this year, having recognized that we shared this sentiment with many our colleagues, we decided to form a Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus. <br> Comprised of 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats, our aim was to create a durable bloc that could champion ideas that would appeal to a much broader spectrum of the American people—even if those ideas were anathema to people on the fringes of our parties. <br> We are united in the idea that there are common-sense solutions to many of the country's toughest challenges—but partisanship keeps those solutions from making their way into law. We believe that's bad for America. <br> The Problem Solvers Caucus is more than just a bipartisan coffee club. We recently adopted a rule that if 75 percent of our bloc and a majority of members in both parties support a position, we will stand behind it. And we as co-chairs of this group have pledged not to engage in campaigns against other members of the caucus. <br> Already, our commitment to bipartisanship has had an effect. When the government came close to shutting down in April, we issued a statement demanding that poison-pill amendments to the budget be set aside and those considering whether to press the issue chose not to. <br> We've met with both Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to offer our help bridging the partisan divide. And we're working hard to craft a bipartisan plan on tax reform and infrastructure and to avoid another debt ceiling debacle later this summer. <br> Members of our caucus won't agree on everything --in fact, they may not agree on most things. But we owe it to ourselves and to the American people to find bipartisan agreement wherever possible. And we should always strive to treat one another with respect and civility. <br> A recent Harvard/Harris poll found that 89% of Americans want their representatives to reach across the aisle. <br> The Problem Solvers Caucus intends to champion that approach and we invite our colleagues to join us in that mission. <br> After all, American democracy is premised on the idea that people with different ideas can work together toward a common solution. Washington shouldn't have to rely on tragedy to be reminded of that. 
 When he ran for president, one of the many things that made Donald Trump stand apart from other politicians was the way he turned the implied into the literal. <br> You can look at this as an admirable forthrightness -- the difference between him and the rest of his party isn't in what they believe, just in how willing he is to speak it out loud. Trump may tell more lies than any other politician any of us has ever seen, but there's never any mystery about what he wants his audience to think. He lacks the subtlety to conceal his feelings behind clever formulations and eloquent words. <br> "This is the president of Goldman Sachs. Smart. Having him represent us, he went from massive paydays to peanuts ... these are people that are great, brilliant business minds and that's what we need, that's what we need to have so the world doesn't take advantage of us anymore." <br> He went on: "And I love all people -- rich or poor -- but in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? If you insist, I'll do it -- but I like it better this way, right?" <br> To start with, let's be clear that we aren't talking about actual poor people. No one's suggesting that the President ought to pluck someone working for minimum wage at a fast-food restaurant to be the next chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. When Trump says "poor," what he really means is "not rich." <br> The difference is that only Trump argues that these people will do a good job precisely because they're rich, that their wealth is itself a qualification. <br> Just look at what Republicans in control of the government are doing right now on health care. Their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act is essentially a giant tax cut for the wealthy, financed by taking insurance away from millions of poor and middle-class people. <br> Once that's done, they'll be moving on to tax "reform" -- another giant tax cut for the wealthy, which they'll justify by arguing that we must unburden the noble "job creators" of the oppressive weight of taxation under which they currently suffer. When that's through, they'll be attacking other elements of the safety net, including food stamps. <br> When they're in charge -- however differently they may frame it for the base -- the wealthy will be hired, catered to, indulged and pampered, while the poor will be the target of vicious budget cuts and stern lectures about pulling on those bootstraps. It doesn't come from any notion about what makes for effective policies -- it's about values. <br> Trump is just a little more willing to say it. 
 While I love KU basketball and our head coach, the fact that he paid no income tax on $2.75 million in compensation shows he is as shrewd with his taxes as he is on the sidelines, but that isn't fair to Kansas families scraping to get by. Putting more money into the pockets of those who need it the least doesn't create jobs. It just weakens the fundamentals that keep our economy and communities strong. <br> It is impossible to hide the effect of slashing revenue, and Americans will feel the impact of these cuts. His plan will give tax breaks to the largest corporations and mirrors the agenda that put Kansas in dire fiscal straits. And from a political perspective, it is historic that a Republican controlled legislature is rebuking their Republican governor over tax cuts. Why? Because the rhetoric on tax cuts does not match reality. 
 In addition to describing the events he witnessed, he spoke from the heart. <br> "This hatefulness that we see in this country today over policy differences has got to stop ... Republicans and Democrats need to use this day today to stand together and say 'stop.' Let's work together. Let's get things done," he said. "We can have our differences, but let's not let it lead to such hate." <br> President Trump holds the world's largest microphone and therefore can do the most to quell much of the angry rhetoric we've seen. <br> These things accumulate, which means they inevitably escalate. And whether the targets are Republican members of Congress, like today, or Democratic politicians or members of the media, it was perhaps inescapable that something tragic was coming in an environment like this. <br> Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an artform. But what we've seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others' motives and legitimacy. <br> On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate -- or a blind "us versus them" tribal mentality -- stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks. <br> Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues. 
 While Washington fiddles, the American people are angry. While our elected officials descend further into frenzies of partisanship, voters feel left out. Their kitchen table concerns are repeatedly ignored, forcing many families to face the twin economic disruptions of globalization and the advance of technology on their own. <br> But in an era of partisan media, unchecked Internet trolling and ideological polarization, the Constitution's blueprint for balanced government has been lost in a political fog. Unlike the parliamentary systems that provide for one-party rule, our system is based on checks and balances. In other words, American democracy centers on the expectation that the two parties will resolve their differences to move the country forward. <br> By all means, Congress should carry out its function of investigating important matters such as Russian covert activities and the possible illegal unmasking and leaking of classified information. But these investigations cannot be allowed to take a car already moving at only 5 mph and grind it to a halt. I was there in the Senate in 1998 during the impeachment inquiry and trial of Bill Clinton, and we learned to investigate and legislate at the same time. We didn't stop what we were there to do -- we put progress over partisanship. It's an important lesson for today. <br> The Problem Solvers are bringing a common-sense approach to the nation's toughest problems. It's time for the rest of Washington to catch up. When in power, neither party will win enduring victories without reaching across the aisle. When in opposition, neither party will leave an imprint if it resists every proposed initiative regardless of merit. Enough of the partisanship that only weakens our country and emboldens our adversaries. It's time for the nation's leaders to put country before ideology and party. 
 There is a simple reality that often seems lost on many inside the Beltway: The priorities of the mainstream media and Washington elites are not those of the American people. <br> If you've watched cable news any given day since President Donald Trump's inauguration, you've been subjected to near-hysterical coverage of the latest "scandal" that threatens to doom his presidency. You've probably seen pundits, analysts and politicians relentlessly deliver talking points on why Trump is unfit to be President -- or even why he should be impeached. <br> Yet here we are, six months into President Trump's term, and many Americans have grown weary of the constant media frenzy regarding his administration. And those who voted for the President continue to support him. <br> This principle might seem shocking to Washington, but average Americans -- many of whom I spoke with while campaigning for then candidate Trump -- will tell you that they could care less about the latest Washington cable news drama. Rather, what they care about are policies that impact their families, their pocket books and their everyday lives. <br> Those Americans -- from Western North Carolina to Ohio to Pennsylvania to Michigan -- aren't focused on the latest breaking "news" on the Russia investigation. They care about seeing results and solutions that help their businesses survive -- and grow. They care about having access to high quality, affordable health care. They care about lower taxes that allow them to keep more of their paychecks. They care about the safety and security of their family. <br> And, in Washington, we have done an abysmal job of maintaining our primary focus on those issues. Passing important policy that impacts every day Americans requires consensus building, marketing our ideas to constituents through media and building coalitions of support. With the constant focus on Russia, big important policy items like tax reform have been stalled. <br> Now, make no mistake, it's critical that we not gloss over any potential wrongdoing in the Russia investigation. If there were improper activities, we need to get to the bottom of the issue -- and no one will be more committed to getting to the truth on a bipartisan basis than I will. <br> At the same time, congressional investigations have to follow a deliberative process that takes time. I've conducted oversight of government agencies and officials for the last five years as a member and a subcommittee chairman on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I've investigated cases ranging from the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal to the IRS targeting scandal to the Benghazi attack where Americans lost their lives. <br> In all of these cases, we had a deliberative process that spanned months -- and in some cases, years -- to collect proper evidence, interview key witnesses and see where the facts led. And, in some instances, the facts didn't lead anywhere, and the cases were dropped. <br> Congress has a duty to hold government officials accountable when necessary, but it is counterproductive for the media and some of my Democrat colleagues to throw unsubstantiated claims regarding White House officials against a wall repeatedly to see what sticks. Media and political hysterics work in opposition to -- not in favor of -- getting to truth and transparency. <br> Furthermore, while foreign interference in our election is something that our republic cannot and should not tolerate, it seems a bit ludicrous to suggest that tens of millions of Americans made a choice for president based on Russian influence. This is evidenced by the fact that President Trump continues to share the support of a plurality of Americans who believe they made the right choice for president -- because they voted for his agenda. <br> America must not tolerate Russian intervention in our elections, but we must also not perpetuate a narrative that suggests a far bigger role than any evidence has proven. Fueling exaggeration and constant hysteria is something that could unravel a democracy like ours. It's time we let the special counsel do his job and allow Congress to focus on actually on doing ours. <br> Let's also remember that through the frenzy, no formal charge has been leveled against anyone in the administration, no direct evidence uncovered and no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia confirmed. This is nothing warranting wall-to-wall speculation from the pundit class. The hysterics surrounding Russia merely serve to distract from accomplishing the priorities of the American people -- and for what, partisan gain? <br> There is real work to be done for the American people. Much of it can and should be possible to accomplish on a bipartisan basis. Now is not the time to circle the partisan wagons, but a time to deliver on the commitments we made to the American people. We need to deliver on undoing the harmful regulatory environment that stifles businesses, reforming the tax code to leave more money in the pockets of hard working Americans, replacing our broken health care system with one that will bring down premiums for American families and properly supporting our men and women in uniform. <br> It's time Congress and the media redirect their attention to those same principles. Let's focus on the American peoples' true priorities -- the Main Street issues that matter. 
 The Trump administration's budget has met withering criticism for its vast spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and for its assumptions about revenue and growth. <br> Is it really all that bad? <br> The U.S. faces serious fiscal problems. The economy is now projected to creep along at a bit less than 2% annual growth. Spending and revenues remain dangerously out of whack because of rising entitlement spending. This threatens to steadily crowd out discretionary spending on national security, basic research, education, infrastructure — the things the Founders saw as the actual responsibilities of government. <br> Viewed from this perspective, the budget deserves mixed reviews, but not disdainful dismissal. It strongly recognizes the need for better growth, and assumes the average growth rate will rise from 1.9% annually to 2.9% over the next decade. <br> Is that aggressive? Yes, but every president's budget is aggressive. It would require that everything -- tax reform, regulatory reform, infrastructure, education reform and more -- be enacted and work exactly as predicted. But that's how every president's budget is formulated. If Trump's budget is right, it would be an enormous improvement in the economy, but more importantly in the lives of every American. <br> The fuss over the revenue seems misplaced. The budget has few specifics, but at the top line it shows that nominal gross domestic product averages growth of 5% per year over the budget window and revenues average 5.2%. <br> By comparison, in the Congressional Budget Office baseline, the corresponding growth rates are 3.9 % and 4.2%. The administration has boosted its estimates by roughly a percentage point, with correspondingly faster revenue growth. By the standards of most presidents' budgets, this is a misdemeanor at best. <br> Turning to controlling the entitlement-spending explosion, Trump deserves credit for proposing a serious Medicaid reform. Critics may not like the particulars, but nobody should argue with a straight face that the status quo is acceptable and reform per se is a bad idea. So, kudos to him. <br> In the other direction, the budget takes Social Security and Medicare off the table. This sends the message that these programs are fine; they are not. Neither program will be financially sustainable over the long-term and seniors deserve programs they can count on and, in the case of Medicare, deliver the highest value of health care. These programs should be in the reform mix. <br> The demerits in the budget belong with the annual discretionary accounts. The budget simply accelerates an already unappealing trend. There will be too few resources to fund the national defense needs that experts have identified and, for example, 18% cuts in the National Institutes of Health go the wrong direction on basic research. This is not to say that every non-defense discretionary program is perfect. They are not. In particular, the anti-poverty programs have failed to produce economic self-sufficiency among their beneficiaries and, as a result, have not "solved" the poverty program. <br> But these programs should be critiqued, better alternatives developed and the budgetary costs of the improved programs incorporated into the discretionary totals. That is, change the programs on their merits. The 2018 budget sends the message that they are being cut simply in order to reach balance. It invites the portrayal of an administration callously indifferent to the quality of the programs for lower-income Americans. <br> The 2018 budget does not get straight A's, but it is a far cry from the complete failure that critics have claimed. 
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. <br> It seems like a distant memory now, but it was only about six months ago that Republican leaders were giddily proclaiming a new political era. <br> What a difference half a year makes. <br> Ethical stumbles, rookie errors and sheer political arrogance have left the Republican agenda -- and the GOP legislative majority itself -- in grave peril. <br> That virtually guarantees the Senate will kill or substantially rework the legislation, leaving the Republicans' No. 1 promise -- shouted daily on the campaign trail by Trump and virtually every Republican lawmaker -- unfulfilled. <br> The second main agenda item, tax reform, also looks shaky: Congressional leaders have already fallen behind the aggressive schedule needed to produce a bill by August. <br> These aren't just gossipy distractions. Enacting major legislation requires a White House that is focused, confident and coherent. That is how the Reagan administration led a divided Congress to tax reform in 1986 and how the Obama White House won passage of a stimulus bill, auto industry bailout and health care reform. <br> It remains to be seen whether voters will punish Republican members of Congress for the problems of the man in the White House. But while the Trump-Russia investigation grinds on, congressional Republicans would do well to find other ways to enact their agenda, mostly by working closely with GOP governors. <br> Congress will need substantial buy-in at the state level to enact many of the big-ticket Republican agenda items, from reforming health care to building a border wall and other infrastructure. Now would be a good time to work with GOP governors on Republican agenda items like state-run high-risk health insurance pools and shovel-ready infrastructure projects. 
 Cassidy's resistance to using health care reform as a front to slash taxes for the wealthy is not a popular position in his own party. But he is absolutely right about the true intentions behind this proposal: Republicans are jamming through a massive tax giveaway under utterly false pretenses. With the process now moving behind closed doors in the Senate, and Washington increasingly consumed with investigating the troubling links between the President and Russia, it is critical that Democrats expose and defeat this cynical ploy. <br> Cassidy agreed with Kimmel. "Tell the American people to call their senators," he urged. <br> We must take him up on that. As the Senate begins considering -- in secret, at the moment -- what to preserve and what to eliminate from the House bill, we should deliver a loud and clear message to Washington: leave those wasteful tax cuts on the cutting room floor. <br> These giveaways are a feature, not a bug, of the House health care plan as intended by its authors. In the rollicking negotiations that led up to the House bill's passage, many provisions underwent major changes, but the tax cuts remained intact throughout. <br> These tax cuts also actively thwart the objectives of making coverage more accessible and affordable. <br> There are literally millions of lives at stake when it comes to the issue of health care. Congress should be ashamed of itself if it treats this as just another opportunity to provide a tax windfall for the fortunate few. 
 The news that former FBI director James Comey wrote in a memo that President Donald Trump asked him, in February, to stop investigating national security adviser Mike Flynn has sent shockwaves through Washington. <br> It comes amid Trump's worst week in politics, and that's saying a lot. After many months of shocking and aweing the nation, the President is finally doing something that seemed impossible -- he is threatening to crack the Republican firewall on Capitol Hill that has done more than anything else to protect him. <br> In general, House and Senate Republicans have stood firm as Trump has issued controversial statements and provoked international tensions. They have given him the benefit of the doubt, hoping that even though the President's first 100 days lacked any significant legislative accomplishments, the second hundred might allow the GOP to finally make progress on their agenda after eight long years in the wilderness. <br> Despite concerns that the health care legislation that passed the House would prove to be damaging to Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he still had confidence he could put the pieces back together into a successful initiative. <br> But in the span of just seven days, everything has changed. President Trump stunned the nation when he fired FBI Director James Comey in the middle of the agency's investigation into his campaign, then admitted in a TV interview that he did it because of the "Russia thing." <br> Presidential advisors were left tripping all over themselves trying to justify what happened, each seeming to contradict the other. They had no time to catch their breath before The Washington Post published a bombshell story Monday night alleging that Trump had extemporaneously shared highly classified information about ISIS with visiting Russian officials. While it is legal for the president to do this, providing this kind of sensitive information to a non-ally is highly unusual and, most experts agree, dangerous. <br> Sounding exasperated, McConnell told reporters, "we could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things so that we can focus on our agenda, which is deregulations, tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare." <br> Then came the Comey bombshell. <br> The triple whammy of Comey's firing, the intelligence sharing with Russia and now the Comey memo has shaken the GOP, generating immense, open questions about whether the President is able to handle two core presidential functions that Republicans have always prioritized -- law and order and national security. <br> Now, more Republicans like Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, who warned of a "downward spiral," are speaking up. Others are not springing to Trump's defense and remain conspicuously silent. None of them know exactly what to do. <br> The controversies of the past week have also taken place at a critical moment for Republicans. Members of Congress have been eager to move forward on some kind of legislative agenda. They wanted to make progress on some kind of health care bill and they were particular eager to move forward on Trump's proposal for supply-side tax cuts. <br> They were hoping that this would finally be the moment when Trump made a "legislative pivot" and actually took the job of pushing bills through Congress as seriously as he did his tweets. <br> Some have even hoped that, just maybe, despite all the odds, the President would be able to produce some kind of dramatic diplomatic breakthrough during his visit to the Middle East. <br> None of this looks like it is going to happen. The momentum has moved in the exact opposite direction. The President is now politically paralyzed and will be on the defense as the White House tries to manage fallout. With the pressure over ongoing Russia investigations and talk of mental competence and impeachment moving to the front pages, the President's men and women will be devoting much of their time to damage control. <br> A day before the headlines about Trump's Oval Office meeting with Russian leaders emerged, The New York Times had already reported that Senate Republicans were planning to go it alone to move bills. <br> House Speaker Paul Ryan said through a spokesman: "We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount. The Speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration." <br> For all the talk about populism and his maverick appeal, the heart and soul of Trump's survival has been the power of partisanship. During his election campaign, he depended on most Republicans to support his version of the party line regardless of what they thought of him. And Republicans came through. <br> Since taking the oath of office Trump has counted on congressional Republicans to protect him from investigation or political backlash based on their desire to make the most of what is possible with united government. <br> To be sure, it is not clear yet if Republicans will actually break ranks. So far its been mostly talk and tweets. But the pressure is clearly building, and the voices of conservative protest are growing louder. <br> If the outrageous actions of the past seven days break this partisan unity, then President Trump will be truly exposed. If legislators feel that their majority is at stake and their party's long-term standing is in jeopardy -- particularly because of a President many of them did not like to begin with -- then anything becomes possible. <br> And at that point, this President may learn just how imperial the legislative branch can be when it puts its mind to taking on the White House. <br> This commentary has been updated from a version published earlier.</div> 
 Health care is a big red flag signaling trouble ahead for President Trump's hope of passing a major tax reform package. <br> If President Trump and the Republicans in Congress are having to work this hard to approve legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare -- an article of faith that they've reaffirmed at least once a day eight years running -- then the odds of major changes in tax law are uncertain. <br> That's because the policy is no less complicated, nor the politics less complex. Indeed, they're more so. <br> House Republicans have been working on their own plan. <br> But House Republicans aren't giving up just yet, adding another layer of volatility to the GOP's effort to overhaul the federal tax code for the first time in three decades. <br> That's why, especially after progress on health care with House passage of the American Health Care Act, there's an episode that might better reveal the political briar patch Republicans and the administration are about to dive into: "Plan B." <br> Lesson of 2012 <br> Rewind to December 2012, when the Bush-era tax cuts were set to expire and the country tottered on a "fiscal cliff." If Congress didn't approve some sort of tax deal by New Year's Eve, virtually every American would get stuck with the bill. <br> House Republicans were scrambling to avoid getting run over by Obama, freshly re-elected and, for a moment, politically strengthened. <br> He wanted to preserve tax cuts for the middle class enacted by President George W. Bush in 2001, but let tax rates rise to where they used to be for higher income people -- "millionaires and billionaires," as he put it. <br> John Boehner, then the House speaker, first sought an expansive deal with Obama to preserve most of the Bush tax cuts, linking that provision to substantial entitlement reform (about $1 trillion) and authority to raise the debt ceiling. When that fell apart, Boehner pivoted to "Plan B." <br> The Ohio Republican told his conference that they had one chance to turn the tables on Obama and protect 99% of Americans from a tax hike: Offer a deal that took the President's 2012 campaign promise literally, to raise taxes on "millionaires" and above, but preserve existing rates for everyone else. <br> House Republicans demurred. And not just conservative rebels; some of Boehner's own lieutenants rejected the strategy. Politically, letting taxes rise for everyone was deemed preferable to taking a tough, compromise vote that would have saved tens of millions of Americans from a writing a bigger check to the IRS. <br> "The policy outcome was worse because Republicans couldn't do something that was tactically smart but politically difficult," recalled GOP operative Michael Steel, then a senior Boehner adviser. <br> (Obama ultimately struck a deal with Senate Republicans, then in the minority, to maintain the Bush-era rates for individuals and married couples earning less than $400,000 and $450,000, respectively -- well below the $1 million threshold Boehner tried to engineer.) <br> Fast-forward to 2017. <br> This won't be easy <br> Trump is proposing to strip the tax code of scores of cherished deductions as part of an overhaul that would cut rates on corporations and small businesses by a whopping 20 percentage points and, theoretically, reduce the burden on individuals and married filers. <br> Only the mortgage interest and charitable giving deductions would survive. Rather than relying on spending reductions to cover lost tax revenue, Trump's cuts would be paid for by the economic growth they generate, senior administration officials say. <br> Now: Explain how a party that couldn't even muster one tough vote on taxes not too long ago is going to withstand aggressive opposition from industry and political advocacy groups with their flush advertising budgets, and, oh, voters, and accomplish tax reform? <br> "It's not a plan, it's phony," a veteran House Republican who is usually supportive of the President told me, on condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly. "They're going to lower the rate to 15 percent but it's going to be revenue neutral? It's not going to work. That's not even well thought out." <br> Yet the prospects for tax reform have brightened somewhat with House approval of the American Health Care Act. <br> Sure, the Obamacare repeal package cleared the House with only two votes to spare, and faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Republicans in that chamber think so highly of it, they've decided to throw it in the trash and write their own bill. <br> But success in the House nonetheless proved that Trump and congressional Republicans might have the chops to govern, injecting fresh optimism into the party's tax reform push. <br> "This has brought the Republican Party together," Trump said during a public event to celebrate the House vote. "We're going to get this finished and then we're going, as you know, we put our tax plan in, it's a massive tax cut. The biggest tax cut in the history of our country." <br> The President might want to wait before he sends a braggadocios tweet. <br> That means tax reform that is revenue neutral. <br> In other words, contra Trump, House Republicans oppose reform that would send more money back to the people in tax cuts than it would generate in taxes paid. And, don't forget those pesky, beloved tax deductions that could be near impossible to find the votes in Congress to get rid of. <br> Politicians on both sides of the aisle like to say that health care is complicated because it involves one sixth of the economy. Well, tax policy is the economy. This is the breadth of the challenge that waits. 
 With his proposed tax cut, President Trump is giving the Republicans the red meat they have been craving. <br> After spending so many months toying around with his faux populist agenda, now the White House is really getting down to business. Coming at the end of this 100-day mark, President Trump's dramatic proposal to cut corporate tax rates from 35% to 15%, slashing individual rates, eliminating the alternative minimum tax, and abolishing the estate and gift tax signals that he understands where his bread is buttered, and that is by the Republican majorities on Capitol Hill. <br> Of all the moves that he could possibly make, including the failed attempt at repealing Obamacare or the infamous border wall, supply-side tax cuts are the most effective way for him to solidify his partisan support, which will be important to his future success with legislation and the possibility of re-election. <br> Tax cuts have been bread and butter for Republicans since the conservative revolution that rocked American politics in the 1970s. Along with anti-communism, few issues have energized Republicans like dismantling the progressive individual and corporate income tax system put into place in the early 20th century. <br> Conservatives made a number of arguments about why taxes should be cut on the wealthy. "Supply side" economists claimed that if the government freed up upper income earners and business with lower marginal tax rates, investment would start to flow and everyone would benefit. <br> Other conservatives stressed that progressive taxes were unfair, a symbol of big government, and lowering them was the most effective way to put a stake in the heart of big government liberalism. <br> Just because wealthier people and organizations earned more than the middle class, it was not fair that the government should be required to pay a higher rate than lower income Americans. <br> Tax cuts skewed toward the upper income brackets play with well with the business and financial community that have often been big supporters of the GOP. In addition, shrewd conservatives like David Stockman, who served as President Reagan's budget director, championed the "starve the beast" argument. <br> It's a losing argument to convince Americans that government programs which they perceive as providing benefits should be cut. So if the Republicans wanted to shrink government programs, their best bet was to lower tax revenues, making less money available to Washington for spending. <br> For decades, Republican presidents have made tax cuts a priority. President Reagan pushed through a historic tax cut in the summer of 1981 that lowered the top rate from 70% to 50% for individuals and lowered corporate income taxes by over $150 billion. <br> "No other issue," Reagan said, "goes so directly to the heart of our economic life." In 1986, he worked with Democrats in Congress to pass loophole-closing tax reform in exchange for lowering rates once again. <br> President George W. Bush did the same in 2001 with a $1.3 trillion reduction (including the elimination of the estate tax), ending the era of federal surpluses that started under President Clinton, and again in 2003 even though the US was in the middle of a war. Bill Plante of CBS News recalled that "the younger Bush went around telling people, 'Look, I'm more like Ronald Reagan than my father." <br> Indeed, the big exception to GOP tax-cutting was President George H.W. Bush, who despite lowering the capital gains tax accepted tax increases as part of the 1990 deficit reduction plan. He paid the price. Conservatives like Congressman Newt Gingrich, future speaker of the House, never forgave him. And he wasn't able to win a second term in his race against Bill Clinton. <br> It took some time for President Trump to get to the tax plan, but now it looks like he is going to send conservatives what they want. <br> While there are many economists who don't believe that this tax cut would have beneficial consequences over the long term, especially by bursting deficits that will strain the nation, politically this could be a winning proposal. <br> Coming at a time when many Republican legislators are itching to deliver an important victory, this would have great appeal to the traditional constituencies of the Republican Party. <br> The corporate world, still uneasy with Trump's populist rhetoric and attacks on free trade, might be a big more comfortable once they are delivered this benefit. And as Presidents Reagan and Bush realized, there are ways to package supply-side tax cuts with rhetoric and targeted sweeteners so that working class conservatives believe they will be sharing a piece of this economic pie. <br> Even though there is a lot of grumbling among Republicans about the impact on the deficits and proposals such as eliminating the deductions for state and local taxes, which will hit New York and California residents hard, Reagan also had trouble moving his tax bill in 1981. <br> After the assassination attempt on his life, Reagan came back and mounted a full-scale public relations blitz that was effective. Most Republicans who opposed him backed off. Democrats ended up adding provisions to the bill (compared to Christmas Tree ornaments) that benefited middle class Americans rather than trying to block it altogether. <br> It will be difficult for Democrats to fight back against President Trump's proposals. While the House and Senate Democrats have found considerable room to obstruct and say no to President Trump, standing against tax cuts has often been one place the party feels vulnerable. <br> They all remember when Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale admitted in 1984 that if elected he would raise taxes, which gave President Reagan ample material to attack. Democratic senators from swing states will be uneasy taking a stand against tax cuts, even if they believe them to be irresponsible, for fearing of giving their opponents a powerful issue to campaign on. <br> Unlike some of the other issues thus far, like refugee bans and health care, this is an issue that President Trump can't afford to lose. This is one of the principal demands from Republicans of their president and it is an issue where the political dynamics in an era of united government point to success. This, more than anything, will give us a measure of what he can do on Capitol Hill. <br> If President Trump can get the tax cut back to his desk for a signature, this could be an important turning point in his policy agenda after the early turbulent months of legislating. Just this one victory, which would be a big one politically, could give him and the Republicans more than they need to take onto the campaign trail in 2018 and 2020 as they aim to keep control of Washington. 
 What we have learned about Donald Trump's leanings on tax policy make them Exhibit A in his bait-and-switch presidency. Although he was elected as a man of the people, Trump's tax reform plans make it clear that he is serving as a baron for billionaires. <br> The tea leaves that pass for a coherent legislative policy suggest that Trump's Plan A had pulled a page or two from House Speaker Paul Ryan's playbook, long on the shelves. Ryan had a wonky, but nifty, three-step: <br> -- One, repeal, but don't quite replace Obamacare; <br> -- Two, enact a corporate tax reform featuring a brand new "border adjustment" tax, also known as tariffs; and <br> -- Three, enact sweeping income tax cuts and repeal the estate tax. <br> Alas, Plan A didn't quite work. Turns out that the people paid attention to details, like the devilish one about the 24 million who stand to lose health insurance coverage. <br> Unfortunately, real tax policy ought to be more than a Vegas-style magic show. There are two painfully serious sets of problems with the return of supply-side witchcraft. <br> Even if growth were to spike up quickly to these rosy-hued levels, interest rates, still historically low, would certainly rise. This would doubly hurt the federal government, because it would have more debt to finance, due to the tax cuts, and at higher interest rates. <br> Second, even if we were to plunge into more debt on a risky gambit for greater growth, why should tax cuts for the rich get the first (and maybe only) priority for the corresponding goodies? <br> Couldn't the trillions for billionaires be better spent, say, on middle-class tax cuts, infrastructure investments, and/or education, with perhaps a little left over for science, the environment and international affairs? <br> Donald Trump got elected president promising to be a man of the people, a ruler for the forgotten. Now it is he who seems to have forgotten. His Plan A on tax reform was to take from the bottom to give to the top. Thwarted in that effort by the people, who turn out to like having health care, Trump turned to Plan B: take from the future to give to the top. <br> Let us hope that the people rise up again and stop the latest attempt at a billionaire money grab. <br> Then maybe, just maybe, Trump could live up to his promise to be a new kind of politician, one for the American middle class. He could give us Plan C: a tax reform that, instead of giving more breaks to the billionaire class, actually asks them to share more with the rest of us. Unfortunately, it is exactly such a sensible reaction to rising economic inequality and mounting associated political concerns that sounds like voodoo these days. 
 President Donald Trump doesn't care what the experts have to say. "No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!," he tweeted. <br> While his critique of the concept of the first 100 days might be fair, it is hard to look at how Trump has performed in the first months in office and not conclude that he and the Republicans face a serious problem. <br> On foreign policy, he has flipped and flopped without any major diplomatic or military breakthroughs. He has stimulated an energized opposition movement that has caused Republican legislators attending their own town halls to think twice about supporting anything that he says. Throughout everyday of this period a major scandal involving collusion with Russia in the election has loomed over his actions. <br> Just maybe, however, the failures of these months are not as devastating as some might think. <br> Normalizing the presidency? <br> And notably, the normalization of a presidency that seemed so tenuous in January is an accomplishment in itself for Trump. With many observers wondering if he would be able to handle the day-to-day challenges that come with the job and whether he would last for very long with his twitter-storms and tirades, it is worth noting that as we enter into the summer most of the discussion now centers on what comes next with his policy agenda. What will he do with North Korea? How will he handle relations with China? Can he move forward with tax reform or an infrastructure package? The shift in discussion has been a remarkable turn of events for this controversial former reality television show star. All the talk about the conflict of interest with his family business and new political business has generally subsided. <br> This is the kind of scandal that could make Watergate or Iran-Contra look like child's play. Yet, at least thus far, he has survived. Partisan loyalty has protected the administration in the House where the Intelligence Committee investigation initially seemed to have broken down. Other than a handful of voices in the Senate, such as John McCain or Lindsey Graham, there has been notable silence within the GOP about all the evidence that has emerged. This scandal could still get much worse, but at least at the close of the first 100 days Trump is still standing and the national conversation has shifted to other issues. <br> Trump's agenda <br> The administration has been able to destabilize the standing of the media. Trump's incessant attacks on news organizations as "fake" and his ability to flood the country with misleading or false statements via Twitter and his advisers have made it more difficult for Americans to tell the difference between fact or fiction. <br> He has built on trends that have been gathering strength over decades, such as the increasingly partisan news and distrust in the media, to undermine confidence in what people hear from established sources. In this kind of atmosphere, it is easier for the President to shift the national agenda to new issues and confuse public understanding of what is going on. Reporters are having difficulty serving as "watchdogs" when more people don't believe what they are saying. <br> Executive power, though not as long-lasting as legislation, has served as a potent tool in Trump's arsenal. At the same time he has shown almost no interest in working on legislation or even engaging members of Congress, he has tapped into his CEO instincts by using executive orders with increasing ferocity. <br> While the ban on refugees stalled in the courts, other measures such as accelerated deportations and deregulations of energy markets have moved forward at a Rooseveltian pace. He has staffed many key agencies with top opponents of the programs they now run. Senate Democrats were unable to stop the confirmations. The measures will have a big effect on the lives and industries being regulated, while his appeals to the mainstream Republican Party -- at the same time he drops his populist facade -- will shore up his support with Republicans. <br> Still Trump can't be boasting about what's happened since January. In the list of presidential 100 days, his will be low on the list. If he wants to be part of the pantheon of productive presidents, there is no way to make that case convincingly. <br> His opponents though shouldn't be so confident either since a closer look at what's happened since inauguration suggests this President might be in much better shape than they think, with a lot of time still left on his political clock. For those who initially asked if impeachment or resignation would happen soon, they might start thinking about what the odds are for a second term. 
 It can be tempting to try and draw far-reaching conclusions about the 2018 midterm elections from the special election results in Georgia's 6th congressional district, where Democrat Jon Ossoff came close to winning the 50% of the vote he needed to capture the longtime conservative seat. <br> But those midterms are more than 19 months away and a whole lot can change between now and then. President Trump is likely to encounter additional national security challenges; congressional Republicans may by then have tackled big issues like tax reform and infrastructure spending; and the state of the country's economy may be very different than it is today. <br> For all of these reasons, all pundits and prognosticators should take a deep breath and realize that whatever electoral predictions they make today have a decent shot at being proven wrong when voters test them in November 2018. <br> In many ways, Republicans are still learning what it means to have unified control of the federal government. As Speaker Paul Ryan noted when he withdrew the Republican alternative to Obamacare in late March, there are growing pains that come with the new responsibilities that GOP officeholders have been tasked with. <br> To be successful in 2018, Republicans in Congress -- working with the Trump administration -- will need to work out the kinks and make progress in advancing a conservative governing agenda. And that begins with demonstrating an ability to pass a sensible replacement to the Affordable Care Act. <br> Voters in Georgia's 6th congressional district didn't appear to be punishing Republicans for their inability to repeal and replace Obamacare in late March -- Democrat Jon Ossoff only slightly outperformed Hillary Clinton's in last night's election and Republican Karen Handel will likely beat him in the upcoming runoff. But GOP voters' patience is not infinite. <br> For more than seven years, Republican officeholders and candidates have promised that they would take decisive action on President Obama's signature health care law. A single failure to do so can be attributable to "growing pains." But a continual inability to pass into law a conservative, market-based alternative to the Affordable Care Act will have electoral consequences for Republican congressional candidates across the country. <br> President Trump did the right thing by featuring the American Health Care Act as his first major foray into working with Congress. While the results were not positive, he recognized that failure to act on health care would have political consequences. It's now up to him and congressional leaders like Speaker Ryan to finally deliver. Failing to do so will impact election results not just in Georgia's sixth congressional district, but across America. 
 On April 15, many Americans will join Tax Marches in cities in almost every state to tell Trump that we do, in fact, care a great deal about his taxes. <br> Though folks may grouse, most people in the United States take very seriously our collective responsibility to pay our taxes. We know that taxes help provide clean air and water, safe food and drugs, passable roads and bridges, protective police, successful schools and so many things that make our communities livable. We, therefore, need to create a more equitable system that closes loopholes, invests in communities and puts money in the hands of working Americans. <br> Trump's tax returns -- or lack thereof -- cannot be excluded from any discussion of a more equitable system. His returns are critical to understanding the true state of Trump's financial affairs. Without complete returns, we won't know whether he owes money to foreign governments or their leaders, how much he has given in charitable contributions, how much (if anything) he has personally paid in taxes and what some of his assets really are. <br> On the matter of international entanglement, a surprising new buzzword -- "foreign emoluments" -- has entered the political lexicon. This phrase refers to any payments from foreign governments to the president, as our founders had the foresight to include a clause in the Constitution prohibiting foreign nations from bribing our top executive. <br> The people really do care -- if he has benefited from the many tax breaks afforded to the rich, his gains would reflect a fundamental inequity in the American tax system and a driver for the weekend march. <br> So Trump can be sure that Americans won't stop marching, chanting and demanding his tax returns until he finally releases them. 
 CNN Opinion invited commentators to weigh in on President Trump's speech to Congress Tuesday night. The views expressed are theirs. <br> Eric Liu: A master of symbols over substance <br> In his first presidential address to Congress, Donald Trump tonight reminded us that he is a master of symbols over substance. And he reminded us as well that this is a pretty effective formula for success in American politics. <br> From his opening (if belated) words condemning recent acts of anti-Semitism to his promises to cut two regulations for every new one created to his highlighting the widow of a Navy SEAL, Trump dealt mainly in rhetorical gestures. <br> But people who criticize Trump for dealing in such gestures and for offering few specifics forget that public leadership depends on symbols. More than that, it depends on setting a simple vision and animating it with symbols and with stories. Like it or not, Trump is good at that. <br> This speech was his most effective moment as president. It played to his natural strengths -- performance and theatricality -- while keeping his liabilities, like cynical incuriosity and casual cruelty, at bay. More than that, with talk of infrastructure investment and hints at immigration reform, it showed his willingness to keep both left and right off-balance. It hinted at the trouble Democrats would be in if Trump could ever sustain discipline. <br> Unfortunately for him, the rest of his job requires him to face the world in its actual complexity -- and to deliver. The daily grind of governing will likely reveal tonight's Trump to be the exception rather than the rule. "The time for trivial fights is behind us," he said. But shortly afterward, he regained access to his Twitter account. <br> Eric Liu is founder of Citizen University and executive director of the Aspen Institute Citizenship American Identity Program. His books include "A Chinaman's Chance" and "The Gardens of Democracy." He was a White House speechwriter and policy adviser for President Bill Clinton. Follow him on Twitter: @ericpliu. <br> Mark Bauerlein: Leaning on themes that got him elected <br> Trump supporters might have found the pageantry of the lead-up to Donald Trump's speech a bit much, impatient as they are of DC puffery. But soon after Trump started, the wellsprings of his patriotism fed their profound hunger for national meaning. <br> It's a desire that my fellow academics and cosmopolitan elites do not understand. As I was interviewed on CNN International last week, the host insisted that America was doing just fine--low unemployment and strong stock market--so why the talk about American decline? I answered that a nation isn't measured primarily by money. There is, first, the sense of home and self-esteem and respect for law and order. <br> In fear of strong convictions, it pushes the minimization of nation, the break-up of American tradition into a breezy multiculturalism, the opening of borders, the conversion of American citizens with roots in a time and place into global citizens with no roots and who should belong everywhere, which is to say, nowhere. Trump's understanding of this is why he won. <br> The details in the speech were unsurprising: fewer regulations, less lobbying, less off-shoring of jobs, new trade agreements, border security, repeal of Obamacare, an end to the "cycle of poverty," a stop to violent crime, the suggestion of opening vouchers to religious schools. As always, the consequences of all these claims remains to be seen. <br> One thing is certain, though: President Trump stuck to the very themes that have generated so much rancor and heat, and nothing he said or did tonight promises to lower the temperature. When he said that his job is not to "represent the world," only the USA, the globalists and internationalists and intellectuals suspicious of American power knew their enemy. <br> Mark Bauerlein is a professor of English at Emory University, senior editor of the journal "First Things" and author of "The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future; Or, Don't Trust Anyone Under 30." <br> Jen Psaki: New tone, but no new clarity <br> It is safe to say there has been no "joint session" speech in modern televised history that was anticipated with lower expectations. We waited for Donald Trump to invoke American carnage and doom and gloom and instead we got something much closer to a broad and traditional address. <br> The change in tone, helped by the personal stories in the second half of the speech, was noteworthy--though the glow will only last as long as he maintains the positive tone, which may be a matter of hours. <br> Also striking was how completely disconnected these remarks were from the speeches and the actions of first five weeks of the Trump Administration. <br> Beyond the news cycle coverage of any joint session speech, the goal of such an address is to give marching orders for the months ahead. But Trump failed to lay out a specific path to achieve his policy objectives. It is just as mathematically impossible today to keep health care coverage for pre-existing conditions, repeal the Obamacare mandate and lower costs as it was yesterday. He did not make any tough choices on how exactly to achieve tax reform where tax cuts to the middle class are not impacted. And he did not present a new strategy for going after ISIL. <br> The audience is the American people at home, but more than five weeks into the administration it is also the people in the room. They may be relieved by the change in tone (and we will see how long that lasts) but they don't have any more clarity on his legislative agenda now than they did before the speech. <br> Jen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, served as the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. <br> Kayleigh McEnany: Democrats cool to Trump's message of unity <br> His words reflected the American ethos. But, sadly, unifying, benevolent messages like extending treatment for Americans addicted to drugs were met with Democratic recalcitrance, as left-wing elected officials sat firmly planted on one side of the House chamber, where clapping was sparse. <br> Democratic resistance could not squelch the overriding message of unity, best represented by the emotional moment when Trump saluted Carryn Owens, wife of fallen Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, reminding us that, "the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom --- we will never forget him." <br> Kayleigh McEnany is a CNN commentator </em>and a graduate of Harvard Law School. <br> Errol Louis: An olive branch for Democrats? <br> President Donald Trump delivered what many hoped for: a speech calling for unity with Democrats -- a key departure after antagonizing them during his first month in office. <br> The commander-in-chief's straightforward presentation was also a departure from his usual bombastic style. Trump stayed cool when Democrats stayed seated as Republicans rose to clap, or gave a thumbs down to his proposed Obamacare repeal. He largely refrained from his habit of rehashing the election and the rise of the coalition that brought him to power. <br> While Trump seemed to be sending an olive branch to Democrats with his approach Tuesday night, the Republican is going to face problems within his own party when it comes to his budget. <br> Trump might not find a friend in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, either. The Kentucky Republican said today that the upper chamber would kill Trump's budget plan -- featuring a 37 percent spending cut to the Department of State -- if it's sent to the Senate. <br> In other words, Trump may have connected with some Democrats, even as a showdown looms with his fellow Republicans. <br> Errol Lous is the host of "Inside City Hall," a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. <br> Sahar Aziz: Solidarity with his far-right, anti-Muslim base <br> Donald Trump prides himself on snubbing political correctness. Thus, he made sure to emphasize that the terrorism he is fighting is "Islamic." <br> While Trump rightfully acknowledged the rise in hate crimes against Jewish communities, he was resoundingly silent about the rise in attacks and discrimination against American Muslims. Even his mention of the shooting in Kansas City left out that the victims were apparently mistaken for Muslim. Trump's material omissions demonstrate that he did not have American Muslims in mind when he stated "We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood." <br> Evidently, Trump is concerned with political correctness more than he admits -- the type imposed by his far right, anti-Muslim base. <br> Sahar Aziz is associate professor at Texas AM University School of Law, where she teaches national security, civil rights, and Middle East law. She is also a fellow at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. <br> Aaron David Miller: What the President really meant to say <br> Not surprisingly, foreign policy didn't figure prominently in the president's address to the joint session of Congress. But President Trump did lay down several foreign policy markers. Here's a rundown of what he said in the speech, and what I'm pretty sure he really said about them during the car ride over to the Capitol. <br> ''We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim World, to extinguish this vile enemy ISIS from our planet." Trump in car: Boy am I really out on a limb on this one; I said in my inaugural that I'd eradicate ISIS from the face of the earth. But how can I do that without eliminating the conditions in Syria and Iraq on which ISIS feeds. And that would mean deep US involvement in nation-building; not only that, the plan the Pentagon has given me is really just a plus up from what Obama been doing. <br> "America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align." Trump in car: This was really clever on my part. I didn't want to mention Russia, let alone Mr. Putin, for obvious reasons; but I really did want to give him a shout out. He's strong and tough like me; and I know I can cut deal with him. <br> "My job is not to represent the world, my job is to represent the United States of America." Trump in car: Boy do I love that line. To all you liberal interventionists and neocons who somehow think I belong to the "US as the indispensable power" club, think again. No more globaloney. It's America first. I'm looking out for number one. And you know who that is. <br> Alice Stewart: Trump in charge <br> A lengthy standing ovation honoring American hero Ryan Owens and led by Donald Trump allowed him to demonstrate, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he is President and Commander in Chief for all Americans- no ifs, no ands, no buts. <br> To say that President Donald Trump's joint session speech was optimistic is an understatement. The more than hour-long address was filled with references to renewal of the American spirit. Trump spoke of unity, with a heartfelt tribute to Black History Month, condemned attacks on Jewish Community Centers and cemeteries, and the recent apparent hate killing in Kansas. <br> Democrats sat on their hands for much of the speech, even during talk of a $1 trillion infrastructure spending package. The president simply looked the other way and drove home his commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, defend our borders, provide tax relief for the middle class, build the Keystone pipeline, and restore respect for the rule of law. <br> For those who have been asking when President Trump was going to start reaching outside his base, the joint session speech is your answer. From Obamacare, to immigration, to national security -- President Trump stressed that the best way to solve these complicated problems is to join forces. <br> Alice Stewart is a CNN Political Commentator and former Communications Director for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. She has worked in communications for the presidential campaigns of Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann, as well as communications for Concerned Women for America. <br> Peniel Joseph: A speech that trafficked in fear and division <br> President Donald J. Trump opened his first congressional address with a rhetorical flourish that noted the last day of Black History Month as a time to reflect on the nation's past progress toward civil rights, marred by a recent uptick in anti-Semitism that may well be at least partially a result of the divisive language used by the President himself. What the President touted as a "renewal of American spirit" is actually a period that has been marked by a resurgence of racism, xenophobia, religious intolerance, and attacks on LGBTQ communities. <br> Like champions of Brexit, Trump doubled down on his nation building rhetoric Tuesday night, with a promise to rebuild long decayed industries and "make America great again." <br> Veterans, white industrial workers, and active military and law enforcement shine in this narrative, which makes the ambitious claim that inner cities like Chicago, and all the rest of urban America will be dragged into prosperity (presumably kicking and screaming since the president received a scant 8% of the black vote) by the sheer will of a president touting pro-growth policies. These he claims will jumpstart an American economy that has already seen steady, but relatively constrained, growth since the great recession. <br> The president repeated his campaign promise to build a "great wall" along the nation's southern border in an effort to defend the homeland against, what he has repeatedly called the "bad hombres." <br> Threats from terrorists, illegal immigrants, and drug cartels formed the core of a presidential speech that trafficked in fear as the fuel for a renewal of the American Dream. The President ratcheted up his law and order rhetoric by parading victims of immigration crimes in the gallery, in a shameless act of exploitation designed to further mass incarceration. It was a divisive, intolerant, and ultimately dangerous speech from a president content to serve more as a demagogue than inspirational leader of the world's greatest democracy. <br> Peniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Political Values and Ethics and the Founding Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. <br> Michael D'Antonio: A 'Game of Thrones' mental landscape <br> With repeated references to "I" and "my" and "me," Trump flashed his lifelong narcissism and reassured the nation that at least he is consistent. With so many warlike references and the promise of a new fortress America, walled off and fearful, we returned to Trump's true inner reality. It's a mental landscape worthy of Game of Thrones. <br> Michael D'Antonio is the author of "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success."</div> 
 What American doesn't love a good deal? A free lunch, a gallon of unleaded for $1.50, half-priced theater tickets -- they never get old. We love them so much that we even invent opportunities for more in the form of game shows such as "Let's Make a Deal" or "The Price Is Right." <br> But in the era of President Donald J. Trump, the stakes of our political deals are much higher. That is why, especially for conservatives, reading the fine print with every purchase is critical. If we do not, we risk getting taken for a ride -- trading away the health of our democracy for less critical wins. <br> This means that Trump now needs conservatives far more than we need him. Understanding this leverage will be critical to our negotiations with him for the rest of his presidency. <br> He knows this all too well and has turned to conservatives, recently hosting a campaign-style rally in Florida and, last week, appearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he heralded his election as a "win for conservative values." On Tuesday night, he'll address Congress and, if past is prologue, direct his comments again to his core supporters. <br> Trump has deployed his deal-making skills in our direction from the beginning. His pitch was simple: "Vote for me and I'll appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court." Most conservative voters were willing to hold their noses and agree to this, in spite of his many concerning qualities. <br> But as we would with any other important deal in life, we must now assess what we're actually giving up against what we're receiving. Because what we're compromising, in this case, may be worth far more than what we're getting in return. <br> For example, Trump promised national security through increased military spending, but then opened the door to Russia's assault on our democracy and that of our most important allies in Europe. <br> He promoted a departure from political correctness in the name of free speech, but then put us in league with white nationalists, who oppose equality, as he undermines our free press, and even truth itself, by labeling them "fake news." <br> He sold us a conservative justice but appears intent on also delivering a judiciary branch with diminished independence through his attacks on what he calls "so-called judges," whose reasonable, yet unfavorable (to him) decisions he calls "political." <br> This deal should have us checking to see if we still have our wallets. It's as though Trump is granting us a free night in one of his garish gold-plated hotels as long as we part with our life savings in the casino downstairs. <br> Each of these trades is designed to give us a policy win we want in exchange for our turning a blind eye to Trump's amassing of power at the expense of our republic's essential ideals, norms, and institutions, which are enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. <br> Conservatives have loudly warned of their erosion as a matter of highest concern for decades. Will we now trade them away them for important, but lesser prizes? If so, was liberty ever our real concern, or was it merely a partisan prop in a political play? <br> We should expect Trump to approach the rest of his presidency in this transactional manner and our nation will be well-served if we demand first his respect for that which ensures our freedom. <br> For conservatives, protecting the republic requires our walking away from supporting Trump when the price to too high. As important as they are, defense spending increases, regulation rollbacks and tax reform are not a good enough trade for Trump's alignment with Russia, attacks on our free press and other branches of government, and conflicts of interest associated with his foreign business interests. <br> Continuing to back him while ignoring his attempts to weaken our democracy jeopardizes our liberty and will have long-term, negative political consequences for Republicans. <br> For the country, and for ourselves, it's time for us to say "no deal" and demand better of our president. 
 Trump's greatest firewall against the Democrats has been the fact that he enjoys a united Republican government. As of now, the GOP has been very reluctant to challenge the administration and generally remains optimistic about the political benefits that will accrue from this moment of Republican control. <br> This was supposed to be the Republican moment. But with a little over of a third of the Hundred Days almost over, Capitol Hill sounds like crickets chirping in the dead of night. <br> The early months of a presidency can be critical. Franklin Roosevelt, who would send 15 major bills to Congress by the end of his Hundred Days, had legislators working on an emergency banking bill just days after taking office. The Economy Act, which cut spending, passed a few days after FDR began work in the White House.. <br> On the night of John F. Kennedy's assassination, Lyndon Johnson was already meeting with advisers to plan how he would move forward a massive tax cut and civil rights bill through the Senate, while mapping out a schedule for sending to the Hill a host of other domestic bills. <br> Notwithstanding the controversial election that brought him into office, George W. Bush was pushing within weeks for a massive supply-side tax cut and a federal educational bill to show that he would govern like he had a mandate. By the end of January in President Obama's first term, the House had passed a massive economic stimulus bill and both chambers had voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. More importantly he was already working on health care and financial reform. <br> Why is Trump moving so slowly on the legislative front compared with his nonstop pace on everything else? If you asked him, the President would certainly blame the Democrats. He would say that the Democrats are obstructing and delaying so that he can't get anything done. But the fact is that Republicans control the House and the Senate, so charges of obstruction make little sense. <br> And in fact it's not clear whether Trump even has much interest in the legislative process. This is where his background in business might not serve him well. Congressional politics is slow, messy, incremental and often frustrating. None of this is the kind of experience that Trump enjoyed in the world of business. The command-and-control structure of the corporation, where the CEO is boss, doesn't exist in our separation of powers, where the president has to work with or find ways to work through many other actors with fiefdoms of their own. <br> To be sure, the Hundred Days ain't even close to over yet. There is still more than enough time for Trump to start moving on the legislative front and to put his opponents in a defensive position. Tuesday's address to Congress serves as an opportunity for him to get this part of his term going. If he tries a rapid-fire approach, as he has done with executive orders, with legislation, then congressional Republicans will move the bills with speed and muscle. But he has to keep them on his side. <br> Most members of Congress understand that moments of partisan unity like the one Trump now enjoys are few and far between. Time is the most valuable commodity in American politics, and with every day the opportunities for passing legislation fall away. <br> Trump needs to be careful right now. Many Republicans are clearly grumbling that the pace of the legislative agenda is not just halting but almost non-existent. Trump should not confuse partisan loyalty with love for him. The Republicans want bills to be sent their way. The longer he waits, the more that frustration builds and the more temptation there could be for the GOP to break with him. Then President Trump might find out, like presidents before him, just what Congress can do to a commander in chief they don't like. 
 As a very young man barely rounding the corner on 30, I had the opportunity to witness and view the Reagan revolution by serving as an enthusiastic and blindly optimistic apprentice in his administration. Now at the opposite bookend of my life, I have the challenge and honor of providing tiny bits of advice and counsel to my friend, the President of the United States, Donald Trump. <br> Like President Reagan before him, President Trump is beginning a White House journey with a rocky and tumultuous introduction in the midst of great division, discontent and confusion among a very diverse and conflicted American and foreign constituency. I cannot help but reflect on the parallels of these two administrations as a compass for clarity and direction. <br> President Trump is not only changing the tapestry of policy but is maneuvering the manner in which it is woven and the threads of its composition. His campaign was unconventional and disruptive, and he is now tackling Washington in an unconventional and disruptive way. It was Reagan who famously responded to a question from a Washington veteran on doing things unconventionally, "Well, isn't that why we are here?" <br> The arrival of President Trump is causing many legacy institutions to feel challenged as they scramble with the change that he is stewarding. The inertia and momentum of the government does not naturally lend itself to new methods of communication, thinking and negotiation. <br> In fact, the stable, recurring patterns of the Washington bureaucracy are designed to be immune from a consistent changing of the deck chairs, and become agitated by the need to acclimate to new circumstances. President Trump is facing the same opposition that President Reagan did almost four decades ago from the fixtures of the Washington and the global geopolitical scene. The bureaucracy is not the enemy but an essential ingredient to our success. <br> Without an unwavering entrenched establishment providing bureaucratic stability, our democratic system would cease to function in the ever-changing winds of temporal political shifts. An entrenched establishment is a safeguard, not a terminal illness. However, the bureaucracy must be amended, adopted, nourished, realigned, incentivized and held accountable. If not, the machinery itself, not the people who run it, become corroded and corrupt. Without constant supervision and monitoring, the bureaucracy will both grow in size and diminish in efficacy. <br> The President's policies were clear and distinct in his campaign and continue to be his priorities into his second month of governing: tax policy, job growth, immigration reform, a reworked health care system, a renewed national security alignment, a strengthened military and a re-engineered trade practice and policy. If the President is able to take advantage of an aligned Congress and executive branch to enact even half of these policies within the first year of administration, he will accomplish more than any other president in history. <br> The difficulty and challenge is the implementation of the President's policies into action by the agencies that are built to preserve the status quo and prevent abrupt movement. Aligning the leadership and bureaucracy of the Cabinet agencies with the policy initiatives of the President is a managerial nightmare. <br> The agencies are manned by political Schedule C appointees (individuals who report to presidential appointees), and an army of civil servants working hand in hand. Either group operating in isolation without the other is ineffective and somewhat dangerous. A little more than 30 days since the inauguration, the administration still has 2,000 vacancies, many of which require Senate confirmation, a process which is antagonistically slow and politically charged. These appointees are the nano-engines that will realign the bureaucracy to appropriately adapt to the President's and Congress's direction and practices. Without them, it will be status quo, "for better or worse." <br> The press is not the enemy, the intelligence community is the not the enemy, and even leaks in the new world of instantaneous information and social media are not the enemy. The enemies are time and confused expectations. <br> If we stop judging the President and his administration on every word that is uttered, every hour, and instead hold him accountable over time for the implementation of policies under which he ran, confusion might turn to clarity. <br> The challenges that the President is facing are not abnormal, nor are they earthshaking. Leaks to the press, death by bureaucratic sabotage and rogue cables from within the State Department are nothing new under the sun; in fact, they are celebrated traditions and were even more demonstrable during the era of the Reagan administration. <br> America is a vast tapestry of millions of threads, a multitude of colors and a diverse and distinguished array of fabric. What is truly important to the mastery of the artistry is a process that melds all these diverse elements into an understandable and lucid portrait. <br> President Reagan is not remembered for the initial confusions as he first began to set the pace. In fact, the first year of the contrarian Reagan revolution was anything but seamless. Reagan is remembered for his effective policies -- tax reform, deregulation, reinvigorating our military, bringing down the Berlin Wall -- accomplishments which were not achieved in his first year and in fact, were the result of a lengthy processes requiring significant time in the saddle, and incredible perseverance in the face of opposition. <br> The bottom line is the debate, the dialogue, the concern, the bickering, the parrying and thrusting all contribute to the process of American democracy. The institutional press is doing its job in bringing to light all sides of the Rubik's cube. <br> Journalism has dramatically changed over the last decade. Everyone has instantaneous access to data. Walter Cronkite's "And that's the way it is" no longer holds relevance to a viewer who can access information in an instant. The art of journalism is now about adding perspective and point of view to widely available facts that were once scarce and only disseminated to mainstream media. This, ultimately, is a good thing, and through adversity produces prolific dialogue and greater understanding of all points of view to a broader audience. <br> The results will always appear unsatisfactory to varying constituencies. What makes America work is the process that allows us all to express our dissatisfaction, not necessarily bask in the results of unquestioned splendor. <br> So, as I sit here musing almost 40 years later, I am hopeful and encouraged by lessons learned from the final chapters of the Reagan presidency. President Trump is a great man, and the most effective action we can take as Americans is to give him a chance. <br> With our help, he will find the same trajectory as that of President Reagan, and the nation and the world will soon look through his abrupt, blunt and esoteric style to find bold substance, compassion, implementation of his policies, global respect and admiration, and a rebalancing of the attributes that truly make America great. Let's simply hold the President accountable for delivering on the promises and policies upon which he was elected. <br> "And that's the way it is." 
 It was a disciplined message he delivered in Maryland, though in his usual extemporaneous style -- and that message was all about commonality of purpose. <br> To the left and those inside the media, it may have seemed like business as usual -- a reinforcement of traditional conservative talking points and promises. But that would be to misunderstand what the appearance meant for the Trump of 2017 -- in a different position now from the Trump who snubbed the proceedings in 2016, causing conservatives and populists at the annual conference to take sides. <br> On Friday, he arrived at CPAC having proven that he could motivate enough support outside of those policy and media circles to gain the power to deliver on those conservative promises. <br> And he has connected not just with the gathered activists and policy wonks, but with voters in Middle America that felt left out and left behind. Indeed, he continues to demonstrate that his message and his agenda can energize and motivate conservatives and other voters, including those who just a year earlier in this same venue viewed his candidacy with considerable skepticism. Now they are excited about him. <br> "It's great to be back at CPAC ... I love this place," he declared. The reception from the capacity crowd made it clear that the feeling is mutual, at least for now in the flush of victory, with the 2016 tensions replaced by a remarkable sense of optimism and enthusiasm. <br> That enthusiasm came in part because of Trump's address, which shrewdly framed his agenda in the context of familiar conservative flashpoint issues. He targeted the media, long a bête noire for the right, calling out "fake news" and the use of anonymous sources on stories. "Let their names be put out there," Trump said about critical stories based on leaks. "Let them say it to my face." <br> He continued his attack on "fake news," but said he respected the media and reporters who work hard to get stories right. Trump insisted that he will defend the First Amendment -- "who uses it more than me?" he quipped, getting a laugh -- but that it also allows him to criticize the media, just as it allows the media to criticize him. <br> On policy, Trump also stuck mainly to the common ground between populists and conservatives. Border security and immigration enforcement got the loudest cheers, as well as his pledge to represent the United States rather than the globe. <br> He repeatedly praised the NRA and pledged, "We will protect the Second Amendment," another hot-button issue with conservatives. He pledged that tax reform and deregulation, longtime projects at CPAC, would be high on his list of priorities, too. <br> All of those issues command common between populists and conservatives. The one area in which Trump appeared to seek a middle ground was on national security policy in the Middle East. He criticized the interventionist foreign policies of both Barack Obama and George Bush, saying "if our presidents had gone to the beach for the last 15 years, we'd be in much better shape." <br> However, Trump also got loud cheers for his pledge to "obliterate ISIS" and conduct "one of the great military buildups in American history." The two positions are not necessarily contradictory, but they do highlight one political tightrope he must walk between the two factions responsible for the Republican Party triumph in 2016. <br> The populists who carried Trump to victory, especially those of the Ron and Rand Paul factions, want an end to foreign entanglements altogether. Movement conservatives and the neocons mainly favor a forward strategy on terrorism, and hope to advance Western interests in former Soviet republics, which populists blame for bad relations with Russia. Balancing all this will be especially tricky in the months ahead. <br> Factions may end up at odds again before next year's CPAC on other potential fracture points, such as the tension between conservatives and populists on the deficits and on entitlement reform -- the latter especially acute on the issue of Obamacare repeal. <br> For the moment, though, the focus remains on the potential for significant advances for the right -- and Trump's speech reminded conservatives at CPAC of those tantalizing possibilities. 
 Facing fierce criticism from the right on fiscal policy, President Donald Trump has developed a new sense of urgency. In an interview last weekend with Fox's Bill O'Reilly, when asked if Americans should expect a tax cut this year, instead of saying something along the lines of "yes, absolutely," Trump offered the more restrained, "I think so ... before the end of the year. I would like to say yes." <br> Reforming the tax code is likely to be far more politically complicated than the Trump officials, most of whom are new to Washington, think. As a congressional staff aide and later an outside adviser, I worked on both the 1981 and 1986 tax reform packages. <br> The process of seeking a consensus was difficult and time-consuming. In the case of the 1986 tax reform, it took years to resolve some serious differences. Trump will face a similar challenge in a much more compressed time period. Announcements are easy to make. Actually enacting tax reform is a lot more difficult. <br> The details of the President's plan have yet to be announced, but a rough outline exists. The outline largely reflects the House Republican tax reform plan. And the answer to two questions will likely determine the success of the overall effort: <br> First, will the Senate (and perhaps even some House Republicans) kill the House's proposal for a border adjustment tax (which produces an estimated $1.4 trillion in new revenue over 10 years, the amount roughly needed for Trump's infrastructure spending and military modernization)? <br> Second, will the Senate accept the House's use of "dynamic scoring" in determining the budget implications of tax reform? Dynamic scoring assumes tax incentives have some effect in creating greater tax revenue. Critics charge that dynamic scoring is "funny math." Proponents use the analogy of a small business. "If you expand your sales budget by $100,000, you wouldn't expect sales revenues to stay the same," they argue. <br> Here's why these questions are relevant: If dynamic scoring is accepted, tax reform will include the immediate expensing for tax purposes of all capital investment, a huge stimulus for business expansion. As one congressional leader told me, "If there is no dynamic scoring, expensing is out," because the static revenue loss (on paper) as a result of the stimulus would not comply with the 10-year budget restrictions previously set by Congress. <br> By the same token, if there is no border adjustment tax, the Trump fiscal stimulus is likely to be significantly smaller than originally envisioned. US tax policy will change, but there may be nothing "phenomenal" about the final result. <br> Making tax policymaking entails a series of trade-offs. If the choice is between a border adjustment tax versus Trump's reckless call for 35% or higher tariffs aimed at US trade competitors, the choice is clear. <br> Tariffs would risk a global trade war and almost certain worldwide recession. The border adjustment alternative would likely be consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization and would not lead necessarily to trade retaliation. The US corporate tax system would not be dissimilar to the value-added tax systems used elsewhere in the world to the disadvantage of American companies. <br> But here's the ultimate question: Is the President's call for tariffs the opening bid in an elaborate effort to strike a deal on a border adjustment tax he wanted all along? <br> In other words, by threatening the world with tariffs, does the border adjustment tax (and its $1.4 trillion in new revenue) become the reasonable and safe alternative? Or is the new President not that clever? When all is said and done, one thing is certain about tax policy: All policy changes produce unintended economic and political consequences. That's why enacting a border adjustment tax is hardly a sure thing. <br> Finally, there is the issue of Trump's promise of individual tax rate reduction. Some of the administration's economic advisers have suggested the personal tax reductions be separated from the corporate tax stimulus, with the personal tax code to be addressed at a later time. <br> Here's the problem: More than 80% of businesses in the United States use so-called "pass-throughs" to pay their taxes -- proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter S organizations that all pay their taxes using the personal income tax schedules. Unless these firms are part of the corporate tax reform plan, small businesses and startups, which are already at a disadvantage relative to large corporations because of the complexity of the tax code, will fall further behind. <br> The upshot is that many Democrats in Congress are open to supporting a plan that reforms the inefficient corporate tax system. Few Democrats will support a plan for individual tax rate reduction. Here's the problem: Can a President who won by promising support for the Rust Belt's "forgotten man" really agree to a plan that delays tax rate cuts for the middle class and pushes fiscal stimulus for the corporate class? 
 The clock is ticking. President Trump has between now and April 29 to make the most of his Hundred Days. <br> Ever since Franklin Roosevelt introduced the term in 1933 as he pushed through Congress one of the boldest domestic agendas that the nation had seen, 75 bills in total, these important weeks in the early history of a presidency have become a lens through which politicians and pundits view the effectiveness of a new leader. <br> The Hundred Day record for presidents is mixed. <br> John F. Kennedy saw a Democratic Congress -- deeply divided between conservative southern Democrats and liberal northern Democrats -- stifle most of his domestic agenda, while the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba undercut the perception that many Americans had of his foreign policy competence. <br> Ronald Reagan didn't get nearly as much done as FDR, as a Republican Senate could not overcome the opposition of a Democratic House, and in March the would-be assassin John Hinckley shot him, but the president was able to get a historic tax reduction moving through Congress and he deregulated oil markets through executive action. <br> Bill Clinton had an even worse experience than Kennedy, despite enjoying a Democratic House until 1994 and even though he had promised overwhelming success. <br> In his Hundred Days, President Obama moved his stimulus bill through Congress and put into motion the financial regulation proposals that would culminate in the Dodd-Frank legislation. <br> The truth is that the Hundred Days is just a construct, a way for presidents to define a specific period of time and to create pressure on allies in Congress to move as fast as possible before their time for legislating closes. It's interesting to note that some presidents who are considered failures, such as Jimmy Carter, actually had a bountiful Hundred Days. <br> The narrative <br> The notion of the Hundred Days offers a way for the news media to create a sense of drama for viewers and readers by fashioning a clear narrative. <br> The entire premise rests on the belief that a president has some "political capital" he can use after an election to push things through Congress, a so-called "honeymoon" period when legislators will bend to his will. As every president discovers, these concepts are overblown and opponents are ready to fight in the first Hundred Days and thereafter. <br> What will President Trump do in his Hundred Days? For all the talk about his unpredictability and maverick style, the outlines of what we are going to see in this period are pretty clear. His inaugural address indicated that, once again, the Trump "pivot" will have to wait. While the details are fuzzy, and the devil is in the details, we can expect to see him work with the Republican Congress on a number of objectives. <br> Deregulate <br> Few issues have animated Donald Trump as much as deregulating the economy, particularly energy markets and financial institutions. It was not much of a surprise that the markets boomed after Trump was elected president. <br> After all, Trump is an ardent supporter of this core idea from the Reagan Revolution: removing government restrictions from economic activity is the best way to go. Trump has made it clear throughout his campaign that he views federal regulations as an inhibition to economic growth. <br> We should expect to see him push aggressively for ending the prohibitions on offshore drilling that have hampered oil exploration. With a Cabinet team picked right out of Wall Street, the administration will also work to either overturn or gut the Dodd-Frank financial regulations that were put into place after the 2008 crash. <br> Deregulation will not only occur through executive action and legislation, but also through the hands of potential Cabinet officials like Rick Perry and Scott Pruitt, if they are confirmed, who have no sympathy for the programs they are now responsible for administering. <br> Repeal <br> Trump has made it clear that he is coming after as much of President Obama's legacy as possible. The first program on the chopping block is the Affordable Care Act, and the congressional Republicans have already gotten started by passing bills that eliminate most of the program. <br> If Trump follows through on his promise to gut the program, it will be difficult for Democrats to stop him. Yes there could be catastrophic fallout and a political backlash as millions lose their benefits, but right now it seems that Republicans are deciding that they will deal with that later. <br> Trump has also promised to go after other programs, such as the "Dreamers" executive action that allowed the children of undocumented immigrants who were born in this country to stay. <br> He might use his executive power to overturn what Obama achieved on issues like the Paris climate agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Iran Nuclear deal. <br> He will also likely go after lesser known executive orders, such as Obama's 2016 action instructing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that significantly broadened the term of who was "engaged in the business" of selling guns so to give the federal government greater regulatory power. <br> Legislate <br> Trump won't only be focused on tearing things down. With a very conservative Republican Congress to work with, he will try to use this window to start creating a legacy of his own. Although we don't know if he will brand his programs with the Trump logo, we do know that there are a number of areas where he will pursue legislation that fulfills some of his campaign goals. <br> We are very likely to see efforts from the White House to make good on his hard-line anti-immigration rules. He might go for broke and push for the construction of a wall -- or else he might work within the boundaries of what's politically easier such as increasing deportations and putting more funding into border control. He is also expected to put forward an infrastructure bill laden with tax incentives for developers to show that he is serious about creating jobs while placing Democrats in a difficult position to oppose him. Another area where he could potentially attract Democrats would be a tax reform package that eliminates incentives for corporations to move overseas. Loophole-closing reform has often been an issue that can draw bipartisan support. <br> Nominate and confirm <br> President Trump has already started with this process. He has pushed hard and fast for his Cabinet picks, staffing the offices with members who if confirmed will push for a very conservative agenda. Some of the nominees might get tripped up, particularly on ethics issues that have emerged in the hearings. <br> The main problem is that Senate Democrats did away with the filibuster for nearly all confirmations in 2013, meaning that Republicans only have to get a simple majority of the Senate to approve nominees. <br> The most difficult battle will be the Supreme Court where the Democrats still do have the filibuster at their disposal. Trump has promised to make a very conservative pick to fill the vacancy that now exists, tipping the balance to the right. We should expect he will do that early on to build his support with the conservative base. The Supreme Court won't be the only selection. He will move to fill as many federal judgeships as he can with conservative justices to build his support with the right and with Senate Democrats now unable to filibuster his appointments. <br> Fight <br> Don't be surprised if Trump exercises presidential power with a show of force against ISIS. Throughout his campaign, the president blasted the Obama administration for being too timid against international security threats. <br> He criticized the administration for refusing to take forceful action when terrorists struck and for not doing enough in Syria to put down the ISIS forces fighting against the Assad regime. All eyes are now on the White House to see whether the president employs military force to respond to these security concerns. <br> He will reverse much of what Obama has accomplished by putting diplomacy and international alliances front and center. We should expect the continuation of provocative statements about countries such as China as well as the use of threats involving trade against countries he sees as hostile. <br> NATO will be tested more than ever with Trump's attacks on the alliance and potential support for Republicans threats to reduce our financial contributions. At the same time we should not be surprised to see an easing of sanctions against the Russians. <br> Of course, it's not possible to completely predict how the Hundred Days will shape up. Unexpected events have a way of reshaping the agenda of an administration, forcing the president to adjust and improve and to move in new directions. 
 To his credit and to the ultimate benefit of the nation, Trump has been far more conciliatory toward his erstwhile opponents than they would have been had Clinton won. And for the most part, they have responded by joining his team. Trump tapped South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for the important role of ambassador to the United Nations, and by all reports, Mitt Romney was high on Trump's list for secretary of state. And Trump has welcomed into his transition longtime campaign staffers and consultants who only a few months ago worked to defeat him. <br> This coming together of the party has been driven by Trump himself. Trump did not transform into a liberal the moment Clinton conceded, as many in the Never Trump camp warned he would. Instead, he has continued to champion the same conservative ideals that won him so much grass-roots support. <br> But before we all gather around the fire and sing "Kumbaya," there's still much work to be done. While Never Trump didn't mean never for many, holdouts remain, particularly in conservative media. Whether at The Wall Street Journal, the National Review, The Washington Post or in the feeds of millions of Twitter followers, their voices matter -- more for what they don't say than what they do. It's not as if the left ever intended to allow Trump a political honeymoon. He was always going to face attacks by Democrats and their allies. What Trump needs now is for smart, principled people to push back. He needs his own echo in the echo chamber. <br> It's true that Trump did just fine without that kind of support during the campaign. But that success was based on the sheer power of his personality. Governing is different than campaigning. If Trump wants to accomplish his goals, he'll need to convince a skittish and often skeptical Congress to go along with him. That job will be much more difficult if he is constantly fending off attacks from his own political base -- or if that same base is silent in the face of the Democratic political machine. <br> The Cabinet fights that are ramping up are simply a preview of things to come. Democrats aren't attacking Sessions because they actually believe he is a racist. If that were true, Booker wouldn't have been cozying up to him only a year ago. Rather, Democrats don't like Sessions because he's conservative. He'll do things such as enforce our laws on immigration and illegal drugs, a dramatic change from Obama's Department of Justice. But the left recognizes that the American people are actually pretty fond of the rule of law: Enter the race card. <br> Never Trump Republicans need not abandon their principles to do their part. There will be debates to come -- on trade, on spending, on national defense. But conservatives are also presented with an opportunity to reform the government, to implement good policies, and, yes, to make America great again. But it will only happen if conservatives are willing to swallow their pride and support a president they don't always like and with whom they haven't always agreed. <br> Because I can promise you this: The Democrats are ready for a fight. 
 If there was one unambiguous bipartisan message from the outcome of the November election, it was this: It's time for business as usual to come to an end. Washington, we heard over and over again, has become too unaccountable to the voters and in the minds of many, corrupted by power. <br> Yet Monday night, behind closed doors, the House Republican Conference made their very first act of the new Congress an explicit rejection of that unmistakable message. <br> If House Republicans want to get back on track, they will need to treat this as a teachable moment on the lessons of transparency in the Age of Trump. <br> The new rules proposed by rank and file Republicans stipulated that the nonpartisan office be subject to oversight by the separate House Committee on Ethics, made up of members of Congress. It could not make public statements or examine anonymous complaints. It could not review any possible violations of criminal law. In other words, there was not a heck of a lot it could do. <br> There is indeed a legitimate case to be made for what the Republicans did. There has been bipartisan grumbling about some of the Star Chamber-like qualities of the office since Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats created it eight years ago. <br> In many cases, the damage was already done, and the members' exonerations weren't usually covered at all by the media. <br> But I've had my own dealings with Office of Congressional Ethics and, without exception, found it to be thoughtful and deliberate. They take complaints and accusations of ethical breaches seriously. Their very strength was their independence. By contrast, too often in the past the House Ethics Committee has been reluctant to investigate its own. <br> That doesn't mean the office doesn't need reforming. Proceedings need to be made more transparent and should provide a better sense of due process to those the office investigates. Democrats seemed to agree with that as much as Republicans. <br> But in an era where bipartisan agreement may be rare amid proposals for replacing Obamacare and passing tax reform, why not try to forge a solution that Democrats could agree with? Why not do so out in the open instead of confirming the worst stereotypes about smoke-filled rooms in Congress? <br> The President-elect rightly called out House Republicans' fecklessness and misplaced priorities over his favorite medium, leading to a near immediate repeal. The House Republican caucus would have faced never-ending ridicule by Democrats, government watchdogs and transparency advocates. <br> Republicans will have no shortage of legislative battles in the coming months that will test their unity and whether there are compromises to be made with the other side. It's a shame that their first test on this front came up so short. 
 To the untrained eye, that sure makes it sounds like the President-elect, with a couple of tweets, forced the House to abandon its plan to put the Independent Office of Congressional Ethics under lawmaker control, a move that split the party and had just about everyone scratching their heads. <br> And so began the pronouncements that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's influence was all but dead. What he can accomplish with a microphone or a gavel, so this hyperventilating went, was no match for what Trump could do with a tweet. <br> But, as is often the case when it comes to covering Trump, there's more to the story. <br> It's an understandable -- and indeed compelling -- way to frame his unprecedented social media prowess. <br> Yet consider the sequence of events in this case. <br> Then, word came that House Republicans scheduled an emergency meeting to pull the measure. <br> "President-elect Donald Trump dramatically strong-armed House Republicans into line Tuesday in his first Washington power play, after they voted to gut an ethics watchdog in a manner that undercut his vow to drain the establishment 'swamp.'" <br> To be fair, it's a safe assumption that upon seeing Trump's tweet many of the amendment's supporters -- who are ironically also Trump supporters -- decided they would not fall on a sword to defend an optically imprudent proposal that the President-elect was not behind. <br> But it's also just as reasonable to believe many of those same House members caved to public pressure as news of the perplexing legislation made its way through the press back to constituents who thought it a troubling first item of business for the new Congress. <br> What is not reasonable, though, is the assertion that Republican leadership somehow caved to Trump. In fact, it's more likely the other way around, even if Trump himself doesn't know it. <br> Ryan, as well as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, voiced their concerns with this measure Monday night in the closed-door meeting, sources in the speaker's office tell me. While most agreed the ethics watchdog panel was problematic -- it allegedly leaked stories to the press and forced lawmakers to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars proving their innocence against anonymous tipsters -- leadership was outspoken that this amendment was the wrong way to go about reform. Alternative paths were proposed, but they were overwhelmingly denied by House members. <br> In reality, Paul Ryan was against this before Trump was. According to my sources, Ryan and Trump only spoke after the vote was resolved. 
 Democratic lawmakers representing liberal parts of America habitually denounce this sort of thing: Spending reductions combined with tax cuts benefiting upper incomes. The question is, "should they?" and the answer is "no." The blue states should take the money and run. <br> Most of the proposed federal tax reforms would leave more wealth in the affluent blue states. They could capture some of it through their own taxes and economic activity unleashed by residents with more money in their pockets. <br> The federal income tax has been called a blue-state tax because the higher incomes tend to cluster in Democratic strongholds. What's especially unfair about this is the federal tax code does not account for cost of living, which is highest in the elite coastal cities. <br> There's no reason why like-minded states can't get together and solve problems, including local challenges and international ones like climate change. For the richer blue states, a reduced federal tax burden would leave them with the added means to address these challenges. And the nicest part: They can spend the money at home. 
 Judging by appointments to top posts in health care, the incoming Trump administration is on course to validate its campaign promise to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act. <br> Despite the emphasis by many on preserving secondary parts of the law like maintaining children up to age 26 on the parent's coverage, Americans should understand that the ACA indeed must be eliminated. Why? Because its misguided amalgam of regulations generated skyrocketing insurance premiums, reduced choice of doctors, funneled millions more poor people into substandard programs and accelerated consolidation throughout the health care industry-- serious consequences directly harmful to patients. <br> The ACA's biggest error was broadening a detrimental misapplication of health insurance that began decades ago. The point of insurance is to reduce risk of financial disaster. Instead, with its long list of mandates and regulations, the ACA furthered the inappropriate construct that insurance should subsidize all medical care and minimize out-of-pocket payments. The ACA's coverage requirements directly caused more widespread adoption of bloated insurance. <br> When combined with invisible health care prices as well as doctor qualifications, most patients have virtually no incentive and lack sufficient information to consider value; similarly, providers don't need to compete on price. The consequences are the overuse of health care and unrestrained costs. <br> HSAs, tax-sheltered accounts for smaller health expenses, are another critical component of reform, because they motivate direct consideration of price. Better than simple tax deductions, HSAs also incentivize saving. These accounts have been over-regulated by current law. Raising maximums and catch-up contributions at least to those of IRA limits, and allowing uses for elderly parents and rollovers to surviving family members are steps to take immediately. <br> Beyond the numbers, the tax exclusion created perverse incentives. It encouraged higher demand for care, regardless of cost, while distorting insurance into covering almost all services, greatly increasing health care costs. Rational tax reform should have three main features: 1) deductibility for everyone, whether insured through employers, or self-employment, to level the playing field; 2) limits on exclusions to the maximum allowable HSA contribution; and 3) limited eligibility for exclusions to incentivize appropriate health spending, i.e., HSA contributions and catastrophic coverage. <br> This approach has important advantages over tax credits, an alternative favored by many conservatives, including U.S. Rep. Tom Price and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Tax credits would create yet another government entitlement, at a time when entitlement reform in the opposite direction is already urgent. Tax credits further complicate a monstrously complex tax code. Tax credits further expand the far-too-dominant IRS's mission from collecting revenues to doling out money to favorite economic activities. <br> Tax credits are actually reminiscent of Obamacare subsidies, given that government officials would necessarily set rules about eligibility, including "appropriateness" of coverage, to receive the credit. While politically appealing as a visible demonstration of a "helping hand", let's realize this -- tax credits represent another example of government literally taking taxpayer money from one person and allocating it to someone else. <br> Moreover, we must know by now that entitlement costs always -- always - expand far beyond projections. Income exclusions, on the other hand, meet a different and important fairness test -- the government overtly admits that some earned income is simply off-limits to the dictates of government and should stay with the worker. 
 Comments from Donald Trump or his transition team tend to spur frenzied efforts to figure out the President-elect's policy intentions. So new rumors over his trade policies are hardly a surprise. <br> That would be a step away from Trump's commitment to spur growth, wages and jobs in the United States. While it's true that some American workers and industries suffer from international competition, the economy as a whole is stronger and more productive when engaged in trade. <br> And the country's future prosperity demands that we reach out to the 95% of the world's consumers who live outside our borders. Raising tariff walls, hiding behind isolationist barriers, is a recipe for Japanese-style stagnation. <br> Here's another blunt reality. A 10% import tariff would be simply a tax that would raise consumer prices for every American family. It would clash directly with Trump's supposed commitment to lower taxes and grow families' budgets. <br> At the same time, according to CNN, the transition team is floating the idea of "a border adjustment tax" on imports -- an idea proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady -- as a way to spur American manufacturing. <br> Because it would exempt US exports from tax, it would allow them to compete on a level tax playing field in their country of destination -- both US goods and Brazilian goods, for example, would pay Brazil's taxes. <br> Similarly, US goods and imports would both pay the US tax. Fair is fair, and the best products win in market competition. <br> Moreover, this isn't a matter of collecting cash in every port. Under Brady's proposal, as each firm prepares its year-end tax return, it would exclude from the tax base all cross-border transactions. Specifically, it would not report overseas sales revenue -- effectively exempting it from the US tax -- or costs of imports into the United States, thereby including the cost of imported intermediates. <br> This has three virtues. First, the tax code is much simpler. A US multinational firm engages in three types of transactions: between its foreign affiliates and others abroad, between the domestic company and its foreign affiliates, and between the domestic company and others in the United States. <br> To compute their tax under the House proposal, firms operating in the United States would need only to report transactions of the last type -- domestic transactions. This limited focus also makes it easier to verify that firms are complying with the tax code. <br> The second virtue? The incentives to "game" the tax system, or hide profits offshore, are eliminated. The tax base is unaffected by the value of exports or the cost of imports, so there is no payoff to manipulating "transfer prices" between domestic and overseas operations so that reported profits are lower in the United States and higher in overseas, lower-tax jurisdictions. <br> Most importantly border adjustment removes incentives for domestic firms to relocate production offshore. Because they will owe taxes on US sales whether production takes place in the United States or elsewhere, and owe no US taxes on non-US sales, they will gain no tax benefit from shifting operations abroad. <br> We can concede global production to our competitors and make it more expensive for US families to purchase those products. Or, in the context of a larger tax reform package, we can remove the incentives that drive production to other countries and increase jobs, wages and US prosperity. Interest from the Trump transition team in moving this effort forward is a good sign. 
 After several decades of policy stalemate in Washington, cynics might conclude that the Trump era will be more of the same. Think again. Significant change is coming if only because the GOP controls both Houses of Congress, along with the White House. <br> True, some analysts argue that serious divisions within the GOP will make it tough to achieve policy consensus. But Republican congressional leaders give three reasons why civil war is unlikely and big change is coming fast. <br> First, the fact that the GOP lost so few House seats in last month's election gives House Speaker Paul Ryan a lot more ideological room to negotiate. Had some of the polls been correct and the GOP lost 20-22 seats, leaving the thinnest of majorities, the Republican House today would indeed be ungovernable. <br> Second, Republicans are terrified that if they don't deliver, the same working-class voters who turned on Hillary Clinton will turn on them. <br> And third, Republicans have a definite fear of Donald Trump himself, whose coattails in last month's election were surprisingly strong. Obstructionists will almost certainly be the subject of ridicule in a Trump tweet. <br> Here's how the next six months could unfold: <br> Tax plans <br> Trump and the GOP House leadership have surprisingly similar tax reform plans. Both include reform of the corporate and individual tax codes. Both plans have identical reductions in individual tax rates (with brackets down to 12, 25, and 33%) and are fairly similar in what they propose for other provisions of the tax code. <br> The tax plan agreed to by both Trump and the Congressional GOP will almost certainly be achieved through the legislative vehicle called reconciliation, which means only 51 votes are needed for passage (the GOP has a 52-48 Senate majority). Translation: Immune to being filibustered, their plan will likely become law very quickly. <br> The greatest difference to be resolved centers on individual taxation at the highest tax bracket. Team Trump, while lowering the top tax rate for upper-income earners, would reduce deductions such that the net effect would be no change in total taxes paid by those at this bracket. Congressional GOP tax plans would bring the top tax rate down but leave enough deductions such that the upper-income taxpayers would receive a tax cut, as measured by total taxes paid. <br> High income vs. middle-class tax cuts <br> How this difference will be resolved, and other details of the tax code (number and size of exemptions and deductions), will be determined depending in part on how Senate Republicans and the Trump administration respond to the House Republicans' decision more than a year ago to use "dynamic scoring" to determine the revenue implications from various tax policy changes. The move to dynamic scoring originated from the House Ways and Means Committee and suggests that tax policy can stimulate the economy, increasing tax revenues somewhat. No, tax rate cuts cannot pay for themselves, but they do generate some economic activity and thereby increase revenues, proponents argue. <br> How GOP differences are resolved on dynamic scoring will determine the number and size of deductions left in the tax code. Depending on how Congress scores the revenue loss, for example, the top corporate tax rate, which is now 39%, could be reduced to as low as 15% or as high as 20%. <br> On the issue of whether the final tax plan, while reducing the top tax rate, has no net tax cut (Trump Plan) or a net tax cut (House GOP Plan), watch for Trump to have the upper hand. The likely outcome is that high-income earners will receive a net tax cut, but not nearly as generous as congressional GOP tax writers propose, meaning a significantly larger net tax cut is in store for the middle class. Both approaches would entail significant revenue losses and the deficit would grow. <br> Future of Obamacare? <br> Candidate Trump vowed to "kill" Obamacare. The GOP could accomplish that goal immediately using the vehicle of reconciliation, which again only requires 51 votes to eliminate the part of the legislation that finances the program. <br> Republicans sense they need to send their core constituency the message that they took action to kill a plan that has allowed health care premiums and deductions to skyrocket. But the politics are tricky. The implementation of any legislative action will likely be delayed, probably until after the 2018 midterm elections. Here's why: Replacing Obamacare with some new health care system cannot be done through reconciliation, which is a special legislative approach limited to financial and budgetary matters. Instead, enacting an entirely new health care plan requires the legislative track called "regular order" which requires 60 votes for passage (by overcoming a certain filibuster) and therefore will need the support of a number of Democratic senators. <br> That sounds like a recipe for legislative stalemate. But there may be a reason a number of Senate Democrats (25 out of 48 are up for re-election in 2018, with 10 coming from so-called "red" states) may be willing to compromise with Trump and the Republicans on a health care reform plan. <br> The GOP will delay implementation of any effort to kill Obamacare precisely because of the anticipation the program will die its own death. So why take the blame for killing it? Both parties would then have no choice but to devise a bipartisan replacement. As one GOP congressional leader told me, "There are some things the Democrats want that we can live with. Compromise is not out of the question. We'll come up with a new plan. We have to." <br> Infrastructure: A trillion-dollar question? <br> Finally, there is the issue of infrastructure spending. It is assumed that on the first day of the Trump administration, $1 trillion in infrastructure spending will be dropped from a helicopter onto the US economy. But such an approach is not practical. Instead, a lot of the upcoming infrastructure spending is likely to be stretched out over several years with decisions made in close coordination with state and local governments. <br> The Republican leadership says it is determined to avoid the Obama administration's experience in 2009 when officials were desperate to find "shovel ready" projects to initiate as stimulus in response to the financial crisis. A lot of less-than-essential projects were funded. "Shovel ready" in too many cases proved to be a euphemism for "needless but ready." <br> But how will Congress finance this new spending? Think big corporations. In 2015, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and then-Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, were engaged in negotiations over the connection of an infrastructure spending plan to a plan for overseas corporate profit repatriation; currently $2.5 trillion in US corporate profits are parked overseas, where tax rates are lower, and could be put to work building the US economy. <br> Senate leader Harry Reid (retiring this year) stepped in and killed any chance of compromise. Watch for the Schumer-Ryan negotiations to begin again. In their negotiations, any infrastructure spending plan should involve US corporations being asked to purchase a specified amount of low interest rate infrastructure bonds as part of any generous overseas profit repatriation exercise designed to bring the $2.5 trillion back home. <br> So, here's my crystal ball on what is about to quickly unfold. With upcoming changes to the tax code and replacement of Obamacare, Congress will take the lead. Change will happen relatively quickly, but Team Trump will have influence in keeping the bulk of the stimulus directed at the middle class. But here's the point: The rough outlines of the proposed reforms have already been debated and are on the shelf, waiting to be quickly enacted. <br> On infrastructure spending, President Trump will likely take the lead. Throughout his first term, the new president will position himself as the hands-on, shirtsleeves-rolled-up "builder." In other words, on domestic policy he will appear to be more like a big city Northeast mayor than a traditional conservative Republican president. Trump will regularly visit infrastructure construction sites, with press in tow. <br> As always, the question is whether the end result avoids a new round of Solyndras, "bridges to nowhere" and other nonsense associated with stimulus and infrastructure spending in the past. <br> The smarter approach would be for the President-elect now to do something that Congress would hate: Establish a distinguished panel of independent experts to decide which projects are funded. This would be similar to the successful military base realignment and closing commission that worked so successfully between 1988 and 2005. But then again, when has Washington ever adopted the smarter approach? <br> Meanwhile, get ready for takeoff. 
 "For of all sad words of tongue and pen, The saddest are these: 'It might have been.'" <br> Four years ago, I watched our country miss a tremendous opportunity to vastly improve our national well-being when we re-elected President Barack Obama and shunned Mitt Romney. <br> To this day, I believe the United States suffered on every measurable level -- economically, societally and internationally -- because of that decision, and I suspect many of my fellow Americans retrospectively agree. <br> Why? Because of what "might have been." <br> Compared to the undeniable chaos of the last four years, a Republican presidency would have delivered a dramatically better reality for our citizens and for the world. <br> Domestically, dozens of serious jobs bills would likely have been signed into law; the Environmental Protection Agency's war on American energy, especially coal, would likely have ended; the Keystone XL pipeline would surely have begun construction; comprehensive tax reform could have lowered rates for everyone and made our tax code fairer; corruption at the IRS would more likely have been properly condemned and punished; the Little Sisters of the Poor would no doubt have been left alone to keep caring for the elderly instead of being forced into court for their survival; and so much more. <br> Abroad, the war on terrorism could have been waged with resolve, not reluctance; the Islamic State would have been taken seriously at its infancy and exterminated without restraint; the Iran nuclear deal would never have happened; Vladimir Putin's resurgent Russia would have been seen as the geopolitical threat it is, and likely would have been deterred before victimizing our ally Ukraine; even the situation in Syria may well have looked more positive than its current state of agony. <br> Yes, these are hopeful hypotheticals. But I don't list them to express useless regret. Instead, they should be seen as affirming that, as much as ever, elections have consequences. <br> The course of the next four years is completely in our control and should not be permitted to resemble the last eight years. The challenges of those years still exist, yet for now, so do many of the opportunities. Time will not stand still if we wait to seize them. <br> It is abundantly clear that a President Hillary Clinton, bound to a ruthlessly left-wing base, will simply not be able to break from the Obama trajectory and thus provide the stronger leadership these tough times demand. Only a unified Republican government, unbeholden to the status quo, is capable of confronting today's reality and securing a more prosperous and hopeful future for all Americans. <br> This, of course, means making Donald Trump our 45th president. <br> To be sure, I've read the big-name newspaper endorsements of Mrs. Clinton. I hear what Hollywood celebrities are saying. And, yes, Mr. Trump's secretly recorded comments remain unacceptable. But I care far more about actions and products than words, and in government the most important product is policy. <br> Donald Trump is not feeble, nor without immense energy. And when it comes to what actually matters -- policy -- he will use his energy to empower those outside of Washington, not in it. Only a Trump presidency can undo the current damage caused by explosive government growth and chart a new direction. <br> As Obamacare keeps imploding and working families keep suffering, Mrs. Clinton will focus her efforts on patching up the law and keeping it on life support; Mr. Trump has pledged to sign repeal legislation to end the disaster and start fresh. <br> And when the unaccountable regulatory state inevitably gets challenged before the Supreme Court, Clinton-appointed justices will ignore the Constitution and let the red tape keep flowing; Trump-appointed justices will do exactly the opposite. <br> When it comes to the most urgently needed policy overhauls, a victory for Donald Trump next month would be a course correction for our entire union. The tragedy would come in 2020 if Americans -- worn down from more division, more anxiety and more stagnation -- have to look back at another four wasted years and think those saddest of words: what might have been. 
 House Republicans have had a tough decade. Many of us elected in 2010, 2012 and 2014 went to Washington to challenge President Obama's big-government, progressive agenda that was sending our country down the wrong track, driving up debt, and imposing growth-choking, Washington-knows-best regulations on our health care, financial services, energy and other industries. <br> Although President Obama and congressional liberals blocked many of our efforts, we have enacted critical opioid, infrastructure, human trafficking and veterans legislation. And while the Obama agenda has not been stopped, it has been slowed. In the past 5½ years, congressional Republicans blocked, among other things: <br> We've also exposed agencies and high-ranking officials who violated fundamental precepts of public service. We've put bills on the President's desk to repeal Obamacare and block implementation of onerous EPA rules. And the Senate has exercised its constitutional prerogative to decline consideration of the Supreme Court nominee of a President who has willfully overstepped his constitutional limits. <br> A platform for the future <br> But our proposals for health care, tax and regulatory reform, strengthening security and generating upward mobility will only become reality if someone in the White House signs our legislation. That is the fulcrum on which we sit. We simply cannot afford another four years of sputtering zero to 2% economic growth. That is the consequence if A Better Way is not enacted into law. Hillary Clinton's status quo, big-government policies will only lead to more debt, doubt and decline. <br> While I appreciate the concerns I hear from some constituents and fellow members about the choices the American people face this November, I encourage everyone to consider something that has been missing in this debate. It actually concerns one of the planks in our Better Way platform, and that has to do with the people with which I serve -- the members of the United States Congress. <br> In A Better Way, we describe how Congress can reclaim its constitutional responsibilities. Those responsibilities go to the heart of the notion of self-rule. Our Founders recognized that in our country, the people are the sovereign. The people exercise that sovereignty through elected representatives, who in turn enact laws to which the people are subject. If the people do not consent to those laws, they can change their representatives. <br> Regulatory superstate <br> When you couple the regulatory leviathan with our broken appropriations process, where Congress gets cornered into take-it-or-leave-it omnibus spending bills that grotesquely limit its spending power, the legislative branch today exercises far less authority than the Constitution grants to it. <br> But now the good news. Our historic Better Way platform puts us on offense. This is fitting, because we, the people's representatives, are the ones who should be setting the nation's policy agenda. It is in Congress where government of, by and for the people happens. <br> Donald Trump is following our lead on other matters as well. For example, his tax plan has evolved to conform more closely to our tax plan in the Better Way. <br> Our three branches of government are supposed to be independent and separate. That means, for example that if a Republican were in the White House, a Republican Congress would still be free to exercise its own, independent constitutional role. And there should be a healthy tension between the branches. <br> I would expect such with a Republican Congress and a Trump administration. Unlike the manner in which congressional Democrats have circled the wagons to defend President Obama's unconstitutional overreach and Clinton's email debacle, Benghazi lies and failed tenure at the State Department, I fully expect to see a Republican Congress hold a President Trump accountable. <br> We have already seen, for example, members of our party disagree with Trump when he expresses opinions that are inconsistent with their own. <br> Holding President Trump accountable <br> Holding a President Trump accountable includes ensuring he keeps the commitments he has made to conservatives, especially regarding nominations to the Supreme Court. Who knows, as we conduct such oversight, it is possible our Democratic colleagues may finally understand that a large part of the past six years of GOP House control has not been about like or dislike of President Obama, but about his failed policies and the protection of institutional, constitutional prerogatives of the United States Congress. <br> And while a Trump administration will be subject to checks and balances from a Republican Congress, I expect a President Trump to exercise the executive branch's checks and balances as well. <br> It would be great to see Trump help Congress find spending discipline by forcing Congress to abandon its bipartisan, spend-by-omnibus tradition. He should veto any of these thousand-page, trillion-dollar bills that reach his desk. <br> None of this happens, however, if Hillary Clinton is President. With Donald Trump, you have someone who has already pledged to sign transformative legislation to restore congressional oversight, has embraced tax reform and health care reform proposals similar to those in A Better Way and pledged to support conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. <br> Should he not follow through on these commitments, Congress will exercise stringent oversight. In other words, a Trump administration offers a rare opportunity for a resurgent legislative branch. <br> Ours is a unique moment in history. It is time for Congress to step up and into the role the Founders envisioned for the branch closest to the people. That makes this coming Election Day a date with destiny we should embrace. 
 There are two key lessons in this. <br> Yet the truth is that Clinton's just-released 2015 return is fully open to being audited. For the next three years, the IRS could challenge Clinton on anything that anyone -- an eager press, an active "right-wing conspiracy" -- might find in those returns. <br> How would Trump's tax plans affect him, personally? Hillary's tax returns showed that she and Bill earned about $10.6 million in 2015, and paid $3.24 million in taxes for an effective tax rate of about 31%. Hillary's tax reform plans would raise her own family's taxes, by hundreds of thousands of dollars. <br> Trump does tout how he is closing the "carried interest" loophole that Wall Street hedge fund managers use to reduce their taxes, but it is not clear that their taxes will in fact go up at all. It is also not clear if any of this is relevant to Trump, personally. <br> Trump and his fellow Republicans like to lambaste Clinton for her alleged "pay-for-play" schemes. Is Donald Trump paying to become president so he can play trickle-down-tax-policy for himself and his family, to make the Trump brand rich again? If that sounds crazy, then Don't-Disclose-Donald can prove it is indeed crazy by one simple step -- releasing his returns. 
 Donald Trump's travesty of a presidential campaign is forcing Republicans to ask themselves some hard questions: Does party loyalty outweigh the risks of putting a self-infatuated political ignoramus in the White House? Do they hate Hillary Clinton more than they love their country? <br> No doubt Democrats are enjoying the GOP's agonizing moment of truth, but their party also faces a big strategic choice. Will Democrats wage the fall campaign as pro-growth progressives or as angry populists? <br> Trump's reckless caricature of the U.S. economy as a "disaster" gives Democrats a huge opening. They can offer anxious voters a hopeful counterpoint to Trump's fearful narrative -- a positive plan for parlaying our country's strengths in technological innovation and entrepreneurship into stronger economic growth that works for all Americans. <br> An opportunity for Democrats <br> Like all of Trump's forays into policy, the speech was widely panned, including by conservative economists. It showed how little Trump appreciates the key role innovation plays in driving growth in today's knowledge economy, and how nostalgic he is for the factory economy of the 1970s. <br> Consider this: the digital sector -- broadband, mobile devices, social networks, online content providers -- is responsible for 45 percent of private sector growth since 2007 and virtually all the productivity gains, according to PPI research, and virtually all the productivity gains. Yet it didn't rate a mention in Trump's speech. As if stuck in an Archie Bunker time warp, he promised to bring home jobs from China and Mexico and restore America's old dominance in steel and autos. Soon we'll all be driving U.S.-made muscle cars again -- believe me! <br> Trump's retro vision of what makes America great -- namely, low-tech, middling skilled, labor-intensive manufacturing jobs that are highly vulnerable to automation -- is a major political liability. Yes, it taps into the gnawing sense of economic and cultural dispossession felt by many blue-collar workers. <br> But it doesn't speak to the aspirations of middle-class voters who now mostly work in offices, use digital technology to boost their productivity, and understand that their jobs depend both on keeping their skills up to date and on their companies' ability to succeed in global competition. <br> What Trump offers is mainly a fantasy of retribution against the "elites" who have supposedly wrecked the U.S. economy. In picking him as their standard bearer, Republicans have abandoned any pretense of being the party of economic competence and growth in this election. <br> This presents Democrats with a striking opportunity -- if they can resolve their own identity crisis. Are they a party of economic innovation and progress, or a party of economic reaction -- a left-wing version of Trump? <br> What not to do <br> Although Clinton staved off a surprisingly strong challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders, she felt constrained enough to make significant concessions to her party's increasingly assertive populist wing. The big question now is whether this distinct social democratic tilt will prevent Democrats from taking full advantage of the GOP's blunder in making Trump their standard bearer. <br> The conventional view among party elites, echoed by political reporters, is that Clinton must keep railing against the "rigged game," free trade, Wall Street and other populist bogeymen, for two reasons. One is to prevent Trump from making deeper inroads among white, working-class voters in Midwestern swing states like Ohio and Wisconsin. The other is to keep Sanders' voters -- especially his young white supporters -- in the fold. <br> Such calculations, however, look back at primary and caucus voters rather than the national electorate candidates will face this fall. Trump's nativism and bigotry make him anathema to millennials, whose mantra is diversity and equality. True, there are still a hard core of "Bernie Bros" who despise Clinton as a corporate sell-out and warmonger. Some of them may opt for third-party candidates or stay home, but young voters' antipathy to Trump will be a strong motivator to turn out in the fall, however tepid their enthusiasm for Clinton. <br> Nor does it make much sense for Democrats to compete with Trump in pushing blue-collar America's hot buttons. In the first place, non-college-educated whites have been voting predominantly Republican for a generation, more on cultural than economic grounds. And nobody is going to "out-populist" Trump on trade, immigration, "law and order," hostility to Muslims, or the alleged incompetence and corruption of the nation's political class. <br> Targeting aspirational voters <br> Instead, Democrats should recalibrate their primary message to appeal to aspirational voters across the middle of the political spectrum -- independents, college-educated suburban moderates and a substantial slice of Republicans who can't abide Trump. <br> A savvy economic platform <br> To build a broad majority that can deliver victory up and down the ballot, Democrats should offer voters a progressive alternative to populism that puts economic innovation and growth front and center. They need a plan to attack today's popular discontents at their root -- by breaking our economy out of a slow-growth trap that's been holding down wages. <br> These include major public and private investments in modern infrastructure; a strong push for advanced materials and 3D printing to keep America in the vanguard of advanced manufacturing; a strategy for digitizing the physical economy and accelerating the "Internet of Things"; pro-growth tax reform (including bringing business taxes down to globally competitive levels); a systematic lowering of regulatory barriers to innovation and startups; and, a robust system of career and technical education to equip workers without college degrees with skills and credentials valued by employers. <br> Trump's economic illiteracy gives Democrats a chance to own economic growth and opportunity. They'd be fools not to seize it. 
 The economic plan that Donald Trump presented on Monday in Detroit, while light on details, provides a good glimpse into what the nation can expect from a Trump presidency. Though the plan had a few noteworthy ideas, it misfired on issues ranging from tax reduction and reform to regulatory reform and trade policy. <br> The plan promises across-the-board tax reduction, aimed mainly at middle-class Americans. Reductions in marginal tax rates can spur economic activity, but unless the tax cuts improve the incentives to work and save, they are at best mildly beneficial in the short run and detrimental in the long run. <br> In particular, Trump proposes allowing parents to deduct the average cost of child care from their annual taxes. This incentivizes more children and spending -- the opposite of good reform. Policy distorts incentives when it takes a stand on the number of children or the kind of spending; it should remain neutral about these decisions. <br> Trump also called for tax simplification, such as reducing the number of existing tax brackets. This is fine as far as it goes, but in an era of HR Block and TurboTax, it's a trivial simplification. True improvement means elimination of the code's myriad exemptions, deductions, credits and other features that favor particular types of income or activity. Trump's plan so far provides no such examples. <br> At the same time, Trump promises a lower tax rate on business income and full expensing of investment. This is all for the better. Lower taxation encourages businesses to locate domestically, and full expensing allows a simpler corporate tax code. The lower rate does mean a higher deficit, but by a modest amount, given the additional business activity that will occur in the United States. <br> Concern that lower business taxation helps the rich is misplaced. By keeping jobs in the country, a lower rate mainly benefits the working class because they are less likely to see their jobs shipped overseas. <br> On regulatory reform, Trump's proposals are headed in the right direction but unlikely to have much impact. A moratorium on new regulations will simply generate a bump in regulations once the moratorium ends. A directive to regulatory agencies to identify misguided regulations will mainly generate feel good suggestions that never materialize. Trump's claims about regulatory overkill are also likely exaggerated. <br> Regardless, Trump would have to target specific agencies and regulations if he wants to make a real difference. <br> And Trump's proposals on trade are particularly dangerous because some sound "reasonable" at first glance. He suggests, for example, that we impose tariffs on countries that "cheat" by subsidizing exports. Yet every country cheats in this way, including the United States. So this "sensible" departure from free trade is an excuse to impose tariffs widely, often at the urging of crony capitalists who stand to benefit. <br> Taken as a whole, Trump's economic plan is disastrous. Large tax cuts without even larger spending reductions mean explosive deficits and debt. Massive interference with free trade means a far less productive economy. The few sensible elements -- tax reform and regulatory reform -- cannot plausibly undo the damage of the other proposals. 
 The Framers of our Constitution meant Congress to be a great deliberative body. It has become an embarrassment. Congress doesn't deliberate to resolve important national issues. Congress fundraises, and postures to fundraise, to support the next fight for control. <br> The transformation to this "Fundraising Congress" began in 1993. Newt Gingrich was its leader. After claiming Republican control of both houses of Congress in 1995 -- for the first time in 40 years -- Gingrich launched his new army of reformers on a project to secure permanent control of that institution, and of government. <br> Fundraising was the key to that strategy of control. The Republicans came to power raising a then unheard of amount of money: $618.42 million in the election cycle ending in 1994, compared to the Democrats' $488.68 million. <br> In the four years between 1994 and 1998, Republican candidates and party committees would raise over $1 billion. Never before had a party come anywhere close to raising that amount of money, because never before had any party's leaders so effectively focused the energy of their members on this single task: fundraising. <br> Gingrich concentrated the "work" of Congress into a three-day "work" week. He sent his caucus home for the rest of the week, in part so they had time to launch cross-country fundraising missions. <br> Members of Congress now spend between 30% to 70% of their time raising money to get re-elected to Congress or to get their party back into power. And not just the Republicans: The Democrats quickly followed the lessons of Professor Gingrich. And in the 20 years since he came to power, practically everything about that great institution has changed. <br> Gone is any semblance of deliberation, or the idea that there is a business of the nation to be done, as opposed to the business of the party in power. Instead, the institution that Gingrich inherited -- the one in which Democrats worked with Republicans to pass the most important tax reform in modern history (Reagan's), and in which Republicans led Democrats to break a filibuster in the Senate and pass the most important social legislation in a century (The Civil Rights Act of 1964) -- was gone. What replaced it is the completely dysfunctional institution that practically no American has confidence in today. <br> "Republicans took over ... determined to cut the government down to size. [But] their ambitions were soon compromised. ... Gingrich initially supported ... efforts to impose discipline on spending. ... But in the face of perceived political necessity, the leadership wavered. Cutting spending was good, but Gingrich, (Dick) Armey, (Tom) DeLay, and others quickly realized that 'we have another aspect to our existence here, which is that we must use the Appropriations Committee as a resource to protect our vulnerables, because once we got into power, we wanted to stay in power.'" <br> The job of Congress was no longer the work of the nation. The job of Congress was to help its majority "to stay in power." <br> This is the legacy of Speaker Gingrich. It is a legacy that has done the nation great harm. 
 With increasing awareness in the electorate about the implications of global warming, these shifts may open up political space after the elections in November and pave the way for a new, bipartisan U.S. climate and energy policy framework. <br> Such a framework should provide a predictable, level playing field that factors in the social and environmental costs resulting from carbon emissions. It should put a heavy emphasis on research and development of cutting-edge energy technologies that will enable the full decarbonization of the energy sector. <br> It would propel energy efficiency investments and enhance the competitiveness of carbon capture and storage techniques that could provide a long-term future for gas. A carbon fee would also go a long way toward helping revive the commercial prospects of zero-carbon nuclear power. <br> Finally, but most importantly, carbon revenues could also boost research and development spending on breakthrough energy technologies needed to make full decarbonization by mid-century easier, in line with the goals of the U.S.-led Mission Innovation project announced in Paris. <br> Without bolder public policies in place, the United States risks losing out on the energy revolution -- one of the most consequential transformations of this century. It is time to start constructing a new U.S. energy edifice. 
 In the GOP presidential debate, Marco Rubio responded to a question about work, wages and college tuition by attacking philosophy majors. He said: <br> "Here's the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. For the life of me, I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers." <br> But this isn't just about how awesome a philosophy major is. The data on wages and education reveal two things. First, college degrees are a good investment, though we've got to address the high cost of tuition and the student debt crisis. Second, welders, and all skilled blue-collar workers, need a raise. <br> Philosophy is not unique in propelling its majors to financial success. Like my own degree in history, philosophy gives students a key set of analytical and expressive skills that are mandatory for nearly every high-paying career. College graduates do better in the job market not only because some acquire useful skills, but also because employers want employees with the ability to think critically and to adapt to the jobs of tomorrow. <br> There are, of course, many complexities to these numbers, such as whether low-achieving high school students should invest in college and take on debt, but the overall pattern is clear. These numbers are why we must continue to fight to make college affordable, accessible and high quality for everyone. That means no shortcuts like cheap online programs, over-reliance on temporary adjunct professors, and unethical for-profit colleges. <br> But the crux of these discussions isn't just about the earning potential of liberal arts majors. <br> Welders, and all people who work in blue-collar industries, are too often underpaid. It's easy for white-collar pundits and former political science majors (a heavily philosophical discipline) like Marco Rubio to forget. I'm reminded of Joe the Plumber from the 2008 campaign, a man who was famously neither named Joe nor working as a plumber. He told then-candidate Barack Obama that as a plumber he soon expected to earn over $250,000 a year, therefore Obama's tax plan would hurt him, and by extension good American small business owners everywhere. <br> The best way to help the large swath of American middle class -- both white-collar workers and blue-collar workers -- is to focus on a new labor movement and revitalize unions. <br> I believe in an America where those who want to study philosophy can do it with the knowledge that they will be prepared to compete for good jobs as they move forward. I believe in an America where people interested in trades can, likewise, find good work that pays living wages. <br> It's time for a new labor movement that unites college students with underpaid skilled labor. Blue-collar and white-collar, college-educated and skilled labor, should stand united, shoulder-to-shoulder. We're all in this together. 
 Throughout history, there have been many unlikely pairs in politics. President Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Tip O'Neill had a meeting of the minds on tax reform; Sens. George McGovern and Bob Dole worked together on food stamps; and Sens. Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy drafted the original proposal for a Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. <br> While today's political discourse often seems hopelessly steeped in gridlock, sometimes an idea comes along that's so obvious, so important and so worthwhile that it transcends political divides and brings elected leaders together. <br> As governors -- one Republican, one Democrat -- there are some issues we don't see eye to eye on. But one thing we can wholeheartedly agree on is that when it comes to our students' education, great teachers matter. <br> Research shows that teacher quality is the most important in-school factor affecting a student's academic achievement, and students who are struggling academically or who come from low-income backgrounds benefit the most from excellent teaching. <br> Having access to high-quality teaching has significant economic benefits for students. Just moving from a classroom with a low-performing teacher to one whose performance is average for the academic year can mean an additional $50,000 in lifetime earnings per student, or $1.4 million per classroom. <br> Learning from other nations <br> Clearly, giving more students the opportunity to learn from excellent teachers should be a top priority for policymakers, as it has the potential to spur dramatic improvements in student outcomes. We know that this is true because other nations that perform highly on international assessments -- like Finland, Korea, and Japan -- and those that have seen dramatic improvements -- like Canada and Poland -- have made improving the systems that educate, train and develop teachers a high priority. <br> As governors, we've taken different approaches to improve the teacher pipeline in our states, reflecting our unique state circumstances. <br> Iowa is establishing the most extensive teacher leadership system in the nation, with two main goals: The first is better utilizing the expertise of many of our top teachers to improve instruction and raise student achievement. The second is attracting and retaining more outstanding teachers with new career pathways. That includes rewarding top teachers with higher pay for taking on leadership roles, such as instructional coaches who help analyze data, fine-tune instructional strategies and co-teach. <br> Working in greater collaboration with colleagues, teacher leaders provide embedded professional development in the classroom directly related to what students are learning. When Iowa's new Teacher Leadership and Compensation System is fully phased in next school year, it will cost $150 million annually, with about 25% of Iowa teachers in leadership roles statewide. This investment is important because giving students a globally competitive education today requires making the most of principal and teacher leadership. <br> Raising expectations <br> Meanwhile, Delaware has raised expectations for our college and university teacher preparation programs. That included higher criteria for student admissions, higher-quality student teaching experiences, a requirement that graduates pass a performance assessment, in addition to the traditional written exam, and a process to hold the state and individual programs accountable by tracking graduates. <br> Delaware has also upgraded in-school supports, including with professional learning communities that provide teachers up to 90 minutes a week to spend with a small group of peers dissecting data on which lessons and teaching techniques are having the greatest impact. And the state is working to transform Delaware's educator compensation system to raise starting salaries, as well as to pay teachers more for taking on more responsibilities and working in high-need schools. The traditional system of paying only for years of experience and college degrees does not fully respect our teachers' work. <br> Because we know how important this work is, we were thrilled to speak Tuesday at the launch of the Teach Strong campaign, a diverse group of 40 coalition partners working together to change the national education policy conversation and make modernizing and elevating the teaching profession the most pressing and significant education policy priority for our nation. <br> By putting forth a shared vision for improving our public schools, the campaign is working to depolarize the education policy landscape and lay the groundwork for the fundamental changes that are needed to dramatically improve student achievement. <br> Modernizing and elevating the teaching profession is the right thing to do for students and for teachers. As governors, we are working hard to achieve these goals, but more must be done. Improving the teacher pipeline needs to be a national imperative, starting today. 
 Two things in life are inevitable: death and taxes. But not for big corporations. <br> Although they are "legal persons" and can fund politicians of their choice without limit, they don't have to be limited by time and, thanks to our outdated system of taxing global profits, they can easily shirk paying taxes. <br> While multinational companies can get away with paying little or no taxes, average workers have no choice in the matter because their income taxes are paid even before they receive their paycheck. And while big businesses can exploit tax loopholes and shift profits to offshore subsidiaries by employing sophisticated tax planners, small and medium-size businesses have little choice but to pay the full rate. <br> This week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, unveiled its package of reforms to the global tax system. This joint G20/OECD exercise is known as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, or BEPS. The BEPS Project is commendable: it is important to own up to the mammoth problem of tax avoidance and the outdated tax system its member countries have created. Just five years ago, a reform like BEPS would have been unthinkable. But after the financial shocks and revelations of widespread tax abuse by global companies, the G20 called on the OECD in 2013 to propose reforms to the global tax system. <br> Locating the problem <br> Getting the issue on the table and admitting the problem is a start. And the BEPS Project has made remarkable progress in addressing the problems. However, this is just the beginning, and one should not view it as a successful fix of the broken system of taxing global corporate profits. Although several of the reforms inch toward the project's goal of taxing profits "where economic activities take place and where value is created," there is much more work to be done and many more countries to be included in the conversation. <br> The proposed requirement under BEPS of country-by-country reporting to tax administrations of revenues, profits and taxes paid is an impressive step forward for transparency. However, the home countries of multinational companies will need to require their multinationals to file these reports. Moreover, country-by-country reporting will only be required for entities with revenues above $845 million and even then, these reports will not be made public. <br> Another important set of reforms attempts to prevent avoidance of tax by contracting out important business functions, such as sales and distribution activities, to separate companies. If a company does business in a jurisdiction, it has tax nexus — and thus, its profits are taxable by that jurisdiction. However, as long as corporations are able to create infinite numbers of subsidiary companies, business operations can be artificially segmented to get around nexus rules. <br> Moreover, the strong lobby of the technology firms blocked inclusion of digital activities in the list of business operations that create tax nexus. New York state has a very simple and effective approach: tax related companies within the United States as single firms and companies that generate revenues over $1 million from New York are taxable — regardless of the type of business activity. <br> Overall, the biggest deficit of the BEPS Project is its inability to address the core problem of the global tax framework: the transfer pricing system. This system provides wide latitude for companies to move profits around the world toward low tax jurisdictions, using mythical prices. And the problems have only been amplified with the growth of intellectual and other forms of "soft" capital. Using the transfer pricing system for the allocation of profits originating in the different U.S. states would be absurd. But as globalization proceeds, doing so within the different states of the world is equally absurd. Yet the OECD attempts to reduce tax avoidance and make improvements in a flawed system studiously avoid addressing these fundamental issues. <br> Searching for solutions <br> Tax avoidance, whether by corporations or individuals, reveals the dark underbelly of globalization. While well managed globalization can increase global efficiency, it can also facilitate illicit activities, including tax avoidance, and these can distort efficiency and increase inequities around the world. We have come to realize that we need global solutions to these global problems, which can only be obtained with appropriate global governance. <br> At the United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the developing countries and emerging markets expressed distrust, almost anger, at the United States and other advanced countries. Over the years, they have been told to open up their markets to multinationals with the promise that these firms would contribute to their growth, but the result was that these firms manipulated the books so as to avoid the most important corporate responsibility of all — paying their fair share of taxes. <br> Could the governments representing these multinationals be trusted to devise a fair global tax regime or will they use their power to devise a regime that advantages their own companies and taxpayers? The international community has already created a body — the United Nations — to address global issues of common concern, and certainly tax avoidance falls under this remit. That is why we believe that all countries should have a voice in creating global rules and that this conversation should take place within the United Nations. <br> As the BEPS Project outcomes are presented to the G20 finance ministers this week, reflection on the sufficiency of its outputs as well as global tax reform beyond BEPS is critical. Our world has been changed by globalization. It's time for smarter rules based on global negotiation, made in the interest of all. The BEPS Project should be viewed as a beginning, but just that. We need to go beyond it. 
 Now, we have further proof that Trump is becoming more and more like the professional politicians he so often lambasts. Trump's campaign released a document setting forth "the goals of Donald Trump's tax plan," cheerfully titled, "Tax Reform that Will Make America Great Again." <br> Spoiler alert 1: There are no great surprises here. <br> Spoiler alert 2: Don't worry about that whole "the rich should pay more taxes" thing. <br> Trump's plan centers around "simplifying" the tax law (I am still searching for a candidate running on a "more complexity" platform). He would get many taxpayers off the tax rolls altogether by raising the standard deduction, a play out of Ronald Reagan's playbook. Rates would come down to a top rate of 25% (now 39.6%) on individuals. Trump would repeal the alternative minimum tax (AMT), an annual headache for tens of millions of taxpayers (mainly high wage earners in high tax states like California, Illinois and New York), along with the "death tax," a tax easy enough to oppose. On the business side, Trump would again lower rates (from 39 to 15%), to stir business and create a "huge number" of jobs. <br> How to pay for all this in a time of mounting deficits? No worries: The plan is "fiscally responsible" and "revenue neutral" because it will eliminate "deductions and loopholes available to the very rich," but not, of course, including the mortgage interest or charitable contribution deductions. <br> What's left to eliminate? Trump doesn't say, but it's a good bet that it includes the deduction for state and local taxes, which the AMT is now taxing anyway. Trump also claims he will bring in hordes of revenue by a "one-timed deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas." It is hard to know exactly what that even means -- Trump is still leaving the details to offstage devils whom we may never meet -- but, apparently, this "one time" tax on cash accounts will magically balance the books. <br> All of these ideas have floated around various desktops inside the Beltway for some time now. This is cut-and-paste tax policy. Like his fellow Republicans, Trump is almost certainly playing fast and loose with the math of the matter -- a whiff of voodoo is in the air. We cannot count on lower rates and more revenue as a handy combination of phrases to avoid actual thinking and making hard decisions about tax and spending systems. <br> There is however one thing we can keep counting on -- the rich are not going to see their taxes raised by one Donald Trump. It's still morning in America for the wealthy. 
 People running for president might be expected to focus on issues like the economy, national security and foreign policy. Sure, religion has to come up sometime, and candidates on both the left and right have discussed faith, but in America, well, we try to leave religion out of government. <br> But not Mike Huckabee. He sounds more like he's running for Pope than President of the United States. It seems like faith is all he wants to talk about. <br> He went on: "I'm less concerned about what faith the person has. I'm more concerned about the authenticity of their faith." This is a jaw-dropping -- and disturbing -- statement. The "authenticity" of a person's faith? <br> Juxtapose this against the apparent belief of Huckabee, who would like to be our president. According to him, your faith is no longer between you and God; it is now between you and Mike Huckabee. Huckabee appears to the judger in chief. <br> Huckabee, however, has done more than just call for religious liberty in this campaign, he has actually questioned our entire system of government. <br> Huckabee has even injected religion, instead of sensible policies that could save American lives, into the aftermath of tragedy. <br> I'll reiterate: He wants to be president. <br> If only he were alone among the GOP presidential candidates in putting religion front and center, but he's not. <br> But it will be impossible to judge his competence as a potential commander in chief if he continues to define himself pastor in chief. 
 Donald Trump has managed to open up a serious debate within Republican politics. His call to eliminate a tax break that protects the wealth of hedge fund managers has stimulated a backlash among conservatives. <br> The conservative Club for Growth has predictably blasted the idea. This reform, it says, constitutes the kind of tax increase that should be anathema to the party of President Ronald Reagan. Raising taxes is unjust, club members say, and stifles economic growth. <br> Liberals who are becoming too giddy about this proposal should calm down. Both Bush's and Trump's plan would slash corporate and individual rates, making the tax system more regressive by lowering taxes on the wealthy. This is just one loophole-closing reform within a broader agenda of slashing the progressivity of the income tax system. <br> Bush's proposal, according to Jared Bernstein, a former adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, is a "revenue-eating wolf in sheep's clothing." <br> Still, the debate that is taking place is very real for Republicans. The party has gone to great lengths since the 1970s to take tax increases off the table after many decades when a sizable part of the party understood that fiscal austerity required a combination of revenue hikes and spending cuts. <br> The tenor of Republican politics changed significantly with the rise of the conservative movement. An anti-tax movement in California helped inscribe these principles into property taxes. <br> He and others in his administration promoted a "starve the beast" strategy whereby Republicans would cut off the revenue sources of the federal government so that it would be harder to launch new programs. <br> Reagan's historic across-the-board tax cuts in 1981 were praised as a major victory against liberalism. Grover Norquist, an influential conservative activist who founded Americans for Tax Reform (which promotes the no-tax pledge), pressured Republicans into agreeing they would not support tax increases. <br> The positions of conservatives have moved even further to the right than when Bush was in office. Today, this is evident as the Club for Growth is attacking a proposed cut in loopholes, something that Republicans had accepted. Even this is much too much for them. <br> If Trump and Bush are able to shift the conversation back at least to where it was in the 1980s, it would be important step for the party -- even if it is a baby step. <br> The adherence to no tax increases under any circumstances has damaged the ability of the GOP to legitimately claim the mantle of fiscal conservatism, and this stance has been a huge obstacle in budget negotiations with Democrats. <br> The fact that two mainstream candidates are willing to start taking on this orthodoxy could put the Norquist crew on the defensive and help the GOP strengthen some of its public image. More important, it might start to create conditions that would make it possible to normalize the budget process. <br> While there are some issues where conservatives are willing to give and take, taxation has not been one of them. Without any kind of change within the GOP, the prospects of a sounder budget process and path toward fiscal balance will remain elusive. 
 Thursday's announcement by the Federal Reserve Board that it would maintain short-term interest rates came after many weeks of intense anticipation and hyperbolic prognostication by financial pundits across the globe. One pundit went as far as to declare that the Fed's decision would determine next year's presidential election. <br> No doubt, decisions by the Federal Reserve have significant implications for our economy. But the reality is that the power of monetary policy to grow our economy is vastly overestimated. Instead, history tells us that public policy choices have a far greater impact on growing the American economy. And right now, sound public policy decisions are something that are desperately needed -- for America's workers and job creators alike. <br> This is especially true in light of Thursday's tacit acknowledgment by the Fed of the long season of tepid economic growth we have unfortunately grown accustomed to. <br> Because of these disturbing trends among workers and job creators, Congress should enact sound public policy to jump-start our economy. <br> First, Congress must end deficit spending. Reckless spending in the past has resulted in perpetual deficit spending in the present. Excessive borrowing and spending threatens economic stability, jeopardizes American power abroad and passes along a mountain of debt to our children and grandchildren. Returning our country to sound fiscal footing will take more than governing via crisis. No more fiscal cliffs, no more deficit spending. <br> Second, Congress should pass comprehensive tax reform and new trade agreements. Against the headwinds of the slowest recovery since 1960, small business owners are dealing with a tax system that is hopelessly complex, full of provisions that expire every one or two years, riddled with special exemptions, deductions and preferences and filled with new penalties. It is long past time to simplify this byzantine code. <br> Equally as important to economic growth is trade, which has a clear impact on jobs. Earlier this year, Congress acted to give the President Trade Promotion Authority to negotiate trade agreements with other nations under strict parameters. Congress must now call on the administration to finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership, submit the agreement for approval in the Senate and engage with other trading partners on additional trade agreements that will create new markets for American businesses. <br> Government bureaucrats have implemented barriers to entry on professions from florists to interior designers, personal trainers to retailers of frozen desserts. Obamacare's myriad of taxes and mandates continue to represent a significant threat to employers and employees alike. For our economy to thrive once again, we must remove these barriers to job creation. <br> Collectively, these actions can help unlock our economy's potential and create opportunity for all Americans. Imagine what could be accomplished if the same amount of attention and energy given to announcements by the Fed was directed toward putting this pro-growth economic agenda into action. 
 In the topsy-turvy world of tax politics, here's the latest twist: Donald Trump is making some good points about taxes. <br> Now the devil is as always in the details. Trump has a long ways to go in providing that -- and what details do seem lurking beneath the surface hardly seem promising. But let's not nitpick just yet. Trump ought to be applauded for throwing out some ideas -- any ideas -- about fundamentally fixing America's flawed tax system. None of the many other Republican candidates seeking the presidency has done anything truly resembling that. <br> And that is surely the first and most important point to make here. The mainstream political system -- Congress, the president, committees, lobbyists and all that jazz -- have become a large part of the problem of tax. Looking to these usual suspects to be part of the solution seems hopelessly naive. Traditional politicians offer tepid manipulations of the status quo in tax. It takes someone coming from and thinking "outside the box" to light the kindle of rage against tax as is. <br> We have seen this script before. Remember Ronald Reagan? When Reagan took office in 1981, the top marginal tax rate on income was 70%, as it had been since JFK cut it to that level in 1963. Five years later, in 1986, Reagan had the rate down to 28%. It hasn't exactly stayed there, but the point is that Reagan -- an unconventional politician -- was able to go over the heads of traditional decision makers and make his case directly to the people. That's being a Great Communicator. The income tax hasn't really changed since. <br> Maybe, just maybe, Trump, some 30 years later, can give us more of the same -- significant tax reform by taking his case to the people and forcing traditional law and policymakers to get on board. <br> Let's get to those ideas. Each, individually, makes some sense and, collectively, could form a powerful vision of a 21st century tax plan for America. <br> One, lowering America's corporate tax rate makes a good deal of sense and would be supported by most mainstream economists. The trouble today is that the U.S. corporate rate is now among the highest in the world, so companies explore various gaps in the tax base to avoid taxes. <br> One of these avenues is to move overseas, for there are plenty of jurisdictions with far lower rates, even ones at zero. No reform is going to bring trillions of dollars home, just like that -- those devilish details, again -- but sensible corporate tax reform entailing a lower nominal rate structure is clearly sensible. <br> So too, with idea two, eliminating "death" taxes. <br> These taxes raise little revenue, apply to far less than 1% of the population and can be avoided by byzantine tax planning that benefits no one except the financiers who manage the resulting trusts and foundations. Getting rid of these relics altogether makes good sense. <br> Which brings us to idea three: making the wealthy pay more. <br> Here, Trump's one detail is silly and grandstanding: He is picking on hedge fund managers, who have found a trick, in "carried interest," to defer taxes and pay capital gains rates. These are two benefits not available to working folks, who must pay their taxes now and at ordinary rates. <br> It is fair enough to think that this is a problem. There have been proposals to shut down this "loophole" in Congress for over a decade now. But the problem of under-taxing the rich hardly maps onto the problems of taxing hedge fund managers, who are but a small drop in the rich person bucket. Trump, for example, has ample billions without ever having to have become a hedge fund manager. <br> The good news is that there are very serious ways to tax the rich -- like a progressive spending tax, as I and others have been advocating for many years. Such a tax would not burden work or savings (or dying, giving, or getting married, for those matters), but instead would fall on the private act of spending, at higher rates the more luxurious the spending level. <br> It would work like an income tax, but with an unlimited deduction for savings -- any income that is not saved is, by definition, spent. Progressive rates would apply to the spending level. So, any one wealthy enough to spend more than a million dollars a year, say, would see his tax rate go to 50% or higher. <br> A progressive spending tax, by the way, would be consistent with each of Trump's three primary ideas -- lowering (or repealing) corporate tax rates, repealing death taxes (because dead men don't spend -- the heirs can be taxed when they do), and, of course, getting the wealthy to pay more. <br> Trump has a long way to go from his tax-policy-by-sentence fragments to anything like a real, practicable plan. But he has set forth some rather plausible ideas, and certainly some principles worth attending to. If this is all we get, and some more conventional politicians are stirred into some serious thought about tax reform, so be it. <br> When conventional thinking is part of the problem, we should be thankful for the unconventional voices still talking. So keep going at it, Mr. Trump. 
 It looks like the Republicans in Congress have failed again. House Republicans defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration. <br> McConnell proposed that there would be a separate vote on the immigration issue. When Speaker John Boehner proposed an even narrower compromise, funding the Department for only three more weeks, his caucus said no. The final bill provides funding for one more week, at which point Congress needs to take up the issue again. <br> Yet from a different perspective, congressional Republicans are achieving their goal. Once again they are using up a valuable chunk of President Obama's political time. Congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions, such as economic inequality or climate change, which the White House hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the Republicans refused to do anything about these problems. <br> While the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim, President Obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues, like tax reform, where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough. <br> Using up the legislative clock has been central to the Republican strategy since the 2010 midterm elections, a tactic that the Democrats have found difficult to fight back against. <br> The strategy has been pretty straightforward. Each time that President Obama tried to introduce a new issue to the nation, whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality, Republicans have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy. <br> This is what Republicans did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if Democrats did not accede to their budget demands. Congress spent many months wrangling over the budget as they faced the real possibility of the federal government going into default. This was all that anyone in Washington was talking about. The GOP did the same with the threat of a government shutdown. <br> Even though the possibility of repealing the Affordable Care Act is remote, Republicans keep bringing it up for a debate, forcing Democrats to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing. <br> The "tea party" faction of the House Republicans has been pivotal to this strategy as was clear this week. Since they have shown repeatedly that they are willing to employ the most extreme measures to defend their principles, and that they won't allow Boehner to rein them in for "practical" political considerations, Democrats can't afford to take the threats lightly. <br> Republican leaders can and have said to the White House they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems, but with a nod to the Republican caucus, remind Obama that they don't have full control. <br> While it is true that these tactics have hurt the name brand of the GOP and place Republican presidential candidates at greater risk in 2016, many congressional Republicans have been willing to suffer hits in the polls because the tactic has allowed them to continue using up time on the legislative calendar. Aside from vetoing bills, President Obama doesn't have many options other than to watch the clock tick away. <br> Now the GOP has done it again. Even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security, months have been consumed on Capitol Hill. When the year began President Obama wanted to make economic inequality a defining theme for the year. He wanted to use the limited power he had to bring more attention to the growing divide between the rich and the poor, as well as the struggles facing middle class Americans. But he has only had limited success. Instead, he and his party have been consumed with this struggle over the budget bill. <br> When House Republicans pushed their "stop-gap" measure to fund Homeland Security for just another week, they were following the standard game plan. By avoiding permanent solutions to budgeting problems, and keeping the debate over these issues in play for even more time, the GOP continues to eat away at the president's political clock. <br> Usually political extremism does not have the virtues that Sen. Barry Goldwater claimed in his famous 1964 speech to the Republican Convention, but it sure can have short-term political benefits in Congress. Just ask Mitch McConnell, who can barely contain his grin. 
 Given the partisan stalemate in Washington, many pundits therefore view the White House budget as a purely political statement intended to frame the 2016 presidential debate. Next, the GOP Congress will produce a conservative alternative, and each side will spend the next two years accusing the other of waging class warfare. <br> Except that the federal government actually does need a budget, especially one that reinforces the economy's gathering momentum. The one thing both parties seem to agree on is that reversing middle class stagnation is the nation's top priority. What America needs more than anything else is a long stretch of robust economic growth, something we have not seen since the 1990s, when both the growth and unemployment rates averaged about 4 percent a year. <br> It's true that stronger growth alone ultimately may not suffice to restore mass upward mobility. In the absence of real wealth creation, however, a politics of redistribution can only sustain a fleeting illusion of shared prosperity. <br> The Obama budget also calls for a 6% increase in federal RD funding, especially for biomedical research. Public investment that replenishes America's depleted stock of physical and knowledge capital is crucial to putting the U.S. economy back on a high-growth path. <br> In addition, the president wants funding for seven more manufacturing institutes that enlist companies, governments and universities to put America in the vanguard of advanced manufacturing, including 3-D printing. There's also more money for career training and on-the-job apprenticeships, as well as an intriguing Upward Mobility Project aimed at spurring enterprise in impoverished communities. <br> The controversial centerpiece of the president's budget is a grab bag of big tax changes that take from the rich to give to, well, everyone else. These include a minimum tax on millionaires; a higher capital gains tax (including on inherited wealth); and limits on the value of itemized deductions claimed by the wealthy. There's also a new tax on the nation's 100 largest banks. <br> Surging revenues would pay for an array of costly tax breaks for families with modest incomes, including a tax credit for second earners, an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without children and a tripling of the child tax credit. But while there's no doubt the overall effect would be to make federal taxes more progressive, it would also make the code even more insanely complicated. <br> Unfortunately, Obama's budget stops short of a comprehensive tax reform that would close loopholes for both individuals and corporations and use the added revenues to reduce rates for all taxpayers. Most economists believe that junking, or at least limiting, a host of special preferences and tax breaks would reduce economic distortions, promote more efficient use of capital, and generally make federal taxes fairer and simpler. <br> Congress, in short, is wearing fiscal handcuffs. Lawmakers can't launch fresh initiatives to tackle contemporary problems without either piling on new debt or reneging on old commitments (to spend more, or tax less). What's more, as the nation ages, more of our resources are channeled into automatic, formula-driven spending on current consumption -- mainly through Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- leaving fewer dollars to invest in children and families or future economic growth. <br> No one expects President Obama to solve this problem unilaterally, especially with a Republican Party so addled by anti-government populism that it can't distinguish between consumption spending and genuine economic and social investment. But neither can America afford a federal budget so paralyzed by old promises and interest group gridlock that it is essentially a blueprint for national decline. <br> That's why progressives need a strategy for reclaiming their fiscal freedom -- and the ability to invest in America's future. 
 On the individual side, he would increase taxes on the very wealthiest Americans to pay for tax cuts for lower- and middle-income Americans, including limiting tax benefits of itemized deductions for the best-off Americans, scaling back gigantic tax breaks for capital gains and large estates, and ensuring that hedge-fund managers pay their fair share. Each of these steps would reduce glaring inequities in our tax laws that allow the Warren Buffets of the world to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. <br> On the tax-cutting side, Obama would expand tax credits for child-care and education expenses, boost the earned-income tax credit for childless workers, and give a new tax break to two-earner couples. Critically, these tax cuts would be paid for by the loophole-closers already mentioned. <br> Unfortunately, these sensible proposals are almost certainly dead on arrival in the GOP-led Congress. <br> But on the corporate side, the president's plans actually have a chance of being taken seriously by congressional Republicans — possibly because his ideas are more in line with the ideological push for lower corporate tax rates. <br> The president's plan would impose a one-time 14% tax on the $2 trillion in untaxed income that multinational companies collectively have stashed in tax havens. While 14% is certainly higher than the single-digit rate companies such as Apple and Microsoft have paid to date on their offshore cash, it's still a lot less than the 35% these companies should be paying on their profits, and it's less than what many other businesses are already dutifully paying. Members of Congress have made similar proposals, including Sens. Barbara Boxer and Rand Paul, who recently proposed taxing foreign profits at 6.5%. Put another way, the president and lawmakers' theory on taxing offshore profits appears to be "getting something is better than nothing." <br> But we can do better. <br> In the wake of a titanic debate last year over what should happen to the corporate tax rate, Obama's budget is equally notable for failing to include a comprehensive proposal to eliminate tax giveaways. <br> The President has said that he wants a revenue-neutral corporate tax change that collects the same amount of revenue by lowering the corporate tax rate while eliminating loopholes. But his budget proposal is silent on how to accomplish this goal. The goal of corporate tax reform should be raising more revenue, not the same amount. <br> Measured as a share of the economy, the U.S. corporate tax is lower than almost every other developed nation -- and our corporate tax collections are at nearly their lowest point since World War II. This decline has been driven by rampant tax avoidance by big multinational corporations. <br> There is some good in the president's tax reform proposal. In particular, the low-income tax credits will encourage work and pull millions of workers out of poverty. Unfortunately, it is hard to imagine these ideas receiving a real hearing this year. <br> But the President's plan to lower the corporate tax rate and reward companies that stash their profits offshore with a lower tax rate -- coupled with his budget's lack of detail on a road map to eliminating corporate loopholes -- signals there is fertile ground for compromise that would fail to achieve a fair and sustainable corporate tax. 
 In the United States, the top 1% control more than one third of the nation's resources. Two out of three Americans disapprove of the current distribution of income and wealth. They believe that our economy and government unfairly favor the rich. <br> One of the major contributors to rising inequality is our tax system. Raising taxes on the very wealthy is an idea that appeals to many Americans, including the middle class and poor. <br> Republicans, meanwhile, are already apoplectic about President Obama's plan. One of the more curious phenomena about Republicans is that their economic agenda is entirely independent of the facts of the moment. So when the economy is strong, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich. When the economy is weak, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich. When the economy is recovering, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich. <br> President Obama is also proposing fees to make it more costly for the biggest financial companies to excessively borrow money. Post-recession, corporate profits have soared, but wages for Americans workers have not. Once upon a time, corporate profits used to correlate more closely with economic growth and wage prosperity for average Americans. In other words, we used to do well all together. <br> But increasingly, especially in the past decade thanks to Republican tax cuts and deregulations, corporations have succeeded while ordinary Americans have fallen behind. How else do we explain the stock market hitting record highs while many Americans are still out of work? This runaway train of inequality won't solve itself. We need government action -- action the majority of Americans strongly support. <br> In his State of the Union address, President Obama will argue for closing the "trust fund loophole," which, according to the White House, is one of the biggest tax loopholes plaguing our economy and lets the wealthiest Americans avoid hundreds of billions in taxes every year, money that should be helping build roads and schools that help us all. <br> President Obama will also propose raising the top capital gains and dividend rates back to what they were under President Ronald Reagan, which clearly Republicans once agreed was a sufficient level. And to hedge the sort of gambling that puts our entire economy at risk, President Obama will propose a fee on the nation's largest financial firms in proportion to how heavily they borrow and leverage. <br> These modest measures will help us reinvest in America's middle class and strengthen our economy for everyone's benefit. Among the President's proposals is a $500 tax credit for second earners in families where both spouses work, a proposal that will benefit 24 million American families. The President will endorse tripling the child care tax benefit, to help 5.1 million American families cover the cost of child care. President Obama will provide students with up to $2,500 a year toward the cost of college and make the first two years of community college free. And President Obama's plan includes giving 30 million more workers the opportunity to easily and automatically save for retirement through their employers. <br> While American voters across the board think that Democrats help the poor, middle class and rich fairly equally, 69% think Republican Party policies favor the rich. Even conservative voters are concerned about rising inequality. <br> The political pressure is on the GOP to prove they're not just the party of the 1%. There are some encouraging signs that Republicans believe tax reform should include increasing the share paid by the wealthiest Americans. President Obama's plan is a modest and effective set of policies that sensible Republicans can support. <br> The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. We've cut taxes on big businesses and the rich to near historic lows. Those tax cuts have only helped corporate profits and yacht sales. It's time that our economic policy helps all Americans. In this economic and political climate, not supporting basic tax fairness is insane. 
 Income inequality is like the weather: Everyone talks about it, but no one does much about it. Now comes President Obama in his State of the Union Address, hoping to do more than just talk about it. <br> The President tackles this perennial conundrum by proposing that the tax code be changed in two very distinct directions: 1) Provide extra money to low- and middle-income families in the form of tax credits for children and working couples. 2) raise taxes on upper-income taxpayers, especially the fabled "one percent" through various cutbacks and increased restrictions on savings. <br> It is certainly easy to dismiss his suggestions given the makeup of the new Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, but stranger concoctions have been enacted when major tax overhauls are undertaken. So what does the President suggest? <br> The majority party in Congress may not be particularly enthralled with President Obama's caveat that this credit phase out when a family's annual income reaches $120,000, but such parameters can be negotiated as legislation gets developed. <br> The tax changes on upper-income taxpayers are more likely to generate partisan resistance. As a general matter, Republicans want to lower or even eliminate taxes on capital gains, and this position has been party dogma since the first Bush administration. <br> In contrast, President Obama proposes to raise taxes on capital gains received by married couples with incomes exceeding $500,000 per year. That income level may be above most people's conception of "middle class," but it is far below what it takes to be a "one-percenter." Nevertheless, if one wants to address anomalies like Warren Buffett and Mitt Romney paying lower effective tax rates than their employees, then raising tax rates on capital gains is a necessity. <br> But President Obama goes much further and attacks the so-called "step-up in basis" rule -- which the White House calls the "trust fund loophole" -- that allows gains on inherited property to go untaxed, regardless of amount. Targeting this longstanding tax rule takes aim not at those who have worked hard to create businesses and build wealth, but at those whose pathway to riches was having the right relatives. <br> Obama's proposal, in other words, seeks to reduce wealth disparities without disincentivizing the job creators among us. Along these lines, he also proposes that no tax be due on inherited family-operated businesses until they are sold. <br> Will this time be different? Perhaps the sense among some citizens that the system is "rigged" will produce a different result this year, but income inequality is fundamentally not a problem that is exclusively or even primarily about taxation. Causes range from globalization and unfair trade agreements to falling educational achievement and the decline of private sector labor unions, among others. <br> Tweaking the tax code, even in the substantial and perhaps radical ways that President Obama is due to propose on Tuesday, can go only so far in addressing this issue. On the other hand, the U.S. tax code is one part of the puzzle that the federal government can control and do something about in fairly short order. <br> Tackling tax reform more broadly could be a pathway to bipartisan cooperation that creates a genuine achievement for both President Obama and the new Congress. In that context, repealing the "step-up in basis" rule and perhaps equalizing tax rates on capital gains and regular income would go a long way to simplifying tax planning and return preparation while allowing the market to allocate capital without the often nonsensical preferences embedded in the current tax code. That is certainly a worthy project. But it is a very different focus than trying to ameliorate income inequality. <br> Regarding the latter, even if President Obama's tax proposals are enacted exactly as he set out, they may not do much about income inequality in the United States, but they at least do more than just talk about it. 
 As a long-time advocate for reducing inequality -- or to put it another way, upping the fairness factor in local and global economies alike -- I am heartened to hear world leaders and policy-makers increasingly agree that growing inequality is undesirable. <br> But while we all agree that the world is facing an unprecedented number of large-scale, complex economic challenges, there remains heated discussion about the policy fixes needed. <br> Wealth gap increasingly 'obscene' <br> As economist Thomas Piketty so eloquently argued this year, wealth and the return on capital are growing faster than the overall economy and income from labor. Making matters worse, labor income is becoming increasingly skewed, with an ever increasing share going to a small band of top earners. <br> This means we are approaching levels of inequality in wealth and income that are increasingly difficult to justify, increasingly obscene, and are an increasing drag on productivity and growth. <br> Inequality of this magnitude undermines the basic notions of trust, fairness, and social cohesion that underpin our economies and societies. <br> That's why civil society wants G20 nations to embed equity in their country growth plans by measuring improvements in the incomes of the bottom 20% of households. <br> The G20's commitment to pursuing economic growth of two percentage points above current targets over the next five years is welcome. But the success of the Brisbane talks must also be viewed through the lens of fairness. Leaders must be held to account for ensuring the benefits of growth are spread more widely. <br> G20 needs to change <br> Just as the G20 has evolved in recent years from a gathering of finance ministers to include national leaders, the involvement of non-government organizations in G20 meetings and decision-making is a reflection of the realities of contemporary governing and policy making. <br> Put simply: the continuing relevance and legitimacy of the G20 as an effective global economic policy-making body is reliant on it being more people-focused. <br> That means the realization among global policy agenda-setters that inequality and exclusion stifles economic growth must drive better responses to addressing the economic impact of climate change, for example, and the establishment of robust post-2015 sustainable development goals. <br> The way forward <br> The Australian presidency has no less a task than securing the G20's future. The jury is still out on whether its outreach to non-government actors and, importantly, to developing nations is enough to deliver this. <br> Consider the key agenda item of driving jobs growth. Governments must work with the corporate sector and the community as equal partners to provide real and quality jobs in the formal sector of the economy, with social and legal protections so that all workers, especially those from vulnerable groups, have the opportunity for improved participation. <br> The G20 is also poised to make genuine progress on glaring faults in global governance, via its tax reform and transparency agenda. The potential benefits of coordinated action to increase transparency range from strengthening efforts to combat corruption and money laundering, to finally countering tax evasion and avoidance. <br> It's time to end tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions, and the practices that allow earnings to be "washed" or hidden, as well as the lax residency standards and treaty shopping that allow profit shifting. <br> Aggressive tax planning alone is estimated to cost developing nations billions of dollars a year. These are the same countries which rely heavily on foreign aid and lack the resources to deal with poverty or fund essential health care and education services. <br> As governments of wealthy and developing nations alike decry their ability to "afford" to meet the growing demands placed on them by their citizens, they surely have no excuse to ignore the policy levers they have at their disposal to plug leaky and opaque tax systems. <br> Is it too much to ask that adequate health services, better education opportunities and even clean water no longer remain hostage to capricious and shady global tax arrangements? <br> I'd say it's only fair for the G20 to act. 
 Each time, we've put forward a plan that stops spending money we don't have, creates jobs with pro-growth reforms, strengthens the safety net, and expands opportunity for all. And each time we've learned a little bit more about where the two parties stand. <br> He wants to raise taxes by $1.8 trillion -- on top of the $1.7 trillion he's already raised. He wants to increase spending by $791 billion. And he never balances the budget -- ever. <br> Time and again, the President and his party put government in the driver's seat. They want to take more from families to spend more in Washington. Whether it's health care, energy, or taxes, Democrats want the federal government to play a bigger role in the lives of Americans and our economy. <br> And that's great for Washington; it thrives on more power. But the American people will lose out. They'll face less opportunity, more debt, and fewer jobs. <br> A quick reality check for the critics and big spenders in Washington: On the current path, the federal government will spend roughly $48 trillion over the next 10 years. By contrast, this budget will spend nearly $43 trillion. On the current path, spending will grow, on average, by 5.2% a year. Under our budget, spending will grow, on average, by 3.5% a year. Nearly $43 trillion is enough. Increasing spending by 3.5% instead of 5.2% is hardly draconian. <br> Responsible spending restraint is just one part of our plan. We also call for pro-growth tax reform and greater energy production. We repeal Obamacare and clear the way for patient-centered reforms. We protect and strengthen Medicare. We repair the safety net so it's there for those who need it, and we give states the flexibility they need to help people move up the ladder of life. <br> All of these solutions would help create jobs. Instead of sending more money to Washington -- instead of funding more Solyndras and racking up more debt -- we return power to the people by cutting tax rates and wasteful spending. Under our plan, people will spend less time navigating the maze that is Washington and more time developing the new ideas that will power our economy. <br> So this debate boils down to a question of trust. Do we trust Washington to know what's best for our health care, our economy, or our families? Or do we trust the people of this country to make an honest assessment about what's best for their lives? <br> Republicans have made our choice. We've put forward a budget that harnesses the power of economic freedom and respects the dignity of every person. We trust the American people to lead our country forward. 
 You may not have noticed it, but in the midst of all the usual finger-pointing and polarization, a bit of actual problem-solving is underway in American politics. <br> A coalition of unlikely allies has coalesced in recent months to advance criminal justice reform. These strange bedfellows -- from liberal Democrats such as Sen. Dick Durbin to tea party darlings such as Sen. Mike Lee, from the NAACP to Americans for Tax Reform -- are all proposing reductions in mandatory minimum sentences. <br> U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's calls for such reductions have been cheered by some of the same Republicans who otherwise want to impeach him. In Texas, a conservative group called Right on Crime has led the way on prison and sentencing reform -- earning plaudits from, among others, California progressives. <br> Why this rash of consensus? <br> Well, for the right, it's mainly about getting control of big government -- prisons now consume a quarter of the Justice Department's budget, and state prison spending has been on a multidecade boom with little corresponding "return on investment." <br> For the left, it's mainly about social justice -- the disparity in criminal sentencing for crack versus powder cocaine has a long-documented racial dimension, and blindly filling the "school-to-prison pipeline" has seemed misguided and cruel. <br> Democrats and Republicans agree the metastasis of the prison-industrial complex is unhealthy. But for each side there are also benefits to acknowledging the other side's rationale. In a GOP sometimes perceived as intolerant, Rand Paul's embrace of sentencing reform lets him to show his concern for minorities. Civil rights Democrats, meanwhile, get to embrace fiscal responsibility. <br> The criminal justice deal-making suggests a possible way forward for our politics: crosspartisanship. Crosspartisanship may look like bipartisanship, but it's different. <br> Bipartisan compromise typically splits the difference between the views of two parties, giving each side less than its ideal outcome. A crosspartisan approach, by contrast, finds issues where people from both parties converge on a common principle, even if for different reasons, and achieve an outcome that's ideal to both. <br> Where else might such crosspartisanship take hold? Curbing government surveillance is a possibility. Reducing crony capitalism is another. Even reform of the federal tax code, an arena as full of political landmines as crime and punishment used to be, might be feasible. <br> On surveillance, Edward Snowden's revelations have scrambled party affiliations, bringing civil libertarians from left and right together to push back against the National Security Agency. Liberals hate the size of the national security state because they are wary of war; conservatives hate it because they are wary of government. <br> On crony capitalism, Republicans since 2008 have blamed the housing and financial collapse on the profligate policies of quasigovernmental agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while Democrats have blamed unregulated and predatory Wall Street firms. It's possible, of course, that they're both substantially right. <br> The moment is ripe for a liberal to say that government created the conditions for corruption in housing finance, and for a conservative to say that the absence of government accelerated such corruption. Perhaps both sides can agree that when public policy allows businesses to privatize gain while socializing loss, that's neither true capitalism nor good government. <br> On taxes, GOP House member Dave Camp of Michigan recently put forward a framework for tax reform that, while admittedly going nowhere legislatively, did take aim at tax expenditures -- loopholes -- that disproportionately benefit the privileged. He's not alone among conservatives, and they may be able to join with liberals who see such tax expenditures as welfare for the rich. <br> I'm not suggesting by any means that we're about to enter some golden age of collaboration in our politics. On plenty of issues -- making it easier for unions to organize workers or cutting taxes on the rich -- there are still irreconcilable policy differences that reflect deeper differences in worldview. <br> Some people, like me, think unions are generally a force for good; others see them as inherently inefficient, even evil. Some people divide the country into "makers" and "takers"; others find that division and its implications repugnant. <br> So the fighting will in most cases continue. But in the same way that the United States in foreign policy can sometimes partner with adversaries or rivals -- simply because it is in our interest in that moment to do so -- perhaps in domestic politics we can foster more such pragmatism. And make it contagious. <br> If that's going to happen, though, it'll be up to us as citizens to say that we want it. We'll have to reward elected leaders for this style of crosspartisan problem-solving. We'll have to resist punishing them for even talking to "the enemy." And then more leaders will have to learn to think -- and lead -- outside the lines of party. 
 CNN asked for views on President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night, in which he called for "a year of action"-- with or without Congress's agreement -- on combating inequality, creating pathways into employment, immigration reform and more. <br> Julian Zelizer: Obama's message to the middle clas</strong>s <br> President Barack Obama's State of the Union Address offered both a threat and a promise: To use the federal government's power to tackle the economic challenges the middle class has faced in recent decades. His theme was opportunity, namely, using government to ensure that all Americans have a genuine chance to climb the ladder "of opportunity" to make it into the middle class and become self-sufficient. <br> Relying on the government to ensure that those doors stay open is a traditional theme for Democrats, one they've employed effectively since President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s. <br> While the speech did have more proposals than some expected (tax reform, investing in infrastructure and research, job training, education, equal pay, minimum wage and more), the address was generally vague. But offering a laundry list was not the President's main intention. Nor was his primary goal to boost his approval ratings. <br> What the President really hoped to do with this speech was to direct the national conversation for the coming year. He wants to move Washington further away from its political obsession with austerity -- cutting spending and cutting deficits -- and toward a debate about how the federal government, through the President if necessary, can take concrete steps to alleviate the problems of inequality and provide renewed security to the middle class. <br> President Obama asked Republicans in Congress to join him in entering this discussion and dealing with this problem through concrete policy, while he also sent a clear warning that he will move ahead without them if they resist. "But America does not stand still," the President said, "and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do." <br> LZ</strong> </strong>Granderson: A missed opportunity on inequality <br> Considering how much stock Democrats have put into the debate over income inequality recently, President Obama's State of the Union speech didn't spend much time driving the party's point home with specifics or facts. <br> Instead he over-relied on anecdotes. Yes, he correctly pointed out the three decades of technological growth had slowly eaten away at middle-class jobs. But by focusing the nation's attention more on the band-aid minimum wage increase -- and making only cursory mention of more permanent solutions, such as the specific loopholes he would close and tax code revisions he would make -- Obama missed an opportunity. And that was to convince Americans that his economic policies are not the reason median income has dropped since he took office and that he's still capable of big policy initiatives, the kind that could find a little bipartisan support from tax hawks on the moderate right who also want to re-write the tax code. <br> That's not to suggest an executive order to raise the minimum wage won't help people; it will. But to change the dynamic that has kept wages stagnant since President Reagan, it's going to take something big. And for all of the big talk about income inequality from Democrats, President Obama's address presented very little in terms of specific ideas, backed by facts, that would change the trajectory. <br> Instead, by glossing over the country's economic arc -- and not educating people on the decades-long regression of the middle class because of the tax code -- he made it easier for his critics to simply point a finger and say "it's his fault." <br> Anne-Marie Slaughter: Where was foreign policy? <br> The biggest surprise of Obama's speech last night was his return to a campaign pledge from his first Presidential run: To close the Guantánamo Bay prison where the U.S. government is holding detainees accused of terrorism without formal charge or trial date, violating one of the most fundamental safeguards of our Constitution. <br> That is the only comfort that human rights supporters and humanitarians got from tonight's State of the Union address. On Syria, the greatest moral challenge of our time and a pressing strategic issue, the President said nothing except to make a quick reference to the removal of Syrian chemical weapons due to U.S. "diplomacy backed by force." <br> That kind of diplomacy is exactly what is lacking in Syria; the participants in the ongoing conference in Switzerland have no reason to think that if they cannot agree to a peace agreement the United States will respond with anything more than exhortations. Indeed, elsewhere in the speech the President echoed his remarks last May when he insisted that "America must move off a permanent war footing," adopting restrictions on the use if drones. He also anticipated the day when the Afghan war, the longest war in American history, would be over. <br> Looking at the speech as a whole, the real core of the President's foreign-policy is not political but economic: His point early on that America is now the No. 1 place to invest in the world, beating out China. Notwithstanding Secretary of State John Kerry's strenuous efforts on three different fronts -- Iran, Syria, and Israel/Palestine -- his boss used this speech to toss breadcrumbs to various foreign-policy constituencies. It's the economy stupid, never more than now. <br> Kevin Appleby: An immigration reform goal he may be able to reac</strong>h <br> A highlight of President Obama's State of the Union address was his call for bipartisan cooperation in passing immigration reform this year: "Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted. I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same. So let's get immigration reform done this year." <br> Unlike other years, this year's call to action actually has a ring of political reality, as the House Republicans are preparing to release their own principles for reform. <br> But getting a fair immigration bill through the House of Representatives in an election year will be tough, requiring more political leadership and less political gamesmanship. It is achievable, provided all sides enter the fray in good faith and with a sincere desire to tackle the problem. As the President said in his speech, "...it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders and law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system." <br> Both sides will have to compromise and, believe it or not, work together to pass positive and humane legislation. There will be real differences on the substantive issues, particularly in how the undocumented population will be allowed to apply for citizenship and what future enforcement policies may be adopted. But they are not irreconcilable. <br> The human stakes are high. If the President and Congress fail to repair our immigration system, immigrant families and communities -- and the social fabric of the nation -- will continue to break apart. <br> As Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles has aptly stated, our current immigration system is a "stain on the soul of the nation. " As a moral matter, we can no longer wait to fix it. <br> Kevin Appleby is director of Migration Policy and Public Affairs at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. <br> Timothy Stanley: Obama plans to ignore Congress</strong> </strong>-- and they'll ignore him back <br> The latest State of the Union address reflected the Washington partisanship we've all come to know and hate. Obama began the speech by asking for unity, but quickly made it clear that he a) didn't expect to get it and b) is prepared to break the deadlock with executive action. Take the minimum wage. Obama made a moral case for it being raised, implied that he expects the Republicans to refuse support, and then indicated that he'd find ways of doing it anyway. <br> Last year he was prepared to fight the Republicans in Congress. This year he'll ignore them and, presumably, travel the country calling them heartless instead. So the battle will take on a new, slightly less Constitutionally-sound dimension. No less bitter, of course. <br> Where he has asked for cooperation, it's doubtful he'll get it. Solar panels and amnesty for illegal immigrants are not things that John Boehner can easily deliver votes on. Meanwhile, Republicans will probably avoid engaging rhetorically with Obama's economic populism and continue to talk about Obamacare and the deficit instead, setting themselves up to reap a protest vote in the November midterms. <br> So what we heard last night was an admirably feisty attempt to regain the political initiative by establishing the Republicans as the party of stasis and the President as a man who just wants to get things done. The problem, though, is that the political realities continue to block movement. <br> Last year we saw a shutdown, light gun control initiatives defeated and even a war averted by just the terror of taking it to Congress. Why should this change? The Republicans won't gain anything from being nicer to the President and the President is staking everything on the country turning against the Republicans. Sorry, but 2014 looks like it'll be a repeat of 2013. <br> Nick Ehrmann: Early education important, but don't forget high school <br> Last night, President Obama made an impassioned and necessary case to lower the barriers for low-income students to succeed in higher education. He said: "The problem is we're still not reaching enough kids, and we're not reaching them in time." He's right. That has to change. <br> The President points out that "one of the best investments we can make in a child's life is high-quality early education." His focus on mustering resources from both the public and private sectors, of creating "a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists" to increase access to quality early education is smart. <br> Let's not forget that the same is true of students further along in their education. Research has shown that academic preparation in high school is the single strongest predictor of college completion. <br> Take 18-year-old Estiven Rodriguez, the Dominican-born student whom the President hailed in his speech for extraordinary academic achievements, including a scholarship to Dickinson College for the fall. After arriving to the U.S. speaking limited English, Estiven's path to opportunity accelerated with exposure to rigorous academic preparation later on in his journey through the New York City public schools. <br> Making the President's vision a reality requires collaboration from both the public and private sectors, from the best minds in education, from parents, teachers, policymakers, and nonprofits alike. This is about Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School -- or WHEELS, an urban public high school -- partnering with nonprofits to create a learning environment that helps students like Estiven thrive. <br> We have the rest of 2014 to see whether the President's intention to work outside of Congress to expand educational opportunity will prove effective. <br> Nick Ehrmann is the CEO and founder of Blue Engine, a New York City-based education nonprofit that partners with public high schools to prepare students for college success. <br> Maria Cardona: GOP should follow Obama's lead on women's issues <br> In his State of the Union speech, President Obama offered a blueprint for moving the country forward with optimism, economic opportunity and pathways to prosperity for all. But thanks to obstruction in Washington, too little has been done to make these a reality for all Americans, especially women. Here is where Republicans should pay attention. <br> Republicans can also follow the President's lead on raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for future federal contract workers as a way to climb out of their self-dug hole with women. Women hold a majority of low-wage jobs in America. Raising the minimum wage and closing the gender wage gap will help the 1 out of 3 women who live in or on the brink of poverty, could cut poverty in half and add half a trillion dollars to the economy. <br> Add to that abandoning the GOPs obsession with repealing Obamacare -- an initiative that has given countless mothers the security of knowing that their children with pre-existing conditions will be covered by a health plan -- and you could have the beginning of the end of the Republicans' problems with women. Maybe. <br> John Stoehr: He can't address inequality without spending <br> President Obama's fifth State of the Union address was haunted by the specter of austerity. Very few of the measures he asked Congress to act on -- education, tax and immigration reform, closing Guantanamo or passing fair-pay legislation -- would require the federal government to spend. <br> That's what was missing. <br> The closest Obama got to discussing spending was after urging Congress to close tax loopholes that reward corporations for sending jobs overseas while creating disincentives to creating jobs at home. We can take the money saved from tax reform, he said, and spend it "rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes." But if Congress fails to act, he said he would use the powers of the executive to fast-track "key projects" to "get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible." <br> That's fine, but there's only so much Obama can do without Congress. He can cut red tape all day but that's not going to put more money in more Americans' pockets, boosting their purchasing power. His call to raise the minimum wage will indeed increase demand, and alleviate poor sales, but even a $10.10 minimum wage doesn't keep pace with productivity gains over the past decade. This economy is not able to create enough quality jobs on its own. In the absence of benevolent market forces, the government must spend. <br> John Stoehr is managing editor of the Washington Spectator. <br> Aaron Carroll: No victory lap on Obamacare <br> Given that this is the year when the Affordable Care Act really gets into gear, it's not surprising that the President took the opportunity to highlight some of the important things that are happening right now due to health care reform. He highlighted the case of a woman in Arizona who was previously uninsured, but who was able to get health insurance on January 1 thanks to new regulations and the insurance exchanges. Millions of people stand to gain insurance this year, and the administration is eager to highlight this achievement. <br> But the President also seemed to acknowledge reality in the sense that people are not signing up for insurance at the rate that he had hoped for. He exhorted people to get family members to sign up for care. He used Kentucky as an example of success, but even that state isn't where many hoped it would be. <br> He urged Republicans to change their tactics on the law. Instead of "refighting old battles," he asked them to offer new ideas and allow them to be compared to his law in terms of costs and coverage. <br> This certainly didn't feel like a victory lap. President Obama continues to face opposition and calls for the law to be repealed. That's almost certainly not going to happen, but it has to be frustrating to the President that he still has to appeal to the American people for support on a law that was passed almost four years ago. <br> Bob Greene: The state of the union? Discord and inaction <br> Three bangs of the gavel, "Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States," "High privilege and distinct honor," and the annual grandeur-on-demand unfolded right on schedule Tuesday night. <br> The State of the Union address was not short on human moments. President Obama, in the first minute of his speech, evoked teachers, entrepreneurs, auto workers, farmers and rural doctors to argue that America's finest moments are crafted not in Washington, but out in the nation. <br> He pointed out that "the son of a barkeep" -- John Boehner -- was Speaker of the House, and that the son of a single mother -- Obama himself -- was president. <br> But when Obama declared that "this chamber" -- the well of the House of Representatives, on this evening filled with members of Congress, members of the Cabinet, justices of the Supreme Court, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- "speaks with one voice," his words, no matter how well intentioned, rang necessarily a little hollow. <br> The leadership of this nation? Speaking with one voice? <br> If ever in the country's history it was true -- and it probably never was -- it certainly isn't today. The President was making the case that the upper echelon of American politics and government concurs that "the state of our Union" is strong. <br> That sentiment is far from unanimous, and before long you will find ample evidence in the wall-to-wall attack ads that, as always, will be an inescapable feature of Congressional campaigns across the country. The State of the Union address long ago ceded its place as the main barometer of how political and governmental America feels about itself; the attack ads paint a truer cumulative portrait. <br> The president vowed "a year of action," and he will be correct, although perhaps not in the way he intended. The action is up the road, in the bare-knuckles election campaigns that lie ahead. The state of the union -- at least the political union -- is combative and discordant. Which is probably healthy, although sometimes not easy to watch. As messy as America's civic life can be, in the end it is hard to dispute that it is indeed a high privilege and distinct honor to live here, to be a part of it all. <br> CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose 25 books include "Late Edition: A Love Story;" "Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War;" and "Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen." <br> Edward Morrissey: Papering ove</strong>r</strong> poor track record on jobs <br> It's always difficult for a President starting a sixth year in office to frame a State of the Union speech for a forward-looking agenda, even when the basic economic environment is good. When that President has governed through a dysfunctional recovery and watched the workforce dwindle down as a share of the working-age population, it's nearly impossible. President Obama's speech, needless to say, did not accomplish the impossible. <br> He started out the speech bragging about adding eight million jobs in four years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that figure is 7.5 million since December 2009, although it's closer to 6.5 million in the Household survey. Even at the higher number, job growth works out to an average of 156,250 net jobs added each month. <br> Thanks to population growth, the U.S. economy needs to add about 150,000 jobs each month just to stay even in terms of workforce employment. What President Obama fails to mention is that his economic policies have dragged employment and active engagement in the workforce as a percentage of the civilian population down from 64.6% at the beginning of that four-year period to 62.8% now, a level not seen since Jimmy Carter gave his first official State of the Union speech in 1978. <br> Clearly, then, Obama's policies have not brought prosperity and job creation to the nation. At best, we have had four years of stagnation on job creation, and the falling top-line unemployment number reflects an exodus from the workforce, not any improvement in the job market. Why is that? Obama slipped into the passive voice to explain it: "But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled." Obama seems to think that he's just arrived on the scene, but it has been his economic and regulatory policies for the past five years that produced this stalled economy and stagnation environment. <br> And what did Obama propose to solve this? The same policies that produced it -- spending on supposedly shovel-ready public works, short-term gimmicky incentives and government programs, most of which have nothing to do with freeing capital to unlock job creation. <br> No one expected Obama to offer anything innovative or new, so it's hardly a disappointment. But like his last few State of the Union speeches, it was largely a laundry list of priorities far out of touch with Americans who just want to get back to work. <br> Anthony Leiserowitz: A renewed</strong> </strong>promise of action on climate change <br> President Obama's 5th State of the Union address called for reigniting the American dream -- one that feels increasingly out of reach for far too many Americans. <br> He vowed to take assertive presidential action this year -- with Congress where possible, but without Congress when it refuses to act. This includes perhaps his most important legacy -- making serious and substantial progress to reduce the threat of global warming and prepare the nation for the impacts already beginning to hit home. Future generations will look back on this President and on this time as a critical moment in the history of the world: did we choose to address this real and present danger or did we choose to ignore or deny the problem until it festered beyond repair? <br> The President listed his accomplishments so far -- stronger pollution standards for cars, rules to limit pollution from power plants, investments in the transition to clean energy. He also described new partnerships with states and local communities to begin preparing to protect the nation from extreme weather and other climate impacts. <br> These are important first steps. There is much still to be done -- by individuals, communities, states, the nation and the world. And there are still political divisions within America about the reality and seriousness of the threat. (He was in fact blunt: "...the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact," he said.) <br> But as the President reminded us, progress never comes easy. "Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged. But for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress." <br> Anthony Leiserowitz is </em>d</em>irector of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication at the Yale School of Forestry Environmental Studies. 
 When President Obama takes center stage for the State of the Union Address on Tuesday night, he is certain to address the issue of economic inequality. <br> Over the past few months, President Obama has become increasingly vocal about the growing divide between the rich and the poor in America. During a speech at the Center for American Progress in December, he warned that the nation needed to deal with the "dangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility that has jeopardized middle-class America's basic bargain—that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead." <br> The problem is that any talk about tackling inequality runs directly into the reality of Washington gridlock. In an age when so little gets done, it is hard to imagine Obama will have any luck achieving much progress on this issue. <br> But he needs to try. At a minimum, he can use the power of the presidency to at least get these issues into the national debate for now and for the future. <br> There are also some concrete proposals on the table that could take a dent out of inequality. <br> 1) Raise the minimum wage: Most important, the minimum wage has been central to the nation's efforts to provide a base of support to working Americans. Since its enactment in 1938, the federal minimum wage has been integral to boosting the income of workers in some of the lower-paying jobs. <br> But current minimum wage levels are not adequate. Most economists agree that there is room to increase the minimum wage without any dramatic impact on unemployment. There are proposals in Congress to raise it to $10.10 an hour from $7.25. The proposal has enormous national support even though there is still stiff opposition from Republicans in the House <br> 3) Restore extended</strong> </strong>unemployment benefits and food stamp spending: Congress must also restore some of the benefits that they have taken away from those who are struggling. It is one thing to stop progress on fighting inequality, another to make things worse. <br> Unfortunately, in recent months some Republicans have aggressively sought to undercut key pillars of the social safety net. The GOP blocked an effort by Democrats to extend unemployment benefits that expired. States are following through by cutting benefits as well, a dynamic that is having devastating effects on those who have been living on the edge. Congress has also enacted cuts to the food stamp program, one of the most effective measures that we have had since the 1960s to help poorer Americans. <br> 4) Add incentives to hire the long-term unemployed: Congress must also consider new incentives to persuade business to hire the long-term unemployed. In 2010, Congress enacted a tax benefit to employers who hired the unemployed. New incentives should be added that target the long-term unemployed. One of the most urgent challenges facing the government is to help the unemployed get back into the labor pool. The longer workers are out the more difficult it is to get back in. <br> 5) Close tax loopholes: President Obama should call on Congress to move forward on tax reform, an issue that has been discussed for years. Tax reform is one of the most effective means for raising revenue from wealthier Americans. At this point, Congress has little chance to move forward on a tax increase on wealthier Americans. But loophole-closing tax reform is a way to raise revenue by taking away benefits that some of the wealthiest Americans thrive on. There are a number of conservatives who have supported tax reform, a means of making the tax code more efficient and dealing with the deficit problem without raising tax rates. <br> Even though they are modest, some of these measures will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve and the odds are low. But President Obama must at least put the issues up on the agenda and energize the debate about how to tackle this problem. 
 President Barack Obama has had a tough year. Although he began in January well aware of the immense problems that second-term presidents have historically confronted, it still doesn't seem that he was fully prepared for what was to come. <br> The past 12 months have found the president struggling to protect his domestic policies from attack and to maintain control of the national agenda. <br> Obama began the year enjoying the glow of his reelection against Mitt Romney. The year ended with his approval ratings plummeting; more and more Americans reported that they didn't trust Obama. Many of the main items on his agenda -- tax reform, gun control, immigration reform, and climate change -- are languishing. <br> What factors made this year so difficult? The toughest challenge that President Obama faced has been the continuing ruthless opposition he has encountered on Capitol Hill. <br> Congressional Republicans have maintained their aggressive stance toward the administration, using the legislative process to achieve their objectives. The most tangible example of this strategy has been their threat to not raise the debt ceiling to force the president into several weeks of confrontation over the budget. <br> Even as their own party approval ratings plummeted, Republicans displayed a fierce determination to move forward with their strategy. Part of the problem stems from the fact that House Republicans play to their activist base, which will shape the primaries in their safe districts, rather than to independent voters. Tea party Republicans control enough of the House Caucus to force the speaker into their corner if he wants to keep his job. <br> Although Obama held his ground on the final outcome of the debt ceiling battle, the budget brinkmanship consumed a huge amount of valuable political time. If Congress passes the current budget deal, it will create a temporary pause in the budget wars, but the battles have already taken their toll <br> Republicans used other tactics as well. They stifled Obama's federal judicial nominations and executive appointments, until Senate Democrats became so frustrated that they changed the filibuster rules (a true sign of desperation in the upper chamber!). <br> House Republicans refused to move forward with an immigration bill with bipartisan support sent to them from the Senate, and conducted many hearings about the president's health care program trying to find scandal in a story about poor implementation. <br> That brings us to Obama's second challenge in 2013, one that did not come from his opponents but the failures of management and organization of his own administration. <br> After his health care program had survived judicial and legislative challenge, all eyes turned to see what the Affordable Care Act would look like when the government launched the federal online health care exchange on October 1. <br> The results were not pretty. The website was filled with problems. The system kept crashing when people tried to sign on. It gradually became clear that the site was not even prepared to disseminate the information about who purchased insurance to the insurers. <br> Investigative stories soon revealed that high-level officials had been aware of these problems long before the web site went live, and failed to properly prepare. Two months later the administration was able to get the system running relatively smoothly, as far as we now know. But the embarrassment of the first weeks had its cost on American's confidence in the program, as well as in the President. <br> Political scientist Theda Skocpol has reminded us that Social Security policymaker Wilbur Cohen, an iconic figure in the 1950s and 1960s, once said that Medicare was 1% inspiration and 99% implementation. In a toxic political atmosphere, Obama caused huge problems for himself with the way that he handled the 99% of the job. <br> And Obama has continued to struggle in the politics of perception. This has been a weakness of this administration from the start of his first term. <br> Obama is a politician who maintains an unending belief in rationality. He refuses to embrace the frenzied media environment where it is often difficult to tell fact from fiction. Since taking office, Obama has continued to hold firm to the idea that over time voters will pay attention to the facts, and that the candidate with the best argument will win. Sometimes, particularly on foreign policy, his outlook has proven to be correct. <br> But on many other occasions he has seen how quickly the national conversation can shift as the president stood silent. When Obama persuaded Congress to pass an economic stimulus bill in 2009, the administration did little to sell the program. Even though it was a modest program, heavily weighted toward tax cuts rather than government spending, conservatives branded it as a failed big-spending program that did nothing for the economy. <br> When Congress passed a health care program in 2010 that left the private insurance system fully intact and avoided anything looking like a national health insurance plan, the White House stood still as Republicans defined the bill as big government gone wild. <br> It was especially important that the White House respond aggressively this year before the rollout, but it did not. The public never got fully behind the law, let alone understood it. <br> The President has also allowed small stories to shift public discussion. Most recently, he delivered a major address on inequality in America. The speech was meant to outline an agenda for the rest of his presidency and provide a framework for the policies that he would pursue. <br> Within a few days of the speech, however, many reporters had refocused on new pseudo-scandals, such as the revelation that Obama once lived with an uncle who was almost deported as a result of a drunken-driving arrest. <br> Administration officials might rightly complain that these kinds of stories have little to do with the underlying issues facing the nation, but they still reflect the kind of media environment all presidents face. <br> From marketing their programs to fighting back against smaller scandals, the President's team needs to do a much better job in the politics of information. In apparent recognition of this failing, the administration is adding John Podesta, Phil Schiliro, and Katie Beirne Fallon to the White House team. <br> In the realm of national security, Obama also struggled in the face of the ongoing disclosures over the NSA surveillance program. Major leaks have revealed the extensive spying that the United States has undertaken within the United States and overseas, revelations that have angered many of the President's supporters who had believed he would do things differently than President George W. Bush. <br> The one area where the president has experienced slightly more positive outcomes are in foreign policy. In confronting a series of crises -- including Syria's use of chemical weapons against rebels and Iran's nuclear buildup -- Secretary of State John Kerry has put in place a series of temporary deals that aim to curb these threats. <br> Although the verdict is out on both of these, and each deal can backfire on the administration if they don't work out, for the time being the White House has calmed the storms. <br> Obama's supporters should hope that the tough moments of the year turn into learning moments for the President, hardening him for the coming year and giving him a better roadmap about how to push for his agenda in the upcoming year. They might take some solace from President Ronald Reagan, who enjoyed some of his most important accomplishments in his final years in office -- the signing of the INF Treaty with the Soviet Union -- as well as President Bill Clinton, whose approval ratings skyrocketed in his final years. <br> The good news for the president is that there is time left to win back public support and build on his record for the history textbooks. He also can gain some optimism from the fact that he is facing a deeply divided Republican Party whose approval ratings are even worse than his. 
 On the surface, Montana Senator Max Baucus's proposal to reform the corporate tax code seems politically insane. The powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has proposed tightening up the tax treatment of corporate profits overseas. The Senator, along with legislators in both parties, wants to use this proposal as the basis for broader loophole-closing reforms that also tackle the individual tax code. <br> Given how difficult it has been to pass any piece of legislation in recent years, it seems impossible that Congress will muster the energy or courage to challenge powerful interest groups that benefit from the status quo and to reform the tax code. <br> While loophole-closing tax reform might be good policy, it is hard to see how it can be good politics. "This is a big rock to push up the hill," warned Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden. <br> But in fact there is reason to believe that tax reform might have a chance to pass. The proposal comes at a good time. Congress is stuck in the mud. As an institution, Congress needs a big victory. Polls show that the approval ratings of Congress have reached all-time lows, now having fallen to an abysmal nine percent. <br> Although members of Congress tend to focus on their own electoral future, the public image of Congress has reached such a low point that the leaders of both parties are seriously concerned. <br> When public disapproval of the institution is so strong, it creates the environment for a possible "throw the bums" out atmosphere in which all parties are at risk for an anti-incumbent election. <br> Nothing can boost the image of Congress as an institution like a reform that benefits the public interest over private interests. Although achieving tax reform is extraordinarily difficult, Democrats and Republicans could walk away from a deal looking as if they were finally willing to take on the status quo in Washington and to defy the powerful interest groups who lurk on K Street. This might be enough to bolster public attitudes about the House and Senate going into the next couple of election cycles. <br> If Congress gores enough oxen, with both parties equally implicated in the reform, members could insulate themselves from the fallout—preventing one party from using this as an issue against the other--and strengthen their standing with the electorate as a result. <br> Both parties also stand to benefit from tax reform because it remains one of the best ways to raise revenue without raising taxes. One of the reasons that tax reform has always attracted the interest of fiscal conservatives is that cleaning up the tax code of its loopholes quickly raises more revenue. <br> Most fiscal conservatives understand that serious deficit reduction is only possible through a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts. <br> Although the United States has maintained a progressive tax code since 1913, few upper income individuals or corporations pay the actual higher rates since loopholes diminish their obligations. Occasionally, such as in 1969 and 1986, Congress has closed loopholes as a way to raise more money to curb the deficit. <br> Unlike 1986, this time the legislation would not be revenue neutral. The amount of money raised by closing loopholes would be more than the money saved by taxpayers enjoying lower rates, and that money could be used to help shrink the deficit. That could enable the grand bargain over deficit reduction that Democrats and Republicans have been unsuccessfully pursuing for years. <br> As occurred when Ronald Reagan was president in 1986, tax reform was an issue that both parties had an incentive to support. For unpopular Republicans, tax reform can offer evidence that the party is committed to fiscal responsibility and demonstrate that they are capable of governance. <br> Passage of the legislation would offer a contrast to the image that the party gained when it used the debt ceiling to try to force President Obama's hand on spending cuts. For Democrats, tax reform can shift the national agenda away from the problems with the roll out of the Affordable Care Act and toward a legislative accomplishment. <br> Finally, tax reforms can be one of the first tests of the post-filibuster reform Congress. The Senate voted to prevent filibusters on executive and judicial nominations. They did so through a majority vote, establishing for the first time that a majority was sufficient to change the rules. <br> Many experts predict that this precedent might scare senators from using the filibuster as much as in recent years, fearing that the tool might be eliminated altogether. It is thus possible that tax reform would now only require 51, rather than 60, votes in the Senate. <br> President Obama could desperately use a victory like tax reform. As the chances for passing immigration reform diminish, and the possibilities of achieving progress on climate change are nil, tax reform might be one of the few areas where progress is possible. <br> Ronald Reagan scored a big victory in 1986, one that remains a noted part of his record and legacy. Unfortunately, over time new loopholes were created and there is a need for another around of reform. The president should seize the moment, to make sure that his second term is not solely defined by the bitter partisan battles over the budget and health care. 
 If this were a movie, we would be at the part where the hero finds himself surrounded. He has no escape routes and he's outgunned. What will happen next: Will our hero prevail like John McClane in "Die Hard," or will he fail like William Wallace in "Braveheart"? <br> Well, the good news for Obama is that the script for the final scenes of his presidency has not been written yet. The bad news is that he may not be the one writing it. <br> Simply put: Obama is not the protagonist driving his own story. Rather, his storyline is being dictated by others. No question, he has long had trouble controlling the narrative, with a GOP bent on denying him, basically, everything he wants. But now he's heading toward the end of his final term -- and the clock is ticking on his agenda. <br> It was as if Obama had become George Clooney as the captain of the fishing boat in "The Perfect Storm." The rain has stopped, the ocean is turning calm and there is even a glimmer of sunlight; he's beaten the storm. But then moments later, the sky darkens and there is a deluge of rain. The choppy waters (in this case, the Obamacare website debacle) soon consume the ship. <br> Is this Obama's metaphoric fate? He can accept another plotline -- let's say of "Gravity," with Obama as a character like Sandra Bullock's, hit with one harrowing challenge after another. This may be exciting to watch, but not great for the character, who has no idea what will happen next. <br> I'd recommend a different story line. I'd use the ending of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" as inspiration and metaphorically go out with guns blazing. Why not set some lofty goals that will frame the agenda anew going forward? <br> Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News. But the upside is that the debate will be about the issues the President has chosen. <br> It's denouement time for Obama as we enter the final act of his presidency. Will the President's agenda continue to be dictated by others, making him nothing more than a lame duck, caretaker President? Or will he use every means at his discretion to write his own story? <br> Obama is the star of this movie. The only question is: How is it going to end? 
 Driven by a hard-line faction of conservatives, Washington has done something terribly stupid: shutting down the national government. Most of America is aghast. But it is also just possible that doing something stupid will help us avoid doing something truly dangerous. <br> Shutdowns are a lousy way to run a government. Just for starters, this one has cut off services to women and children in need, furloughed hundreds of thousands, further shaken the confidence of the public, sent a shudder through the financial world and created new storm clouds over the economy. And once again the world is wondering about our capacity for leadership. <br> But all of this damage pales in comparison with the danger posed by a second, lurking threat: a default on our public finances. <br> The United States has had 17 government shutdowns since 1977 and has generally recovered well. But we have never had a default. Experts, while not fully certain, are convinced that it could be hugely destructive -- even leading to a worldwide financial meltdown. Unless Congress and the White House get their act together, we could default in less than three weeks. <br> But a shutdown could have a silver lining. It could be such an electric shock to the political system that it forces the politicians in Washington to settle their squabbles before the default deadline. <br> What we know from past shutdowns is that not only citizens -- especially older ones dependent on Social Security and Medicare -- start raising hell, but so do business and financial leaders who see damage rippling across their economic interests. Politicians are increasingly seen as villains. Pressure tends to grow so unbearable that eventually Washington finds a solution. <br> Seasoned GOP leaders across the country know that if the shutdown does serious damage, chances of Republicans picking up Senate seats in 2014 and the White House in 2016 could evaporate. Those leaders will push intensely for a way out. <br> But Republicans are not the only ones who will come under pressure to find a settlement. So will Democrats, starting with President Obama. We expect our presidents to be leaders of all the people, not a single party or ideology. We want them to rise above the squabbling and keep us on track. The harsh rhetoric that the president has been directing at Republicans suggests that he is less interested in settlement than unconditional surrender. <br> Moreover, as Republicans make their counterarguments, it is becoming increasingly apparent that they have some valid questions. Is Obamacare truly ready for prime time? Shouldn't the two parties work together on the tax code? When is Washington going to get serious about overhauling the entitlement programs so they will survive for coming generations? <br> Yes, conservative hard-liners have chosen the wrong place to fight; arguments over Obamacare are no excuse to shut down the government. Yes, hard-liners like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are creating deeper partisan divides. But Democrats can ill afford to continue rejecting any talks or negotiations. <br> Now that the shutdown has happened, Obama has a fresh opportunity -- indeed a fresh responsibility -- to seize the mantle of leadership and get us out of this mess. Instead of just blaming the Republicans, he should call in the leaders of both parties and in Lyndon Johnson fashion, keep 'em talking till they get a deal. <br> With the shutdown underway, the president has new leverage to say, "Look, we are here to negotiate a settlement so that we can reopen the government. We are not here to negotiate over a possible default; I have said all along that I won't do that. But those of you who have been listening closely know that I have also been saying that I am open to conversations about settling our policy differences so that we can keep the government running. <br> "Tax reform, entitlement reform and even some tweaking of the Affordable Care Act are on the table now. I have only two conditions: I will not accept a gutting of Obamacare -- we settled that at the ballot box in 2012 -- and any settlement here must include a pledge not to let the country go into default. So, let's get started." <br> Would it work? Who knows for sure? But one thing is clear: If enough Americans rise up now and pressure politicians in Washington to call off this circus, we could not only end this foolishness over a shutdown, but we could also avoid a truly dangerous default. And we could hold our heads up again. 
 In contrast to the 2002 farewell summit between President George W. Bush and outgoing Chinese President Jiang Zemin at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, this week's talks between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in California mark the first time in history that a U.S. president will host a series of informal meetings with a new Chinese leader. <br> While issues such as North Korea, cybersecurity and the economy will likely dominate their discussions, what really matters is whether Xi and Obama can establish a trusting personal relationship that will help both leaders overcome stark policy differences. <br> As charismatic leaders who view themselves as transformational figures, what better way to start the conversation than to outline their aspirations and plans for resolving pressing domestic matters? <br> Both Xi and Obama are finding themselves at political crossroads that will define their subsequent days in office. Both need to solve a confluence of structural problems while confronting cynical constituencies that can easily turn on them. <br> For Obama, dealing with a seemingly intractable partisan divide in Washington is hard enough. A series of recent bureaucratic problems has made his burden worse, resulting in what some have referred to as his "second term blues." <br> For Xi, an apparent turn to conservatism has the potential to bring his erstwhile reform-minded political honeymoon to an untimely end. <br> Luckily, each leader has the opportunity this week to talk with one of the few counterparts in the world who can empathize with the magnitude of the issues. <br> In his first few months as president, Xi has worked to give the Chinese government a face-lift, trying to contain corruption and construct a sense of nationalism by offering his people something they aspire to: the Chinese Dream, or what Xi has described as the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the opportunity to realize a middle-class lifestyle. <br> As Xi pursues these aspirations, he should join Obama in exploring similar issues that are hindering both countries -- a growing divide between the rich and poor, persistent post-graduate unemployment, housing bubbles, food safety concerns, immigration (or internal migration for China) reform, health care reform and tax reform. <br> If Xi is to be successful in confronting these issues, it will be difficult to do so without political reform. <br> In China, dissent has been growing on college campuses, where academics have received recommendations instructing them not to speak about seven sensitive issues: universal values, freedom of the press, civil society, civil rights, past party mistakes, crony capitalism and judicial independence. Whether such official guidelines persist will determine if there is hope for an open and intellectually dynamic political environment that can accommodate socioeconomic changes. <br> As a former professor of constitutional law, Obama is uniquely situated to address the importance of Chinese political reform and constitutionalism. Obama needs to stress that avoiding intellectual discussion of political issues doesn't make them go away—it only pushes such discussion into less structured arenas, and China has seen how that has turned out in the past. <br> As the first black president, Obama can also candidly and respectfully articulate America's lessons from the civil rights movement and its firm commitment to democracy, human rights, media freedom and the rule of law, which the United States believe to be fundamental to the long-term stability and prosperity of any country. <br> Some might argue that discussion of China's much needed political reform would set Obama and Xi on course for a contentious relationship. In fact, it would help remind Xi that he can seize this moment to stand on the right side of history and turn back from the conservative path before he squanders the reform-minded political capital he has built over his first productive months in office. <br> Instead of focusing solely on specific issues like national security and economic rebalancing, Obama and Xi have an opportunity to set the stage for a deeper, more candid and more cooperative Sino-American relationship by crafting a shared vision of the future and drawing on the common needs and desires of the Chinese and American people. <br> Only by talking about their domestic challenges and areas for improvement will they realize the potential fruits to be born out of such cooperation. And only when such unity of purpose is realized will China and America be able to work together and tackle the economic and security issues of our time. 
 The controversies generated a big stir in Washington and the news media, though it is unclear that the general public is quite as interested as the politicians and the reporters. Nonetheless, at least for now, both stories have produced intense congressional investigations to find out who was responsible for any wrongdoing. <br> While investigations to determine whether laws were violated and who should be blamed are important, it is also crucial that Congress use these moments as opportunities to reform processes and laws that are broken. <br> Having a tax system that retains strong legitimacy among the public is essential. After all, taxes are the lifeblood of our federal government, providing the funds necessary to keep citizens safe and to provide needed services lacking in the private sphere. The more the government can do to create the impression that the system is working well, the more confidence we can gain in our government on the right and the left. <br> In the past, tax scandals have led to substantive reform. There have been moments when stories about wrongdoing within the IRS have led to restructuring and reorganization that improved the basic operations of the agency. Following the revelation that bribery, kickbacks and other kinds of corruption had been taking place in the IRS during the 1940s, Congress imposed stricter civil service rules to govern bureaucrats in the agency. <br> In response to news about cases in which tax agents were aggressive in their treatment of taxpayers in the mid-1990s, Congress passed a reform in 1998 that reorganized the IRS, creating an oversight board, and imposed much stronger restraints on IRS agents to make them more accountable to citizens. <br> New revelations about how individuals and organizations abuse the tax code through exemptions, deductions and loopholes has also produced reform. During the mid-1980s, there were a slew of stories about how wealthy Americans escaped their tax obligations while average Americans were required to pay more. <br> Reformers used the concept, born in the 1960s, of "tax expenditures" to explain the multiple ways in which the federal government provided social welfare by freeing people of their tax obligations. <br> Through a bipartisan effort in 1986, Congress reformed the tax code by cleaning out many of the loopholes that existed. President Ronald Reagan called the legislation a "sweeping victory for fairness." While the reforms came undone gradually over the next decade, the legislation did mark a shining example of how both parties could, under the right conditions, join forces to support the general interest over private interests. <br> Finally, there have been moments when scandals involving the government treatment of political organizations has produced reform, not simply media frenzies. In 1907, in the wake of stories revealing the sordid connection between money and politics, Congress passed a law that prohibited corporations and banks from contributing to the campaigns of federal officials. <br> In 2002, Congress passed another reform that made it illegal for business and unions to use their funds for "electioneering" purposes within 30 days of a primary or 60 days before an election. The McCain-Feingold reform targeted campaign ads that aired on television. All of this came totally undone with the Citizens United decision. <br> Tax reform is always extraordinarily difficult to accomplish, even though the issue draws support from liberals who seek to create a fairer system and conservatives who want a more efficient system. The problem is that the status quo is powerful. <br> There had been talk about tax reform during the budget battles as a method for raising revenue that did not require raising tax rates. But those discussions faded. There are vested interests, both organizations with financial power and bureaucrats, who don't want anything to change. Scandals such as these have the potential to change the equation, by creating political pressure on elected officials to do something to the system upon which they thrive. <br> What kinds of reforms are needed now? The first area that needs reform is our tax code. Without question, the reforms of 1986 have come undone. Legislators have filled the code with too many loopholes, exemptions and deductions that cost the government huge amounts of revenue and are unfair. The time has come for another round of reform, going through the tax code to eliminate provisions that allow individuals and organizations to escape their obligations. <br> The second reform has to do with the exemption for political organizations that is at the heart of the ongoing story. The good news is that the revelations have already triggered discussions about why these organizations receive exemptions and what purpose this loophole serves. It is worth considering whether the loophole should be changed. <br> Third, we need to make sure the IRS is adequately staffed with competent and skilled employees in local offices who won't allow these kinds of mistakes to be repeated. Finally, this scandal should trigger tighter rules against targeting particular kinds of organizations. <br> Whether reform follows the scandal will depend on how much heat legislators feel from the stories coming out of Washington and whether there are leaders in the House and Senate willing to take a stand for those issues. If they do, they will take the most constructive possible actions. 
 The media verdict is in: Barack Obama is cursed. <br> Less than four months after taking the oath of office for the second time, he is seen as falling prey to some mysterious witchcraft that casts a fatal spell on re-elected presidents. <br> One can almost conjure up a bubbling cauldron of black smoke with a wand-wielding wizard laughing diabolically. <br> Now, there's no question that second-term presidents often stumble or run out of gas. But the punditry suggests a one-size-fits-all scenario that isn't borne out by history. What's more, there's a rush-to-judgment air to some of these pronouncements that implies his second term is on the verge of failure, with more than 3 1/2 years to go. <br> Republicans, meanwhile, have been making Obama's life miserable, defeating a modest measure on background checks for guns, slow-walking immigration legislation and refusing to vote for some Cabinet nominees. <br> Oh, and the economy isn't doing that well either. <br> But does that amount to a jinxed second term, or the same kind of partisan standoff that has marked Obama's years in office? A look back at recent second-termers makes clear that every set of problems is inherently different. <br> As for Obama, smart journalists are careful not to be definitive when writing their trend pieces. Politico says the recent setbacks "have left the president feeling deeply frustrated, even angry — and eager to find a way to recapture the offensive." The Washington Post piece describes his mounting woes as "diversions working against a president who is keenly aware of how little time he has left to achieve big things." <br> This brings us to the thing that every second-term president since FDR has indeed faced: a ticking clock. <br> A re-elected commander-in-chief is a lame duck whose ability to reward and punish inevitably diminishes as his departure date approaches. And that, rather than any sinister voodoo, may be Obama's biggest problem as he tries to dig his way out of this ditch. 
 President Barack Obama is having a tough time. <br> Now the president faces another challenge with immigration reform. A bipartisan group in the Senate, led by Charles Schumer and Marco Rubio, has put together an immigration bill that includes a path to legalization for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in this country and tighter border control. It appears that the bill has a chance to pass the Senate. <br> But will House Republicans subvert the deal? <br> Immediately after Congress killed the gun control legislation, critics started pointing to the president's hesitation to twist arms and lean on members of Congress. In what has become a familiar refrain, Obama was no Lyndon Johnson. <br> Yet Obama's trouble has much more to do with the way government works than his skill, or lack thereof, at working Capitol Hill. <br> Too much emphasis is placed on the small picture of what he does or does not do in his personal interactions with Congress, or his "messaging." Actually, it's not so much him as the government. <br> Obama understood this when he ran for president in 2008. He spoke constantly about the need to reform the government and the way in which our political processes hamper the ability of Congress and the president to take action. <br> Yet once he was president, Obama put the issue of reform on the back burner. He decided to focus on the policy challenges ahead, generally dismissing the idea that there was much chance for him to make government work better. In certain cases, such as with the use of private money and political action committees, he decided to join the game and make sure it worked to his advantage. <br> The decision has come at a cost. <br> Throughout his presidency, Obama has struggled as private interest groups have continued to exert enormous power over the legislative process. When Obama pushed his health care law through Congress, he felt the need to abandon hugely important measures that would have imposed tough cost controls. He did so to placate powerful interest groups in the medical industry who were dead set against these measures. <br> The financial regulations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in response to the financial crisis of 2008, have struggled as interest groups continually undercut their effectiveness by persuading legislators to avoid any kind of tough implementation. <br> This time around, gun rights organizations -- from giants such as the National Rifle Association to smaller operations -- conducted a massive and unyielding blitz on legislators. Even bipartisan support, a rarity in Washington, was not enough for the bill to succeed. <br> Other issues, such as tax reform to close loopholes, have simply been abandoned because they seem so impossible given the power of lobbyists and campaign contributors who lurk on K Street. The power of money makes it extremely difficult for politicians to go out on a limb. <br> The filibuster has also remained the chronic obstacle for Obama. With the constant threat of the filibuster against almost any piece of legislation, almost every bill requires a 60-vote super majority in the Senate. This makes it hard to build a coalition behind legislation and in most cases allows small factions within a party to subvert presidential proposals. Presidents usually need bipartisan support to get 60 votes, and bipartisanship is almost impossible nowadays. <br> This was certainly a challenge for gun rights, and could make immigration reform vulnerable in the final stages of debate. As with money and politics, the filibuster has also made other issues altogether impossible to consider even. <br> When the immigration bill reaches the House of Representatives, the trouble will begin. House members in gerrymandered districts care about the party activists who tend to be the loudest voices. The situation to avoid is one where the Republican caucus drifts further to the right even while counterparts in the Senate and public opinion support immigration reform. <br> The truth is we will never know what was possible in that transformative moment that followed Obama's historic election or after his re-election in 2012. But without reforming our government, the path to gridlock is not going to disappear. 
 Several sitting governors might be contenders in the 2016 presidential election. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have given indications they are thinking of running, although they haven't announced candidacies at this very early stage of the contest. <br> Both are serious candidates. Christie, a Republican, has demonstrated his ability to handle the heat from the national spotlight and he has positioned himself as a tough, northeastern budget cutter who can appeal to moderate Republican voters and disaffected Democrats. <br> Cuomo, a Democrat, has earned considerable praise for advancing a brand of pragmatic liberalism by championing issues like same-sex marriage, progressive tax reform and rent regulation while also fighting to reduce spending, taking on public unions and reforming government. <br> Each governor faces some difficult challenges within their states. Over the past week, Cuomo has watched as a massive political scandal has unfolded within the Democratic Party, centering on an official who tried to bribe his way into becoming a candidate in the mayoral election of New York. The stories coming out of the state suggest the culture of Albany might not have become as different as Cuomo has claimed. <br> Christie also finds himself in the national spotlight after the release of a shocking video showing the coach of the Rutgers University basketball team berating and hitting his players. The revelation that Rutgers officials knew about this behavior for at least a year has led to calls for the resignation of top administrators at the state-funded university, including the president. Thus far, Christie has backed away from calls to have the president removed, though he has used some tough rhetoric in his comments about the coach. <br> Other governors are thinking of running as well. For example, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, is gaining some national attention by pushing his state to the left on a number of key issues, including a proposal to repeal the death penalty and the recent passage of sweeping gun control legislation. Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, has long been considered a potential superstar for the GOP. O'Malley has received some flak from the right for his fiscal record in the state, while Jindal's falling approval ratings in Louisiana could pose a big problem for a national run. <br> The governors need to handle these challenges with extreme caution and each must make sure that his record as the chief executive of his state, always one of the biggest selling points for governors running for president, does not turn into an albatross that brings his candidacy down. <br> In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis ran for the presidency against Vice President George H.W. Bush. Dukakis started his campaign by touting his role in bringing about the "Massachusetts Miracle," the revitalization of the state's economy around high-tech industries along Route 128. <br> At first, Republicans were worried that his record could allow the governor to position himself as a new kind of Democrat, someone who understood how to nurture economic growth and whose economic policies offered a model of smart government investment as an attractive alternative to Reagan's free-market economics. <br> But Massachusetts, miracle and all, soon turned into a nightmare for the Democrat. Vice President Bush and his aggressive campaign staff found ways to rip apart his record in the state and they used it to defeat him. Some of the attacks were vicious, taking aspects of the state government's record and twisting them into devastating campaign arguments. <br> The Republicans, for instance, pointed to a law that Dukakis had vetoed as governor that would have required teachers to conduct the Pledge of Allegiance with their class. Dukakis had been told in no uncertain terms that such a law would be unconstitutional. The Republicans highlighted the veto to paint Dukakis as a liberal of the far left variety. <br> Bush adviser Lee Atwater also put together a television ad focusing on a program that a Republican governor who served before Dukakis had put into place that granted prisoners short furloughs. One prisoner, Willie Horton, had killed a man and raped his fiancé during his time out of prison. The famous ad, playing on racial fears, focused on the program, presenting it as one of Dukakis' legacies. <br> Vice President Bush targeted the pollution in Boston Harbor to question Dukakis' environmental record. "Two-hundred years ago tea was spilled in the Boston Harbor in the name of liberty. If tea were spilled in the Boston Harbor today," Bush said, "it would dissolve in the residue of my opponent's neglect and delay." <br> As economic conditions changed, Bush pointed to evidence that the state was starting to falter. Combined with reports of a looming budget deficit, Republicans used the data to challenge the very centerpiece of Dukakis' campaign. <br> In 2012, another man who served as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney, suffered from similar challenges. Romney's signature legislation as governor, the health care program of Massachusetts, undercut some of his ability to challenge President Obama on this issue. His record of increased "fees" in the state and problems with the economy also became fodder for the primaries and general election. <br> The condition and record of their states almost always becomes the prism through which presidential candidates who are sitting governors are evaluated. Sometimes governors use this to their advantage, like Bill Clinton in 1992 and George W. Bush in 2000. But often the states can turn into a problem. <br> Cuomo, O'Malley, Jindal and Christie, who still have to decide whether to run, need to handle these challenges with extreme caution. If they don't, they might find themselves suffering the fate of Dukakis, who, like them, was once touted as the most exciting voice of his party. 
 President Obama has characterized his 2014 budget, released Wednesday, not as his ideal vision for how much the federal government ought to tax and spend, but rather as a compromise that aims to respect the priorities of Democrats and Republicans. He has insisted that congressional Republicans see the policy options laid out in his budget as a package deal, not as a menu of policy options from which to choose. <br> And so the president's budget includes reductions in the planned growth of Social Security and Medicare spending, to appeal to conservative advocates of spending restraint, and a number of tax increases, the bulk of which are designed to affect high-earners, a high priority of the president's congressional allies. <br> House Speaker John Boehner and other leading congressional Republicans have made their opposition to further tax increases clear. But President Obama's tax proposals nevertheless merit close attention, as they tell us a great deal about his priorities. <br> One of the ways the Obama administration seeks to raise revenue is to have the federal government adopt chained CPI, a method of calculating consumer price inflation that factors in the fact that consumers tend to substitute some goods for others in response to rising or falling prices. <br> Chained CPI has been discussed primarily with regards to its impact on federal outlays, and particularly Social Security spending, as it is expected to lead to somewhat lower cost-of-living adjustments that in turn will lead to somewhat lower Social Security benefit levels. <br> Yet chained CPI will also lead tax brackets to be adjusted more slowly than they are under the federal government's current inflation index. This adjustment is expected to yield roughly $100 billion in new tax revenues over the next decade. <br> In addition, the president has revived two proposals that figured prominently in his 2013 budget: the so-called "Buffett Rule," which requires that households earning $1 million or more pay a minimum of 30% of their income in federal taxes, after allowing for charitable giving, and a limit on tax deductions for the highest-earning 2% of households. <br> The downside of the Buffett Rule, according to Viard, is that it might discourage capital investment and increase reliance on debt financing. The limit on tax deductions, meanwhile, reduces the value of itemized deductions to the 28% tax rate for households. <br> That is, even as a household enters the 33, 35, and 39.6% tax brackets, the value of its itemized deductions will remain at the lower 28% rate. The president's budget also calls for substantial increases in federal taxes on tobacco products, which are designed to fund new preschool efforts. <br> President Obama's tax proposals illustrate how difficult it will be to raise tax revenues by a substantial amount while shielding middle-income households from tax increases. Chained CPI and tax increases on tobacco products will almost certainly affect some number of households earning less than $250,000 a year, yet the Obama administration also intends to increase the size of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which will tend to mitigate any harmful effect. <br> If President Obama hopes to build momentum for a substantial revenue increase, he would be well advised to cheer on the efforts of Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, and Rep. Dave Camp, R-Michigan, the chairmen of the tax-writing committees of the Senate and House respectively, as both are working toward a larger, more ambitious tax overhaul. <br> Despite these substantially lower rates, revenues would increase, in part because capital income would be subject to the same tax rates as ordinary income. Of course, measures like the Buffett Rule would increase effective taxes on capital income even further. If Baucus and Camp converge around something like the Modified Zero Plan, the tax debate might finally break out of its current grim stalemate. 
 It's not often that a presidential to-do list (and legacy-making agenda) comes down to a couple of key weeks, but here we are: gun control, immigration reform and the budget -- all front and center, right now. <br> It's an odd time in Washington. The president has been dating Republicans, dining with senators with whom he has hardly spoken in the past. Republicans seem to believe they can actually work with the president -- on immigration, at least. <br> As for guns, well, some in the GOP seem ready to filibuster an issue -- background checks -- that has overwhelming public support. "That won't do us a lot of good," moans one GOP pollster. "We will look like the party taking extremist positions." <br> Remember how well that worked with women in the last election? <br> And then there's the budget. The president decided to propose one this year that starts with compromise -- containing some of the entitlement reforms that he worked out with House Speaker John Boehner before the "grand bargain" became the grand failure. A couple of senior GOP pollsters tell me that they can't quite figure out why the president did something guaranteed to annoy his liberal base. <br> How about this for an answer: When all else fails, it doesn't hurt to look credible. Better yet, it doesn't hurt actually to be credible. <br> After all, what's the downside? "When you are dealing with dysfunction, the best you can do is demonstrate that you are reasonable," one senior administration official tells me. "The alternative would be throwing fuel on the flames. We need to be serious here." <br> It's about time. On all fronts. <br> Understand this: This is a not a strategy hatched by a bunch of Pollyannas at the White House. It is borne of necessity, and bred with an understanding of a public that has just about had it with Washington. The president played tough in the sequester fight -- calling for new revenues -- and he lost. Now he's not overplaying his hand; he's playing it smart. <br> On immigration, he's hanging back, letting congressional negotiators take the lead. He was called out for doing that on health care reform -- rightly so, allowing top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to manage an unpopular process and produce an unpopular bill. But this time, it's different: Republicans understand that immigration reform has now become a gateway issue. 'It's now a basic way for us to find our way back into national politics," one GOP pollster tells me. "It doesn't solve our problem with Latino voters by itself, but it helps." <br> Even polls show that a majority of GOP voters -- once opposed to reform -- are now on board with some version of it. The notion of a "pathway to citizenship" still stirs all kinds of fears about amnesty with the GOP base, but that's less of an issue these days: All things considered, any gain in Latino voters outweighs some shrinkage of the base. <br> It's a trickier route for the president on guns. Barack Obama didn't intend for gun control to be part of his second-term legacy; it came to be after Newtown. And this is an issue, by the way, that splits the Democratic Party more than it splits the GOP. A half-dozen Democratic Senate races in pro-gun states next year could hang in the balance. And if the Democrats lose those senators -- and can't break a GOP filibuster -- it's dangerous for them, too. <br> Not as dangerous, of course, as the GOP holding up any vote on a gun bill. That, I would argue, could have a great deal of impact on the midterm elections. Why? Because the president will continue to take the issue directly to the voters, 90% of whom agree with him on background checks. <br> It's a delicate time here in Washington. If nothing happens on guns, for instance, what about the rest of the Obama agenda? "If you can't pass a bill on guns in this environment, what can you ever do?" asks one senior administration official. "It sets the bar so high for anything, people will be demoralized." <br> The result? Retreat. Maybe some sort of immigration reform passes (it's in everyone's self-interest) but no tax reform. No serious entitlement reform. Nothing big on the agenda, just small-scale items. <br> Perfect for politicians unable to respond to crisis, much less the will of the people. 
 As the House and the Senate debated and passed budgets recently, one person was notably absent from the debate: President Barack Obama. <br> Unfortunately, the president's tardiness is reflective of his fundamental lack of seriousness when it comes to budgeting. Families and businesses have to ensure that their spending, including their debt payments, doesn't exceed their income, but the president acts as if he doesn't think that should apply to the federal government. <br> Recently, when speaking about his budget (which the White House says will be out next week, a full two months after the deadline), the president said that he didn't want "to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance." Well, perhaps he should chase a balanced budget for the sake of our economy. <br> The impact of those policies has not been pretty. <br> While it's certainly true that the president inherited a bad economy, it's important to note that he inherited it more than four years ago. What has he been doing since? <br> Let's put this in perspective. Ronald Reagan inherited a bad economy. But Reagan put in place growth-oriented economic policies such as fundamental tax reform and fewer regulations, which turned the economy around. <br> The fact is Obama's spending, tax and regulatory policies are smothering economic recovery, jobs and opportunity. <br> Yet despite the abysmal failures of the president's policies, he continues to argue for more of the same. <br> It's time to try something new: Time to balance the budget, rein in Washington's dangerous levels of spending and unleash economic growth by expanding energy production being held back by the Obama administration, such as the Keystone XL pipeline. It's time to cut excessive government red tape strangling our small businesses and to truly reform our tax code to make rates lower and fairer for all Americans. <br> We should be taking an honest look at the relationship between the president's policies and economic growth. The president's tax hikes, runaway spending and onslaught of new and burdensome regulations are preventing a real economic recovery. <br> It's time for the president to get out of the way of the American people and let our economy take off. It's time to do better than 0.8% growth. 
 Cold weather has delayed spring in Washington, but we can detect a clear warming trend in our politics. <br> To be sure, the distance between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans remains vast, executive and judicial nominations remain blocked by an unprecedented number of filibusters and major legislative accomplishments are still months away. But the ice of gridlock is starting to thaw. <br> Evidence of a healthier, more normal politics is beginning to reappear, centered in the Senate, our political institution that has declined the longest and the furthest. <br> The Judiciary Committee has reported the first major gun control legislation since 1994, though its fate is far from certain. <br> Freshman Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown have expressed similar views as have Republicans Bob Corker and Chuck Grassley on the dangers of ''too big to fail" banks. Democrat Max Baucus, Senate Finance Committee chairman, and Republican Dave Camp, House Ways and Means chairman, have accelerated their effort, started two years ago, to enact the first major tax reform legislation since 1986. <br> The atmosphere is palpably better. President Barack Obama's "charm offensive" on Capitol Hill won approval from many Republicans. <br> Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, who after meeting with the president in 2010, called him "thin- skinned" and recommended that he "take valium," praised him generously this time around for the substantive meeting on the budget and related economic issues. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who famously declared that defeating Obama was his highest priority, has this year shown much more graciousness, respect and even occasional humor. <br> Two factors are most responsible for the improvement. <br> First, it turns out that elections do have consequences. <br> Obama's decisive re-election, coupled with what amounted to a national landslide won by the Senate Democrats, has forced the Republicans into a period of reassessment and repositioning. Of course, some Republicans still believe that their party lost because its right wing views were did not come through clearly enough. <br> But most Republicans recognize that the party's combination of extremism and obstruction proved to be a losing strategy. They know the Republican brand is in deep trouble. The election results seemed to have convinced at least some of the Senate Republicans that finding areas in which to cooperate with the president is necessary. <br> But the second factor, less understood than the impact of election returns, is just as important. By the end of 2012, for many returning senators and those newly elected, dismay about the Senate has hardened into disgust and determination to change it. <br> Across the political spectrum, senators are fed up with lurching from crisis to crisis, leaders dictating straight party votes, endless filibusters and constant failure to address the nation's problems. <br> Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, compared the Senate to "the Russian Duma ... an endless series of secret conclaves .., with meetings everywhere but in the committee room or the open air of the Senate floor." <br> Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, took pride in the "zone of civility" created by the increasing number of women senators. <br> Sen. Schumer, D-New York, longingly "looked forward to the good old days when we had major legislation go through committees." <br> The shorthand for what the overwhelming number of senators want is "regular order" -- legislation that results from committee consideration, vigorous debate, the opportunity to offer amendments and hard bargaining to reach principled compromise -- and the Senate is changing as its leaders respond to the members' frustration and anger. <br> Legislating in our diverse, contentious country, with our system of separation of powers, has never been, and will never be, easy. Former Sen. Gary Hart once described the great Senate of the 1970s as "a kind of controlled madhouse." <br> The path to major legislative accomplishments is always treacherous and strewn with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. <br> Today, the partisan divide is much deeper and the political culture far more vitriolic than 20 or 30 years ago. Although senators cannot choose the era in which they serve, they can choose the way they approach their work and they can determine the way the Senate functions. <br> It doesn't take much time, or that many people, to change the Senate. Hopefully, day by day, that change is starting to happen. 
 For most Americans, the budget debate in Washington is reaching dog-whistle pitch, a tone that only partisans can hear. Which, as far as I am concerned, is a mercy. <br> Paul Ryan offered his budget on Tuesday. Let's do give him props for making the effort and all. The vast majority of his colleagues are potted plants on this front, reading talking points, sometimes banging the table and doing precious little else. But what Ryan calls a budget is what any CEO would call a firing offense. It uses some numbers and some words that appear in real budgets. But it neglects some other key elements ... like arithmetic or the truth or a greater economic purpose. <br> The Ryan budget depends entirely on unspecified tax reforms and the replacement of revenues he doesn't care for (such as those associated with Obamacare) with others he doesn't care to actually define or describe. The rigorous, widely respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities slammed the exercise, taking Ryan to task for failing to live up to his billing as the guy courageous enough to put his ideas out there. <br> It wrote, "Is it courageous to propose tax cuts but not identify a single tax expenditure to rein in? Is it courageous to target your deepest cuts on the poorest Americans, who vote in lower numbers and provide little in campaign contributions? Is it courageous to camouflage hundreds of billions in cuts for the poor and disadvantaged in broad budget categories without identifying the programmatic cuts, so that analysts, journalists, and other policymakers can't identify the specific cuts and assess their impacts?" <br> Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, we have a real sign of the End Times: Senate Democrats have actually come out with a budget for the first time since the iPad was invented. There are children in school, reading, who were born since their last budget. <br> Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray unveiled it Wednesday. Her budget is as partisan as Ryan's and offers little common ground with his on controversial issues. It calls for $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction through the end of the decade, almost $1 trillion of it from new revenues. <br> Ryan calls the divergent plans the beginning of a process. The question is where that process will lead. <br> Early next month, the president will submit the budget he was supposed to have sent to the Hill in February. There it will sit, because it too is just a negotiating ploy, an opening bid. <br> These compilations of charts and data are not budgets at all. They are just props in the Budget Follies of 2013. Not one of the long-term visions sketched out in these plans will actually be realized. There will be no serious discussion or honest debate about enacting meaningful tax reform, rethinking defense spending or remaking our entitlement system for a world in which people generally live longer and in which government resources are stretched. <br> But, frankly, these aren't even the most critical issues we should be addressing. <br> The budget is important. Cutting our deficits matters. But in a country in which corporate profits and the stock market are at record highs but in which jobs are being created far too slowly and median incomes are sagging, we have far more basic issues to grapple with. <br> The United States is like a business whose model for making revenue is failing, trying to save itself by cutting down on travel expenditures and the cost of making photocopies. Sure, we shouldn't overspend. But if we don't figure out what business we're in -- what new industries will create tomorrow's jobs, what kind of new workers we'll need, what kind of infrastructure we must have to be competitive and attract investment -- our deficit problems will seem minor compared with our social and political concerns. <br> Our most important national discussion should not be about spending but about investment. We need to recognize that some federal programs help grow the economy and weigh the return on investment we will get from these and which are essential to growing the new industries that will be the employers of tomorrow ... and will provide the growth that is the only real solution to our debt issues. <br> The Ryan budget cuts transportation spending in a country that has neglected its highways and bridges for over half a century. It doesn't plan for the infrastructure spending we will need to respond to the consequences of climate change (like hurricane relief) or anticipate the investment we could make to avoid such problems in the first place. It doesn't discuss how to expand information technology and next-generation energy infrastructure as we must. <br> Perhaps the Senate budget or the president's will be wiser about investing -- although neither is likely to think big enough about transport spending or an infrastructure bank or, better, a network of regional infrastructure finance institutions. What seems more likely, sadly, is more hollow gestures, scurrying to avoid artificial deadlines and visionless crisis management. Not one leader has emerged in Washington who is providing anything truly different that cuts to the core questions we face or rises to the true challenge of our times. <br> Which leaves us but one consolation. Washington has grown so shrill that most of this empty debate will be heard only by our dogs. Pity the dogs. 
 This, of course, is something completely different. After his re-election, the president was asked about his unusually standoffish behavior with Congress. He took offense. <br> Look at what happened with me and Speaker John Boehner, he said. "When we went out and played golf, we had a great time. But that didn't get a deal done in 2011." And just recently, a senior administration official told me, "There's this myth in Washington that somehow if we all sat down around a table, Republicans would miraculously be more willing to work with us." <br> That's ridiculous, he clearly thought. Just absurd. <br> So now the White House has decided it's not so silly after all. The president had dinner with 12 GOP senators Wednesday. The big question: Why now? <br> There are all kinds of ways to answer that, and I'll get to them in a moment. But let me first say this: Give the president some credit. It's the right thing to do, and he should have done it awhile back. He has nothing to lose, and has never had anything to lose by engaging. And if he is interested in some larger budget deal down the road, this is the only way to figure out if it is at all possible. <br> They're also seeing the president's popularity suffer: It has dropped an average of four points since mid-February. <br> Worse yet, they're seeing that Americans are starting to blame both sides for the Washington standoff. Not long ago, Republicans bore most of the blame. Not anymore. <br> The administration's strategy hasn't worked. The White House made the assumption that because it succeeded in getting new revenue during the fiscal cliff negotiations, it would be able to do so again. After all, that's what the 2012 election was about: the middle class versus tax cuts for the wealthy. The argument worked and Republicans caved on the fiscal cliff, so they would cave again. <br> Just the reverse has happened. The GOP cut a deal in January that included tax increases without commensurate spending cuts. No doubt it was a short-term tactical success for the White House, fresh off its impressive re-election. But in the long run, it could turn out to be a strategic mistake. Why? Because Republicans are now more dug in than ever on taxes -- at least without tax reform or serious entitlement cuts. <br> It's not without irony that the Democratic win on the fiscal cliff narrowed its chances to get a deal on the forced spending cuts. The deal didn't happen. And the public didn't buy the Armageddon scenario. So the once unthinkable cuts are now real, and the public isn't predicting the end of the world. <br> All of which gets us back to the White House dinner party. Having failed to secure a short-term truce, maybe the White House is finally thinking big picture. The public doesn't like the military cuts; neither do lots of Republicans, including McCain. Maybe that's the entry into a larger discussion: How can we do this without damaging our military? <br> The pieces are all there: Graham has already told CNN he would be open to increasing revenues if the administration is willing to do serious entitlement reform. Other senior Republicans have said there's a window this summer to get something done. The president is trying to protect the rest of his agenda -- immigration reform, climate change, gun control -- from falling victim to the budget wars. <br> So even if this is a cynical and calculated dinner hosted by a president in danger of losing political altitude, I'll take it. Even if the president is doing it to prove it won't work, I'll take it. It's not the Last Supper, but it is the first. 
 Among Republican insiders, Bob McDonnell, governor of Virginia, isn't considered a leading presidential contender. Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan and Rand Paul have all garnered more attention. The more interesting question has been -- until this week, at least -- why that is the case. <br> Moreover, McDonnell's 2009 campaign was in many respects an excellent template for a national GOP campaign, as it focused on job creation and energy development while largely avoiding ideological bromides. <br> Part of the reason McDonnell was able to run as jobs-centric pragmatist is that his socially conservative convictions were not in serious dispute. Indeed, Democrats in 2009 sought to highlight McDonnell's anti-abortion views, but to no avail. Just one year after Barack Obama had rallied moderate voters in Virginia's affluent northern counties, McDonnell managed to win many of them back. He aggressively courted Asian-American and Latino voters, an effort that helped blunt the growing Democratic advantage in these constituencies. One would think Republicans would be beating down McDonnell's door. <br> But recently, many conservative activists have soured on McDonnell. For much of 2012, the Virginia governor has struggled to make progress on his policy agenda. Progress in some areas, like K-12 education, has been overshadowed by inaction in others, like the privatization of Virginia's state-owned liquor stores or the all-important issue of alleviating traffic congestion. <br> Last week, however, McDonnell finally brokered a deal with the Virginia General Assembly to finance a sharp increase in new transportation spending with new taxes. This is despite the fact that McDonnell had pledged to resist any and all tax increases in his 2009 campaign. <br> Not everyone is furious about McDonnell's measure that would increase taxes. Some prominent voices, including Washington Post conservative commentator Jennifer Rubin and Washington Post columnist Robert McCartney, have praised the governor for addressing Virginia's transportation woes. One wonders whether McDonnell might somehow be able to turn a liability -- having reneged on his tax pledge -- into a strength by presenting himself as a pragmatic, bipartisan problem-solver. <br> It's a long shot, given that primaries tend to be dominated by highly ideological voters. But it might be worth a shot all the same, particularly if the Republican presidential field proves thinner than expected in 2016. 
 So let's try to recount why we are where we are. In August 2011, Washington was trying to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling -- so the US might continue to pay its bills -- when a stunt was hatched: Kick the can down the road. <br> And not only kick it down the road, but do it in a way that would eventually force Washington to do its job: Invent a punishment. <br> If the politicians failed to come up with some kind of budget deal, the blunt instrument of across-the-board cuts in every area would await. <br> Unthinkable! Untenable! <br> Until now. <br> In fact, something designed to be worse than any conceivable agreement is now completely acceptable to many. <br> And not only are these forced budget cuts considered acceptable, they're even applauded. Some Republicans figure they'll never find a way to get 5% across-the-board domestic spending cuts like this again, so go for it. And some liberal Democrats likewise say 8% cuts in military spending are better than anything we might get on our own, so go for it. <br> The result: A draconian plan designed to force the two sides to get together has now turned out to be too weak to do that. <br> And what does that tell us? More about the collapse of the political process than it does about the merits of any budget cuts. Official Washington has completely abdicated responsibility, taking its dysfunction to a new level -- which is really saying something. <br> We've learned since the election that the second-term president is feeling chipper. With re-election came the power to force Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy in the fiscal cliff negotiations, and good for him. Americans voted, and said that's what they wanted, and so it happened. Even the most sullen Republicans knew that tax fight had been lost. <br> Points on the board for the White House. <br> Now the evil "sequester" -- the forced budget cuts -- looms. And the president proposes what he calls a "balanced" approach: closing tax loopholes on the rich and budget cuts. It's something he knows Republicans will never go for. They raised taxes six weeks ago, and they're not going to do it again now. They already gave at the office. And Republicans also say, with some merit, that taxes were never meant to be a part of the discussion of across-the-board cuts. It's about spending. <br> Here's the problem: The election is over. Obama won, and he doesn't really have to keep telling us -- or showing us, via staged campaign-style events like the one Tuesday in which he used police officers as props while he opposed the forced spending cuts. <br> What we're waiting for is the plan to translate victory into effective governance. <br> Sure, there's no doubt the president has the upper hand. He's right to believe that GOP calls for austerity do not constitute a cohesive party platform. He knows that the GOP has no singular, effective leader, and that its message is unformed. And he's probably hoping that the next two years can be used effectively to further undermine the GOP and win back a Democratic majority in the House. <br> Slight problem: There's plenty of real work to be done, on the budget, on tax reform, on immigration, climate change and guns. A second-term president has a small window of opportunity. And a presidential legacy is not something that can be kicked down the road. 
 This week the president faced the American people to talk about, among other things, the budget. He said the right things. During his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, he drew a link between responsible fiscal policy and the important issues of jobs, the middle class and economic growth. He emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility. <br> He acknowledged that compromise will have to drive negotiations and that no one will see a deal come together exactly as they would choose. But when it comes to specifics, the president continues to take the easy way out, instead of using the platform that he alone has to help the country understand both what's at stake and what it will take. It's relatively easy to talk about things like scaling back tax loopholes for corporations and the well-off, asking the rich to pay more as part of Medicare, and providing fewer subsidies to drug companies. But it will take more than that. <br> Instead of just replacing or retooling the blunt sequester, we do need to find savings from defense. We also need to put Social Security on a path toward solvency and the sooner we do it the better. We should protect those who depend on the program, and running from the financial imbalances it faces does just the opposite. <br> The bottom line is deficit reduction is difficult, the president knows that, and he should start an honest dialogue with the American public about what it will take to help move the issue forward. <br> The emphasis he put on the issue this week was encouraging, but the proof will be in how he leads going forward. In recent fiscal negotiations, we have been locked in a game of you go first, no you go first between the two parties when it comes to how they would get specific on entitlement and tax reform. The risk is that both will find it too politically convenient to hide behind the easy pieces of taxing the rich and discretionary spending caps--both of which have been enacted, and neither of which are sufficient to fix the problem—instead of focusing on the real issues of entitlement and tax reform. <br> Only the president can start this honest dialogue. If he steps forward and starts putting real specifics on the table for some of the hard choices and uses his platform to explain to the country why it is so important not to duck from these issues as we work to get the economy back on track, his speech will have been a great start to a serious effort. Otherwise, it will be just a lot of empty words. 
 CNN asked for views on President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night, which was dominated by domestic issues such as the economy and need to reinvigorate the middle class, gun control, minimum wage, early education and immigration. Afterward, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida delivered the Republican response. <br> After Barack Obama's speech and Marco Rubio's rebuttal, we should have heard from Kim Peters. <br> The 47-year-old single mother, who has been more or less unemployed since the start of the Great Recession, wore fuzzy Shrek slippers as she watched the president's State of the Union address Tuesday night from the middle of an empty living room south of Atlanta. <br> You would think that in the shadow of a general election dubbed "Year of the Woman," the last thing any Republican in Washington would want to do is tick off women. <br> And while the Violence Against Women Act passed in the Senate by a healthy bipartisan majority a few hours before President Obama's State of the Union address, the fact that 22 senators -- all Republicans, all men -- voted against it should be troubling to GOP leaders. <br> And perhaps the most troubling aspect of that is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the so-called savior of the Republican Party, was one of those Republican men. <br> As exasperated appeals for an obstructionist Congress to get off its duff, the exhortations provided emotional catnip for Democrats. For the rest of us, however, they were sobering reminders of what governing liberalism has deteriorated into: content-free calls to take action for action's sake. <br> It is sometimes said of a great actor that he could hold an audience spellbound while reading a laundry list. This is essentially what President Obama tried to do on Tuesday night. As State of the Union addresses go, his was artless. It lacked inspired phrases or compelling narrative. Save for the energy he gave it at key moments, it was pedestrian. <br> It was also very important. <br> Sen. Marco Rubio was ready for his close-up, and he got it. Now you know what all the fuss is about. <br> Rubio, a rising star and possible 2016 GOP presidential hopeful, was picked to deliver the official Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union sddress. <br> The hallmark of the 2013 State of the Union address was progressive pragmatism. <br> Time and again, President Obama punctuated his proposals with the refrain: "We should be able to get that done." After his call for "bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit," he said: "We can get this done," and later, "That's what we can do together." <br> President Obama's State of the Union address predictably focused on his domestic priorities. <br> As in years past, foreign policy made up only about 15% of the speech, but even within that usual limited attention, Tuesday night's address pointed to few new directions. <br> "To report the state of the union." Within the first few seconds of President Barack Obama's address Tuesday night, he quoted the late President John F. Kennedy, who 51 years ago used those words to describe a president's annual duty. <br> As Obama spoke, citizens around the country were tapping away at keyboards, posting and sending messages -- public and private -- characterizing their own view of how the union, and its president, are faring. 
 Time and again, President Obama punctuated his proposals with the refrain: "We should be able to get that done." After his call for "bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit," he said: "We can get this done," and later, "That's what we can do together." <br> When he proposed the addition of three more urban manufacturing hubs and asked Congress "to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America," he added: "We can get that done." <br> When he described his new "Fix-It First" program and a Partnership to Rebuild America to put people to work on our most urgent infrastructure repairs and to attract private capital to the cause, he said, "Let's prove there's no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let's start right away. We can get this done." <br> In other places, such as his appeal for comprehensive immigration reform, the president exhorted the nation: "let's get it done." <br> But his repeated insistence on what we can get done bespoke a step-by-step approach to solving the nation's most critical problems, a list not of grand initiatives but of pragmatic steps to make concrete progress. <br> At the same time, he was holding a mirror to Congress, reminding them of the disgrace they bring upon themselves in the eyes of the nation and the world when they fail to get these eminently reasonable and doable things done. <br> Obama's approach to foreign policy was much in the same vein. Instead of calling for the completion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, which has been stalled for decades, he announced his intent to complete negotiations on a "Trans-Pacific partnership" with a limited number of North American and Asian nations and to "launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union." <br> He justified both initiatives in terms of creating "good-paying American jobs." The focus on the Atlantic was actually the most novel and striking of his foreign policy proposals, given the administration's widely heralded "pivot to Asia." But he chose to play down any fanfare and instead present the clear pragmatic case for expanding trade in both directions. <br> Similarly, instead of talking about his commitment to "Global Zero," a vision of a world without nuclear weapons that he committed to in his first inaugural address and his Prague speech in April 2010, he again focused on a set of smaller steps. <br> "We'll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands." He also reiterated his administration's commitment to prevent Iran from "getting a nuclear weapon," but focused on achieving a "diplomatic solution." No grand doctrines, no global visions, just a list of concrete, doable steps. <br> That is the context in which we should understand the most powerful and passionate part of his speech: His insistence that all the victims of gun violence, from Gabrielle Giffords to the children of Newtown to the moviegoers of Aurora, "deserve a vote." His point was to cut out the political grandstanding, the filibustering, the huffing and puffing and bluffing. Bring it to the floor. Stand up and be counted. Vote it up or down. <br> That is how government is supposed to work. Make a proposal. Assemble a coalition. Put it before the country's elected representatives. And vote. <br> President Obama was daring Congress, and the country, to get to work and get it done. 
 "What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick it any further. ... We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else's." <br> So said President-elect Barack Obama at a Washington Post editorial board meeting in January 2009, just days before taking his first oath of office. He was talking about the importance of dealing with the long-term deficit and debt. <br> The rhetoric hasn't met the record -- debt has exploded under Obama's watch. Reasonable people can forgive the president for expenses incurred while confronting the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression -- and, let's be honest, alternative paths of austerity have not worked that well across the Atlantic. But now is the time to get serious about reigning in our long-term debt, which now exceeds an unsustainable 70% of gross domestic product. <br> At this moment of maximum political capital, Obama is perfectly positioned to act on his original impulse in the State of the Union on Tuesday night. <br> But there is a dangerous bit of hubris sweeping the Democratic Party, which says that dealing with deficits and debt is a sucker's bet, best left to the next Republican president. <br> This would be a major mistake and a costly lost opportunity. <br> With an eye toward his legacy, Obama should follow his original instincts and put the power of presidency behind a balanced long-term plan to deal with deficits and debt -- including spending cuts, tax reform and, most importantly, entitlement reform. <br> This is the time for Obama to pull a Nixon in China. <br> Just as only a committed anti-communist such as Nixon could establish relations with communist China, Obama is perfectly positioned to do what he knows is necessary to preserve the long-term strength and solvency of the social safety net: Medicare and Social Security. <br> Formula adjustments such as these can save billions of dollars over the next 10 years, keeping these popular programs solvent. Other solutions, such as raising the Social Security payroll tax cap to more than the current income cutoff of $110,000, are worth consideration as part of a package. This is an idea that liberals love because it extends the progressivity of the tax code to the wealthiest Americans. <br> Alternatively, we could means-test Social Security to make sure it serves primarily as a safety net -- or (gasp!) raise the retirement age. When the Bowles-Simpson commission suggested raising the retirement age to 69 in 2075, it was met with howls of outrage from unions in particular. This makes no sense, especially if common-sense exemptions are made for manual labor. <br> Beltway cynics say that the bipartisan deficit and debt reduction plans that are often cited have no chance of passing Congress. When you look at the pathetic support for Bowles-Simpson when it was actually put to a vote in the House last March -- 16 Republicans and 22 Democrats supported it -- you see why cynicism is always a safe bet in Washington. <br> Of course the devil is in the details, and politicos will point out that when confronted with tough medicine to deal with deficits and debt, even alleged tea party supporters balk (hence the classic "Government Get Your Hands Off My Medicare!" sign that I saw at one 2009 rally). <br> But strengthening America to remain competitive in the 21st century will require getting our long-term debt under control along with other important but less poll-prioritized policies such as comprehensive immigration reform and a public-private infrastructure bank to fund nation-building "here at home." <br> The State of the Union is a chance for the president to put forward a balanced bipartisan solution that contrasts with radical conservatives who believe that increased tax revenues from closed tax loopholes can't be part of a big deal to bring down our debt. Wall Street lawyers will fight to protect every loophole they embedded in our tax code, but their argument doesn't begin to make sense to people on Main Street. <br> Obama will probably point out Tuesday night that economic growth is the essential X Factor to reducing long-term deficits and debt. On this point at least, he and some conservatives might agree. But dumb meat cleaver cuts such as the looming sequestration could push our economy back into recession. <br> That's why a smart balanced alternative plan is necessary. But it will require presidential leadership and putting some Democratic sacred cows on the table. <br> This doesn't just make practical sense in a divided government (a reality some Democrats seem to forget) -- it makes compelling political sense as well. By seizing the mantle of fiscal responsibility -- in contrast to fiscal conservatism -- Obama will build on his post-election bump among centrists and some independents. <br> The more Machiavellian Democrats might argue that this outreach could only serve to isolate Republicans more. Nonpartisan strategists might argue that this approach would drive a wedge between reasonable Republicans and the House radicals. <br> But the real reason for Obama to address the need to reduce long-term deficits and debt directly is because it's the right thing to do for our country -- and he is uniquely positioned to achieve it. Just as Nixon could go to China, a Southern Democrat such as Lyndon Johnson was needed to pass civil rights legislation and Bill Clinton was able to sign welfare reform after decades of Republicans talking about it, Obama can put our country on a balanced path of long-term economic growth and fiscal responsibility. <br> Bottom line: Obama has the political opportunity, but does he have the political will? We'll all find out in real time if he decides to lead on this issue or just be the latest in a long line to kick the can further down the road. 
 Phil Mickelson, aka Lefty, is thinking of leaving California and perhaps America because, according to his own reckoning, he is facing tax rates of 62% or 63%. Mickelson, probably the second-most-famous professional golfer in the world after Tiger Woods, later backed off from his initial comments about making "drastic changes." <br> It does bear noting that Mickelson is doing something to earn his $60 million. Whoever is paying him that much believes that he is worth it. Who are we, really, to argue? <br> But that is not the problem in the story. Lefty faces such seemingly inescapably high tax rates that he might just pack up his golf bags and leave home. Mitt pays so little tax that he has to ignore the law to pay a higher rate for appearance's sake. <br> How can this be? <br> The Mitt-Lefty paradox has a simple explanation: In America, we tax work. And highly. We do not tax capital or wealth much at all. Indeed, if you have wealth already, taxes are essentially optional under what I call tax Planning 101, the simple advice to buy/borrow/die. <br> In step one, you buy assets that rise in value without producing cash, such as growth stocks or real estate. In step two, you borrow to finance your lifestyle. In step three, you die, and your heirs get your assets, tax free, and with a "stepped up" basis that eliminates all capital gains. That's it. <br> Romney, with a personal fortune estimated at $250 million (his five kids have another $100 million) has figured this out. When he pays taxes, at all, he does so at the low capital gains rate. <br> Not so with Lefty. <br> It's a "poverty trap" that works just like the severe marriage penalties for the lower-income classes. But the working poor do not have the options of going to Canada, Russia or France. <br> Lefty has a point -- high tax rates create disincentives. If the rates are high enough, people react by moving. This should not surprise us: American companies have been fleeing our shores for years, in droves. Ask Mitt. <br> But this should worry us, for two reasons. <br> One, the fact that the high incomers do flee jurisdictions, or flee from the productive activity of working, is a bad thing for the U.S. <br> Two, the very risk that the rich and famous might leave, aided by the appearance that some do, holds tax reform hostage. We have struggled to raise rates at all on the rich, blocked by the mostly mythical Joe the Plumber as much as by the realities of Mickelson or the Rolling Stones. When we do finally raise rates, as we did at the fiscal cliff, we do so on the wrong rich, in the wrong way. Lefty's taxes went up, Mitt's need not. <br> The problem -- and it is the same problem as with Mitt's taxes -- is that we are taxing the wrong thing, in the wrong way. In sum, we tax work, not wealth. This is backward. <br> We should be taxing the act of spending, not the socially beneficial ones of work and savings. Then we could raise tax rates without fear of ill effects. <br> Mitt's taxes would go up, for he is surely spending more than $14 million a year, as by running for president, and we wouldn't need any special capital gains preference under a consistent spending tax. Lefty's taxes would go down to the extent he saves some of his $60 million, helping us all by working and saving. When and if Mickelson or his kids spend, we could tax him or them then. <br> And if Lefty is really insisting on both earning and spending $60 million a year? Well, I figure he can buy a lot of borscht in Russia with that. 
 Who is Grover Norquist? He's a private citizen, a conservative lobbyist, the author of the Taxpayer's Protection Pledge and president of Americans for Tax Reform. His idea of tax reform is no more tax increases ever again. And no closed loopholes unless matched by cuts in government spending. <br> Norquist says the pledge was made to the American people. But Norquist is the sole enforcer of the pledge, which he keeps in a fireproof safe in his office. No one has dared to challenge his self-appointed role as enforcer on behalf of American voters. Until this past week. <br> These declarations from Republican leaders are like political dynamite. And like well-placed dynamite, they might begin to break the logjam preventing effective leadership and legislation in Congress. <br> Norquist, of course, doesn't think so. <br> King replied that Norquist was "being a lowlife," words that caused almost an audible gasp among Republicans. You see, Norquist's pledge isn't about money; it's about loyalty. <br> Next to Mitch McConnell's pledge to defeat Obama in 2012, Grover Norquist is the man most responsible for Republican lockstep voting and gridlock in Washington. <br> That top Republicans are willing to openly defy Norquist's pledge and that any are willing to buck McConnell and Boehner are seminal events in recent American history. It means some Republican office holders are actually listening to what the voters said in the 2012 elections: Help the middle class, work together, stop the finger-pointing. <br> But McConnell and his collaborators are proceeding as if the 2012 election never happened. He and other Republican "leaders" apparently intend to extend the Republican campaign, disregarding the election and the people's mandate. They intend to push the Republican agenda that voters overwhelmingly rejected at the voting booth and in post-election polls. <br> Boehner claims that Congress received its own mandate. But Republicans lost seats in the House and the Senate that they had expected to win. Besides, as Harry Truman used to say, "The president is the only elected official who represents all the people." <br> The Peter Kings, Lindsey Grahams and Tom Coles of the Republican Party get it. There aren't enough cuts to offset $1 trillion in lost taxes from the excessive tax breaks the wealthy were given. The alternative is to harm our national security, weaken our defenses and cause some Americans to literally go without food. The Republican budget that passed the House, but not the Senate, before the election would cut food stamps as excess spending for unemployed parents. <br> Extending the lesser tax breaks for 98% of all Americans is, indeed, a first order of business. Or as Cole said, "It's the right thing to do." <br> There is money for these things. First, though, Republicans must break Norquist's insane hold on their party. More Republicans must put their country before someone else's agenda, and their Pledge of Allegiance before "The Pledge" to Norquist. 
 Fewer and fewer Republicans, thankfully. <br> Add Southern Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Lindsey Graham to the growing list, along with Reps. Peter King, Steve LaTourette and Scott Rigell. <br> Chambliss kicked off the most recent outbreak of common sense by telling a Georgia TV station, "I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge." He added, "If we do it (Norquist's) way, then we'll continue in debt." <br> On ABC's "This Week," Graham doubled down by saying, "I agree with Grover, we shouldn't raise rates, but I think Grover is wrong when it comes to we can't cap deductions and buy down debt. ... I will violate the pledge, long story short, for the good of the country, only if Democrats will do entitlement reform." <br> King agreed with Chambliss on NBC's "Meet the Press," saying, "A pledge you signed 20 years ago, 18 years ago, is for that Congress. ... For instance, if I were in Congress in 1941, I would have signed a declaration of war against Japan. I'm not going to attack Japan today. The world has changed, and the economic situation is different." <br> This post-election outbreak of pragmatism is welcome and needed. These senators and congressmen are profiles in courage for speaking out against the stranglehold that one self-appointed activist and lobbyist has had on bipartisan governing. <br> The signature item for Americans for Tax Reform is a pledge that commits signers to oppose any tax increases at all, for all time -- not just tax rate increases, but any increases in tax revenue. <br> This distinction makes a real difference in the current deficit and debt deal negotiations. Going back to the Bowles-Simpson Commission, the obvious common ground for negotiations has been for Democrats to compromise on spending cuts and entitlement reform and Republicans to compromise on increased tax revenue. This can be done -- as the Bowles-Simpson Commission demonstrated -- by potentially even lowering some tax rates but closing loopholes to raise revenue. This is what's known as a win-win. <br> The biggest stumbling block for tea party conservatives has been Norquist, who says any new revenue violates the pledge and promises to invite a primary challenge to any member of Congress who puts revenues on the table. Given the number of safe seats carved up in the rigged system of redistricting, a primary challenge from the wings is what most members of Congress fear most. The result is gridlock: an inability to reason together and make a long-term deal for the good of the country. <br> It is an ironic problem in some ways: Tea party congressmen rose to power on a promise to deal with deficits and debt. Putting anti-tax absolutism ahead of that goal may play well with special interests, but it undercuts the ability to govern in the national interest. That's what is at stake. <br> These pronouncements from Chambliss, Graham Co. put them in the company of party leaders like John Boehner, John McCain and Jeb Bush, who have publicly dismissed the pledge as a distraction from the business of governing. <br> This pragmatic statement in the summer of 2012 helped break the fever of groupthink. Norquist called Bush's comments an "insult." <br> Comparing Coburn to Hiss -- a convicted traitor and KGB agent -- was both ugly and revealing: This is what happens when partisan politics starts to look like a cult. <br> The real fault line for Republicans is between Norquist-style radicals and Ronald Reagan, who presided over the bipartisan 1986 tax simplification deal by closing loopholes to raise revenues. As Reagan said at the time, "We're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share." In addition, the "sainted" Reagan oversaw some 11 tax increases during his administration. To be sure, his overall goal was to slash rates and simplify the system -- but he was not nearly as absolutist as his activist acolytes who do not have to deal with actually governing. <br> Norquist's hold on the GOP has been loosening as congressional leaders recognize that this extreme, unelected activist is helping to hold a balanced bipartisan deal hostage. The election is over. The time for hatred, ideological obstruction and overheated rhetoric has passed. Reasonable Republicans and Democrats need to take on their respective special interests to get a long-term deficit and debt deal done. <br> It's foolish to be afraid of Norquist. The only pledge members of Congress should take is the Pledge of Allegiance. 
 In the horse race coverage of political campaigns, we sometimes forget that elections are just exciting preambles to the main event -- governing. <br> Now's the time when the parties return to Washington and try to implement the people's wishes as expressed in the election. And unlike 2008 and 2010, neither party is likely to misinterpret the results as an ideological mandate. <br> This is a good thing. But it's also a mistake to read the election results as simply an endorsement of the status quo. Despite the fact that Americans returned President Barack Obama to office while keeping Democrats in control of the Senate and Republicans in charge of the House, this was no seal of approval on the political division we've seen in Washington for four years. Instead, it was a decided endorsement for balanced bipartisan plans. <br> Obama won the election with a 16-point margin among moderate voters. Republican Senate candidates who represented the ideological extremes of their party -- Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin, specifically -- were soundly rejected even in states that voted for Mitt Romney by double digits. Polarizing voices such as Rep. Allen West were also retired from Congress. The hate and hyper-partisanship that has disfigured our civic debates in recent years was decisively defeated in this election. <br> The broad outlines of a balanced bipartisan plan are well-known -- cut spending, change entitlements and raise revenue. That's the ground defined by the Bowles-Simpson commission, the Gang of Six and the Obama-Boehner grand bargain. <br> In all cases, the problem came to selling such a plan to right-wing Republicans, who refused to consider any revenue increases, as well as left-wing Democrats who don't want to see long-term changes to entitlements. That's why congressional members of the Bowles-Simpson commission such as Paul Ryan on the right and Jan Schakowsky on the left refused to support its recommendations, even while conservative and liberal senators such as Republican Tom Coburn and Democrat Dick Durbin did. <br> But according to the Main Street survey, 54% of Republicans, 50% of Democrats and 49% of swing voters support the Bowles-Simpson plan -- while just 10% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats oppose it. <br> And despite the strenuous opposition by adherents to Grover Norquist's no-tax pledge, 35% of Republicans say they would be more likely to vote for a member of Congress who broke the anti-tax pledge to find a long-term solution to the deficit and debt mess -- while 31% said it would make them less likely. <br> The opportunity and obligation of Obama's second term will be to depolarize the nation and the Congress. That will require leading on issues such as entitlements as part of a balanced plan to deal with the deficit and the debt. <br> It seems possible that with the right bipartisan style and substance, the president can also achieve comprehensive immigration reform and some aspects of his jobs bill, such as a public-private infrastructure bank. <br> Republicans now realize that they cannot antagonize the Hispanic community and win elections. President George W. Bush tried to pass immigration reform co-sponsored by John McCain and Ted Kennedy in the Senate but was defeated by an outcry from the right in 2007. Obama could achieve that elusive goal by picking up that legislation again. <br> Also, the president's jobs bill, composed almost entirely of policies that had bipartisan support in the past, was dead on arrival in the last Congress for reasons little more profound than election-year hyper-partisanship. But with the economy slowly improving and the election over, there is little reason to prolong the painful charade. <br> Ideas such as a public-private infrastructure bank could boost employment while increasing the structural strength of our nation, a clear win-win while the Northeast rebuilds from Superstorm Sandy. Best of all, it can be done with comparatively little cost to taxpayers by simply leveraging government investment with private funds, benefiting private employers rather than creating new bureaucracy. <br> There will be stubborn hyper-partisans who refuse to work in good faith with the other party, pretending that their unwillingness to compromise is political courage. They are the problem in our politics, angry conformists who put partisanship ahead of patriotism and problem-solving. <br> We have urgent problems to confront in our country. We have the capacity to solve them, and we know the broad path forward. What's been missing is the political courage to stand up to the extremes in our own parties and reach across the aisle. That is specifically what voters want to see in our next Congress -- a spirit of constructive compromise and principled problem-solving that defines the common ground on any given issue and then builds on it. <br> This is the time to redeem the promise Obama passionately articulated on Election Night: "We are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and forever will be, the United States of America." 
 When Washington gets back to work, the situation will be difficult. President Obama won a sound re-election victory, doing very well in the Electoral College and winning the popular vote by more than 3 million votes. He trounced Mitt Romney in almost all the battleground states and he will return with a larger and more energized Senate majority. <br> Yet President Obama likely understands that elections don't remake the political system. The parties remain as polarized as ever, and the political process will be as difficult as it has been since the first day he took office. Republicans retained control of the House, where they can make it hard for the president to move his agenda forward and can place immense pressure on him to curtail spending. <br> While Democrats control the Senate, with 54 votes, Republicans control the tools of the Senate minority -- namely the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass any major piece of legislation. Exit polls showed that the public is not satisfied with the status quo, many voters opposed the idea of an activist government to solve problems, and President Obama struggled with some key constituencies, including older and suburban voters. <br> In general, second-term presidents, even those with landslide victories, have trouble with Congress (think of FDR after 1936), and President Obama must spend much of his political capital making sure that existing programs, like the Affordable Health Care Act, are implemented effectively. <br> Despite these challenges, political incentives for both parties could inspire legislative breakthroughs in several areas. President Obama does not have to remain content with the domestic agenda he has already achieved. He could succeed like Ronald Reagan in 1986, when Congress passed, with bipartisan support, a major tax reform bill that closed many loopholes and lowered rates. <br> In the short-term, deficit reduction offers the greatest potential for such a breakthrough. The process toward reducing the deficit will begin even if the president and Congress take no action. <br> The 2011 Deficit Control Act will require $100 billion in spending cuts starting in January. At the same time, the current income tax rates are set to expire on December 31, along with the Social Security payroll tax holiday. By making progress on a "grand bargain" over long-term deficit reduction, one that both parties could live with, President Obama could steal this issue away from the Republicans, positioning himself as the guardian of fiscal discipline just as President Clinton was able to do in the 1990s. <br> There are also policy issues that grow directly out of the election results. President Obama has been promising Latino voters that he would reform immigration policies. He has pledged to renew his push to pass the DREAM Act, a bill that has been stopped by Republicans, which would help almost 1.7 million young immigrants become citizens. <br> The huge Latino vote for the president, which played a critical role in battleground states like Colorado and Nevada, should bolster his resolve to take on this issue. And many Republicans will understand that the GOP's hard-line anti-immigration elements have become extraordinarily costly to the party. For more than a decade, those in the Republican Party who favor liberalized immigration policies, including George W. Bush and much of the business community, have been stymied by their colleagues. <br> Finally, there are long-term issues that might be on the radar as a result of crisis. The storms that have devastated sections of the country have given climate change more attention than ever. The impact on wealthier suburban communities has created more political support for addressing an issue that was largely ignored throughout the 2012 campaign. By producing legislation that deals with this grave problem, such as limits on domestic oil and gas drilling and more investments in solar and wind energy, each party could make progress toward solidifying support in key middle-class constituencies that are still struggling to dig out from the storms. <br> Nothing is inevitable in American politics. The history of Washington is filled with moments when something should have happened but didn't. Politics has a way of sidetracking progress on almost any issue. Talk about compromise that often follows an election is cheap, frequently leading to nothing. <br> The potential for some important breakthroughs, however, is there. The election's outcome gives both parties reasons to make deals with each other so they can each make gains with voters in 2014 and 2016. Sometimes, when politics and policy converge, progress in Washington is possible. 
 The lame duck Congress should depart town quietly and leave the governing to President Obama and the newly elected Congress in January. <br> Tuesday's election results did nothing to change two critical issues. First, the soon-to-be-outgoing 112th Congress has been among the least productive in history. Second, Washington must address the so-called fiscal cliff of expiring tax cuts and hefty automatic across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration. <br> This lame-duck Congress should behave responsibly, play to its strength and once again kick the can down the road. It should try to avoid economic calamity that might result from total inaction, but the heavy lifting must be left to the newly elected 113th Congress. Very little good comes out of post-election lame duck sessions; rather, there are a lot of opportunities for legislative mischief. <br> The current fiscal cliff is quite dangerous. The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts -- those that benefit the well-off and less-well-off -- expire when the ball drops in Times Square. A whole passel of small-bore tax breaks for everything from rum tax rebates for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to NASCAR track expensing -- the so-called extenders package -- awaits extension. At the same time, a "patch" to prevent millions from facing the alternative minimum tax and a routinely extended increase in the Medicare doctor payments will expire. Additionally, there will probably be a need for more disaster relief funding as well as federal flood insurance program borrowing to approve. <br> On January 2, the across-the-board cuts of sequestration kick in, lopping off more than $100 billion in fiscal year 2013 spending in defense and non-defense budgets. After that, the debt ceiling looms. <br> To get everything done, more will have to happen in the last two months of 2012 than was substantively done in the entire 112th Congress to date. And that is precisely why the current members of Congress shouldn't even try. <br> Many in the House and Senate will not be coming back in the 113th Congress. Eighty-six lawmakers are retiring, lost or ran for a different office. They should not be the ones setting policy for future years. <br> For this reason, Congress and the president need to step back and identify the minimum amount of small changes that will enable the nation to retreat from the fiscal cliff and give new policymakers breathing room to enact meaningful changes in 2013. <br> The minimum action would be not simply turning off sequestration but delivering a down payment in one- to two-year savings that delays the onset of cuts rather than some pie in the sky 10-year number that will never happen. <br> The president and Congress should wrestle over taxes, with short-term extensions that set the stage for comprehensive tax reform in the 113th Congress. To that end, alternative minimum tax should be "patched," but with budget offsets. Finally, if FEMA or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers needs extra resources to conduct disaster relief and recovery, that should be considered. <br> What the lame duck Congress should absolutely not be doing is enacting legislation that inhibits future spending and tax reform. <br> This is not the time for a new legislative agenda and parochial projects and programs like a new trillion-dollar farm bill (extend expiring provisions with offsets and repeal permanent agriculture law dating from the 1940s and '50s instead). <br> Lawmakers' shopping lists go on and on, with wasteful changes to water project financing scheduled for a hearing in November and a massive tariff relief package with 2,000 earmarks for parochial interests championed by the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means Committees, and other lawmaker priorities circulating as possible business to address in the lame duck. <br> We don't know what will be stuffed in the last legislative trains leaving the Capitol Hill station. Policymakers had their legislative chances in the past 22 months. Now we need a legislative freeze for the next two months to concentrate on getting the fiscal cliff resolved. <br> Let's give the next Congress a chance to make real progress. 
 Both parties have received an electoral politics wake-up call, courtesy of a diversifying America. <br> President Obama won re-election thanks in part to a 52-percentage-point spread among Latino voters, the nation's fastest-growing electorate, according to election eve polling. <br> In the America coming over the horizon, it is practically impossible to overcome such a number and win the race for president. <br> Even in Florida, with its large, Republican-leaning Cuban population, the Latino Decisions poll found that Latinos overall favored the president 58% to 40%. <br> While these trends worked to Democrats' advantage on the ground on Tuesday, that's not entirely good news: A demographically challenged Republican Party is bad for America. <br> As a nation, we are at our best when both parties work together to address difficult policy issues. And, in the case of immigration -- an issue of great concern to Latinos -- a bipartisan roadmap is good politics and great policy. <br> Bringing the country together around a common-sense immigration process is not a bridge too far. In fact, while partisan politics dominated the national debate, faith, law enforcement and business leaders have worked with immigrant leaders across the political spectrum to forge a new consensus on immigrants and America. <br> Post-election talk will focus on the president's mandate. Immigration is different from other issues because the mandate for reform is clear, and it's not only because of his vote margin among Latinos. <br> "Immigration is the most important thing to focus on if you're concerned about America as an economic power. It's not only good policy to have more immigrants to the United States ... (and) a path forward for those people who are here; it's also good politics." <br> When it comes to crafting a 21st century immigration process, Bibles, badges and business are ready to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reach a consensus. <br> Americans are ready for a just immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect. Our leaders in Washington -- of both parties -- can and must deliver. <br> As we saw Tuesday, their electability may depend on it. 
 Finally, the results are in, and contributors to CNN Opinion weigh in on what they mean: <br> Julian Zelizer: Challenges of second term will be immense <br> President Barack Obama comes away with a victory, but it won't allow him to rest easy. He pulled off the Electoral College votes that he needed, securing wins in states that Republicans once thought to be secure and preserving Democratic strength in other areas. <br> Mitt Romney failed to carry most of the key battleground states that were essential to his victory. The Republican failure to appeal to key constituencies, such as Latinos, has proven to be more costly with each election. <br> But the challenges of Obama's second term will be immense. Polls show that the electorate is unhappy. The House will remain under the control of Republicans, and Romney ran a competitive race. This is not what any incumbent hopes for, especially with a Washington that is so gridlocked. Presidents want a commanding victory, hoping for another 1936, 1964 or 1984. <br> Obama will quickly need to find areas of possible compromise on issues such as deficit reduction and immigration reform, where Republicans may see an incentive to negotiate. This is what Ronald Reagan did with tax reform in 1986. <br> Such breakthroughs have the potential to steal some of the thunder from the GOP, even if they anger members of the president's own party, allowing him to enjoy some policy victories that will strengthen his historical legacy. <br> Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and the new book "Governing America." <br> Paul Begala: Obama overcomes the odds <br> It is hard in the moment to find the proper perspective for President Barack Obama's re-election. Political strategists like me fall back on the strategic and the tactical: This ad worked, that debate performance soared, that state's get-out-the-vote effort failed. Such analysis is inadequate to the task. <br> Obama's 2012 re-election was infinitely more difficult than his first historic election. With a stagnant economy, a bitterly determined and zealous opposition, and the risk of sagging enthusiasm among his true believers, the odds against the president were nearly insurmountable. The economy alone would have sunk nearly any other politician. But Obama has always beaten the odds. <br> The president kept his party united and avoided a primary challenge, Job One for any incumbent. He assembled a remarkable team, from the high command in Chicago to the farms of Iowa and the factories of Ohio. He even reached out to his golden-tongued predecessor and a raspy-voiced rocker: Elvis and the Boss. His funny, feisty, fiery vice president was an underrated asset. And so was first lady who never stooped to the level of the critics and awes all of us who struggle to raise good kids in tough times. <br> The Republicans have a lot of soul-searching to do. But for now, let me congratulate our president and his brilliant team for a victory that was as hard-fought as it is well-deserved. <br> Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, is senior adviser to Priorities USA Action, the biggest super PAC favoring President Barack Obama's re-election. Begala was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. <br> Anne-Marie Slaughter: Good news for rest of world <br> Obama's re-election was good news for the world. And judging by the congratulations and jubilation coming in on my Twitter feed from all over the globe, the world knows it. Aziz, my Moroccan hairdresser, told me Wednesday morning that his entire family (proud new members of Morocco's emerging middle class) was as jubilant as his neighbors in New Jersey. <br> The most important implication of Obama's victory, at least in the short term, is continuity. Given the fragility of the global economy and the number of ongoing crises and conflicts, this is no time for a sharp change in America's course. <br> Change is coming in China, Japan and undoubtedly a number of European countries as part of the fallout from the euro crisis; governments are new or in transition across the Middle East and North Africa; speculation continues about the health of Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Erdogan. A steady hand at the helm in the White House will be more important than ever over the next four years. <br> Equally important, a newly elected Obama will be in a position to do a number of things that the world badly needs. <br> First is to get serious about the U.S. approach to climate change. The combination of his re-election, the devastation inflicted by Hurricane Sandy and the dawning awareness among even very resistant Americans that weather patterns really are matching climate scientists' predictions, and the possibility of raising much needed revenue from a carbon tax or cap-and-trade schemes all augur well for serious federal legislation at last. <br> Next is immigration reform, which was on Obama's 2008 agenda but now must come to a head. Republicans staring at U.S. demographic changes over the coming decades, changes that were already visible in this election, would be suicidal to block it. <br> Finally, the president will return to his global zero agenda, working decisively to put the world onto a clear path toward a future without nuclear weapons. <br> Countless additional issues, crises and conflicts await the president and his new foreign policy team. But for today, Obama's campaign slogan has actually won the day -- forward. <br> William Bennett: Four more years of the status quo <br> The American people have chosen, and they chose, rather than change, four more years of the status quo -- Barack Obama as president, a Democrat-controlled Senate and a Republican-led House. <br> The result is surprising. Many, including me, thought the country was tired of the last four years of partisan gridlock, economic malaise and mounting debt and would pitch back to the right. <br> That did not happen. However, fewer Americans supported the president this election than in 2008. According to the latest tallies, Mitt Romney was behind in Florida, and lost Ohio, Virginia and Colorado by fewer than 400,000 votes for the four states combined.  <br> But a narrow loss is still a loss, and the results tell us several things. First, it is incredibly difficult to beat an incumbent, especially after a brutal and costly primary fight. Second, it appears that Obama's negative advertisement blitzkrieg over the summer defined Romney in a way he could not overcome. Third, if the economy was the key issue in the election, which the exit polls indicate, then clearly voters blame Republicans and George W. Bush for the state of the economy more than Obama. <br> But perhaps the biggest takeaway from this election is the state of American culture. A majority of Americans reaffirmed Obamacare, Obama's foreign policy, high unemployment, bigger government and more dependency on government services. There is an alternative, but people must learn what it is. <br> For this we can point only to the education system and character-forming institutions. So while Republicans must broaden their coalition to include minorities and young adults, which they can do with future leaders such as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, it is more important and consequential that they fight to take back schools, families, communities and the culture because those institutions cross all demographic barriers. <br> Republicans can no longer be the party of only business and individualism. Otherwise, they will be grasping for a shrinking, narrowing electorate and coming up short again in future elections. <br> William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of "The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood." He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush. <br> Donna Brazile: A mandate to move America forward <br> Does President Barack Obama's impressive victory give him a "mandate?" That he won re-election itself seems to be a sufficient answer; how he won doesn't matter. Those who say, "yes, but..." are carping. An election victory is what you make of it. <br> Overwhelming results occur only once in a presidency: FDR's second term, LBJ in '64, Reagan's second term. One could argue that Obama '08 was such a landslide. Landslides require three elements: an extraordinarily charismatic leader on one side, a non-consequential candidate on the other and historical circumstances that overshadow the common political dialogue. <br> Besides, the last three "mandates" -- or "landslides" -- happened before the advent of the Internet, the unfettering of corporate money in politics and the removal of the Fairness Doctrine, which required a measure of real balance in reporting. <br> What constitutes a "mandate," anyway? By any standard, Obama's re-election was not only convincing, but also significant. This election was a test of the truth as no other -- keeping track of Mitt Romney's misleading statements was head-spinning. It was also a test of patience and investment -- hallmarks of Obama's first four years. There will be much more to say about the nature of the president's leadership, his style, in the weeks to come. <br> After all, Obama's campaign went negative, too. But a look at how Obama won tells us he indeed has a mandate. Obama won Latinos, blacks, the young, and especially single women (unmarried, divorced or widowed) by overwhelming, historic proportions. He lost the white male vote, but not by a degree greater than one should have expected, given the candidates and the electorate. <br> His mandate, then, is to continue -- to "forward" -- the policies that support diversity, inclusiveness, empowerment, choice and opportunity (we are the "land of opportunity"). His mandate is also to find a way through the right-wing noise machine and reach the middle-aged and elderly whites who see an economy shifting and a country growing in unfamiliar ways and are scared they will be left behind or lose out. <br> Obama indeed has a mandate: to move our country once again toward that "more perfect union." That is the best way forward. <br> Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of "Cooking With Grease." She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000. <br> Bob Greene: As one campaign ends, others begin </strong> <br> And so begins campaign 2016. <br> Those words are intended not as satire or as whimsy. The purported finish line represented by Tuesday's re-election of Barack Obama is someone else's starting line. The phrase "permanent campaign" has evolved from winking hyperbole to irrefutable reality. Presidents come and presidents go; the never-ending campaign endures. <br> The demise of the long 2012 presidential race is replaced by the instantaneous birth of new ambitions in each major party, even as the candidate who came up short (Mitt Romney, this year) is beginning to grieve for what might have been. <br> There are people and entities -- partisan websites all along the ideological continuum, news-oriented television channels, radio talk shows, campaign strategists-for-hire, political consultants, pollsters -- whose livelihoods depend on the presidential contest that never ceases. To them, Election Day itself is little more than a signpost along the road and certainly no reason to slow down. <br> The public may have grown weary of this year's politics, but the professionals are already picking sides and players for the next one. Governing can be dreary; campaigning always promises exhilaration. Legislators doing their jobs seldom hear the cheers that are the soundtrack of the campaign trail. And there will forever be an audience; people, whatever their protestations, like to watch a fight. <br> So, even as the newspapers Wednesday morning, with their banner headlines, declare that President Obama is heading back to the White House for the next four years, other men and women are hearing a proclamation that, although literally silent, is to their ears as distinct and loud as a blaring announcement over the public-address system in some vast sports stadium: <br> "Will the runners please report to the starting blocks. . . ." <br> Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Obama should thank Latinos <br> If President Barack Obama wants to thank one group of voters for holding the line -- especially in the critical battleground states of Colorado, Florida and Nevada -- he should say "muchas gracias." <br> According to exit polls, Obama won an impressive 71% of the Latino vote. In many states, the percentage was higher. <br> Romney couldn't keep up. Having joked at a campaign fund-raiser that he should have been born Latino so he'd have a smoother path to the White House, even that kind of transformation might not have been enough to have done the trick. <br> Now Latinos have a marker. And Latino activists were quick to make clear how they expect to have it paid. They want Obama to do what he didn't try very hard to do in his first term: deliver immigration reform. <br> Eliseo Medina, a Latino union leader, cut to the chase. "As we congratulate President Obama for winning re-election," Medina said in a statement, "we also send him and the new Congress a message: 'We expect passage of comprehensive immigration reform next year. We don't want promises; we don't want debates. We expect action.' " <br> Good luck with that. <br> The presidency didn't change hands in this election. Nor was there any change in the political reality that has kept immigration reform on the back burner all these years. <br> Latinos need to keep the heat on and demand what they have coming. <br> LZ Granderson: Romney, in the end, had no anchor <br> Some Republicans are going to try to sum up President Barack Obama's re-election this way: black people. Mitt Romney lost because all of the black people voted for Obama. I heard it in 2008 and heard it repeatedly this year. I sum up the president's victory this way: Michigan, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. <br> Just as I felt Al Gore was undone by not winning his home state of Tennessee, Romney was defeated because the man didn't win three states to which he is supposedly connected. Not the state where he was born and raised. Not the state where he's lived and served as governor. Not even the state where he kicked off his campaign. <br> There is something to be said about a politician who has no place to call his political home, no core constituency. And when you think about it, Romney being defeated in this fashion makes all the sense in the world. With his cynically shifting positions, he'd been accused of having no moral anchor, and he lost every state that was supposed to be his physical anchor. Adding insult to injury, his running mate, Paul Ryan, didn't win his home state either. <br> Republicans of the bitter variety -- the kind who like to deface Obama campaign signs with racial epithets -- can say Romney lost because of blacks. But the truth is, when the voters who know you best don't support you, it should come as no surprise when strangers don't either. <br> Maria Cardona: GOP must turn attention to Latinos <br> America makes history yet again by re-electing the first African-American president after a hard-fought and often nasty campaign. So much will be debated from here on out about what happened to Mitt Romney, where he went wrong, and where he goes from here. Now will be a time for soul-searching for my Republican friends about the direction of their party and how they talk to women, young people and minorities. Especially Latinos. And for President Barack Obama, it will be a time to map a path to deliver on the promises he made to the coalition of voters who gave him a second term. Especially Latinos. <br> I have written many times about the power of the Latino vote and how it would be decisive in this election. And the question I would always get is: Will they come out to vote? They did. In fact, I suspect that the Latino demographic will be central in many Republican conversations about where they are going wrong as a party. <br> It is not as though Mitt Romney didn't know the challenge that faced him with Latinos: Some very smart people in his own party continually said that the GOP and Romney needed to take a different path when it came to Latinos. Romney showed no interest in doing so, and it seemed clear that he had written off the Latino vote early on. Instead, this would have been the time and place to employ his shape-shifting ways to woo them. <br> The numbers don't lie. Neither do demographics. The country has changed, and Republicans had better change with it or risk being in the minority for their own lack of minorities. <br> Obama, for his part, will need to work with and for the coalition of Latinos, women, young people and African-Americans that held together for him. He must deliver on the issues they care about, which are the issues he has talked about throughout the campaign and that will be a big part of his second term. <br> He will also need to find willing Republicans interested in working with him to solve the nation's greatest problems, among them, the need for comprehensive immigration reform. This moment of necessary GOP introspection and attention from Obama to solve the immigration issue may present the perfect storm needed to actually get something done. 
 Finding our footing in the new Arab world <br> Obviously this election was about the economy first, second and third. But the world intrudes. Our election campaign did not keep terrorists from killing American diplomats in Benghazi, nor did it stop the violence in Syria. When all the ballots are counted and the parks swept clean of the debris from election night rallies, President Obama will have to figure out what is happening in this very volatile part of the world and what, if anything, we do about it. <br> We intervened in Libya to get rid of an awful dictator, but so far we have not intervened to get rid of the awful dictator in Syria. As the violence escalates and the Syrian president wreaks ever more death and destruction on his people, will we be drawn into an intervention there too? After 9/11 we went to war with Iraq over a mistaken fear of nuclear weapons. Is Iran developing nuclear weapons or are we wrong to be concerned? Will we go to war with Iran too? <br> Preventing the fiscal cliff <br> While President Obama has been crisscrossing the country looking for votes, the people left behind in Washington have been wringing their hands over the dangers posed to the fragile economic recovery by the severe combination of spending cuts and tax increases that are due to kick in on New Year's Eve. This so-called "fiscal cliff" was the result of politicians kicking the can down the road a few years ago. Will they do it again? Or will there be a grand bargain that actually puts the country on the path to smaller deficits? <br> There are plenty of plans on the shelf waiting, including those put together by the big deficit reduction commissions such as Simpson/Bowles and Rivlin/Domenici. And there's the plan almost put together by President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner. The problem isn't the lack of plans; it's the lack of courage. The outlines of any deal have been clear for some time now: Democrats have to give up some spending, especially on entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, and Republicans have to allow for some new taxes. Each side has to hold it's nose if a deal is to be done. Which brings me to the next issue facing President Obama: <br> Dealing with the Republicans <br> Obama must figure out how to deal with a Republican Party in Congress that has become dysfunctional. In 2010 a relatively small group of voters calling themselves the Tea Party launched a surprise attack on the leadership of the Republican Party. Under President Bush, the Republican Party had gotten a little too fond of world domination and a little too dismissive of the party's traditional concern for fiscal discipline. Frankly, they deserved a trip to the woodshed. <br> But once their new majority in the House of Representatives was won, the leadership overreacted, and rather than forge a majority that could perhaps make some progress, they cowered before their new members like frightened children. The result? No progress. If the Republican leadership continues to tremble before their most radical members, the entire party risks a rightward slide off the face of the earth. And President Obama will have to figure out how to work around them. <br> Cutting a deal on tax reform <br> It's been 25 years since a Democratic Congress and President Reagan cleaned out the tax code and achieved lower rates and fewer loopholes. But tax loopholes grow back like dandelions in the garden. The current tax code is a mess. It rewards some sectors of the economy and not others. It distorts business decision-making and it makes sure that those who don't need it have plenty of tax deductions. It's time to weed that garden once again. <br> Amazingly enough in this era of extreme polarization, both presidential candidates have expressed support for lowering the corporate tax rate to 25% and simplifying the corporate side of the code. It's possible that they could agree on the easy stuff on the corporate side and move to the harder stuff on the individual side. Tax reform will be part and parcel of a long-term deficit deal. Tax cuts for the oil and gas industry are a favorite target of President Obama, and they are just one example of many industry-specific tax breaks that might get swept up in a big tax deal. <br> Climate change <br> And finally I come to the issue that was not mentioned in the presidential campaign: climate change. The Democrats' one attempt at climate change legislation died in 2010, a victim of the recession and also of the fear that confronting it would increase energy costs on a public still reeling from the meltdown. The failure of the climate bill began, however, the issue's long, slow slide into oblivion; a slide so complete that both candidates spent their debates falling all over themselves to prove they were friends of coal. <br> But coal is the big culprit in climate change, a fact conveniently ignored when the votes of Ohio are at stake. How fitting then, that in the very last week of the campaign, a gigantic hurricane would destroy the Jersey shore and close down lower Manhattan. The seas are rising after all; there is something happening after all. What, President Obama, are you going to do about it? The options are plentiful, from taxing carbon to pouring more money into green energy. They just haven't been very palatable. Maybe hurricane Sandy can change that. 
 Mitt Romney spent weeks battling Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich for the Republican presidential nomination, and he faced blistering attacks from Rick Perry and other GOP rivals along the way. And now he is paying the price. <br> Romney's failure to surpass Barack Obama this summer stems in no small part from his reluctance to make any bold moves on policy, and this reluctance is a direct product of the beating he's taken from conservative critics for much of the last year. <br> The basic rap on Romney -- who represented, let us not forget, the conservative alternative to John McCain during the 2008 race for the Republican presidential nomination -- was that he wasn't sufficiently conservative. To reassure conservative primary voters, Romney embraced positions on a wide range of issues, from immigration to taxes, that are more popular among reliable Republicans than among swing voters. <br> As the political analyst Sean Trende, author of "The Lost Majority," has argued, the central dilemma facing the Romney campaign is that it has essentially secured all of the low-to-medium hanging fruit for a Republican presidential candidate by condemning Obama's economic record. Yet this hasn't been enough to give Romney a lead over the incumbent president. <br> Indeed, there is at least some reason to believe that the Romney campaign is losing ground. This strongly suggests that the GOP needs a more positive message with crossover appeal. The trouble, of course, is that Romney's efforts to inoculate himself against charges of squishiness have made it very difficult for him to pivot to the center. <br> What might a more daring Romney campaign have looked like? <br> A more populist Romney campaign would spend time and money bashing the big banks. While Romney has called for repealing the Dodd-Frank Act, the centerpiece of Obama's fitful efforts to reform Wall Street, he hasn't provided much in the way of detail regarding how he'd address the too-big-to-fail problem. Given that anger against taxpayer-funded bank bailouts helped fuel the rise of the tea party movement, and in turn the Republican congressional victories of 2010, this constitutes a serious strategic mistake. <br> Sebastian Mallaby of the Council of Foreign Relations, a market-friendly centrist perhaps best known for his exhaustive history of the hedge fund industry, "More Money Than God," has even argued that investors might welcome a bank break-up. <br> Leaving aside the substantive merits of this and other proposals designed to curb the too-big-to-fail phenomenon, this is an accessible idea that would help Romney play against type. So it has come as a disappointment to many on the right that the Romney campaign has been dismissive of the idea. <br> This could reflect a conviction on the part of the candidate that Wall Street is not in need of a radical overhaul. Or, more cynically, the Romney campaign might be reluctant to alienate influential Republican donors in the financial services industry. Yet the decision to tread lightly on financial malfeasance might cost Romney the election. <br> Romney's evolution on tax policy is also telling. <br> The idea was that this would be a prelude to a larger tax code overhaul. But when Romney feared that Rick Santorum might defeat him in Michigan's crucial Republican primary, he released a far more ambitious, and far more expensive, tax cut proposal that is being criticized as pie-in-the-sky. <br> Rather than campaign on a deep tax cut that would benefit high-earners, the Romney campaign might have instead championed a revenue-neutral tax reform that cut taxes dramatically on families with children while effectively raising them on childless high-earners. <br> In choosing to embrace the Journal's view, Romney may have sacrificed an opportunity to connect with cash-strapped middle class parents, including many independents and Democrats. <br> Right now, the Romney campaign seems to believe that it can defeat Obama by running a conventional and cautious campaign. But as the weeks go by and the president's lead remains frozen in place, this is starting to look like a bad bet. 
 Taxmaggedon is coming. Unless President Obama and Congress act, Americans will be hit with what would be in total dollars the largest tax increase in history in little more than five months. <br> Income taxes will go up on every single taxpaying American. The Alternative Minimum Tax, designed decades ago to ensure that 154 wealthy Americans paid income taxes, would hit an additional 27 million Americans with a $92 billion tax hike. The death tax will come roaring back -- hitting farmers, ranches and businesses. <br> And there's a clear difference in vision for how to address this fiscal crisis. <br> I and other Republicans have proposed stopping these tax increases for all Americans. As the top Republican on the Finance Committee, I've put forward a proposal to prevent the largest tax hike in history from taking place and to pave the way for comprehensive tax reform in 2013. <br> If Congress doesn't agree with President Obama's plan to raise taxes on one of the most productive segments of our economy by allowing the top two marginal tax rates to expire, Washington Democrats' default position appears to be to let everyone's income tax rates skyrocket. <br> Taxmageddon is real, and the uncertainty caused by it is contributing to the lackluster economic recovery. That's not a Republican talking point; that's based on comments from job creators across the country. <br> It's based on people like Brent Gines from Sandy, Utah, who said that "Any increase in expenses or outlay always has a big decrease on our ability to do business." <br> The only solution is to provide job creators and working families the certainty they need by extending all the current tax rates for another year, as we did in 2010, and then work next year to fundamentally reform our broken, costly tax code. <br> The president and his allies need to listen to what Americans are saying. They need the certainty of an extension of current tax rates for another year, and they need Congress to move forward together to reform the tax code to spur economic growth and job creation. <br> What does fundamental tax reform look like? <br> It means lower marginal income tax rates that would lead to more hiring, greater capital formation, better returns on our investments and a stronger economy. <br> A simpler tax code means that many of the resources currently poured into complying with the tax laws could be put to other uses -- investing in new businesses, paying for our children's education, and giving money to charitable causes, to name a few. <br> This is not a time for political games, divisiveness and vilifying business and industry. Businesses continue to sit on the sidelines because they don't know what Washington is about to throw at them. The uncertainty is holding them back, and it's stifling our economy. <br> The president and his liberal allies in the Senate need to stop holding America's economy hostage in order to get what they want -- which is higher taxes that would hit small businesses and the workers they hire. <br> Let's extend current tax rates for a year to give job creators and working families some certainty, then roll up our sleeves and pass meaningful tax reform to ensure America remains the leader we know it to be. 
 Earlier this week, President Barack Obama proposed to extend the Bush-era income tax cuts, which expire at the end of this year, for one year for people with income below $250,000. People with higher income would continue to receive all of the benefits of lower taxes on their first $250,000 of income, but the tax rate they face on income above that amount would rise. <br> One might wonder why we need more tax cuts, given that the Congressional Budget Office just released a study showing that tax burdens as a share of income for almost all households were the lowest in 2009 that they have been in decades and given that we face a long-term deficit problem that will require more revenues over time. <br> The answer, of course, is that taxes are slated to rise at the end of this year, an increase that if allowed in full, along with scheduled spending cuts that came out of the debt limit budget deal in 2011, would hurt an already weakly recovering economy in the short-term and possibly push it back into recession, if not counteracted. The president's proposal would substantially reduce the extent to which taxes are slated to rise. <br> The president's unwillingness to keep Bush-era tax rates for households with the highest income has been criticized on grounds that it will hurt job-creation efforts and in particular small businesses. These criticisms can be overstated, however. <br> First, in our current economy, with significant number of unemployed workers, job creation will depend much more on creating an economic stimulus -- that is, by cutting tax levels and by boosting spending by federal, state and local governments and by the private sector -- than a slightly lower marginal tax rate. <br> Second, the net tax rate businesses actually pay on new investment and new hires, not the tax rate listed in the tax law, is what should drive business choices. The "effective tax rate" takes into account that small businesses can generally write off all of their investment as a deduction in the year the investment is made. This is sometimes called section 179 expensing. <br> This provision reduces the effective tax rate on new investment financed by the business owner to zero. Yes, zero, because any tax on future investment returns will simply pay the government back for the cost of the deduction. This is true no matter what the tax bracket is for the taxpayer. <br> Indeed, if they can finance the investment with tax deductible debt payments, small businesses will face an effective tax rate that is actually negative. <br> Likewise, the calculus of hiring a new worker should take into account the fact that wage payments are deductible for businesses. Hence, if the law imposes a higher statutory tax rate on higher incomes, while it will raise the tax that has to be paid on the proceeds from new investment and new hiring, it also will raise the value of the deductions that most small businesses can take from the new investment and new hiring, and in a way that exactly balances out. <br> Third, much of the income for small businesses comes in the form of capital gains, which would continue to face a much lower rate than ordinary income. <br> Fourth, the vast majority, 97%, of people who receive most of their income from business sources are not in the top two tax brackets. Small businesses are essentially used sometimes as a "poster child" by those who wish to avoid higher taxes on other income at high income levels. <br> Still, while the president's proposal recognizes the need to avoid running straight off the fiscal cliff next January, it could be improved. <br> First, it does not do enough to promote economic growth in the near term. The economy would still be facing tax increases (due to the end of the temporary payroll tax cut) and government spending cuts (due to the budget deal). <br> In an economy that is struggling to reduce unemployment, these restrictive measures will not help. European countries have seen the failure of austerity policies and the effects would have the same impact here too. <br> Rather, the economy needs a bigger stimulus, with a bigger bang for the buck. This could take the form of payroll tax cuts, infrastructure investments and federal aid to states and localities, which have had to cut back on jobs and education and other forms of spending. <br> Second, the president's proposal prolongs highly partisan debates about the Bush tax cuts and which should be extended and for how long. <br> A better way to stimulate the economy and move the broader debate forward would be to let all of the Bush tax cuts expire as scheduled and be considered as part of a broader tax reform and medium-term deficit reduction effort, and institute instead an explicitly temporary cut, again a payroll tax cut comes to mind. <br> Regardless of the fate of the president's proposal, policy makers need to address the weakly recovering economy and build toward a sustainable long-term tax and fiscal solution. 
 Welcome back to work, Congress. Hope you enjoyed your fourth full week off this year. Now find a way to work together to help get America back to work. <br> Experts all say not to expect any constructive action from Congress until after the election. There is a reason that cynicism passes for wisdom in Washington. But with economic clouds from overseas depressing our own recovery, there is an obligation to act now. And, in fact, there is a handful of bipartisan bills that could help get the U.S. economy moving again if they were enacted. <br> These are not Democrat or Republican ideas -- they are simply good ideas. And unlike bipartisan pork barrel bills, they cost taxpayers comparatively little to enact. <br> Let's take a look at three proposals with bipartisan support that could pass this summer if given a chance. <br> Public-Private Infrastructure Bank <br> It would create a public-private bank to seed investment in America's aging infrastructure, improving our resilience and competitiveness over the long term while spurring the economy in the near term. <br> "In a time of budgetary crisis, the American Infrastructure Bank pays for projects with private money now sitting on the sidelines," attests Michael Likosky, director of NYU's Center on Law Public Finance. "Every country uses private capital to build projects except for the United States. We are an island." <br> "We are poised for a new era of prosperity if we could gain consensus on the fact that our infrastructure needs to be rebuilt," agrees John Hofmeister, the former CEO of Shell Oil. "It was designed for a time in the past when our country had a different population." <br> President Obama has backed this bipartisan infrastructure bank bill as more feasible than a version his administration pushed earlier. "President Obama is the biggest proponent of public-private partnerships to hold office to date," argues Likosky. "The Infrastructure Bank is a rare case of a popular bipartisan idea, born in the Beltway, that has been adopted by governors and mayors." It is trickle-down policy-making. It's also smart policy-making that business and labor, Republicans and Democrats, should all be able to agree on. <br> The Start-Up 2.0 bill -- co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Jerry Moran as well as Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Chris Coons -- would allow Ph.D. or master's graduates in science, technology, engineering and math to receive green cards to work in the U.S., while also lifting the per-country cap on skilled worker visas. <br> In addition, it would create new tax incentives for investments in start-up companies and reduce taxes for businesses in the start-up phase. It's precisely the kind of smart incentive that is key to expanding the American dream, while keeping the United States a magnet for the best and the brightest from around the world. <br> Small Business Assistance <br> The Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act of 2012 -- backed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and pushed by Sen. Chuck Schumer, both Democrats -- is expected to be brought up for a vote this month. <br> It deserves bipartisan support because it builds squarely on a traditionally Republican idea: Use tax incentives to spur job creation, investment and expansion. Specifically, the bill would offer a 10% tax credit for any new hiring or raises this year as well as allow the complete write-off of new capital investments like machinery or equipment consistent with expansion. <br> Much like the forgotten American middle class, small businesses are the backbone of America, and they receive far less government attention than big business, despite the fact that they actually employ more people. There is a competing House bill which would double the tax credit -- and therefore, the cost -- of the bill, but which would also apply to hedge funds and the like. The differences can be bridged, the common ground defined and then built upon. But the focus should be on helping the people on Main Street rather than on Wall Street right now -- objectively, they need the help more. <br> These are all relatively modest measures. (We centrists always try to balance idealism with realism.) Unfortunately, the larger opportunities for broad tax reform or a grand bargain on long-term deficits and debt are unlikely to come until after the election -- and there's no rational reason to expect that the hyperpartisan politics will end then. But that is no reason not to take action on specific targeted bills with bipartisan support right now. <br> The enemies of action include lobbyists who want to keep special treatment for their respective industries embedded in the current tax code, or unions that oppose immigration reform for high-skilled foreign workers. Big ideas with bipartisan support like lowering the corporate tax rate can't get traction for these reasons. <br> Most poisonously, there are extreme partisans in both parties who want to stop progress before the election for fear that the other party might get some credit. Republicans don't want Obama to get visible wins on the economy. And some Democrats are concerned that passing bipartisan bills now will make it harder for the president to run against an obstructionist Republican House of Representatives. "The American people are held hostage to the selfish political interests of partisans on both sides," says Hofmeister, the former Shell chief executive. <br> There is an old joke among congressmen that every bill is a jobs bill, because it is your job on the line. These three bipartisan bills present a win-win on the jobs front -- an opportunity to do well by doing good. Every member of Congress should feel urgency to prove that they can in fact work together on the economy, or face the anti-incumbent wrath of all voters. <br> The political courage that is needed comes from looking out for the national interest instead of being driven by special interests. Governing is not a zero-sum game and just as a rising tide lifts all boats, a growing economy is good for everyone. After all, we Americans are all ultimately in the same boat. 
 Tuesday is tax day, and the only thing more frustrating than paying taxes is Washington's refusal to fix the tax code. <br> Aside from entitlements, no policy debate highlights the dysfunctions of American politics more than taxes. Instead of viewing the tax code as a way to raise revenue and enable government to perform its essential functions, politicians on both sides of the aisle use the tax code -- and the debate about taxes -- as tools to keep themselves in power and to reward their friends and interest groups who put them there. <br> First, liberals like to argue that taxing the rich will solve our debt and deficit issues. They ignore one major problem. There simply are not enough rich people to tax to make a difference. <br> Even taking every last penny from every individual making more than $10 million per year would only reduce the nation's deficit by 12% and the debt by 2%. There's simply not enough wealth in the community of the rich to erase this country's problems by waving some magic tax wand. <br> Fortunately, the Senate voted down the Buffett Rule Monday night. Yet the Senate once again wasted America's time to make a political point. <br> Republicans, on the other hand, have desecrated the limited-government legacies of Reagan, Goldwater, and our founders by embarking on spending orgies with borrowed money -- a form of deferred taxation and financial repression -- while hiding beyond false pledges of tax purity that have made tax reduction and simplification much more difficult to achieve. <br> For instance, some Republican tax lobbyists, such as Americans for Tax Reform's Grover Norquist, say eliminating any credit or deduction -- what economists call "tax expenditures" or "spending the code" -- is a tax increase. For instance, when I tried to eliminate a tax earmark for Hollywood movie producers in President Obama's stimulus bill, Norquist alleged that I was trying to raise taxes. <br> In other words, Norquist would demand that Republicans and conservatives walk away from a deal that was $9,000,000,000,000 (that's $9 trillion) in budget cuts and $.01 (one cent) in new revenue. That's pure stupidity and, fortunately, no one serving in Congress agrees with him. I know all the major negotiators on the Republican side and, regardless of what their public statements suggest, not a single one would automatically walk away from a deficit reduction deal that included revenue. <br> Congress has not tackled fundamental tax reform in more than 25 years. In 1986, President Reagan signed a comprehensive tax reform plan that closed loopholes, lowered rates, simplified the code, and sustained what was then the longest economic expansion in peacetime since World War II. Reagan called the tax reform act "the best anti-poverty bill, the best pro-family measure and the best job-creation program ever to come out of the Congress of the United States." <br> Using Reagan's approach would be a win-win for taxpayers. President Obama's own deficit reduction commission, on which I served -- the Simpson-Bowles commission -- followed this template of lowering tax rates and broadening the base by getting rid of spending in the code. The commission recommended lowering individual rates to 8, 14, 23% and corporate rates to 26%. I would push rates even lower, but the commission report, which was supported by conservatives and liberals, showed that it is possible to lower rates, stimulate growth, generate additional revenue and reduce the deficit. <br> Congress has done bold tax reform in the past. It can and must do so again if we are going to survive in the 21st century. <br> <em> 
 Last week we learned that Barack and Michelle Obama's effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5%. They had adjusted gross income of $789,674. We also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than President Obama's secretary, who had about $95,000 of income. <br> Ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. In a true progressive rate system, Obama would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. <br> We also know that Mitt and Ann Romney have a projected effective tax rate of 15% for 2011. They have requested an extension so we don't have their actual returns. Their household income was just shy of $21 million. In a true progressive tax system, the Romneys would never pay a lower tax rate than the Obamas. <br> We do not have a progressive tax system. The notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long. <br> First, not all income is taxed the same. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. That rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the Bush tax cuts. <br> Most of the Romneys' income comes from stock ownership. Stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system. Income from stock is taxed at a flat 15% rate. <br> Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate. Of that minority, very few benefit the way the Romneys do. <br> An analysis of IRS statistics show that for households up to $200,000, no more than about 5% of their income is eligible for the flat 15% rate. Those households combined represent well more than 90% of American households. <br> The Simpson-Bowles commission included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same. While some would say that is a radical step, it is precisely what we did in 1986. <br> Second, not all deductions are treated the same. Two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction. So, as a result, most Americans do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code. <br> In addition, under a progressive tax system, the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed. That is referred to as your marginal tax rate. <br> The more income you have, the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction. <br> For example, if your marginal tax rate is 35%, then for every dollar you spend, you save 35 cents. If your marginal tax rate is 15%, then for every dollar you spend, you save only 15 cents. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes. <br> Third, all of this is supposed to be a secret. <br> The only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it -- either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor Warren Buffett. The IRS statistics do a great job of masking this information because the real problem lies within the top 1% of taxpayers, and the data are not presented in a way that isolates that group. <br> Congress decides to enact a tax law, and the president signs the bill. While presidents voluntarily release their tax returns, members of Congress do not. The first step toward real tax reform would be for every member of Congress to release his or her tax return. We can see which tax provisions benefit them, and we can compare their effective tax rates with our own. <br> Achieving meaningful tax reform will require very few steps. <br> First, tax all forms of income at the same rate. Second, repeal the progressive tax system and enact a flat tax. If a flat tax is good enough for Mitt and Ann Romney, it should be good enough for the rest of us. <br> Most flat tax proponents, however, want a flat tax, but they want to exempt income from stock completely. That would mean Mitt and Ann Romney's already low 15% effective tax rate would be cut even further. That would be wrong-headed tax reform. <br> Finally, most deductions should be eliminated. Most taxpayers do not itemize, so this change would only affect about one-third of taxpayers -- and their accountants and tax lawyers. <br> Whenever Congress enacts a deduction, it creates winners and losers. That must stop. To be sure, every special interest group will oppose even the hint of this suggestion. But we outnumber them. <br> I don't think it's fair that the richest Americans pay taxes at a lower rate than most taxpayers and neither should you. <br> <em> 
 It turns out that Richard Nixon was a hippie. <br> Here's Tricky Dick's wisdom on taxation, always worth dusting off this time of year: <br> "We shall never make taxation popular, but we can make taxation fair." <br> See -- he's talking about "fairness" -- and we all now know that's code for social justice straight out of Saul Alinsky. And it was especially socialistic for him to invoke the concept back in a time when the top tax rate was 70%. <br> Meanwhile, back in reality circa 2012, we are having a typically overheated election-year debate about taxes -- and both teams in Washington have a point. <br> Republicans this side of Ronald Reagan finally found a way to out-promise Democrats. After decades spent griping that the New Deal's electoral power came from liberal's limitless ability to promise public goodies, conservatives have realized that they can tap into American's anti-tax impulse by promising to lower taxes all the time, regardless of whether our nation is at war or running a long-term deficit. Liberals have always had a hard time appreciating that the American Revolution was founded in part on a tax revolt. <br> But historic perspective is the enemy of partisan ideologues, and on the flip-side, conservatives who idealize the past conveniently ignore that tax rates at the heart of the American Century were almost double what they are today. That was an outrage; by comparison, today's debates are about rounding errors. <br> Essentially, we are debating whether the top tax rate should go back to where it was during the Bill Clinton presidency -- 39.6%, up from the Bush tax cut level of 35%. And this would apply only to households making more than $250,000 a year. <br> I happen to think using that threshold is a mistake. A family making 250k with two earners doesn't deserve to be lumped in with the super-rich at the top tax rate. At the same time, someone such as Mitt Romney, who makes $56,000 a day off passive income from investments, shouldn't be taxed at just 14%. <br> Obama has a real weakness in this year's debate, however. Read through his play-to-the-base budget, and you'll see the term "fairness" advanced over and over again. Fairness is a noble goal and contributes to societal stability in the long-run. But the real argument for raising taxes is directly related to balancing budgets and reducing long-term deficits and debt. And that argument is rooted in rhetoric about the "shared sacrifice" needed to restore national greatness. After all, the world's largest debtor nation cannot remain the world's sole superpower for long. <br> Obama's fairness rhetoric bypasses that rational argument in favor of something fluffier -- namely, closing the growing gap between rich and poor via the tax code. This might excite the liberal Democratic base, but it also serves to confirm negative stereotypes about wealth redistribution and the left that alienates independents and swing voters. <br> On balance, I think policy arguments about moving the top rate to people making more than a million dollars a year makes good sense. <br> Republicans will balk out of deference to philosophy and big campaign contributors, but even 52% of self-identified tea partiers support that benchmark. It is an additional irony that many conservatives are fine with raising taxes on those 47% of Americans who don't make enough money to pay federal income taxes, as long as top rates are lowered enough to make the overall shift revenue neutral. This isn't tax policy as much as it has become a shell-game masquerading as ideology. <br> Both Obama and congressional Republicans have campaigned on tax reform and tax simplification in the past. The Bowles-Simpson Plan and the sadly abandoned Obama-Boehner Grand Bargain imagined lowering rates and raising revenue by closing loopholes. The real tragedy is that such an agreement should be within reach -- but the 80% agreement keeps getting eclipsed by the 20% disagreement, that signature, stubborn hyperpartisan insistence on all or nothing. So we get nothing. <br> That brings us back to Nixon's aphorism: "We shall never make taxation popular but we can make taxation fair." It's about the last piece of useful wisdom on the subject that we've heard out of Washington. <br> <em> 
 In the early 1980s when I served on the staff of the Joint Economic Committee, we invited the Republican deficit scourge, Peter G. Peterson, to testify on Reaganomics, but he wouldn't come. Somewhat understandably, he declined to sabotage his own team. This week, when I was asked to comment on President Barack Obama's proposed "Buffett Rule," I had a similar urge to duck. But it passed. <br> The Buffett Rule would increase taxes on a handful of Mitt-Romney-like figures in today's America, raising a few billions of dollars in new revenues each year from the very rich. It is perfectly tailored to the Obama political style, which is to nod symbolically leftward while reserving big concessions for banks, venture capitalists and insurance companies. <br> Symbolic gestures have their place. In this case, the proposed rule states an important principle of tax fairness. It calls attention to the larger issue of income inequality. It could be the start of a larger push for tax reform. No political progressive should sneer at an idea that helps bring these issues into focus. And especially not, if the direct effect might be to cost Romney, personally, millions of dollars. The image of him writing the check will, no doubt, give universal pleasure. <br> Another virtue of the Buffett Rule is that it exposes the craven hypocrisy of its opponents. This is, after all, a very small tax increase. It is exquisitely targeted on a few individuals with large investment incomes. As drafted by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, it would provide a useful spur to their charity. There is no serious argument that the rule would make the tax code more inefficient than it already is. The grounds for opposing it can only be, well, craven and hypocritical. <br> And yet, at the same time, by itself, the Buffett Rule solves no significant economic problem. It will not create any jobs, raise any wages, reduce the crushing debts of the middle class, slow the wave of foreclosures, conserve energy or reduce the price of gas. Nor will it restore confidence in the banks. And it is directed, at least in principle, toward a notorious nonproblem, namely the deficit and the public debt, on which we waste far too much ink as things stand. <br> According to the Economic Policy Institute, Harkin's proposal would raise the incomes of 28 million American workers. It would make a big difference in the South, where wages are lower. It would especially help younger workers, minorities and women. It would not add to the deficit -- since federal workers all make more than that anyway -- and would likely spur the economy and increase tax revenues -- by a lot more than the Buffett Rule. <br> The Buffett Rule would zing a few thousand high fliers, which is not bad. But maybe Obama should go beyond symbols and grab this idea while it's hot. 
 The budget proposal introduced by House Republicans on Tuesday is much more than a series of numbers on a spreadsheet -- it's a vision for reforming the key pillars of the American social contract in the 21st century. In that regard, it's very different from the vision put forward by President Obama in his budget plan from a month ago, which emphasized preserving the status quo with another round of tax hikes. <br> The central economic problem of coming years is how to update the nation's largest entitlement programs so that they are sustainable and available to future generations of Americans. <br> In Medicare, the GOP budget preserves today's arrangements for those in or near retirement. But for future entrants into the program, Medicare would change into a "premium support" model. The government would provide a fixed level of premium assistance to the program's enrollees, and they would use that assistance to pick from among competing insurance options, including the traditional fee-for-service federal program. <br> Obama's vision for Medicare is very different. He wants an unaccountable board of bureaucrats to cut fees to those caring for Medicare patients. But cutting fees isn't real cost control. Low reimbursement rates will just force doctors and hospitals to stop taking care of Medicare patients and thereby impair their access to care. <br> For Medicaid, the GOP plan would shift power and financial control to the states so that they can reform their programs in ways that best suit the needs of their residents. <br> In addition to mending entitlement programs, the GOP plan calls for top-to-bottom reform of the federal bureaucracy, with an emphasis on cutting programs of low or marginal value so that more money can be invested in what truly matters. Most importantly, the plan does not adopt the deep reductions in defense spending that would cripple the military just as threats around the world are expanding and intensifying. Over the next decade, the GOP budget would cut federal spending by $5.3 trillion, compared with Obama's proposal. <br> The American people now have before them two clear and very different approaches for how to address the nation's fundamental economic challenges. One vision would preserve the status quo, with growing entitlement commitments, steady hikes in tax rates and more centralized control of the economy from the government. The other vision would bolster a vibrant private sector with sensible taxes; reform of entitlements and other programs that emphasize limited but effective government; protection of the most vulnerable among us; and the power of free markets to promote prosperity. These competing plans give voters a real choice when they go the polls in November. And whatever they decide, the consequences will be lasting. 
 Compare and contrast the economic plan Mitt Romney released in September with the speech he delivered Friday in Detroit. <br> "We need taxes to pay for the operations of government. But they should be collected by a system that is simple and fair, and that causes the least possible disruption to the productive economy. <br> "While the entire tax code is in dire need of a fundamental overhaul, Mitt Romney believes in holding the line against increases in marginal tax rates. The goals that President Bush pursued in bringing rates down to their current level -- to spur economic growth, encourage savings and investment, and help struggling Americans make ends meet -- are just as important today as they were a decade ago. Letting them lapse, as President Obama promises to do in 2012, is a step in precisely the wrong direction. If anything, the lower rates established by President Bush should be regarded as a directional marker on the road to more fundamental reform. " (Italics added.) <br> By contrast, the Detroit speech seems to have been written on the back of an envelope. The only thought that went into it was: How do we rev up the base so that we can win the next primaries? <br> Romney said: <br> "First, I will make an across-the-board, 20% reduction in marginal individual income tax rates [tax brackets]. By reducing the tax on the next dollar of income earned by all taxpayers, we will encourage hard work, risk-taking, and productivity by allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn. <br> "The businesses that pay taxes through the individual income tax system account for more than half of all private sector jobs in the United States. So this tax cut will encourage businesses to hire, raise wages, and grow the economy." <br> No effort is made to corroborate these claims for the economic benefits of a further 20% tax cut. Corroboration is not needed in a speech intended narrowly for the pre-convinced. <br> But wait -- won't such a big tax cut, piled atop the previous commitment to renew the Bush tax cuts when they expire in 2013, greatly add to the deficit? Especially when joined to new promises to permanently abolish the Alternative Minimum Tax and estate tax? How will the federal budget be balanced? <br> Not with cuts to current Medicare beneficiaries, the speech hastens to assure. <br> "Tax hikes are off the table, and there will be no change for those at or near retirement." Medicare and Social Security reform will not begin until 2022. Yet the tax cuts are supposed to go into effect right away. How to close the gap? <br> Growth, of course, will help. But mostly, the speech suggests that the gap will be closed with big cuts to programs for the poor, such as "food stamps, housing subsidies, and job training." <br> What about the social costs of imposing such big cuts on a population that has by no means recovered from the economic catastrophe of 2008-2009? Do the numbers even add up? <br> One might cynically answer: Who cares? The speech is not intended as policy. It's intended to corral Republican primary voters. If Romney wins the election in November, that will be the time to think seriously about economic plans. <br> Yet cynicism is not always as sophisticated as it thinks it is. However short-term the motivations behind it, Romney's speech in Michigan will have heavy consequences for at least four reasons: <br> • Even if the speech does not strictly qualify as a flip-flop, it does continue the pattern of Romney yielding under pressure from the GOP base. Winning candidates look for ways to demonstrate independence from party dogma. In 2008, Barack Obama did it by praising Ronald Reagan and preaching the importance of fathers. George W. Bush did it with his October 1999 speech repudiating claims that the U.S. was "slouching toward Gomorrah." Bill Clinton of course had his Sister Souljah speech. Romney instead is following the Walter Mondale approach of knuckling his forehead to every interest group in the party. Each succeeding act of submission makes him look weaker. <br> • Romney has now wholly identified himself as the candidate of the rich and the old. Nothing is to be asked from those over 55. Much is to be given to upper-income earners. All the burden of fiscal adjustment is to be piled on the poor and the young. When Republicans invoke the memory of Ronald Reagan, they ought to remember how powerfully Reagan spoke to the aspirations of young Americans -- and how the support of young Americans in turn made the oldest of American presidents appear exciting to voters in every age group. Today's Republican party goes out of its way to show contempt and hostility to the young -- an attitude that will have consequences for a long time to come. <br> • It's not impossible that Romney may win this election. If he does, he'll find that his speech in Detroit surrendered the initiative for his first year in office to the Republicans in the House. They will want to pass the tax cut first. Romney has now endorsed it, so how can he say no? They will want to do some version of the Paul Ryan budget next. Ditto. And whoosh, there goes his first year -- and all the priorities that his September plan and his own book suggested he regards as more important: tax reform, trade, etc. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist will be proved right: Romney will have reduced himself to a signing machine for a government whose real power is centered in Capitol Hill. <br> • If Medicare, Social Security and defense are off the table -- and if the rest of the government is not to be obliterated entirely -- then hopes of deficit reduction after Romney's big tax cut will rest on the country zooming to Chinese levels of economic growth. What if that growth does not appear? It's one thing to incur dreadful deficits during the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. The Romney plan threatens to institutionalize those deficits even during the period of recovery ahead. <br> Compassionate conservatism has been dead for a long time. Romney's Detroit speech cremated the remains. As a man, Romney remains far and away the most capable of the presidential candidates seeking the Republican nomination. But he has now finally eliminated the policy differences separating him from the radical congressional wing. If Romney should win the Republican nomination, moderate and independent voters nationwide will be forced to decide: If they vote for Romney, who is it they're truly voting for? 
 Mitt Romney's victory in Florida is big but still leaves much to be desired. <br> His win comes partly from substance and partly from a substantial advantage in resources. Romney is now a much improved candidate. His tactics and message are sharper, particularly defending his wealth. <br> In the two debates before the Florida primary, Romney outperformed Newt Gingrich, showing a smarter, tougher, more forceful demeanor. And he had an obvious advantage in resources. Romney owned the airwaves in Florida, outspending Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul more than five to one. <br> Should Romney be the Republican nominee, he will not have this luxury against President Barack Obama. Romney must be able to win on issues and substance; he has yet to prove that he can do that. Conservatives, in particular, still have serious questions about his core credentials. If Romney repeals "ObamaCare," what will be his alternative? Will he put forward a bold tax reform plan? <br> In the coming weeks, Romney needs a hard-hitting, conservative speech, one that reaches deeper than his traditional stump speech. We know Santorum's and Gingrich's vision for the country; Romney's isn't so clear. He needs a lucid, Reaganesque plan for the country; it's not enough for him to run as a businessman. He also needs to be gaffe free. His locution Wednesday morning on CNN -- "I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs a repair, I'll fix it." -- is inept at best for a very successful man. <br> Coming off his surge in South Carolina, Gingrich underperformed in Florida. Granted, he was the primary target of Romney's barrage of negative ads, but he was noticeably rattled and distracted from his message. Gingrich is at his best when he takes on the media and Obama, not when he stoops to ugly, personal fights with Romney and Santorum. <br> The lack of debates between now and March will hurt Gingrich more than any other candidate. As Byron York of The Washington Examiner told me on my radio show Wednesday morning, "Gingrich has scored most of his points against the press, not against his fellow candidates." He must find effective ways to engage Romney on the issues and rise above the muckraking. Americans like big ideas; he should return to those. Gingrich has come back from the dead twice; he should not be counted out or underestimated after Florida. <br> In spite of skipping Florida, Santorum is right to remain in the race. With the remaining caucus states and the new proportional delegation rules, Santorum has as much of a shot as Gingrich. <br> Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, pointed out on my show Wednesday that more delegates will be elected in February than in January and Gingrich isn't even on the ballot in Missouri. "Santorum has a shot to replace Gingrich as the alternative to Romney," Kristol said, adding that in his view Santorum is "more electable" and "more compelling" than Gingrich. <br> Santorum is, after all, the most conservative candidate left in the race. His credentials are much needed in the national dialogue. As iron sharpens iron, he will force Romney and Gingrich to focus on the issues. Yet, somehow, Santorum needs to gain momentum and take votes from Gingrich. Look for him to target Gingrich's record heavily, especially on health care, in the weeks ahead. <br> The shift from South Carolina to Florida proved once again that one week can change a lot in American politics. It's not likely we will know the Republican nominee until March. The larger question now becomes whether conservatives will coalesce and unite around one candidate based on substance and message -- or electability. 
 It also suggests that the main argument made by Romney and others for this highly unequal state of affairs -- that it's essential to spur job creation and economic growth -- is false. <br> Romney is fabulously wealthy because he is a hard worker and a smart businessman, to be sure. (Being the child of a smart businessman certainly doesn't hurt either.) Yet there's also no question that Romney has benefited enormously from the growing tilt of the tax code toward the nation's highest earners. <br> The code used to impose higher and higher rates all the way up the income ladder. Today, the very richest generally pay no more than the modestly well-to-do. And indeed, many of the superrich are paying lower rates. Warren Buffet has said he pays less in taxes as a share of income than the people who work for him. <br> The issue isn't just declining rates at the top. Just as crucial, politicians have also shifted the code away from taxing income from assets. Payroll taxes are up; capital gains taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, dividend taxes -- all way down. <br> On the other hand, targeted tax-cutting for the rich has certainly spurred one form of innovation and investment: ever more creative strategies by lawyers and lobbyists to rewire the tax code and reshuffle rich people's incomes so that their earnings show up as lightly taxed capital gains, not the wages and salaries on which the rest of American workers rely. <br> When Romney was at Bain Capital, for example, he and his associates would aggressively load companies up with debt and then reap big short-term gains that depended on tax provisions allowing investors to write off interest on company debt. <br> Even more telling, Romney is taxed so lightly in part because of a longstanding bug in the tax code that deep-pocketed lobbyists have managed to preserve. Unlike most finance professionals, he and other hedge fund and private equity managers get to treat a big part of the fees they earn from managing other people's money as "carried interest," subject to the capital gains rate, not the much higher income rate. <br> This egregious loophole didn't matter when private equity was rare and capital gains were taxed more or less like other income. Now, as Romney can attest, it matters a lot. With carried interest accounting for a quarter of his income over the last two years, Romney saved about $2.5 million from this tax break alone. <br> Actually, Romney's own business career makes the point better. No one seems to have noticed it, but Romney worked those long hours and made those risky bets mostly during a decade-long period when capital gains were taxed at the same rate as labor income. For a brief shining moment, the 1986 Tax Reform Act that Romney's icon Ronald Reagan supported interrupted the steady decline of capital gains taxes and restored the simple idea that all income should be taxed equally. That is to say, Romney's own success suggests that low capital gains rates aren't necessary to encourage the kind of entrepreneurship that Romney now celebrates. <br> <em> 
 One of the lessons of modern American presidential history is that there is nothing more devastating than turning a candidate's supposed strength into a weakness. Karl Rove masterfully made John Kerry's distinguished military service a liability through a series of Swift Boat attacks in the 2004 campaign. <br> Mitt Romney's fumbling response to questions about his tax returns similarly threatens to destroy the central premise of his candidacy that his business acumen will help him lead the country out of its current economic troubles. <br> For someone who has been running for president for six years, Romney is surprisingly ill-prepared to discuss his tax returns. <br> Romney's current position, that he will eventually release his returns for an an unspecified number of years, but not until April, is transparently political since, if things continue to go well for him, he presumably would have the Republican nomination wrapped up by then. <br> All of this raises the question: Why is Romney so defensive about the tax issue? After all, this is the man who told his landscaping company in 2006 that he would have to fire them unless they stopped employing illegal immigrants in order to maintain his future political viability. <br> Romney surely had his future political viability in mind as he arranged his financial affairs and prepared his tax returns over the past half-dozen years. So why hasn't he led with his chin and gone on offense with his tax returns? <br> One front could be on the charitable generosity he presumably has exhibited through his Mormon faith. If he and his wife have followed the Mormon practice of tithing 10% of their income to the church, his tax returns would stand in vivid contrast to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who gave meager amounts to charity, especially in the years before they knew they would be making their tax returns public. <br> These facts fit perfectly with the Republican meme of limited government augmented by private charity, with Democrats the party of compassion with other people's money while they personally do little to help the less fortunate. <br> Romney could open a second front in the tax war by using his tax return to press for tax reform that embraces the capitalist spirit reflected in his work for Bain Capital. Instead, Romney appears defensive about paying only a 15% tax rate since most of his income presumably is in the form of interest, dividends, capital gains, and carried interest. Romney is playing on Obama's turf in his timid proposal to cut taxes but only on those earning less than $200,000 per year. <br> Romney could contrast himself with Warren Buffett -- Obama's favorite tax adviser -- who publicly calls for higher taxes on the wealthy (while continuing to arrange his own business affairs to pay the lower tax rate enjoyed by Romney). <br> The Obama-Buffett world view is that you solve the problem of secretaries paying higher tax rates than their millionaire bosses by raising tax rates on the millionaires. The Romney response should be that you solve the problem by lowering tax rates on the secretaries. And he should insist that Buffett follow his lead and release his tax returns as well. <br> Romney should scrap his 59-point economic plan and mount a full-throttled cry for tax reform that lowers tax rates on everyone to the level reflected in his tax returns. <br> If Romney is unable or unwilling to wage this tax war in the relatively friendly trenches of a Republican primary, the party should think twice about whether it wants him as its standard bearer when the front moves to the stiffer territory of the general election. 
 Small business is not to be trifled with. President Barack Obama's announcement last week of a proposal to temporarily elevate the Small Business Administration to Cabinet rank is a move in the right direction. <br> In the United States, we know that firms less than 5 years old create the vast majority of net new jobs. It is mom and pop shops, garage start-ups and fledgling companies with good ideas that generate growth. <br> So, on its face, the president's move appears to reflect the importance of entrepreneurial companies to the U.S. economy. <br> But his announcement came with a mixed signal. The president gave SBA Cabinet ranking at the same time that he proposed merging six government agencies into one department focused on commerce and trade. Is the political theater in an election year? Because actual policy to support small business growth matters much more, particularly since the engine of small business growth is not what it used to be. <br> What happens when small businesses launch but don't "scale?" We are left with an economy short of 13.1 million jobs. <br> It is an urgent national priority to help small firms grow. This is of much greater importance than Cabinet reshuffling. And while a presidential announcement gives the appearance of focus, it doesn't guarantee legitimate change. <br> Today, U.S. businesses are constrained by burdensome regulation related to health care, the Dodd-Frank financial reform act of 2010, labor issues and environmental issues. Political as well as economic uncertainty makes it difficult for business owners to hire for future growth. <br> The good news is that 2012 started with an economic uptick. In December, the economy added 200,000 jobs, and the jobless rate fell to 8.5%. To accelerate recovery, we must further remove impediments for small businesses to perform. <br> Small and new companies require key policy changes to jump-start growth. We need visa reform to welcome foreign-born entrepreneurs who have graduated from U.S. universities and who want to create new enterprises here. We need to advance trade and further open global markets for U.S. goods. Ninety-five percent of the people we want to sell to live outside of the United States. <br> We need to strengthen K-12 education and improve training programs to ready our work force for the jobs of the future. Further, we need comprehensive tax reform to encourage the creation of new businesses. We cannot continue to maintain one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world and expect entrepreneurs and investors to not move abroad. <br> What does it mean if, as Obama proposed in his news conference, that the Commerce Department's core functions will be coalesced with those of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency and the Small Business Administration. If this reorganization occurs, the SBA will immediately lose its newly awarded Cabinet rank. <br> So which is it? Is Obama genuinely elevating the SBA or seeking to integrate it into a larger bureaucracy? The president's message raises questions about the White House's true commitment to small business concerns. <br> In an election year, politicians pay lip service to topics that pull at America's heartstrings. Small business does something more important: It quickens the nation's pulse. 2012 is a year for urgent action on the economy. Small business matters not only for political headlines, it is our best hope for putting America back to work. 
 The debate in Congress this week about whether to pay for extending the payroll tax cut by imposing a new tax on millionaires will have nothing to do with solving our nation's economic challenges and everything to do with election-year politics. Senate Democratic leaders have already signaled they will use the debate as a purely partisan exercise designed to embarrass Republicans into opposing tax cuts for the poor while defending tax cuts for the rich. <br> I intend to offer an alternative. Instead of punishing the rich with higher taxes, I will give Congress the option of helping pay for extending the payroll tax cut by ending welfare to the wealthy. <br> Every year, politicians on both sides engage in a process of reverse Robin Hood in which they steal $30 billion from low- and middle-income Americans and provide handouts to the rich and famous. <br> Millionaires receive tax earmarks and deductions crafted by both parties that allow them to write off billions each year. These write-offs include mortgage interest deductions on second homes and luxury yachts, gambling losses, business expenses, electric vehicle credits and even child care tax credits. <br> Meanwhile, direct handouts for millionaires have included $74 million in unemployment checks, $316 million in farm subsidies, $89 million for preservation of ranches and estates, $9 billion in retirement checks and $7.5 million to compensate for damages caused by emergencies to property that should have been insured. Millionaires have even borrowed $16 million in government-backed education loans to attend college since 2007. <br> The goal of highlighting these excesses is not to demonize those who are successful. Instead, by highlighting the sheer stupidity of pampering the wealthy with lavish benefits through our safety net and tax code, I hope to make a moral and economic argument for real entitlement and tax reform. <br> The most troubling gap in America today is not an income gap. It is an integrity gap -- and even intelligence gap -- between Washington and the rest of the country. <br> Families are struggling to make ends meet and are making painful economic choices as politicians in Washington borrow billions to provide welfare to the wealthy. Politicians on both sides refuse to fix big problems and defend stupid policies because changing those policies would involve upending a comfortable political status quo. <br> It's important for taxpayers to understand that these distortions are not accidental loopholes in the law. To the contrary, these provisions are intentional efforts to get all Americans to buy into a system where everyone appears to benefit while the poor and middle class are being robbed. <br> In the case of entitlements such as Social Security, progressives have argued for decades that a program for poor people will be a poor program. Yet, Warren Buffett hardly needs the same retirement check as his secretary. Ending welfare handouts to millionaires will strengthen, not undermine, the safety net for people who need it most. <br> Even Canada has adopted means testing in its retirement program by limiting benefits for high-earners. That fact is we can't afford the system we have today. Only by adopting common-sense reforms can we sustain a safety net for those who truly need assistance. <br> On the tax side, both parties have been reluctant to alter tax earmarks and deductions, such as the mortgage interest deduction. These are considered sacrosanct. <br> Yet, it's hard to understand how limiting the mortgage interest deductions for yachts will hurt working families. Defending spending in the tax code is not conservative. Providing tax earmarks and deductions to millionaires is a tax increase on everyone who doesn't receive the benefit. The only way we will enact real tax reform, and grow the economy, is by lowering tax rates and broadening the base by scaling back these egregious handouts. This is precisely what President Ronald Reagan did in 1986. <br> Even though the super committee failed to reach an agreement on broad deficit reduction, there is no reason why the other super committee -- Congress -- should drag its feet. Change in Washington tends to start with small steps. There is no better place to start than scaling back ludicrous handouts to millionaires that expose an entitlement system and tax code that desperately need to be reformed. 
 The Gingrich campaign has now confirmed a longstanding business relationship that enabled his consulting group to receive between $1.6 and $1.8 million from mortgage giant Freddie Mac. But it wasn't for "lobbying," Newt Gingrich insists. It was for "strategic advice on a wide range of issues." <br> OK, but then doesn't the payment, AP's Tom Beaumont asked the former House speaker, just remind people that "your background comes from being a Washington insider?" <br> "It reminds people," Gingrich corrected Beaumont, "that I know a great deal about Washington." And as he continued, "If you want to change Washington, we just tried four [sic] years of amateur ignorance and it didn't work very well, so having some-body who knows Washington might be a really good thing." <br> Newt Gingrich is certainly right about that. There is no candidate for president who has had more experience in changing Washington than Gingrich. Indeed, there may be no American since James Madison who has had more of an effect in making the institution of Congress what it is today. <br> For as far too few remember, more than any other living American, it is Newt Gingrich who gave us the current version of our hopelessly dysfunctional Congress — an institution which, according to a New York Times/CBS poll, now has the confidence of 9% of the American people. That monster is his baby, and no one should deny him his parental bragging rights. <br> The question for Gingrich now, however, is whether he wants to change that institution — again. For nothing in his campaign so far has either explained what went so wrong in the practices that he helped birth, or how we might possibly reform them. And it is this, I suggest, more than anything else that Americans need "reminding" of. <br> The Framers of our Constitution meant Congress to be a great deliberative body. It has become an embarrassment. Congress doesn't deliberate to resolve important national issues. Congress fundraises, and postures to fundraise, to support the next fight for control. <br> The transformation to this "Fundraising Congress" began in 1993. Newt Gingrich was its leader. After claiming Republican control of both houses of Congress in 1995 — for the first time in 40 years — Gingrich launched his new army of reformers on a project to secure permanent control of that institution, and of government. <br> Fundraising was the key to that strategy of control. The Republicans came to power raising a then unheard of amount of money: $618.42 million in the election cycle ending in 1994, compared to the Democrats' $488.68 million. <br> In the four years between 1994 and 1998, Republican candidates and party committees would raise over $1 billion. Never before had a party come anywhere close to raising that amount of money, because never before had any party's leaders so effectively focused the energy of their members on this single task: fundraising. <br> Gingrich concentrated the "work" of Congress into a three-day "work" week. He sent his caucus home for the rest of the week, in part so that they had time necessary to launch cross-country fundraising missions. <br> He exploded the number of committees, radically increasing the number of fund-raising targets. He ended any idea of bipartisanship. Instead, as Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tennessee, has described, the focus of Congress after Gingrich's reforms became the "majority of the majority," (i.e., the majority of the Republicans) polarizing the institution to the end of assuring ever more loyal and energized troops. <br> Members of Congress now spend between 30%-70% of their time raising money to get re-elected to Congress or to get their party back into power. And not just the Republicans: The Democrats quickly followed the lessons of Professor Gingrich. And in the almost 20 years since he came to power, practically everything about that great institution has changed. <br> Gone is any semblance of deliberation, or the idea that there is a business of the nation to be done, as opposed to the business of the party in power. Instead, the institution that Gingrich inherited — the one in which Democrats worked with Republicans to pass the most important tax reform in modern history (Reagan's), and in which Republicans led Democrats to break a filibuster in the Senate and pass the most important social legislation in a century (The Civil Rights Act of 1964) — was gone. What replaced it is the completely dysfunctional institution which practically no American has confidence in today. <br> More important to the right, as the business of Congress became the business of fundraising, the ideals that had brought Gingrich to power quickly got compromised. Fundraising demands pushed the Republican leadership to give up on its stated goal of shrinking the size of government, so that it could better use the power of majority status to raise campaign cash. As the Washington Post's Robert Kaiser reported in his 2009 book, "So Damn Much Money": <br> "Republicans took over ... determined to cut the government down to size. [But] their ambitions were soon compromised. ... Gingrich initially supported ... efforts to impose discipline on spending.... But in the face of perceived political necessity, the leadership wavered. Cutting spending was good, but Gingrich, (Dick) Armey, (Tom) DeLay, and others quickly realized that 'we have another aspect to our existence here, which is that we must use the Appropriations Committee as a resource to protect our vulnerables, because once we got into power, we wanted to stay in power.'" <br> The job of Congress was no longer the work of the nation. The job of Congress was to help its majority "to stay in power." <br> This is the legacy of Speaker Gingrich. It has been followed by Republicans and Democrats alike. It is a legacy that has done the nation great harm. And much more important than the question of how Gingrich might have profited personally from the economy of influence that he helped build is the question of whether, and how, he now intends to "change" it. <br> So it is perfectly true, Mr. Speaker, that you have the most "change" experience of any candidate for president. So would you use it this time to do good? Or would you continue to defend the practices that have destroyed the crown jewel of the Framers' Republic: Congress. 
 The 12 members of Congress on the deficit reduction committee have my deepest admiration and respect. They face probably the greatest challenge they've ever faced or ever will, at least in political life! <br> When my pal Erskine Bowles and I testified before the committee earlier this month, we did not spend much time going over the specifics of what needs to be done. They all know in their gut what has to be done. They know all of the policy options for dealing with the deficit. And by now they are just as painfully and vividly aware that every single program or policy they look at has an entrenched constituency that will raise a perfect hell if they dare to touch it. <br> Instead we offered them our full support, and told them that from our experience it can be done. We told them that if they step up and agree to a big, bold and smart plan to truly bring our nation's debt under control, they will have the true respect and support of the American public. <br> I loved to take on the ideological extremists on both sides when I was in the Senate and took a helluva lot of grief from the special interests passionately defending the sacred cows I dared to brand. But I never lost an election. That is an important lesson that I shared with the committee members. People admire guts and courage. They may fight you. They may vilify you. But they will admire you. <br> When Erskine and I go around the country speaking about our nation's budget, we don't give them BS or mush. We give them some simple facts: Our nation faces the most predictable economic crisis in history. We borrow $3.56 billion every day. We borrow 36 cents for every buck we spend. You don't need fancy charts and graphs to show anyone that is a problem. <br> Wherever we speak, whatever the audience may have thought about our plan beforehand, we get a standing ovation when we're done. And when people see us as we travel the country we get far more thumbs up than any other digit. <br> We can't spending-cut our way out of this, we can't tax our way out of it, and we can't grow our way out of it. You need to do all three. Anyone who says with a straight face that we are going to deal with our debt in a serious way without touching revenue, defense spending, Medicaid and Medicare and addressing the solvency of Social Security is either goofy or a radio talk show host. <br> Some people say to us, "It's easy for you to propose all this tough medicine, you and Erskine have nothing to lose." Well, that's true. But other commission members like Sens. Dick Durbin and Tom Coburn had a lot to lose, and they stepped right up to the plate and supported the original commission plan. <br> When Dick Durbin announced that he was supporting our plan he said he was doing so even though it contained items he "hated like the devil hates holy water" and he knew his vote for it would deeply disappoint many of his friends and allies. <br> Tom Coburn well knew he would be demonized on taxes by the zealous enforcers of ideological purity like Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. But both Tom Coburn and Dick Durbin, and a supermajority of our commission, were willing to give up something they like to protect the country they love. <br> Our nation simply cannot afford to have our elected leaders fearfully bow and scrape to the likes of Grover Norquist and the AARP. We need real leaders, courageous leaders who will place the national interest ahead of special interests. The members of the super committee as well as congressional leaders and the president must do just that. Pray for 'em! 
 In the Republicans' Las Vegas show this week, the headliner turned out to be Mitt Romney. <br> That was a surprise. Many pundits assumed it would be businessman Herman Cain, a wild card who has recently led the field in polls of Republican voters. While media elites and politicians mock Cain's 9-9-9 tax reform plan, everyday voters give him credit for at least having a plan -- and extra credit for the fact that it is easy to understand. <br> By contrast, Romney's economic plan has 59 points. Should Americans really need to hire a team of accountants to understand a candidate's sales pitch? <br> But Romney's major challenge isn't his communication strategy. Instead, it's the same thing that plagued the former Massachusetts governor in the 2008 election: Many Republican voters don't like him, trust him or relate to him. It's not, as some political observers suggest, that they don't think Romney is sufficiently conservative. Rather, it's that they don't think he's sufficiently anything. What does it matter if they agree with what he espouses about issue X or topic Y if they don't believe a word he says? <br> In the CNN debate in Las Vegas, his opponents tried to draw attention to Romney's character by accusing him -- one after another -- of being inconsistent, dishonest and untrustworthy. <br> -- Cain accused Romney of deceptively "mixing apples and oranges" when Romney, seizing on a point made earlier by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, slammed Cain's 9-9-9 plan as adding a tax burden on Nevadans or anyone else who already pays a sales tax. That state tax has to be paid anyway, Cain explained, regardless of what happens at the federal level. Romney seems to have gotten the better of Cain in that exchange, with his joke about how Americans would have a new tax -- and a bushel of both apples and oranges. But the idea that Cain pushed back against Romney's characterization probably also helped reinforce the accusation that opponents direct at Romney -- that he misleads. <br> -- Newt Gingrich tore into Romney for suggesting he had gotten the idea of an individual mandate to buy health insurance from Gingrich. "That is not true," the former House speaker said in a stern voice. The idea actually came from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. Gingrich forced Romney to walk back his comments, and the former college professor seemed to relish his role in teaching Romney a lesson: Don't exaggerate the facts. Gingrich supported the idea of a mandate, but it wasn't -- as Romney claimed -- his idea originally. Gingrich forced Romney to walk back his comments, and the former college professor seemed to relish his role in teaching Romney a lesson: Don't exaggerate the facts. He even tweaked Romney a little, commending his revised version of events with: "That's a little broader. Keep going." <br> Add it all up and you'll see that some of Romney's fellow presidential hopefuls are frustrated and fed up with his tendency to shade the truth. Most politicians do that, of course, but not all of them are equally good at it. Romney excels at it. What he's not so good at is smoothly shifting from one position to another on controversial issues such as abortion or legalizing undocumented immigrants. <br> Romney's inconsistencies grate on his opponents. They see him up-close, on stage and in their face. Look at the Las Vegas debate again and read the body language. It's clear that Romney's opponents would not buy a used car from this man. <br> While some in the media cling to the narrative that Romney "looks presidential," the message sent by some of his opponents this week was simple and direct: buyer beware. <br> To some of the practitioners in his trade, Romney is the worst kind of politician, the kind who will say anything and pretend to be anything to get elected. Remember, it's the view of many Republicans, from conservative radio talk show hosts to members of the tea party, that the current occupant of the White House is untruthful and inauthentic. Plus, many of these people probably don't see the point in replacing Obama with more of the same. <br> That would go a long way toward explaining why Romney -- despite substantial resources, a first-rate campaign organization, head-start in running for president, and the experience of having done it before -- isn't performing better in the polls. He can't seem to get much beyond 25 percent in most surveys, with three-fourths of Republicans opting for the ABR camp: "Anybody But Romney." <br> If Romney ultimately turns out to be the Republican nominee, before he can even begin to convince the American people that he can be president, he'll first have to convince them that he's authentic and that he can be trusted. <br> Good luck with that, Mitt. 
 Rick Perry is calling for a flat tax to stop his campaign from flatlining. But it might be just what he needs to revive his presidential ambitions. Because a flat tax is not just a big idea; it could prove to be both good politics and good policy. <br> After all, tax simplification is both needed and polls well, and the flat tax promises a simpler approach to paying taxes. And at a time when President Obama is campaigning against the fact that Warren Buffett and his secretary pay different rates, the flat tax idea might just have met its moment for broader-based appeal. <br> Its virtue is its simplicity. The current tax code contains more words than the Bible, and Americans spend 6 billion hours each year trying to comply with the code. That's time that can be more productively spent elsewhere. In contrast, a flat tax could be calculated during the seventh-inning stretch of a ballgame. <br> Perry's flat-tax plan, the details of which will be announced this week, may help him regain the enthusiasm of his initial tea party supporters who lately have flocked to Herman Cain. <br> Dick Armey, a former congressman and chairman of FreedomWorks, has been a longtime advocate of the flat tax, and his organization has helped fund many of the tea party rallies and given shape to the movement. This policy move will, in turn, help convince many tea partiers that Perry really is their man. It might also help reignite a spark of support from center-right think tanks that have long supported such a tax-reform but had growing doubts about Perry's commitment to fiscal conservative policy ideas outside bumper-sticker bromides. <br> Cain deserves credit for moving forward the policy debate in this presidential field. His 9-9-9 plan, a flat tax combined with a national sales tax, captured the imagination of the primary electorate and catapulted him to the top of the poll rankings. <br> In turn, it created pressure on other candidates to propose fiscal plans of their own, providing at least some details in place of play-to-the-base bumper-sticker slogans. Ron Paul put forward a trillion-dollar deficit cut, Rick Santorum proposed eliminating corporate taxes on manufacturing companies, and now Perry has gotten into the game with plans to unveil his own bold proposal. <br> The flat tax is certainly more tried and true than the 9-9-9 plan and avoids its most regressive elements, like the 9% national sales tax. The flat tax as proposed by one-time presidential candidate and Perry supporter Steve Forbes contains a family exemption for the first $36,000 for a family of four, effectively exempting the poorest Americans. <br> This doesn't need to be a polarizing idea on partisan grounds; it was advocated by California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, in his 1992 presidential campaign. And while more Americans would pay taxes under this plan, by broadening the base, we would stop the potentially destabilizing dynamic under which nearly half of Americans don't pay federal income taxes. <br> Making ideological peace with the idea of broadening the tax base could also help some conservatives move from anti-tax absolutism to a broader conversation about tax reform that could help get crippling long-term budget imbalances under control. We could lower rates to stimulate economic growth while remaining revenue neutral at a roughly 19% flat tax rate, and if it was pegged slightly higher, we could start putting a serious dent in the deficit and debt. <br> The fact that the flat tax has been backed by a prominent presidential candidate will help shape the national debate and perhaps provide some urgency to the idea of tax reform. Obama talked about tax simplification on the '08 campaign trail, and Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan have long advocated it as well. <br> Even famed Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville said on "OutFront with Erin Burnett" on Wednesday that he'd be fine with a progressive flat tax with three rates and allowances for a few core deductions while closing most loopholes. <br> Even if Perry's plan is only a base-pleasing opening bid in a larger round of tax reform, it is a step in the right direction. We need to have a serious national conversation about tax simplification that can spur economic growth. By taking the risk of putting forward a big idea, Perry just might agree: Good policy is also good politics. 
 Herman Cain claims that brainwashing explains why so few blacks support conservative Republicans such as himself. He is wrong. The thinking, sentiments, and policy preferences he supports give good cause for rejecting him. <br> In his new campaign manifesto, "This is Herman Cain: My Journey to the White House," the candidate states repeatedly and without qualification that "Our Founding Fathers did their job ... a great job." He makes no mention of the blacks who fled George Washington, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson during the Revolutionary War in search of their freedom, or the Constitution's protection of slavery, or that the initial Constitution forbade Congress from prohibiting American participation in the international slave trade for 20 years and indeed made that provision unamendable. <br> Cain evinces no recognition of the Founding Fathers' role in erecting a cruel pigmentocracy that continues to poison virtually every aspect of American political, social and cultural life. This is not an abstruse or academic matter. The president nominates federal judges. An important theory of constitutional interpretation vying for ascendancy is originalism: the notion that the Constitution should be read as originally understood by its framers. Justice Clarence Thomas is the most militant originalist on the Supreme Court. A President Cain would seek to fill the federal judiciary with more Clarence Thomases -- a prospect that most blacks rightly view with dread. <br> Asked about his impressions of the Occupy Wall Street dissidents, Cain declared: "Don't blame the big banks. If you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself " -- a statement that overlooks the desperation with which millions, a disproportionate number of whom are black, strive to stave off impoverishment and unemployment. Later, when Cain perceived the impolitic character of his comment, he tried to minimize it, asserting that he was only referring to the protesters and not to the impoverished or unemployed in general. That attempt at damage control rings false, however, especially in light of his further comment: "It is not a person's fault if they succeeded, it is a person's fault if they failed." <br> Largely located on the lower rungs of the American socioeconomic ladder, most black Americans appreciate sources of opportunity and power that Cain despises: unions, governmental support for the needy, a robust, government-supported full-employment policy, the public provision of health care. His worry, remarkably, is that America is too egalitarian. His signature policy -- the 9-9-9 tax reform proposal -- would institute a regressive consumption tax nationally and starve Social Security and Medicare. It would redistribute income upward. No wonder blacks overwhelmingly repudiate him and his tea party allies. <br> Cain also recently declared: "I don't believe racism in this country today holds anybody back in a big way." If there were any doubts before that he was bereft of the knowledge and sensibility required of a significant political figure, much less president, then this egregious statement should remove them. <br> A library full of careful, rigorous studies shows clearly that invidious racial discrimination and, perhaps even more consequentially, the perpetuation of disabilities inflicted by racial mistreatment in the past hurt blacks and other people of color in a broad array of domains: from commercial transactions like buying a car or purchasing a home, to dealing with police, to electoral politics, to wellness and life expectancy. <br> Of course, there has been remarkable, positive change in American racial attitudes. But recall the miserable baseline against which we mark that progress. In 1958, the Gallup Organization asked whether Americans would be willing to vote for a qualified black presidential candidate nominated by their own party. Three in five white Americans answered "no." <br> The election of Barack Obama is a vivid illustration of the extent to which racial attitudes have evolved. But neither Obama's residency in the White House, nor Herman Cain's current surge, nor the emergence of an African-American affluent class negates the fact that fresh racism and the unhealed wounds of racial injuries inflicted in the past give rise to conditions, observable everywhere, that dishonor the best of American ideals. It is because of Herman Cain's denial of these realities that most blacks will continue, understandably, to view him as unfit for high political office. 
 Here's one idea that could unite Main Street voters with Occupy Wall Street protesters -- raise taxes only on individuals making more than $1 million a year and use that revenue to pay for President Barack Obama's jobs bill, which is made up of bipartisan policy proposals to get the economy moving again. <br> It is an audacious idea, brewed first by Sen. Charles Schumer and backed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as preferable to the president's repeated call to roll back the Bush tax cuts on any household making more than $250,000 a year. <br> There are several reasons that this new millionaire's tax is both smart politics and smart policy. <br> First, an astounding 75% of Americans back raising taxes on individuals making more than $1 million a year, according to an October 5 Washington Post/ABC News poll. This includes 89% of Democrats, 75% of independents, 57% of Republicans and 55% of Tea Party supporters. This isn't subtle -- it's a slam-dunk. <br> The reason this resonates is because it focuses exclusively on the super-rich rather than lumping them in with upper middle class voters who might be called the working wealthy. A household income of $250,000 per year is far from jet set, especially in more expensive areas of the country, where some two-parent working families could find themselves taxed at the same rate as the local billionaire. <br> The best option of all in my book would not be a targeted surcharge but broad-based tax reform that could actually lower all rates to spur growth while closing some (but not all) loopholes to raise revenues. This is the broad goal set out by the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson commission, a vision championed by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and even once campaigned on by a candidate named Barack Obama. But expecting this divided, dysfunctional Congress to tackle anything as comprehensive as tax reform without tearing each others' throats out seems naïve in the extreme. Still, I'll keep hope alive for a simpler, fairer, flatter tax code. <br> But in its absence, we need a way to pay for a jobs plan so that it doesn't put our nation deeper into debt. A surtax on people making more than $1 million a year is one way to do it. Conservatives will claim that any such proposal is class warfare, but that reflexive attack is in danger of losing its sting because of overuse. Small business owners might have been able to identify with a $250,000 threshold, but creating a populist spin in defense of those who make more than $1 million a year will be a tougher sell. <br> Fifty-eight percent of Americans think the president's jobs plan will help the economy, according to that Washington Post/ABC News poll. And while Obama's job approval is at historic lows, he is still three times more popular than members of Congress. More to the point, the president is perceived to be more concerned about middle class Americans than the congressional GOP by a margin of 52%-32%, while the GOP is seen as more focused on the rich, by a deep margin of 70%-17% -- not a great ratio in a time of populist anger. <br> Those professional cynics who parade under the term "Washington insiders" are confidently claiming that Reid's proposal is dead on arrival, just like they did with the Bowles-Simpson and "Gang of Six" plans before it. These pronouncements help create conventional wisdom, but they are not conclusive. After all, the political impetus of this new plan is clearly related to corralling votes -- swing-state senators who would have faced greater pushback on the $250,000 rollback of the Bush tax cuts. Any Democrats who are resisting this proposal in favor of the full $250,000 are the real class warriors, supporting tax hikes out of general redistributive principle even though regions with a high cost of living would suffer. <br> With economic anxieties again increasing, taking action on at least large swaths of the jobs plan seems like a political and policy imperative, especially since the plan itself was built on proposals that have gained bipartisan support in the past. <br> Cutting corporate taxes in exchange for closing loopholes, retaining payroll tax cuts and creating a public-private infrastructure bank should retain broad support -- but real deficit hawks should recognize that these efforts need to be paid for, and cutting discretionary spending alone to deal with the deficit right now would be deeply counterproductive in terms of overall economic growth. <br> A surtax on the super-rich is the least painful way to do that in the short term -- it's not class warfare as much as a call for additional sacrifice from those who can most afford it to help get our country moving again. 
 They just don't get it. <br> Two months after playing partisan chicken with the debt-ceiling limit and leading directly to a U.S. downgrade, our dysfunctional divided Congress was at it again -- carelessly bringing the country to the brink of a government shutdown. <br> This time the debate was over disaster-relief spending. Republicans wanted to ensure that any extra money needed for FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Irene would be matched by cuts in spending elsewhere. The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the House bill as a form of extortion and so the stalemate continued through the weekend, bringing FEMA within days of being insolvent. Ultimately, the two parties came to an agreement that funded FEMA but simply kicked the prospect of a government shutdown to right before Thanksgiving. <br> It used to be that at least a disaster could unite Congress to think beyond party politics. But we are living in a time where extreme measures are used every day. The threat of a government shutdown is seen as negotiating leverage. Threat of filibuster has gone from a rare event to a routine parliamentary procedure. <br> There is no question why Washington is broken. The two parties have become so polarized they seem unable to reason together. Special interests threaten to eclipse the national interest. <br> Hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from being able to solve the serious problems we face. <br> That was the unambiguous message Standard Poor's sent the United States with its downgrade in August that specifically cited an atmosphere of partisan gamesmanship. It was echoed by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- a Bush and Obama appointee -- in remarks at the Jackson Hole conference in Wyoming. We have a political crisis, which is compounding the fiscal crisis. <br> This is not an elite concern, but a problem increasingly recognized by everyday Americans far away from the Beltway. <br> "Members of Congress are intelligent but they have no common sense," Darlene Swithers of Pennsylvania recently told The New York Times. "They fight too much. They should be put in a corner and take a time out and start working together as a team. I'm so sick of hearing Republicans this and Democrats that." <br> This is the articulation of the impulse that led 77% of Americans to tell CNN that Congress acts like "spoiled children" rather than responsible adults. <br> This latest flirtation with a government shutdown just shows how tone-deaf Congress has become. House Republicans played politics with disaster relief and felt that they would be rewarded by their base if they do so. Their all-or-nothing mindset leads them to the logic that Democrats will be to blame for a shutdown if they simply refuse to do what Republicans demand. <br> What's doubly dumb about this particular battle is that it is over relatively small change -- some $2.5 billion in disaster relief at a time when a bipartisan joint super committee is struggling to find a minimum of $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction. President Obama and Speaker John Boehner and 35 senators have encouraged the super-committee to go bigger -- to $4 trillion in deficit and debt reduction -- the amount almost achieved by so-called grand bargain that failed to materialize in August. Bipartisan committees like Bowles-Simpson and the Gang of Six -- as well as a plan proposed by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan -- also set out different paths to a $4 trillion savings, bringing us to a more sound fiscal footing. <br> We know what such a step will require: spending cuts and some revenue increases, best achieved with tax reform and entitlement reform. The far right opposes any tax increases while the far-left opposes any entitlement reform. But there should still be room to reason together. For example, one solution would be to cut tax rates but close select loopholes, allowing higher revenue to be raised from lower rates. Unfortunately, some folks on the far-right have decided that raising revenue at all will be considered a tax-hike and a violation of the anti-tax pledge. That all-or-nothing logic threatens to doom the deliberations that democratic republics depend on. <br> It doesn't have to be this way. For most of the 20th century, congressional voting patterns were clustered toward the center -- the presence of conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans allowed for creative across-the-aisle coalitions. But in the past two decades, as the parties have become more ideologically and geographically stratified, the capacity for coalition building has decreased. The rigged system of redistricting and closed partisan primaries have helped further polarize the process as centrists are pushed out of both parties. <br> Likewise, in the past divided government has not meant dysfunction. America accomplished the Marshall Plan and the National Highway System under divided government during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. The achievements of the Reagan era came with liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill at the helm of the House of Representatives. The two men disagreed deeply on political philosophy, but they had the capacity to disagree agreeably, sit together and tell stories at the end of the day. (And not incidentally, Reagan and O'Neill were able to form a bipartisan commission to help fix social security in the 1980s by requiring both parties to jump in together). Even Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich found ways to work together despite intense personal dislike, achieving welfare reform and turning deficits into a surplus. <br> But now, politics is increasingly seen as ideological blood sport and a zero-sum game. The parties are willing to politicize disaster relief and bring our nation to the brink of default. They oppose even bipartisan plans for fear that the other side might gain politically. Trust is eroded and replaced with the demonization of disagreement. This approach is fundamentally incompatible with the facts of divided government, which requires some degree of compromise based on defining common ground and then building on it. <br> Some hyper-partisans in Washington are simply looking to the next election to solve these problems. But the problem of extreme partisanship is bigger than one election. During this cancer in our body politic will require a cultural change. It will require actively supporting responsible voices in both parties. It will require pushing for policies like redistricting reform and open primaries. There need to be procedural reforms in congress as well -- for example, ending the special interest weapon of "secret holds" and requiring that filibusters be conducted in person. <br> In a larger sense, we need to rediscover some forgotten wisdom from the founding fathers. As Thomas Jefferson said in his first inaugural address, after a bitterly hard-fought campaign, "every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle." We need to remember what President Lyndon Johnson used to say: "I am an American, a Texan, and a Democrat -- in that order." <br> We have been through much tougher times as a nation before and emerged stronger. The danger today is that this crisis is self-inflicted and self-indulgent. The parties need to remember that they are not the purpose of our politics -- and even though they might be polarized, the vast majority of the American people are not. 
 There is a popular misconception in politics today that the American political system is broken because Washington can't accomplish anything meaningful. This is not true. The system is working entirely as intended -- bumps, bruises, and all. <br> One must not confuse broken government with slow government. Washington is stalled. It's being pulled in opposite directions by competing visions of government. In 2008, the American people elected a liberal president, House and Senate. What resulted was anything but gridlock. Democrats passed an unprecedented stimulus package, Obama Care, and the Frank-Dodd bill. In 2010, the country revolted, swung back to the right and elected a conservative House, the likes of which has not been seen before. <br> As a result, we are in the midst of a serious philosophical battle over the future of this country -- a battle between a small, limited government system and a big government entitlement state. The nature of our Constitution requires that the American people decide the direction of this country, not Washington. And until the American people decide, there will be arguments, division and gridlock. <br> Our country does not undergo dramatic changes in political philosophy, for better or for worse, overnight. It is a slow, painful process and has been throughout our history. Our Founding Fathers foresaw this. <br> In Federalist No. 10 James Madison wrote, "The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man. ... A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power ... have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good." <br> For this reason, the Founders constructed a democratic republic that requires national dialogue in order to form consensus on crucial issues. At stake today are two serious debates: one over a nationalized health care system that will fundamentally change the direction of this country, and a second over record levels of government spending sure to redraw our political landscape for many years to come. <br> The arena for that debate is not always pretty and the results are not always good, but the American people get it right over time. As Charles Krauthammer recently wrote, "This is the future of government-worker power and the solvency of the states. It deserves big, serious, animated public debate." <br> Much of the ire of this debate is directed at the tea party, a grass-roots conservative populace whose arrival has put a restraining order on Washington's spending and growth. Since the historic Republican victories in the 2010 elections, the tea party and Democrats have locked horns over every major policy decision, from taxes to spending to health care. <br> Critics of the tea party lay the blame on them as the do-nothing obstructionists. But unlike the events we saw in Madison, Wisconsin, the tea party has slowed and even reversed the course of Washington all within the bounds of the political system. Other critics of the tea party have gone so far as to label their resistance to President Obama's agenda as racist, most recently actor Morgan Freeman. Those accusations do nothing to help improve the national debate and "fix" Washington. It is odd, too, when the tea party just helped Herman Cain surge to victory in Florida's latest straw poll. <br> Moreover, there are steps that both parties can take to improve the status quo in Washington. Bipartisan agreements are on the table, such as free trade agreements and corporate tax reform, which can, and should, be passed. But the real debate over spending, entitlement reform and health care will not be settled anytime soon. <br> Without this debate, which is sure to get uglier and nastier, we wouldn't be having a national discussion about the long-term sustainability of ballooning entitlements. We wouldn't recognize the crisis of our exploding federal deficit. And we wouldn't acknowledge the need for fiscal restraint and responsibility. <br> Don't mistake broken government for the growing pains of a democratic republic. In the end, a slow, restrained government is a more thoughtful, careful, and hopefully good, government. 
 In a call to action on the American economy, President Obama entered a deeply divided U.S. Capitol on Thursday to propose a decidedly bipartisan package of policies backed with an urgent message: "Pass this bill now." <br> The address before a joint session of Congress was greeted with now-routine hyperpartisan skepticism, even before its contents were announced. But this was not a windy inspirational speech; instead it was a direct policy appeal full of specifics. <br> The biggest takeaway is that all the major policies the president proposed were rooted in past bipartisan support. That good faith effort to bridge the deep partisan divides in Washington deserves something more than predictable spin -- and, in turn, the American people deserve some concerted action on the economy from Congress. <br> There were flashes of clear common ground. Among the policy proposals greeted with rare bursts of cross-aisle applause were proposals to form a public-private infrastructure bank, cut the corporate tax rate while closing loopholes, pass free trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, and institute tax incentives for corporations to hire veterans returning home from war. <br> The Infrastructure Bank is emblematic of the opportunity at hand. There is already bipartisan legislation introduced in the Senate, backed by Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry and Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. Its supporters include such unlikely allies as the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. By leveraging $10 billion in federal money as seed loans -- not grants -- the bank is expected to generate up to $600 billion in economic activity, putting people to work at projects that will strengthen communities for decades to come. Critics might cry crony-capitalism, but this is as close as Washington gets to a win-win. <br> To be sure, there were plenty of areas of difference, where Democrats applauded while Republicans sat on their hands, and vice-versa. The president promised that the plan would be paid for by further cuts and a combination of tax reform and entitlement reforms. The devil will be in the details. The Joint Super-Committee was challenged to increase its own savings mandate from $1.5 trillion as part of that effort, but President Obama also announced that his administration would be putting forward an ambitious deficit reduction plan as a way of encouraging action and framing the debate. <br> He'll need to put forward an equally bold and bipartisan deficit reduction proposal, because the American Job Creation Act's estimated $450 billion price tag will provoke some rote "Stimulus II" criticism, and independent voters in particular have wised up to the fact that throwing federal money at a problem doesn't solve it. <br> Significantly, the president also spoke of the need to reform Medicare spending as a way of preserving the long-term strength of the system -- a necessity he acknowledged might alienate liberals, but in the process echoing conservative arguments to such an extent that Sen. Lindsey Graham was moved to stand up and applaud. <br> Any observer of the debt ceiling dysfunction over the summer would not get over-excited about the possibility of rational cooperation breaking out in Congress. Nonetheless, it was hopeful and heartening to hear both House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor acknowledge in interviews after the speech that there was room to work together on some of these proposals. <br> The current atmosphere is so poisonous and polarized that some Democrats were wondering whether Republicans would even oppose extending payroll tax cuts simply because they came from this president, a concern that Obama even joked about. But that level of cynicism will end up backfiring on Republicans. As weak as the president's poll numbers are, he is still much more popular than either Republicans or Democrats in Congress. <br> The audience for this speech wasn't just the assembled members of Congress -- it was the squeezed middle class and struggling small businesses that feel forgotten by Washington and frustrated by the overwhelming influence of special interests. Their anger at both big business and big government is one of the defining dynamics of our political time. A fired up President Obama persuasively made the case that inaction in the face of such economic uncertainty was itself an unacceptable cost. <br> "The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy," the president asked. The answer will be determined by the follow through in this divided government. The common ground has been defined; now it is the obligation of Congress to build upon it. Their willingness to do so will be determined by whether they hear from frustrated constituents wielding a simple message: Stop fighting and start fixing. <br> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon. <br> <em> 
 Pakistan, and Pakistani-American relations, confront their worst crises in recent memory. <br> Pakistan's economy is in free fall, and its major cities are wracked by political violence, while Pakistani attitudes toward the United States have never been worse -- a legacy of the CIA contractor who shot and killed two Pakistanis in the city of Lahore this year, the campaign of drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal regions and the unilateral American raid to kill Osama bin Laden in northern Pakistan in May. <br> On the U.S. side, there is considerable anger about Pakistan's unwillingness or inability to constrain Taliban groups based on its territory that are killing American soldiers in Afghanistan and a perception that while U.S. aid flows in large amounts to Pakistan, it continues to harbor enemies of America. <br> As a result, the rupture in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship may be the most serious ever. Some members of Congress are calling for the freezing of U.S. aid to Pakistan, while the Pakistani government has demanded that U.S. Special Forces troops who have been training elements of its armed forces return home. <br> A further rupture in relations between the two countries would mean placing crippling constraints on American aid, ending dialogue and curtailing cooperation on attacking terrorists. <br> Pakistan is the second most populous nation in the Muslim world and is armed with nuclear weapons. The United States cannot allow such an important country and an ally of the past three decades to become an enemy. <br> In fact, the two nations have many interests in common. The U.S. counterterrorism program in South Asia would be crippled without Pakistan's help. And fostering a stable and prosperous Pakistan would reduce the risks of a nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan, which has been a central goal of American statecraft since the late 1990s. <br> The general consensus in Washington, in fact, though not endorsing more extreme calls for an outright divorce, appears to hold that the only realistic strategy for rebuilding U.S.-Pakistan relations is gradual, long-term and qualified. Such an argument is hardly unreasonable, given the mutual antagonism and distrust that exists today. <br> Yet we do not agree. Waiting on events, we fear, could invite new crises and a more fundamental break in the relationship. <br> Instead, we propose a new basis for a revised yet lasting U.S.-Pakistan partnership: a collaborative agenda for Pakistan to take its place as a major power in a modernizing South Asia. <br> This concept, which we developed together with a study group of Pakistani economists, journalists and former government officials as well as their American counterparts with considerable experience in Pakistan, calls for actions within Pakistan to build the social, political and economic basis for this vision, as well as a U.S. commitment to support this agenda with critical actions -- on trade, peacemaking and technical support. <br> One important step would be a shift from a relationship in which the U.S. sends aid to Pakistan to one in which the emphasis is on trade that benefits both sides. <br> Textiles constitute 60% of Pakistani exports, half its manufacturing output and a third of its industrial employment. Yet Pakistani textiles make up less than 4% of U.S. textile imports. <br> We recommend a new effort to reduce the disproportionately high American tariffs on Pakistani textiles — as well as parallel programs to enhance U.S. and international foreign direct investment in a range of Pakistani industries — as an alternative to most U.S. civilian aid, which theoretically could amount to as much as $1.5 billion a year if all the aid available to Pakistan was actually disbursed. <br> Efforts to lower taxes on Pakistani textiles have foundered in the past because of opposition in Congress and from U.S. manufacturers, but if this effort was tied to reduced U.S. aid, it might have a better chance of being implemented. <br> On security matters, extremism and terrorism threaten both nations. Yet there is a tendency for both sides to operate in secret, from Pakistani support for militant groups who are killing American soldiers in Afghanistan to U.S. covert operations in Pakistan and drone strikes in the Pakistani tribal regions. <br> This only sets the stage for public outrage when secret activities are revealed without being grounded in the fundamental strategic justification, the shared threat that warrants working together. <br> So the time has come for the two governments to move toward joint, sustainable actions — against terrorism, militancy and insurgency — that can be agreed upon and defended in the public sphere. <br> Pakistani concerns about civilian casualties and infringements of their national sovereignty caused by American drones could be addressed with a more transparent drone program, perhaps involving the public release of some drone video footage, as well as more public explication about why certain individuals have been targeted by drones. all done more clearly under Pakistani government guidance. <br> After all, the war against the militants in the tribal regions is Pakistan's more than America's, and polling in those regions indicates that if the Pakistani military were seen as more directly responsible for the drone program, opposition to it would subside dramatically. <br> Pakistan must also get its own house in order. Economic growth has fallen to less than 3%, and inflation has run in double digits for years, reaching a peak of over 20% in 2008-09, while Pakistan has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world, with less than 2% of the population paying income tax. <br> Pakistan needs to make good on long-delayed tax reform that would boost state revenues and to pursue steps to improve the climate for foreign investment. The motivation for Pakistan to do that is the parlous state of its economy; if it maintains a 3% growth rate, given its high birth rate, the economic conditions of the Pakistani people, which are already bad, will steadily worsen. <br> We also recommend initiatives to accelerate trade throughout South Asia. Improved trade with India represents a natural source of potential growth for Pakistan and a way to ease tensions between the two states. <br> Just as after World War II former enemies France and Germany created the coal and steel common market that spawned the European Union, the more India, Pakistan and other regional players collaborate along economic lines, the more troubling political issues will be seen as nuisances in the way of an emerging regional prosperity. <br> A number of short-term initiatives could jump-start this process: allowing multiple-entry visas for businesspeople, easing restrictions on direct shipping and on rail and air links, and allowing Indian and Pakistani banks to open branches in each other's countries. <br> This will take political will in Pakistan amongst its politicians and the military, which retains a veto over all matters relating to national security. <br> Political will also have to be exercised on the U.S. side to sustain faith in a challenging but essential partnership with Pakistan. The relationship has certainly had its bad patches, but it's one that neither side can live without. <br> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. <br> <em> 
 The formula is simple: When the economy accelerates, employers compete for employees and wages increase. I experienced this during my 17 years as CEO of a national quick-service restaurant chain. The stronger the economy, the harder it was to get good employees. Conversely, when growth is weak, as it was during most of the Obama presidency, employees compete for jobs and wages stagnate. <br> President Trump’s regulatory rollback is driving an economic surge few anticipated. Tax reform promises to accelerate that growth by encouraging business investment and eliminating the perverse incentives that drive companies, jobs and investments to other countries. The true test for these pro-growth policies is whether they result in a more participatory economy, in which workers’ incomes meaningfully increase over the long run. The early results are promising. 
 In school, I liked math the least and history the most. Both can be useful in the coming debate over President Trump’s proposed tax reforms. <br> The one thing I learned in math class is that if the formula is wrong, the answer will be wrong. In history class I learned we are not the first people to occupy the planet and that the experiences of those who came before us can be helpful when considering contemporary issues. <br> There is another formula which, when tried, has succeeded. It worked for John F. Kennedy, who cut taxes; ditto for Ronald Reagan (yes, he also raised taxes but by then economic growth was such that they did not have a negative effect). <br> In Robert Sobel’s biography, “Coolidge: An American Enigma,” these quotes from the 30th president are highlighted: “I am convinced that the larger incomes of the country would actually yield more revenue to the government if the basis of taxation were scientifically revised downward.” <br> That was Reagan’s belief long before “supply-side economics” acquired its name. <br> About public debt, which has just passed $20 trillion and would have appalled him, Coolidge said: “Public debt (is) a burden on all the people.” Coolidge left office with a surplus. <br> President Trump should start reading the indecipherable tax code aloud at public events and say, “This is what your Congress has done to you.” He should bring people on stage to tell their stories of how high taxes have harmed, even ruined, their businesses. These should include people who have lost family farms handed down through generations because of the estate, or “death tax,” which forced them to sell the land in order to pay the government. 
 I’m not in the habit of giving stock tips or making market calls. I’ve never claimed to be an investment strategist. But after spending years reporting on business and finance, I was convinced on the night of Nov. 8, 2016, that the conventional market wisdom was way off target. <br> As the night wore on and equity traders began to grasp that Donald Trump would become president, stock markets around the world started selling off. In the U.S., trading in SP 500 futures would eventually be halted after a 5% decline. After midnight, Paul Krugman of the New York Times<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/paul-krugman-the-economic-fallout" target="_blank">opined: “If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never.” 
 For many Americans the legacy of the Obama economy is sluggish growth, stagnant paychecks and missed opportunities. A lost generation of workers still struggle with the consequences of the Great Recession and find it nearly impossible to get ahead. One of the biggest obstacles to their success has been our nation’s complex and outdated tax code. For too long it has dragged down our economy and taken too much from their paychecks. <br> That’s why the Republican-led Senate passed a critical tax reform bill that will help make America an economic powerhouse again. We did that by putting more money into the pockets of hardworking families and small businesses, creating more jobs and economic opportunity, and taking steps to ensure that jobs and business stay in America. This was a once-in-a-generation opportunity that we could not let pass. 
 It’s been more than three decades since Congress has worked with the White House to modernize the nation’s outdated tax system. But that is all about to change. <br> Over the last several months, lawmakers in both chambers have laid the groundwork for historic tax reform. And it all started with the budget process, within the Budget Committee that I chair in the House of Representatives. <br> However, it wasn’t until both chambers agreed to the same budget that conservative tax reform could begin in earnest. For that reason, I often called passage of the budget the “golden key” to unlock tax reform. Without the budget, we couldn’t advance or expand on the tax reform framework that received praise from President Donald Trump when it was unveiled earlier this fall. <br> The good news is that things are steadily moving along. Following agreement to the same budget in both chambers at the end of October, we swiftly rolled out comprehensive tax reform legislation in the House: the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” Earlier this month, the House Committee on Ways and Means, of which I am also a member, was hard at work getting the bill ready for the floor. After four full days of productive dialogue and fine-tuning the text, I was proud to see it approved by the committee. I was even prouder to see it passed on the House floor. <br> In our tax reform plan, we help low and middle-class Americans see more of their hard-earned paychecks by lowering tax rates and doubling the standard deduction for individuals and married couples. For an average middle-class family of four, that translates to nearly $1,200 off their taxes. We also establish a new Family Credit that raises the Child Tax Credit and introduces new credits for family members and other dependents. The tax code also becomes less confusing and less cumbersome, making it possible for most Americans to file their taxes on a simple post card. 
 The American people are anxious for our elected officials in Washington to end their rancor and dysfunction and start accomplishing things. <br> A recent Gallup Poll asked whether Americans preferred leaders who compromise to get things done, or ones who stick to their principles – even if little gets done. The problem solvers were favored over the obstructionists by 54 percent to 18 percent. <br> The House recently passed its version of a tax cut bill and the Senate is aiming to do the same as soon as Thursday. The Senate bill, however, is being tied to the thorny issue of health care, looking to repeal the mandate for individuals to have health insurance. <br> In May, members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, which features 46 members – half from each political party – announced their willingness to work on a bipartisan deal combining tax reform with infrastructure investment. <br> What’s best for the country is not a tax reform effort that mirrors this year’s health-care “debate,” in which one party (the Republicans) tried repeatedly to ram through a repeal with only GOP votes. Democrats were mostly content to sit on the sideline throwing stones. That’s not leadership by either party. <br> If leaders on either side are really interested in governing – as opposed to posturing and futile gestures – there is actually an opening for a broad bipartisan and transformative tax plan that reflects favorably on both parties and most importantly helps grow the economy and creates jobs. <br> Among the countless problems with the current tax code: It’s complex. It’s unfair. Most of the deductions and loopholes benefit upper income individuals and businesses. And, it’s uncompetitive, with a corporate tax system that actively discourages investment in the U.S. <br> Done right, tax reform could bring a big share of this money home for investment here. The new tax revenue could be used to fund major infrastructure investments in new roads, better air travel, an updated power grid and other priorities, which according to the same Harvard-Harris poll, enjoys 84 percent public support. <br> It isn’t just the Problem Solvers Caucus that has endorsed this idea. In 2015, House Speaker Paul Ryan and now Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were reportedly closing in on a deal that would have combined tax reform and infrastructure investment. <br> So, what’s standing in the way of this deal happening? Nothing, other than bad habits and blind partisanship. <br> Hatch would know. He is one of the few members of Congress who was there in 1986, when Congress last passed a comprehensive tax reform package. That bill passed 97-3 in the Senate, an almost unimaginable margin in today’s bitterly divided capitol. 
 Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult. <br> While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive. <br> Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more. <br> About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women. <br> This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.” <br> On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent. <br> Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible. <br> This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality. <br> As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose. 
 Will Senator Bob Corker torch tax reform? That is the speculation of the New York Times, the Washington Post and other liberal outlets. Pundits suggest that Trump’s recent Twitter battle with Corker might drive the offended Tennessee senator to vote against the White House’s proposed tax package. <br> That says a lot more about Bob Corker than it does about Donald Trump. <br> On the campaign trail in 2006, Corker promised to “ensure that government works with entrepreneurs and businesses, rather than against them. By reducing the burden of taxation, litigation, and regulation, American entrepreneurs will be better able to create exciting new businesses and good-paying jobs.” <br> Trump is not the first to fall short of Corker’s expectations. He spent the past decade blasting President Obama’s lack of leadership, eventually writing an op-ed for the Washington Post entitled “Obama is an Unreliable Ally.” In that 2014 piece Corker wrote about Obama’s wavering on Syria, Libya, our “tepid response to Russian aggression in Ukraine” and elsewhere, concluding, “This U.S. president, despite his bold pronouncements and moral posturing, cannot be counted on.” He took Obama to task for issuing “plenty of tough statements” about Russia, but failing to follow up. <br> In short, he echoed Trump’s disdain for Obama’s weak-kneed overseas engagements. But now he has shifted gears, alarmed by Trump’s bellicose warnings to North Korea and threats to topple the Iran nuclear accord. Those positions are surprising in light of his 2006 campaign statements that “Iran and North Korea pose exceptional dangers because of their possession of nuclear materials and our relations with these nations should be a top foreign policy priority. We must be firm in our insistence that Iran and North Korea renounce any nuclear weapons programs and we should stay focused on solving this problem in the near term.” <br> Meanwhile, the only progress made in hemming in North Korea has taken place recently, under President Trump. Helped by his assertion that all options are on the table, including military, the White House has bullied the world into jointly enacting, for the first time, serious sanctions. His missile strike on Syria, carried out while entertaining Chinese President Xi Jinping, unsettled the Chinese and drove them to take his bluster seriously. Key to any success, the Chinese finally appear to be pressuring their rogue neighbor. <br> We shall see. In the meantime, Corker’s dim view of Trump’s aggression towards our enemies and erratic management style should not deter him from voting in favor of much-needed tax reform. Proposals to lighten the tax burden on corporations and small businesses are an important step towards accelerating our growth and creating more jobs. <br> Given that there will be widely divergent estimates of how lower taxes will impact the economy and the budget deficit, Corker will have cover for however he votes. Democrats can be counted on to discount any additional growth to come from reduced taxes, which will drive up estimated revenue shortfalls. Others will forecast a more positive impact from simplifying and reducing taxes, and from encouraging corporations to invest more in the U.S. <br> Maybe that is why another poll showed 77 percent of Tennessee Republicans trust Trump, but only 40 percent have confidence in their senator. 
 Dan Mitchell has been waiting a long time for tax reform. In 1986, he was a young free-market economist working for Senator Bob Packwood, the Finance Committee chairman who helped carry Ronald Reagan’s bold tax reform across the finish line into law. The lower rates and simplified tax code embodied in that law set the stage for the economic growth of the 1990s. <br> Since then, the tax code has once again become encrusted with special interest barnacles and higher tax rates. <br> The House bill will now go over to the Senate, which has to pass its own version and then reconcile it with the House bill before anything reaches President Trump’s desk for his signature. That’s a lot of moving parts and much can go wrong, but it looks as if we are on the cusp of real tax reform. <br> The three major elements of both the House and Senate bill are: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharp reduction in the amount of double taxation of business so as to enable more saving and investment. <br> The reason why those goals have been so difficult to achieve in the last 30 years is that special interests are very good at guarding their own part of the tax code turf. <br> Campaign contributions will flow to opponents of reform. If the opposition to tax reform were a movie it would be dubbed “Revenge of the Swamp Creatures.” 
 Women in public office oftenmakewomen and their families a focus of their work. They put aside partisanship to support positive ideas that are meant to help women in the home, school, workforce, and the economy. <br> Now is an important moment to unite across the aisle and to encourage their male colleagues to make good onpast promises of tax relief to American families.

 Editor's note:The following column first appeared in<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-let-red-state-democrats-off-the-hook-on-tax-reform/2017/10/25/1021d118-b90b-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?utm_term=.b04863cea621" target="_blank">The Washington Post. <br> When Republicans brought<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/10/19/republicans-have-the-budget-votes-they-need-but-democrats-prepare-to-make-it-painful/?utm_term=.00ccae65441a" target="_blank" title="www.washingtonpost.com">their budgetto the Senate floor last week, they were bracing for what is known on Capitol Hill as a “vote-a-rama,” in which Democrats would keep the Senate in session until the wee hours, forcing Republicans to cast dozens of politically toxic votes on everything from gun control to legalizing the immigration status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients. <br> Why? Because they knew that what was toxic for Republicans would be even more toxic for vulnerable Senate Democrats running for reelection in states President Trump won by double digits. Democrats are deeply worried about the fates of Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia (which Trump won by 42 points), Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota (which Trump won by 36), Jon Tester of Montana (20), Claire McCaskill of Missouri (19) and Joe Donnelly of Indiana (19). If Trump can pick off some or all of these seats, then he could finally have what he needs to pass key legislation with GOP votes alone. And the Democrats’ chances of taking control of the Senate two years later in 2020 could slip away. <br> For a while, it appeared Trump was actively courting these Democrats. In September,<a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-smiles-manchin-dinner" target="_blank" title="www.rollcall.com">he hosted Heitkamp, Manchin and Donnellyfor dinner at the White House to discuss tax reform. That same month, he<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/09/06/in-north-dakota-trump-calls-embattled-democratic-sen-heidi-heitkamp-a-good-woman/?utm_term=.58afe5f7c9c3" target="_blank" title="www.washingtonpost.com">invitedHeitkamp to travel with him on Air Force One to a tax rally in North Dakota, where he declared her a “good woman” and said his supporters are “for you, 100 percent.” A few weeks later, he did it again, this time inviting Donnelly aboard Air Force One for a speech in Indiana unveiling the framework of his tax plan. There he took a sharper edge,<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/27/trump-joe-donnelly-tax-reform-243224" target="_blank" title="www.politico.com">warning“If Sen. Donnelly doesn’t approve it . . . we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe,” adding “I think we’ll have numerous Democrats come across because it’s the right thing to do.” All good. <br> But after this initial burst of activity, it looks as if Trump may be giving up. “It’ll be hard getting the Democrats because they are obstructionists and they vote in blocs,”<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/10/18/vulnerable-democratic-senators-want-more-details-gop-tax-plan/" target="_blank" title="morningconsult.com">he told the Heritage Foundation last week, “but if we get the Republicans we need, which is virtually every single one of them . . . you will see things happen like have never happened before.” <br> If he turns up the pressure, he wins, no matter what. If the Democrats capitulate, tax reform will almost certainly pass — giving Trump the major legislative victory that has so far eluded him. If they vote against him in spite of such a campaign, then Trump has teed up the GOP for big gains in the Senate. 
 As President Donald Trump redoubles his efforts to fulfill campaign promises on tax reform, a critical part of his program is in jeopardy of being discarded, as a result of the efforts of uninformed or self-interested business lobbies. <br> The measure under attack is a proposal to increase taxes on importers of foreign goods and reduce taxes on exporters of American goods. It must be restored if tax reform is to achieve its objectives of stimulating investment, preventing American companies from continuing to off-shore RD and manufacturing, and avoiding increases in the deficit. <br> Companies that do stay home get to keep such a small share of returns on their capital that they cannot afford to make investments that would be good for everyone. <br> According to the National Science Foundation, business RD spending is now three times as large as government RD, but since 2010 the basic research share of RD has declined.&nbsp; Basic research is the place where innovations start, and needs the most encouragement. <br> Lowering tax rates would improve the profitability of all long-term investments, and the payoffs from RD are among the most long-term of all. <br> Another tax reform proposal, to eliminate the deductibility of interest paid by corporations, would level the playing field for high-tech companies with large RD budgets, because these high-risk investments cannot be financed with loans. &nbsp;Failures are as common as success in the early stages of innovation, and require investors to spread those risks across a portfolio of projects rather than lenders who require collateral and assurance of repayment. <br> Finally, the RD tax credit is one of the two current business tax credits retained in the reform proposals. <br> What the measure sought to redress is the fact that other countries try to attract RD centers by offering extremely low tax rates on income generated by RD activities, including income from patents and licensing of new products as well as income from manufacturing them. <br> When U.S. companies relocate overseas in response to these inducements, they avoid almost all taxes by hiring workers and keeping profits overseas while exporting manufactured goods back to the United States. <br> The border adjustment was intended to fix this by eliminating the opportunity to deduct payments for imports, including payments for foreign patents, from business income. <br> The whole package of lower taxes, a level playing field in capital markets, continued RD tax credits and the border adjustment would provide powerful incentives to invest in RD within the United States and to produce here the new and better goods that are the fruits of RD. <br> Executives from Walmart, Target, and other big retail chains and off-shoring manufacturers like Nike descended en masse on Republican senators of the states in which they had headquarters to extract promises to oppose the border adjustments. <br> The damage had been done by the time Chairman Brady and a number of economists correctly pointed out that the brunt of the import adjustment would be borne primarily by foreign companies which would have to adjust their prices downward in order to maintain market share for the foreign-made products they sell into the United States. <br> In other words, no real increase in consumer prices would be likely to occur. <br> We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform the tax code in a way that will stimulate innovation and productivity growth for decades to come. 
 We’re more than two weeks from Halloween, yet the mainstream media is already itching to give the American people a mighty good fright, spinning President Trump’s desperately needed tax reform<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.treasury.gov_press-2Dcenter_press-2Dreleases_Documents_Tax-2DFramework.pdfd=DwMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=zPCRl7zn3fwNXu2CRlz8uhIbaQDLe4pv5YJCS1yKHzos=pKDh8N6egXScB0klEoUBzY9BhvgfA36WPz40qzTMNcse=" target="_blank">framework as rash, ill-conceived and even dangerous. <br> At the same time, the president has been barnstorming across the rust belt and his tax reform plan has been met with enthusiastic approval by energized audiences. This show that our country’s elites still – nearly on year after the election – don’t have a darn clue what matters to real, hardworking Americans. <br> Republicans in Congress have to get off their duffs and start supporting the leader who was elected to remake Washington. They blew the opportunity (several times) to eliminate one of the most egregious violations of personal liberty in modern history – ObamaCare. Their failure dissipated a lot of the momentum that could finally make the federal government responsive to its citizens. <br> President Trump’s tax reform framework contains several major provisions, all of which bring a much-needed quality to The Swamp: simplicity. <br> Forking over our money to the IRS just so it can be flushed down into an opaque, bottomless pit of bureaucratic ineptitude is infuriating enough. On top of this, the Tax Foundation estimates that Americans collectively spent $147 billion last year to prepare business income tax returns and $99 billion preparing individual income tax returns. The IRS estimates that we spent a total of 8.9 billion hours complying with tax-filing requirements. <br> Another perfectly sensible proposal is killing the death tax, which unceremoniously celebrated its centennial last year. A Gallup<a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/190067/americans-react-presidential-candidates-tax-proposals.aspx?g_source=Election%202016g_medium=newsfeedg_campaign=tiles" target="_blank">polllast year found that 54 percent of Americans want it eliminated. The tax has a devastating impact on the economy by increasing costs on small businesses. <br> The president’s tax reform framework further aims to help American businesses regain their competitive edge in a globalized economy increasingly stacked against them. It advises considering methods to reduce corporate double taxation, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, and lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. <br> Fortunately, President Trump is brave enough to clutch third rails with both hands. Having a president ready and willing to buck convention means the chance for the GOP to pivot finally – and go big. <br> “Kicking the can down the road” doesn’t adequately express the continual unwillingness of our elected officials to tackle the systemic problems of Social Security. A can might get dented from being kicked, but its weight doesn’t change. 
 The American people are frustrated and rightly so. Tens of millions of Americans came together and elected the ultimate political outsider Donald Trump president of the United States in 2016. This was a continuation of the message sent by voters in 2010 and again in 2014 that Washington, D.C., is broken.&nbsp; <br> Now nine months into the reform-minded Trump administration, that feeling of frustration is palpable and growing with each day.&nbsp; It’s growing because Republican leaders in Congress can’t seem to get their act together to keep their promises to the American people and pass the president’s conservative reform agenda. The Republican majority is Congress is not enormous but it’s large enough to pass the big ticket items that virtually every member of the House and Senate caucuses has supported and campaigned on over the years. <br> I sincerely hope that history does not repeat itself with tax reform. Republican Senator Bob Corker has long supported tax reform for his overtaxed constituents in Tennessee. His constituents sent him to Washington to now deliver on the conservative agenda that eluded them during the Obama years. Tennesseans delivered their electoral votes to Donald Trump with an overwhelming 61 percent of the vote. 
 As President Trump travels to Indiana this week, stumping to reduce a corporate tax rate that is the highest in the world and a full 10 points higher than the global average, predictable critics on the far left have dusted off the tired “corporate welfare” refrain. The class warfare page in the their playbook is getting a little dog-eared, and it’s holding our economy and our workers back. It’s past time for Congress to put aside rhetoric and partisan bickering and work together to strengthen America’s ability to compete globally. <br> It’s true that taxes are necessary to fund the services we expect from government. But excessive taxation kills innovation, economic growth, and job creation while holding back wages. <br> As the author of Indiana’s corporate tax reforms, I can tell you with confidence that the Hoosier state’s experience stands as an instructive example as we enter the national debate. During the depth of the Great Recession, legislative leaders in Indiana engaged in a thoughtful, bi-partisan dialogue about ways to strengthen our economy, encourage job creation and attract investment. We recognized that Indiana’s comparatively high corporate tax rate hurt efforts to attract new business growth, and, to make matters worse, much of our corporate tax burden was being shouldered by thousands of small and mid-sized Hoosier businesses that lacked the legions of accountants and lawyers to shelter income and lower effective rates like the big names of the Fortune 100. <br> While Indiana lowered business taxes by nearly 50 percent, our neighbors in Illinois increased them. The predictable result – as of 2017 more than 50 companies have relocated operations from Illinois to Indiana, bringing jobs and enhancing our state tax revenue so that we can invest in improving our roads, schools and other priorities. Indiana’s unemployment rate remains among the lowest in the Midwest, below the national average, and a dramatic 1.5 percent lower than Illinois. Hoosiers’ personal income growth is strong, our budget is balanced, our credit is rated AAA, and we have a rainy-day fund reserve that approaches $2 billion. It’s a formula that the nation could and should emulate. <br> As Indiana lowered rates, we have also reduced or eliminated many tax incentives, allowing our low flat rates to be our strongest selling point. Recently, our tax incentive review process was recognized by the Pew Foundation as one of the best in the nation. For our colleagues at the federal level, Indiana’s experience suggests cleaning up the code, eliminating excessive breaks and loopholes, and using the savings to dramatically lower rates is a winning formula. 
 Tax reform is the one legislative victory Republicans must have if they are to hold the House and pick up five to seven Senate seats in November 2018. And tax reform is also the one legislative victory that looks increasingly likely. <br> Tax reform is a must-win for two reasons. First, to kick-start strong economic growth and job creation. Second, to demonstrate that President Trump and the Republicans in Congress can get things done. <br> The Democratic failures include higher taxes on everyone, (including eight ObamaCare taxes directly on the middle class), an explosion of regulatory costs, a new unending entitlement and lousy job numbers. <br> Even coming out of a deep recession, the Obama administration averaged growth of only 2 percent a year.President Reagan battled recession and inflation and managed 4 percent growth, creating 4 million jobs in the first year of his recovery. <br> Donald Trump was elected president because he promised jobs, jobs, jobs.He and the GOP Congress know they have to deliver in such a way that even MSNBC will have to note from time to time that in the first six months of 2018 the economy is in fact demonstrably stronger. <br> Long depreciation schedules will be replaced by full and immediate business expensing – at least for a few years. And history suggests that any such pro-growth measure will be extended again and again (just as the research and development tax credit was) and eventually be made permanent. <br> The biggest winners of tax reform will be the millions of Americans who enter or return to the job market when we unleash America's business investment through lower taxes, expensing and repatriation. <br> Finally, passing tax reform without a single Democratic vote will remind Americans that there are two teams in Washington. One works for government and the other works for them. Democrats refer to tax hikes as income. Republicans know taxes area cost imposed on American families.Pick your team. 
 President Trump has called getting tax reform signed into law a “once in a generation opportunity” and he’s exactly right. That’s why the White House and Congressional Republicans must keep their eyes on the prize in the critical days and weeks ahead. After a tough seven months of working hard to reform our broken health care system before it collapses only to come up one vote short, leaders on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue are frustrated and rightly so. They’re frustrated that they haven’t done an adequate job corroborating on policy implementation or combating Democrat obstruction and a hyper-politicized mainstream media. But with every challenge in politics comes opportunity. President Trump, Senator McConnell, and Speaker Ryan need to make the most of this opportunity by plotting a successful strategy and then executing on it. <br> The mainstream media is driving the narrative that the Trump-McConnell-Ryan relationship is too far gone to right the ship. This is a false narrative that can be demonstrably proven wrong by working together and communicating to achieve a goal. I believe the media’s deceptive narrative will ultimately be debunked because Republicans are aware that they made promises, were put in charge to enact those promises, and have a responsibility to keep the promises. The American people are starving for something good to come out of Washington. The stakes are high and it’s time to deliver. I’m optimistic that Republicans will make it happen. <br> Now that we’re past the debt ceiling and government funding issue (for the time being), President Trump and Vice President Pence need to convince House and Senate Republicans to put aside their differences and come together for the greater good, that is, their fellow countrymen. First a budget, and then robust tax reform, must be debated, passed, and signed into law now so it can take effect immediately. It simply has to happen this year. Republicans must be able to tell voters that tax reform is the law of the land when they start to campaign next fall. <br> Next year at this time members of Congress will go home and face the fire. Voters in their states and districts will be asking why Republicans should be re-elected and remain in charge of Washington. It’s imperative for Republican leaders to come up with the answer to that question now and a big part of the answer must be tax reform. 
 In May 2014, a broad collection of thinkers and politicians gathered in Washington to celebrate a new conservative “manifesto.” The document called for replacing stodgy old Reaganite economics with warmer, fuzzier handouts to the middle class. Donald Trump must have missed the memo. <br> The president formally opened the tax wars on Wednesday with his speech in Missouri challenging Congress to meet his principles for reform. The media almost uniformly applied to the speech its favorite (though misused) descriptor: “populist.” But the real news was that Mr. Trump wants to make Reagan-style tax reform great again. 
 Republicans in Congress are at a make or break moment and everyone knows it. Moments like these don’t come around very often in politics. President Donald Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell all agree that the time has come to seize on real and lasting tax reform, which will lead to job creation and fuel our economic engine for future generations. Republicans, as well as any Trump-state Democrats seeking to help hardworking American taxpayers with this pro-growth legislation, need to come together. We must get a robust tax reform bill signed into law this year. <br> The American people know that Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress, and looking at the first six months of the 115th Congress have little to show for it. If Congress doesn’t act, it will appear that the campaign rhetoric was just that – all talk. We have a President of the United States asking Congress to send a tax reform package to his desk. Year after year during the Obama Administration, Republican leaders in Congress said “just wait until we have a Republican president. Then things will be different.” McConnell and Ryan must produce a historic tax reform package that members of their respective caucuses can get behind. Inaction on tax reform could very well mean minority status in 2019. Make no mistake about it; the American people expect action. It’s true that Democrats are being obstructionists, but folks around the country want Republicans to get the job done and keep their promise. <br> The American people believe all Republicans are in agreement that tax reform is critical. That’s why American families and job creators want to know when it’s going to happen and so does President Trump. Republicans on Capitol Hill from across the political spectrum, from the most moderate to the most conservative, all acknowledge that tax reform and tax relief were key campaign promises in 2016 that helped catapult them to victory and majority status in both chambers of Congress. <br> Republicans also agree on the importance of tax reform and tax cuts when it comes to growing the economy. President Trump’s uplifting economic message paved the way for his victories in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Upon taking office, the President’s economic optimism and executive orders on deregulation have caused the Dow Jones industrial average to skyrocket to historic highs, paved the way to one million new jobs created in six months and 2.6 percent growth in the second quarter, and made the unemployment rate shrink to its lowest level since 2001. But job creators in businesses large and small are expecting tax reform from Congress in 2017 so they can plan for the future.&nbsp; 
 The Constitution authorizes Congress to tax Americans to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare. But in Washington, the professional political class has hijacked that authority to rig up a tax code that provides for the well-being of Washington, not the country. <br> This week President Trump is coming to Missouri to explain how he intends to change that. His visit is welcome news, and Missourians should welcome him with enthusiasm to our state. The President understands that when it comes to taxing American workers, things cannot go on as they are now. <br> It’s no mystery how that happened. The people in Washington are getting rich with our money. Under President Barack Obama, the federal government swelled to record size, and it took more and more of our money to pay for it. Who benefitted? Not Missouri farmers or workers. While DC prospers, they are suffering through the weakest economic recovery in decades. <br> Step one is to make the tax code simpler. Today’s code and its regulations are a four million-word mess of special interest exemptions and corporate giveaways. This complexity fuels crony capitalism and grows the power of lobbyists, while burdening American workers. <br> President Trump has urged Congress to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, to increase the standard deduction, and to eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax that kills jobs and forces many small businesspeople into paying higher taxes. These are important proposals. A simpler system with a higher standard deduction would allow working Missourians to pay less, and to spend less time trying to figure out the tax code. Last year, Americans who filled out the standard Form 1040 spent an average of 16 hours and $270 of their money just for the privilege of paying their taxes. That’s ridiculous. It’s offensive. And it’s time to change it. <br> The president has also proposed lowering the tax rate on job-creating businesses. Today our rate is higher than any other industrialized economy, and it’s encouraging businesses to move jobs overseas. American workers and American entrepreneurs can compete with anybody, anywhere if our government will stop making America a cost-prohibitive place to do business. 
 I ran into a woman at the grocery store a while back. With her cart full of groceries and her hand full of coupons, she looked at me in line and said: “When will it get better, Kristi? The cost of these groceries, of health care, of child care – they’re all going up, but I haven’t gotten a raise in years.” <br> She’s not alone. Many American families in every state are asking that exact question: When will it get better? When will the pinch stop? <br> What’s more, those savings are targeted toward our priorities: maybe most importantly, building strong families. <br> Our bill also gives people a boost during those milestone times in their lives, such as when they buy a home or save for retirement. On top of it all, the legislation significantly simplifies the tax code, so many busy families can file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. Think of the stress that would save come tax time. <br> And while we offer support to the families raising our next generation, this tax reform package is also designed to help job creators thrive from one generation to the next. <br> One of the hallmarks of the House GOP plan is a historically low 25 percent tax rate on small businesses that is accompanied by reforms to level the playing field and reduce compliance costs. Additionally, we fully and permanently repeal the Death Tax by 2024, doubling the exemption levels between now and then. <br> A few months afterward, we got a letter from the IRS telling us we owed the Death Tax. We were still reeling from the loss of the powerhouse in our family, and already, the government was reaching out its hand to take part of our American Dream. We had a tough choice: sell off a portion of our family farm or face a decade in debt. We took a decade in debt and struggled to keep our heads above water. <br> By eliminating the Death Tax, we’ll eliminate one of the most unfair, un-American taxes on the books – a tax that has threatened second- and third-generation businesses for far too long. 
 The liberal media is unhappy that President Trump is going to hold a rally Tuesday night in Phoenix, Arizona. Of course they are. Every time Mr. Trump ventures out to speak to the country, he reminds people why they voted for him. His message of rejuvenation and promise to “Drain the Swamp!” still resonate, bigly. <br> Some have criticized the planned gathering as insensitive, coming so soon after the dreadful murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville. They are worried that Mr. Trump might reignite racial tensions, or do something provocative, like pardon Joe Arpaio, the controversial Arizona sheriff recently convicted of contempt. <br> Trump should follow up his speech Monday night about sending more troops to Afghanistan – a speech in which he asked the country to promise our soldiers that when they return “they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one” – by committing to our soldiers coming home to find a booming economy and plentiful job openings as well. <br> This is not, however, a slam-dunk. <br> Let’s start with the inevitable Democrat resistance. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered to work with Republicans on tax reform as long as no relief goes to the top one percent, and only if the tax plan does not increase the country’s deficit. <br> Also, Republicans are intent on repealing the estate tax, which would clearly benefit the wealthiest Americans, as would a reduction in the top capital gains rate to 20 percent from the current level of 23.8 percent. Schumer knows these are high priorities for the GOP. <br> Then there are all the folks who will lose out under the emerging reform plan. To make the numbers work, some big tax breaks will have to go. State and local tax deductions are currently on the chopping block, which will enrage blue state residents, as is the expensing of corporate investments, a negative for capital equipment producers. The Big Six, as the masterminds behind the reform plan are called, is also considering a cap on mortgage interest deductions, probably targeting high earners, which will set the nation’s huge real estate industry howling. <br> But here’s what tax reform has going for it: a committed White House that has participated in drafting the proposal (unlike the various health care plans) and that is willing to go on the road and sell it to voters. One of the enormous failings of the push to repeal ObamaCare was the lack of an energetic messaging effort. This time round, the Big Six, which includes Ways Means Chair Kevin Brady, Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, are united in the effort. <br> The group’s Corry Bliss added:“We will continue to urge Congress to put American families and job creators first, members who fail to do so will be held accountable. It’s past time for members of Congress to put politics aside and work together to deliver results that move our country forward.” 
 Repealing and replacing ObamaCare and implementing President Trump’s plan to build $1 trillion-worth of infrastructure are massively important for the president’s bold vision to make America great again, but the key to President Trump's success is tax reform. <br> President Trump acknowledged this to congressional leaders in a meeting yesterday. <br> The Republican repeal effort to reform health care will likely result in a bitter partisan fight. Probably no Democrat will vote to repeal ObamaCare. <br> We will need positive reforms in other areas that will bring some Democrats into a bipartisan coalition. <br> After the president’s address to the Joint Session of Congress last week, I predicted his massive infrastructure plan will win over about a third of the Democrats. However, it will face scrutiny from Republicans concerned about finding ways to pay for it – even though I’m confident President Trump will negotiate a much lower price tag, develop public private partnerships, and reduce costs by eliminating reams of burdensome rules from the Code of Federal Regulations. <br> The first major step Congress should take is to reform the tax system so companies are incentivized to invest and build factories in the United States and create good-paying jobs. <br> I recently spoke with a group of about 30 major American investors, and they expressed tremendous support for a border adjustment tax. Under our current tax system, it makes more sense for companies to move manufacturing jobs out of the United States, produce products in lower-wage countries, and then export their goods back to the U.S., because we do not impose corporate tax on imports. <br> With a border adjustment tax, we would tax imports – just like more than 160 other countries that have either a value-added tax on imports, a border adjustment tax, or both. <br> Reducing taxes on businesses and individuals, and reducing regulations, will cause more companies to invest in America again. The Tax Foundation reports that Speaker Ryan’s plan will create about 1.7 million jobs in America, and increase Gross Domestic Product by more than 9 percent. 
 Fixing our broken tax code is a foundational step to building a healthy economy, creating more jobs and ensuring more take home pay for hardworking Americans. <br> To that end, Congressional Republicans are working to reform our tax code – which today includes more than 70,000 pages of laws and regulations – to make it fairer and simpler. We recently released our tax reform framework, which will be an outline for Congress in the months ahead and can be viewed<a href="https://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/Tax%20Framework.pdf" target="_blank">here.&nbsp; <br> As for the myths, folks like to hastily equate our tax reform effort in Washington to the 2012 Kansas tax cut package. I’ve seen several headlines with variations of equation - which is either lazy analysis, or analysis based on assumptions that lack substance. The only real similarity is that they are both called “tax reform.” <br> As for our federal tax framework, Congress wants to lower rates for ALL taxpayers: individual, corporate, and pass-through. As the top corporate rate drops from 35 percent to 20 percent, the pass-through rate drops similarly from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. Kansas went to a zero rate, not 25 percent. <br> Let me say this again: we are not zeroing out the pass-through rate as Kansas did. Instead, American businesses, both small and large, will be paying a tax rate firmly in line with our other global competitors, rather than one of the highest of any first-world country. Further, the pass-through rate and the corporate rate will remain relatively similar to each other, meaning there is little incentive for businesses to reclassify for tax avoidance purposes. Business owners can instead just focus on creating jobs.&nbsp; <br> Finally, in addition to lowering rates, the federal tax reform plan calls for broadening the base. This is shorthand for closing tax loopholes. When tax loopholes are closed, more business and personal income is subject to taxation, so we are able to raise the similar revenue at lower tax rates. This allows us to cut tax rate for individuals and businesses without blowing a hole in the budget, since revenue neutral reform is our goal. 
 <i>Editor's note: This piece was originally published in the Indianapolis Star.
 With the failure of Republicans to address health care, the GOP Congress hasn’t landed a single major legislature acccomplishment on President Trump’s desk yet. No wonder Trump was in Indiana Wednesday launching his effort to reform the tax code by reducing tax rates and inhibitors to job creation. <br> There is no doubt that the notion of tax reform is popular with the American public. A recent poll found 68 percent of Americans agree our tax laws should have a major overhaul. That number included 77 percent of Repubilicans, 70 percent of Independents and 62 percent of Democrats. <br> The Trump tax plan would dramatically simplify the tax code by cutting the number of rates from seven to three - ranging from 12 percent to 35 percent - and getting rid of deductions such as those for state and local taxes. The standard deduction for couples would be doubled to $24,000 a year, making it possible for many Americans to have no tax liability at all. <br> Companies would be allowed to immediately write off investment expenses, though only for five years. That is of advantage to existing businesses, but much less so to new firms struggling to get started. Look for Congress to be under pressure to make expensing permanent. 
 On Tuesday House Speaker Paul Ryan, speaking at the National Association of Manufacturers, reiterated his call for the need for tax reform. Tax reform is urgent because the gap in corporate tax rates between the United States and our competitors is wide and increasing. <br> Ryan told the audience that “as the world changed, our tax code has remained stuck in neutral. It has ballooned to 70,000 pages of rules and regulations that few people today actually understand. There is an old line about this: our tax code is about five times as long as the Bible, but with none of the Good News.” <br> For example, Burger King, the fast food chain, merged with Canada’s Tim Horton’s, a doughnut chain, in order to access Canada’s lower taxes. <br> In America corporate profits are taxed three times, once at the business level, another time when they are distributed to individuals, and a third time at death. The high corporate tax discourages investment. The gap between American and foreign rates is widening, as foreign countries are lowering their rates even as the U.S. rate stays the same. In order to raise U.S. levels of investment, the corporate tax rate should be reduced to the range of 15 percent to 20 percent, as President Trump and Speaker Ryan propose. <br> After all these taxes are taken into account, the tax rate on equity can reach well over 50 percent, depending on the extent of the estate tax. This encourages firms to take on debt for financing, which is distortionary. <br> A global (or worldwide) tax system is uncompetitive with high tax rates because it imposes a high income tax rate on all profits, regardless of where they are earned. If an American company operates in the United States and Canada, its domestic affiliate pays U.S. taxes of 35 percent and its foreign affiliate pays U.S. taxes at 35 percent and Swiss taxes at 15 percent. America allows companies to deduct the taxes paid to foreign governments from U.S. taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service, but this means that corporations always pay the full U.S. rate and are unable to take advantage of low-tax jurisdictions. <br> America raised just under $300 billion from the corporate tax in 2016, according to the Office of Management and Budget, around 9 percent of all revenue, and the tax costs millions to administer. Most important, it effectively discourages investment in the United States. 
 The knives are out for Paul Ryan. To survive, the House Speaker must produce a win on tax reform. That will not be easybecause the obstructionist Freedom Caucus could once again join Democrats to defeat this next major White House initiative. While Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will bleat about handouts to billionaires, the intransigents on the right could well object to the “new” border adjustment tax. &nbsp; <br> Still, the failure of the AHCA – at least in its first round at bat -- has put Ryan on the hot seat. The Freedom Caucus blames him for the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, and for embracing the now mainstream position that the country expects all citizens to have access to healthcare. Like John Boehner before him, House Speaker Ryan has failed the litmus tests of the far right; they want him gone. <br> Ryan’s American Healthcare Act of 2017 would have accomplished much<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gop-entitlement-caucus-1490653793" target="_blank">that conservatives wanted.Through its dismantling of the fees and taxes which funded Obamacare, it effectively dismantled the law itself. In addition, the bill would have for the first time thrown a lasso around Medicaid, starting to rein in the third-largest federal program, which has tripled in size since 2000. <br /> <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 For years, as a radio broadcaster, I organized tax reform rallies on the state capitol steps demanding relief for hard working Minnesotans—but also changes in how the government collects its revenue. <br> Now, as a member of Congress, I actually have a chance to do something about it. <br> Rarely has a tax code done more to stifle, discourage and punish entrepreneurship than the one with which we're currently saddled. In fact, Americans were projected to spend more than 8.9 billion hours—the equivalent of roughly 4.3 million full-time workers—doing their taxes for 2016, according to the<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/compliance-costs-irs-regulations/#_ftn1" target="_blank">Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. <br> Yet the current federal tax code subsidises the higher income tax states like Minnesota instead of nudging them to get their taxes in line with the rest of the country. A loophole, by the way, which disproportionately benefits upper income earners. <br> Any wonder why after nine years of massive amounts of federal spending and debt we're still mired in the slowest economic growth rate since WWII -- yet to hit three percent annually? Why median household incomes still haven't reached their pre-2007 recession levels? Or why the civilian labor force participation rate is stuck at levels not seen since the ‘malaise’ of the 1970s? <br> The House tax reform blueprint simplifies the four-million-word tax code, cuts corporate and personalincome taxes and reduces seven individual brackets to just three. It also vastly expands those who will owe nothing by enlarging the standard deduction. <br> We need a tax code where more folks have skin in the game -- but at much lower rates. In fact, one reason for the army of special interest groups in Washington is the punitive nature of very high marginal tax rates. <br> On the corporate side, the OECD reports the combined federal and state statutory tax rate for the United States is nearly 39 percent—about ten points higher than the weighted average of the group’s other 34 members. <br> By some estimates, there may now be upwards of $2.6 trillion stockpiled offshore avoiding U.S. taxes. The House plan embraces a common-sense‘territorial system that taxes corporate earnings only once and starts the process of repatriating those trillions of dollars back into the United States for things like infrastructure investment right here at home. <br> In 1962,<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkeconomicclubaddress.html" target="_blank">speaking at the Economic Clubof New York, President Kennedy reiterated his support for an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes<i></i>because a complicated tax code coupled with high rates exerts too heavy a drag on growth&nbsp;and&quot;reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking. 
 After months of fits and starts, it looks like comprehensive tax reform is nearing the goal line. <br> This would be an ideal holiday present for the American people, who have had to live with an outdated, onerous and inefficient tax system for far too long. <br> Polling suggests that many Americans are dubious about the current tax reform proposal. That’s understandable, since so much of the discussion has centered on cutting corporate tax rates, which are slated tofall from 35 percent to 20 percent. Unfortunately, there’s been much less discussion about why this rate cut matters for middle-class Americans. <br> America now has the<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-world-2014" target="_blank">world’s higheststatutory corporate tax rate – over 39 percent for combined federal and state, as compared to the current worldwide average of 25 percent. <br> Even France, certainly not known as the bastion of free-market capitalism, recently announced plans to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-reform/french-government-outlines-gradual-corporate-tax-cut-plans-idUSKCN1BA2HX" target="_blank">lower its corporate rate from 33 percent to 25 percentover the next few years. <br> Here at home, William Randolph from the Congressional Budget Office released a preliminary working paper in 2006 that found<a href="https://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/75xx/doc7503/2006-09.pdf" target="_blank">domestic labor routinely bears 73 percent of the corporate tax burden. <br> These increases are significant, tangible results for working families. More recently, the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent would increase average household income by somewhere<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/81f819be-b21c-11e7-a398-73d59db9e399" target="_blank">between $4,000 and $9,000 per year. <br> According to the nonpartisan<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-passed-senate-finance-committee/full" target="_blank">Tax Policy Center, Americans of all household income brackets would get a tax cut in the first year. <br> In addition, the Senate Finance Committee<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/11.20.17%20Real%20World%20Examples.pdf" target="_blank">estimatedthata family of four earning a median income of $73,000 would see a tax cut of nearly $2,200. 
 President Ronald Reagan wisely said:<i>“You can’t be for big government, big taxes, and big bureaucracy andstill befor the little guy.” <br> The Tax Reform Act of 1986 stands as the single greatest example we’ve known of bipartisan federal income tax policy. Once it was enacted, our nation had a simpler tax code with fewer tax exemptions and loopholes, and significantly lower rates. This brought relief to American families and businesses. <br> The Trump administration and Congress have an opportunity to build an economic legacy. By enacting comprehensive tax reform, they would spur economic growth and ensure American prosperity far into the future. Both Democrats and Republicans can be heroes to their constituents by passing tax reform and kicking off economic growth similar to what we experienced three decades ago. <br> Additionally, homeownership was encouraged by increasing the mortgage interest deduction. Americans kept more of what they earned and were incentivized to invest. The economy soared. <br> This is a far cry from our income tax code today, with the highest rate at 39.6 percent. The previous four administrations have reversed much of the progress made in 1986 and have managed to vastly increase the national debt from $2 trillion to more than $20 trillion. <br> Bipartisanship is required for this overhaul. This can be encouraged by demonstrating one basic economic principle that both Democrats and Republicans understand: incentives. Technically speaking, we’re talking about the behavioral effects of a tax cut. <br> The proposed tax bill would also simplify individual income tax brackets from eight to four (including the “zero” bracket). Individuals earning less than $12,000 a year – or couples earning $24,000 and filing jointly – would pay no tax, essentially doubling the standard deduction. <br> While reducing the number of brackets is a definite positive, adding deductions and credits removes people from the tax rolls and reduces the impact and strength of the tax bill. However, the overall implications of this tax bill are extremely positive. If passed today, it would surely incentivize the Reaganesque economic growth that this country needs. <br> Lowering the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent would encourage existing businesses to grow and invest in the United States, and would reduce barriers for new businesses to form. After all, entrepreneurs are an essential ingredient to our economic growth. You can’t love jobs and hate job creators. <br> How do we learn from that experience and lay a foundation for long-term prosperity in future generations to come? The best way is to each our children and grandchildren that incentives matter. Most children already build an understanding of this principle by achieving good grades, earning an allowance and competing in sports. <br> Today’s fifth-grader will vote for the first time in 2024. When we commit to raising economically educated children, we prevent readdressing economic policy every four to eight years. Talking with kids about how incentives work in their daily decision making, and then demonstrating how this applies to government policy, is the bridge we need to bring about long-term tax reform and prosperity. 
 Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is furious after a provision that would have expanded 529 savings accounts to cover homeschool expenses was removed from the Republicans’ tax reform plan. <br> <b>Click here for a FREE subscription to Todd’s newsletter – a must-read for Conservatives!</b> <br> Under the Cruz plan, homeschool families would’ve been able to deduct the cost of homeschooling their kids. A provision allowing parents to save for private or religious schools remained in the bill. 
 For the first time in more than 30 years, Congress has enacted comprehensive tax reform, which provides middle-class tax relief and a much-needed boost to our economy.This will lead to more jobs, higher wages and increased investment at home. <br> After nearly a decade of stagnant economic growth, this historic tax overhaul will restore America’s position as the center of the world’s global economy. <br> Repealing the individual mandate tax is the beginning of the end of the ObamaCare era, which has been marked by skyrocketing premiums and shrinking choices, making America’s health-care system untenable and unsustainable. <br> ObamaCare and its mandates put our nation on a fast-track to socialism. If the federal government can force you to buy health insurance, where does the government’s power stop? <br> Repealing the individual mandate tax restores liberty to the nation’s health-care system. Once again, the American people will be back in charge of their health care – not Washington bureaucrats. <br> Additionally, the individual mandate tax is regressive and punitive, disproportionately hurting low-income households. According to the IRS, nearly<a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-historic-table-2" target="_blank">80 percentof households that pay the penalty make less than $50,000 annually. Those families paid more than half of the individual mandate tax collected by the IRS. <br> I have fought long and hard to repeal the individual mandate tax. In fact, I was the<a href="https://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/releases?ID=3E883BE5-5E3A-4F43-8B52-EF7D0FBF92FE" target="_blank">firstmember of Congress to introduce legislation to repeal the individual and employer mandates. And I am proud that the tax reform bill that passed out of the Senate Finance Committee included the individual mandate tax repeal and that this provision was included when the bill crossed the finish line. 
 Americans desperately want a fairer tax system and relief from arbitrary treatment by the IRS. True reform requires simply junking the personal and corporate incomes in favor of a consumption tax. <br> The tax code is riddled with special interest provisions that favor rich donors to political campaigns, distort business decisions and consumer choices, and handicap economic growth and job creation. <br> Camp proposes to eliminate or modify many exemptions, deductions and other special provisions, but just the summary of those reforms takes 194 pages to explain in language only a tax expert could fully comprehend. <br> Despite noble intentions, much of the morass would remain, and the biggest beneficiaries would be the lawyers and accountants tasked by the rich and big corporations to game the new system. <br> In 2013, the Treasury collected $1.6 trillion from corporate and personal income taxes. This could be replaced by a 12 percent sales tax on all private purchases and other payments — be they computer equipment, college tuition or lunch at the corner takeout. <br> It would end forever all the headaches associated with valuing inventories, calculating depreciation on capital equipment and other work that cost billions in accounting and legal fees. <br> Businesses and institutions would file a three-line return: how much tax they collected, how much they paid and the difference. Individuals would file no tax return at all! <br> Two problems remain. A VAT is not progressive — it taxes rich and poor consumers at the same rate. The elderly, who more or less live on savings, have already paid income taxes on those savings and would be taxed again. <br> If Congress wants to spend more, it could raise the rate further. That would make transparent to all the cost of spending more on government activities. If conservatives on Capitol Hill want to cut programs, they could explain to voters how much those savings would lower the rate. 
 Republicans in Congress return from vacation next week under attack from all sides. They need to put some wins on the boards, and show the country they can govern. They need to pass tax reform. <br> President Trump is blasting the GOP leadership for having failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and for ignoring his advice to tie the debt ceiling increase to the noncontroversial Veterans Affairs’ Choice Program extension. <br> Maybe more worrisome is the cautionary note sounded on Larry Kudlow’s radio show by Noelle Nikpour, a Republican strategist. In reaching out recently to favorite long-time bundlers, she has run into a brick wall. Some ask, “What have Republicans done for me lately?” <br> It’s understandable. Voters were promised that if they delivered the Senate, the House and the White House to the GOP, the country would break through the stifling gridlock of the past several years and begin to rebuild our infrastructure, cut through the regulatory thicket, renew entrepreneurship, and overhaul our failing health care system. To date, all the country has to show for putting Republicans in charge is Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. That’s not nothing, as they say, but it’s not enough. <br> Bottom line: for the Republican Party, and for the country, we need progress. We need to raise the debt ceiling, approve a budget and then pass a wide-ranging tax reform package that lowers rates for individuals and businesses and resolves some of our tax code’s most troublesome features, such as how we treat corporate profits earned overseas. The current approach, which is to tax repatriated income, is unique among developed countries and self-defeating. It encourages companies to pile up profits overseas, forcing them to borrow against those holdings in order to pay dividends, for instance, and makes it easier to invest abroad than at home. That must end. <br> There should be no such schism in advocating tax reform. There will be, for sure, plenty of haggling over which deductions bite the dust in order to allow tax rates overall to come down. Because Democrats will not work with the GOP to simplify and lower taxes, preferring to use any tax overhaul to redistribute the country’s wealth instead of build it up, Republicans will need to pass tax changes via budget reconciliation, which requires that the effort be revenue neutral over an agreed-upon time frame. <br> The message is clear, though. Republicans in Congress cannot let perfect be the enemy of good, as they did in the fight over repealing ObamaCare. Reforming our system so that it rewards workers and job creators is good for everybody. Rival CEOs David Abney and Fred Smith, of UPS and FexEx, respectively, recently teamed to write an op-ed pushing for measures that might boost growth, including tax reform. They write, “Studies show that permanently lowering the corporate rate by even 10 percentage points would increase GDP by 1% to 2% without lowering tax revenue.” That is a powerful selling point. 
 As Washington stumbles over ObamaCare repeal and delays tax reform—and while seemingly endless scandals monopolize headlines—it’s all too easy to lose hope that transformative policy change is possible. <br> But those seeking a return to fiscal sanity should take heart: Significant reforms are advancing at the state level that could spur a bottom-up course correction across the country. <br> The Pew Charitable Trusts called Pennsylvania’s pension law enacted in June “one of the most—if not the most—comprehensive and impactful reforms any state has implemented.” <br> The answer is simple yet instructive: Budgetary pressures and political realities gave him no other choice. <br> Fifteen years ago, Pennsylvania’s pension plans for state employees and school teachers held a surplus. Yet, in the past ten years alone, the plans’ unfunded liabilities ballooned more than 800 percent to $71 billion last year. <br> The debt surged because lawmakers boosted pension benefits in 2001, then for years pushed off required contributions. Their deliberate underfunding coupled with stock market losses transformed a pension debt ripple into a tsunami. <br> Sadly, hardworking Americans bear the consequences of poor pension policy. <br> Against this grim fiscal reality, government union leaders fought all reform efforts—succeeding even when Republicans controlled the legislature and governor’s office. And in 2015, Wolf vetoed pension reform legislation. <br> A grueling, nine-month impasse over Wolf’s first state budget drove down his approval numbers and derailed his agenda. In 2016, voters, most of whom wanted pension reform, handed pro-reform lawmakers their largest majorities in the state House and Senate in decades. <br> Beginning in 2019, new state employees and school teachers, plus newly elected lawmakers, will enroll in a side-by-side hybrid retirement plan. This plan couples a smaller pension with a new 401(k)-style component. New workers could also choose a straight 401(k)-style plan, and current employees and re-elected lawmakers can opt in to the new system. <br> While this reform is no panacea—it does little to reduce the $71 billion taxpayers owe—it will reduce the future risk to families by approximately two-thirds. <br> This new system establishes a firm foundation that Pennsylvania can build upon. 
 Now that both the House and Senate have versions of the Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act that provide a $1.5 trillion tax reduction for Americans, the doomsayers will be out in full force to declare that tax reform is too difficult to achieve. No reason for pessimism yet. With one smart amendment, the Republicans could have their cake and eat it too. <br> The Republican task seemed to get much harder with the Congressional Budget Office release of an estimate that the tax bill would cause an estimated $1.7 trillion revenue loss for the government over the next decade. &nbsp;As a result, the CBO predicts that U.S. federal debt will grow from 91.2 to 97.1 percent of GDP over that period. <br> But there is a way. Many countries, including Canada and Britain, traditionally install business tax rate reductions over several years rather than moving quickly to a target rate. Republicans should do the same. <br> Not only would delayed rate reductions reduce the revenue cost but it would also help spur growth more. Here’s why. <br> The House plan recommends a 15-point reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 per cent in one swoop, at a CBO-projected cost of $1.46 trillion in ten years.&nbsp; The Senate’s one year delay in the rate cut would squeeze that down to $1.33 trillion over the same period. <br> Suppose instead, however, that the federal corporate income tax rate of 35 per cent is reduced annually by 3 points to the 20 per cent plateau. I calculate that the ten-year loss in revenues would be at least $250 billion less than that predicted by the House Tax Cut and Jobs Act—cutting the projected House bill cost to $1.21 billion. The proposed savings on the Senate bill would be more than double the amount saved by a one-year delay. <br> This effectively results in lower taxes on new investment compared to reducing the corporate rate immediately to 20 per cent or with a one year delay. <br> The Republicans could also reduce costs of their reform by doing the same thing with business income earned by sole proprietorships and partnerships.&nbsp;These are the kind of business vehicles used by small business owners and professionals. Not only would this method reduce the costs of the reform, it would spur new investment as users looked forward to increased future tax gains. 
 In making his impassioned speech on how our county’s economy can grow through tax reform, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said Tuesday, “We need to connect people with the skills they need to get good-paying, in-demand jobs.” <br> Speaker Ryan is absolutely right, and the House is immediately answering the Speaker’s call to action. <br> For many Americans this is not the case, and not the best path they can take to find the skills needed to ultimately lead them to the overall goal of an education — a good paying job and a successful life. <br> An unfortunate truth is that America is still facing a recovering economy, and a widening skills gap that is putting our workforce at a disadvantage to succeed in a 21stcentury economy. While companies across the country have openings for high paying jobs, and are anxious to hire, many workers lack the skills and adequate education needed to qualify and compete for those jobs. <br> Such a shortage in our workforce does not allow Americans to be on track to compete in a global marketplace. We have arrived at this shortage, in large part, because of the way we think about education and skills-focused education in this country. <br> These are students who find high-quality education and career development opportunities in their own communities, and are often recruited by companies in their own backyard who are in need of workers ready to play a role in a 21stcentury workforce. <br> In 2014, the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) was enacted into law, and set in motion necessary reforms to improve the dialogue between local leaders and private businesses on how workforce education could better serve employers’ needs in communities across the country. <br> Most importantly, all of these conversations can be had without the federal government dictating how these programs should be implemented. <br> A “Washington knows best” approach to creating successful skills-focused education programs is not the answer as communities plan and develop career and technical education programs tailored to their local economies. <br> In doing so, we are also changing the way we think about education and vocations in this country. <br> Our state and local leaders in the public and private sectors are in the driver’s seat when it comes to workforce development, and Washington can watch and learn as their work closes the skills gap in our country. 
 The press corps is busy quizzing the president, the speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader on their plans for tax reform. The question is why they aren’t chasing after the three people who actually hold all the power. <br> If the past eight months have proved anything, it is that all the 24/7 news coverage of Donald Trump’s antics, all the millions of words devoted to Paul Ryan’s and Mitch McConnell’s plans, have been a complete waste of space and time. In the end, control of the entire policy agenda in Washington comes down to three senators. Three senators whom most Americans have never had a chance to vote for or against. Three senators who comprise 8% of their party conference. Arizona’s John McCain, Maine’s Susan Collins and Kentucky’s Rand Paul. Forget Caesar, Crassus and Pompey. Meet the Never-Trump Triumvirate. 
 IIn 1939 a young man opened a car dealership to realize the American dream. He built his business up from nothing. He worked hard and he created jobs. <br> When the man passed away, his business was passed along to his only child who wanted to continue in his father’s footsteps. After the funeral, while still in grief, the IRS came to collect 55 percent of the value of the business from the son. He nearly declared bankruptcy. <br> Today, the son still runs his father’s car dealership and employs more than one hundred dedicated workers. That son is me. <br> The reality of our tax code is that it is a bloated, costly mess of business-killing measures that does nothing but line the pockets of an out-of-control, wasteful federal government that is 19 trillion dollars in debt. <br> While politicians – many of whom have never worked in the private sector, let alone owned a business themselves – devote all of their attention to Wall Street, they have forgotten about the 28 million small businesses that are forced to play defense every single day. <br> I first ran for Congress four years ago to fight for moms and dads who have risked everything to achieve the American dream. To fight for those who do not have the means to hire teams of lawyers and accountants to navigate our 70,000 page tax code and comply with unnecessary rules and regulations. <br> Jumpstart America will implement repatriation at 5 percent so U.S. companies are incentivized to return home. <br> It is for that reason that my plan calls for help for cash flowing middle class families and the businesses they run. 
 As the legislative agenda of the new Congress begins to take shape, there is one area in which both Republicans and Democrats appear to agree - the need for comprehensive tax reform, especially of the business tax code. But as with most attempts at reform, the devil is in the details. <br> When tax reform proposals are debated, “interest-group politics are brutal” the Post noted. Also true, and in this respect, President Obama isn’t blameless. His intransigence on the Keystone pipeline and his foot-dragging on freeing crude oil and natural gas exports from trade restrictions, for instance, are well documented. Perhaps nowhere are his interest-group politics clearer than his disparagement of U.S. energy producers as “Big Oil” and his efforts to raise taxes above already high levels. <br> I expect his fiscal year 2016 budget, set for release Monday, to be no different. It’s just another good example of what not to do as we move forward with tax reform – and of the type of partisan rhetoric that can derail progress on this vital issue. <br> Neither his claim nor the president’s withstands scrutiny. <br> Americans for Tax Reform calculated that a recent White House budget would heap some $90 billion in tax hikes upon American energy over the course of a decade. There’s no more sure-fire way to kill jobs, dampen investment, and weaken our nation’s new-found competitive advantage in energy than to pile on taxes. <br> We alsoshould applaud the robust energy industry’s role in private investment. The Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) once again recognized major domestic energy firms in its annual Investment Heroes ranking. The energy companies on the list collectively comprised the second most active industry, with six firms accounting for a total of $40 billion in domestic capital spending. <br> If both parties are able to do this, then we have a real chance to replace our broken tax code with a better model. 
 The economy is not doing well. Unemployment is too high and big deficits threaten the credit worthiness of the federal government, and only genuine tax reform will make things right. <br> Taxing the well off is not free—it slows growth, smothers jobs creation and pushes down wages for the middle class and working poor. <br> [pullquote] <br> Over the comparable Reagan years, when taxes, especially on the well-off were lower but more voters paid at least some income taxes, unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent but then the economy grew at 5.3 percent.&nbsp; <br> The highest marginal federal tax bracket is about 40 percent, but with so few Americans paying significant taxes, the average income tax rate is about 12 percent. <br> Each year, automatically adjust those levels up or down so that the share of federal spending financed by the income taxes remains constant—if folks want more or less federal spending, everyone pays more or less federal taxes. <br> These reforms would eliminate the terrible disincentive high taxes impose on small businesses to invest, grow and create jobs. Corporate tax rates could be similarly reformed so that investment decisions are not made on the basis of getting a tax credit but on the likelihood of boosting profits and employment. <br> For the former, the minimum wage could be boosted an appropriate amount—perhaps 50 cents an hour—beyond what President Obama and Congress agree. Social security payments could be similarly hiked, on a one time basis, by adjusting the payroll tax a few tenths of a percentage point. <br> Since politicians running for a seat in the Senate, House and the Oval Office could no longer promise the moon by getting someone else to pay for it, the economy would grow robustly and more Americans would benefit from the best social program of all—a good paying job and a promising future. 
 Did you file your federal income taxes on or before April 15? Almost 50% of American households won’t be paying any federal income tax this year, and the reasons why have profound implications for our democracy as well as our economy now. <br> Of course, we are accustomed to the idea that high income earners pay more in taxes both in absolute terms and as a percentage of their incomes. But taxing only the top half of a society is not normal progressive taxation. Instead, the recent changes to our tax system are an example of politicians using the tax code for their own political ends. In this case, the so-called progressive Democratic politicians are using “tax reform” to grow their political base by creating a group of Americans that pay no federal income tax. <br> The so-called progressive Democratic politicians are rational actors too. By taking more and more Americans off the federal tax rolls, they are creating a permanent base of supporters for themselves. These politicians may claim to support increased government spending because of their concern for the less-fortunate but--hey, it also happens to be in their own political self-interest. And these politicians will continue to spend on these programs until our nation goes bust because they want to keep their jobs and grow expensive programs for their political base. <br> Under the Obama administration, many Americans accustomed to paying their share of federal taxes are being taken off the tax rolls. Recent tax law changes mean that for the first time, in 2009, a family of four making $50,000 can pay no federal income tax at all. This family may not change its behavior and outlook immediately from its taxpaying days. But the family’s economic incentives are now to keep America taxing and spending. And a family at this income level has surely suffered in this recession, but should they really pay <b>no federal income tax </i>at all? <br> The so-called progressive politicians have turned John Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country” on its head. And telling so many Americans that they don’t need to make sacrifices for our government, as we are now saying, is dangerous new territory for our nation and for the health of our democracy and economy. <br> <span style=" color: #ED1C24;">Fox Forum is on Twitter.

 Editor's note: FoxNews.com is pleased to present an excerpt from Debacle: Obama's War on Jobs and Growth and What We Can Do Now to Regain Our Future the new book by Grover G. Norquist and FoxNews.com contributor John R. Lott Jr.</i> <br> What Was Promised <br> President Obama: Look, I’m at the start of my administration . . . And . . . and, you know, a year from now, I think people . . . are gonna see that . . . we’re starting to make some progress. But there’s still gonna be some pain out there. If I don’t have this done in three years, then there’s gonna be a one-term proposition. <br> The overall impact on jobs saved or created is just about what was predicted.—Austan Goolsbee, the head of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, December 3, 2010 <br> President Obama claims that instead of our economy being short more than 5 million jobs, things would have been even worse without his policies. According to him, we would have lost 10.5 million jobs without all of his spending. No matter how bad the job numbers get, Obama points to some hypothetical economic meltdown that was avoided by his policies. Thus, no evidence whatsoever, no matter how bad the news, can be used against him. <br> And then there was the $42 billion Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which was supposed to create or save another 500,000 jobs. Finally, the Disaster Relief and Summer Jobs Act of 2010 contained a hodgepodge of items, such as $24 billion to help keep teachers, police, and firefighters employed during the recession and $600 million to create 300,000 jobs for youth ages 16 to 24. <br> Even the mainstream media made the administration defend this prediction. By July 2009, it was obvious that the Obama administration’s initial predictions were way off. ABC’s This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Vice President Biden how the 9.5 percent unemployment rate in June squared with the administration’s prediction that if the Stimulus package was passed, “unemployment will peak at about 8 percent.” Biden replied, “We and everyone else misread the economy. The figures we worked off of in January were the consensus figures. . . .” <br> The whole administration spun the claim after Biden’s interview. Economic adviser Jared Bernstein contended that the 8 percent unemployment estimate “was before we had fourth-quarter results on GDP, which we later found out was contracting on an annual rate of 6 percent, far worse than we expected at that time.” Even the president echoed the claim: “It was only after the [fourth]-quarter numbers came in, if you recall, that suddenly everybody looked and said the economy shrank 6%.” <br> There was also plenty of warning before that GDP number was released. In a piece published by the Wall Street Journal on December 11, 2008, with the telling headline “Fourth-Quarter GDP: Worse and Worse” the paper estimated a drop in GDP of 6.2 percent at an annual rate for the fourth quarter. <br> Because of the stimulus, the Obama administration predicted a much milder drop in GDP in 2009 and strong economic growth after that (see Figure 3.2). The economy was only supposed to shrink by –1.2 percent in 2009 and then grow by 3.2 percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2011—leaving the economy up over 6 percent from where it was in 2008. But the actual economy performed much worse each year. Far from growing a robust 4 percent in 2011, the growth was a very anemic 1.4 percent. Over the first three years of the Obama administration, instead of the economy growing by a total of 6 percent, it grew by less than 2 percent. <br> It is also hard to believe that the state of the economy took Obama by surprise. He constantly warned of an economic Armageddon during the 2008 campaign and early 2009. At least once in each of the three presidential debates during September and October 2008, Obama claimed that we were in the “worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.” It was a constant theme of his campaign, and he made that claim again and again in many different speeches. Right after the election, he warned: “We’ve got an unprecedented crisis, or at least something that we have not seen since the Great Depression.” <br> But even after the full extent of the poor economic showing during the end of 2008 was clear, the administration’s predictions at the end of February were much more optimistic and less accurate than those of most economists. While the administration was expecting an average annual unemployment rate of 8.1 percent for the year, business economists and forecasters surveyed in early March by the Wall Street Journal expected the June unemployment rate to be 8.2 percent and the December rate to be at 9.3 percent. <br> Knowing how bad the economy was by the end of 2011, it is hard to believe that in March 2009, just five weeks after passing the Stimulus, President Obama was perceiving an upswing and started off a press conference by announcing: <br> This newfound optimism over the effects of the Stimulus seemed unaffected by the continued bad economic news. Obama declared later in May that the massive spending program was “already seeing results” and had created or saved almost 150,000 jobs. He talked about how the Stimulus was “laying the foundation for a better economy,” and by September, Vice President Biden was declaring: “In my wildest dreams, I never thought it [the Stimulus] would work this well.” By April the following year, the unemployment rate still at 9.8 percent, but Biden thought that now, for sure, the economy was just about to boom: “Some time in the next couple of months we’re going to be creating between 250,000 jobs a month and 500,000 jobs a month.” The administration touted that the summer of 2010 would become known as the “Summer of Recovery.” <br> And he was still making this same claim a year and a half later. Yet, despite Mr. Goolsbee’s claim, the unemployment rate did not rise above 9 percent until May, two months after Obama’s press conference announcing that the Stimulus was already creating jobs. Nor does it explain that the unemployment rate continued to rise, not just above 9 percent, but to 10.1 percent. <br> By the end of the summer, in August 2011, the unemployment rate was still at 9.1 percent. It was no longer possible to claim the Stimulus had worked well. Obama claimed that the sluggish economic growth wasn’t the fault of his own economic policies; it was the fault of other circumstances that he had no control over. It was either events outside the United States or the irresponsible political behavior of others in Washington. Obama claimed: <br> There are a couple of problems with his argument. Economic growth had already ground to a halt during the first three months of 2011—with GDP growing by just 0.1 percent. This was well before the Arab Spring, the renewed debt crisis in Greece and other countries, and the July and August 2011 debate over the debt ceiling. And whatever the impact of the March 2011 earthquake, its initial impact during the first quarter in the United States would have been very limited. The president also blamed Republicans for not passing his new legislation when they took over the House of Representatives in January 2011. But with Democratic supermajorities in both the House and Senate for the two previous years, it is pretty hard to blame for the slow growth in the first half of 2011. <br> Goolsbee, in an interview on Sean Hannity’s radio show in late October 2011, justified Obama’s references to Japan and the Arab Spring this way: “It is not excuses that he is giving for across the board. The question was: Why did we slow down in 2011 when we were growing and adding millions of jobs in 2010?” But it wasn’t just a sudden slowdown in 2011. From December 2009 to December 2010, fewer than a million jobs were added, not “millions.” And Goolsbee’s argument was quite a change from his comments in June 2011, which was well after these events in March, when he dismissed the previous month’s 9.1 percent unemployment rate as an aberration, saying that things were headed in the right direction and that “one month is not a trend.” <br> Sean, you need to date the job creation from when the free fall ends. You can’t date it from the middle of the free fall, which is what you are doing. The job losses that you are describing were 5 million jobs lost of the 8 million lost in the recession. He comes in at the middle of the free fall. Since the end of the recession, we have added about 3 million jobs. <br> It should be pretty obvious: The Stimulus made things worse. Indeed, this is exactly what we predicted on February 3, 2009, when one of us wrote a piece for Fox News.com declaring: “President Obama and the Democrats’ ‘stimulus’ package will increase the unemployment rate.” While the administration was claiming in January and February that unemployment would stop rising once the Stimulus was passed, that prediction was obviously wrong to us then. <br> Excerpted from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Debacle-Obamas-Growth-Regain-Future/dp/1118186176/ref=sr_1_1?s=booksie=UTF8qid=1331842720sr=1-1">Debacle: Obama's War on Jobs and Growth and What We Can Do Now to Regain Our Future by Grover G.

 Every year, Americans for Tax Reform Foundation calculates how many days the average American must work to earn enough income to pay off the regulatory and spending burdens at the local, state and federal levels of government. The findings, released in the Cost of Government Day report, have become more disheartening with each passing year of the Obama Administration. In 2011, Americans must work until August 12 to pay off the full costs of government. While most taxpayers may consider their government debt paid when they file taxes each April, the true costs of government extract a far greater toll from the working public. <br> Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill, hallmarks of the administration’s first few years, will have explosive costs, the impacts of which cannot even be quantified in the bills’ initial stages. This is because in both of the bills Congress punted most of the details to be sorted out by bureaucrats; Obamacare requires over 40 different rulemakings before it will be fully fleshed out while Dodd-Frank needs 500 different clarifications before it can be implemented in its entirety. This, combined with the economic uncertainty spurred by such ambiguous lawmaking, augurs little hope for the economic “recovery” the Administration assures us is forthcoming. <br> One estimate shows that a five percent reduction in regulator budgets would increase GDP by $376 billion and expand employment by 6.2 million jobs over five years. Conversely, for the 2011 $2.95 billon regulator budget increase, the economy loses 6.2 million jobs over five years. This suggests the regulatory burden plays a much larger role in economic productivity than is normally assumed, especially when a quick look-back shows that regulators’ budgets have grown by 72.5 percent over the past decade. <br> Nonetheless, the President’s budget relies on extremely unrealistic expectations for growth. His spending blueprint, which permanently increases spending to two percent higher than the historical average, is premised on a rate of growth averaging 4.71 percent over the next decade. Assuming more realistic growth constrained by historical averages (which is still far below recent levels), spending would actually rise to nearly 28 percent of GDP. <br> Economic growth will continue to stagnate as long as the looming regulatory threats remain, both in the form of coming rulemakings for incomplete legislation and aggressive executive overreach that has become commonplace in the Obama Administration. The economic growth foregone will only be one bite of this sour apple; businesses will not expand while the uncertain regulatory threat exists. Employers will not hire, consumers will be paralyzed and the stalled economic recovery will become the new normal. With the growing regulatory regime, later Cost of Government Days will be unavoidable absent serious and long-lasting reform. 
 When I was a speechwriter at the Pentagon, and drafted the national security parts of President Reagan’s State of the Union addresses, I used to record the speech. I’d then play it back three times: first, picture only -- no sound; then sound only; and finally picture and sound together. So, for part of last night's speech, I turned off the sound last night and just watched the body language.<br />President Obama looked like he was at a funeral. Here he was promising goodies for all – education, health care, tax reform, energy, troops, but he looked miserable. He had the command and power and majesty of the entire U.S. government sitting before him but he looked like he didn't want to be there. <br> He didn’t crack a smile while he delivered the speech, and he positively scowled when he walked out of the chamber, despite the applause and backslapping he enjoyed from the Democratic members of Congress.<br />On the other hand Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who was tapped to deliver the Republican response, looked energized. <br> And, if you turned off the sound, he looked like someone who relished the challenge. Here delivering his response to the State of the Union he was in a nearly impossible setting -- in an empty chamber staring straight into the camera. <br> Kathleen Troia K.T.

 Filing taxes is something that fills most of us with dread. We do the costly, complicated chore and can’t wait to move on. It’s usually not a day to celebrate. <br> But this year, for a change, there is good news. Thanks to the recently enacted“Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” this is the last time you will have to file your taxes under the old, outdated system. <br> For starters, it means the next time you file your taxes, you will benefit from a nearly doubled standard deduction:$12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. This change alone means greater simplicity that will allow nearly nine out of 10 people to do their taxes on a short, simple, and straightforward form next year. <br> Right now, eight of 10 Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck, leaving them one medical emergency, home repair, or other crisis away from being unable to make ends meet.Under the new system, the average tax cut for a median family of four is $2,059.For these families, more money in each paycheck isn’t crumbs—it’s a huge deal. Average families at every income level will see their federal taxes go down. This is meaningful relief for those who need it. <br> This new taxcode also makesfamilies a priority. It doubles the child tax credit so parents are getting more help with the costs of raising a family.It also provides more support for families as they plan for their futures by improving savings options for education. Under the new law, families can use 529 accounts to save for elementary, secondary, and higher education, whether that means college or a vocational school. <br> There’s a lot to look forward to, but thereality is the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” has already started to improve the lives of American families. The law has been a boon to the American economy. Unemployment is at a 17-year low, consumer confidence is near a 17-year high, and the manufacturing sector reached its highest hiring level since the recession last month, adding 380,000 workers. 
 The disconnect between what congressional Democrats are saying about the recently enacted tax cut and what is happening in the real world is so wide that it is getting difficult to see across the chasm. <br> House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who as the 15th richest member of Congress has a minimum net worth of nearly $30 million, referred to the millions of dollars in bonuses and pay hikes announced by more than 100 companies in the wake of the new tax law as “crumbs.” <br> But Pelosi is far from the only Democrat who voted against tax reform while arguing that it would be an economic “Armageddon” for everyday Americans. Behind her stands a long list of Democrats in states that Donald Trump won, in some cases by large margins, who will have to explain how they could have been so wrong. <br> Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri called the benefits of tax reform “scraps,” which sounds even worse than “crumbs.” Those “scraps” include $1,000 bonuses for all employees at the Bank of Advance in Advance, Missouri. Central Bancompany and BancorpSouth are also giving four-figure bonuses to Missouri-based employees. <br> Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota at first tried to persuade her middle-class constituents that they were facing a $10,000 tax increase. When that distortion was exposed, she quietly backtracked, although she still has not publicly acknowledged her dishonesty or apologized to state residents. <br> Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said he “introduced multiple amendments that could have put real money in the pockets of Ohioans. Instead Washington chose to cut taxes for millionaires and corporations.” But Ohioans in every tax bracket will get a tax cut, and the typical family of four with the median income will get a tax cut of more than $2,000. <br> Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana <a href="https://www.donnelly.senate.gov/newsroom/press/donnelly-bill-hikes-taxes-on-many" target="_blank">proclaimed that “instead of providing a tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the middle class, this bill cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans while raising taxes on a majority of families making less than $75,000 in the coming years.” Again, simply not true. A Tax Foundation analysis shows a tax cut for all income groups, “with some of the largest changes in after-tax income accruing to moderate-income families with children.” <br> Not only will those families be getting a tax cut instead, but Wisconsinites will also benefit in other ways. Green Bay-based Associated Bank, the state’s largest, is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour and giving employees a $500 bonus. Stevens Point-based Copperleaf Assisted Living will hand out $60,000 in bonuses to employees -- equal to the company’s entire savings from tax reform. <br> But reality is catching up to them – the reality that America’s economic future is brighter, and it’s no thanks to them. According to a recent New York Times<i> survey, “support for the law has grown significantly over the past month, and more Americans believe that they will receive a tax cut.” 
 The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com. <br> Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House Democratic leader, reduces the many problems with the GOP health care plan to this: “They have no idea how to explain stealing $600 billion from working families’ health care to give more tax breaks to the richest people in our country.” <br> Once again, the most important tweet last week in conservative politics did not come from President @realDonaldTrump. It came from Matt Drudge, the proprietor of the Drudge Report. <br> Drudge is looking ahead on the political horizon and seeing that ObamaCare replacement and tax reform can’t be separated. Without a health care plan that cuts federal spending, there is no chance for tax reform. <br> “And for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do health care before we do the tax cut,” he explained. <br> “It makes tax reform a lot harder, it makes it more difficult…” without a new, low-cost health care plan, Ryan noted. <br> But now with the GOP majority’s mash-up of an effort to replace ObamaCare, the tax reform plan looks like it is headed for the graveyard. The only hope for the GOP is to demand party loyalty to the ObamaCare replacement plan in the service of reviving the tax cuts. Ryan and Trump are twisting arms by telling GOP lawmakers that if they don’t pass tax reform, angry Republican voters will punish them in the 2018 midterms. <br> Voters have noticed. A Fox News poll showed 54 percent disapproval of the Republican plan. About two-thirds of those who dislike the proposal say their complaint is about “too many changes to ObamaCare.” <br> Even with that SOS call, the speaker’s problem is that the Tea Party’s Freedom Caucus wants more cuts to ObamaCare programs for seniors and the poor. That kind of fix will not arrest the decline in public support. <br> The biggest problem the Republicans face is the so-called “border adjustment tax.” Big manufacturers like Boeing support it, while big retailers like Walmart oppose it. <br> Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, raised the bar even higher when he told CNBC recently that any tax cut plan will be “deficit neutral over a 10-year period.” <br> “The fight over a border-adjustment tax isn’t the only challenge for Republicans in their push for tax reform,” The Hill reported last week. “Notably, some business groups have criticized the proposal to do away with the deduction for businesses’ net interest expenses.” <br> It’s not like Trump and Republicans lack political cover to go bold on taxes. The problem is that the congressional GOP is unable to reach consensus within its ranks on even its most basic principles. <br> In their talking points, congressional Republicans like to remind people that the nation has not seen comprehensive tax reform since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan worked with a Democratic speaker, Tip O’Neill. <br> When it comes to a health care plan and tax reform, the GOP might as well echo the famous words of the comic-strip character Pogo: “We have met the enemy and he is us.” 
 <b>Editor's note:</b>The following column originally appeared in<a href="http://theresurgent.com/the-gop-establishment-decides-to-stop-president-trumps-agenda/" target="_blank">The Resurgent.</i> <br> Conservatives support the repeal of ObamaCare, but moderate Republican establishment leaders do not. Guess what? ObamaCare is not being repealed. <br> Conservatives support tax reform, but, again, moderate Republican establishment leaders do not. Guess what? Tax reform is no where to be found. <br> Time and time again, the Republican establishment has blocked all those efforts. It is moderate and liberal Republicans who continue to stymie the advance of any and all conservative legislation President Trump supports. They want to grow government, subsidize ObamaCare, and reward their own special interests. They have no intention of providing a level playing field where the poor and middle class can compete against the rich. They’ve instead decided on a paternalism that keeps everyone piled on a social safety net with their friends rewarded.

Congress created the AMT in 1969 after the Treasury Department<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/senate-would-keep-individual-amt-turn-it-very-different-tax" target="_blank" title="www.taxpolicycenter.org">reportedthat 155 high-income<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/27149.pdf" target="_blank" title="www.finance.senate.gov">filerswere using tax breaks to avoid paying any income taxes. In 1970, it affected<a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/31886/411703-the-individual-alternative-minimum-tax-historical-data-and-projections.pdf" target="_blank" title="www.urban.org">only 20,000 very high-income taxpayers. But today, the number of people impacted has<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/how-would-repeal-state-and-local-tax-deduction-affect-taxpayers-who-pay-amt/full" target="_blank" title="www.taxpolicycenter.org">ballooned to 5.2 million. Most of those who currently pay the AMT are not from the highest-income households for which the tax was intended, but the middle and upper-middle class — folks who have enough money to be a ripe target of revenue raisers, but not enough to have influence on Capitol Hill. They are mostly two-earner households with mortgages to pay, who give to charity and have children. The AMT also hits the families of our fallen warriors. According to Burr, children who receive an annuity from the Uniformed Services Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)<a href="https://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/sen-burr-introduces-bill-to-relieve-tax-burden-for-families-of-fallen-servicemembers" target="_blank" title="www.burr.senate.gov">can see the AMT eat up as much as 26 percent of their benefit. No Republican tax bill should punish individuals like these — especially not to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest among us. <br> Members of the Trump administration know that the AMT is a horrible tax. In 2006, Kevin Hassett — now chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers — called the AMT<a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/want-to-fix-the-amt-here-are-two-simple-steps/" target="_blank" title="www.aei.org">“an economic abomination”and urged Congress to “erase it from the tax code completely.” Yet instead of erasing it, Republicans are retaining it. 
 There was a time when the Democrats were the party of working Americans. They seemed to understand and fight for the interests of the working class and people living in poverty. Republicans, by contrast, struggled for decades with the perception that they were “for the rich.” <br> Well, how things have turned around. Just look at the latest economic pronouncements of leading establishment Democrats. <br> It’s almost unbelievable – but true. De Leon (who is also the leading challenger to Sen. Dianne Feinstein in her primary battle as she seeks re-election this year) has proposed setting up a new so-called charity that would enable the Silicon Valley and Hollywood elite to claw back their losses from the Trump administration’s new tax reform law. <br> That tax reform law, let’s remind ourselves, actually means that some of the richest people in the richest parts of America will pay more in taxes, thanks to drastic cuts in deductions for state and local taxes they pay. <br> Who would benefit from this bit of creative accounting? Californians earning over $1 million a year, mainly. <br> Another prominent California Democrat also revealed her true colors this past week over taxes: our old friend, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. She dismissed $1,000 worker bonuses given in response to the GOP tax cuts as “crumbs.” <br> You can see the new left elitism in their attitude to immigration too. Their total rejection of any effort to clamp down on the out-of-control low-wage immigration that harms American workers shows that establishment Democrats’ sympathies now lie with big business, not working people. <br> In a 2105 interview Sanders said: “Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have to do everything we can to create millions of jobs. You know what youth unemployment is in the United States of America today? If you're a white high school graduate, it's 33 percent, Hispanic 36 percent, African American 51 percent. You think we should open the borders and bring in a lot of low-wage workers, or do you think maybe we should try to get jobs for those kids?” 
 A month ago, liberals were celebrating a<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/09/05/sessions-trump-administration-to-end-daca-program/" target="_blank">sudden deal on “Dreamers”that President Trump made with congressional Democrats. Chuck Schumer, the senate minority leader, was downright giddy when a hot mic later<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/09/14/schumer-insists-hes-still-buds-with-trump/" target="_blank">caught him gloating that Trump “likes me.” <br> Now the wedding is off, the bromance kaput, and<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/10/08/trump-seeks-border-wall-in-exchange-for-dreamers-deal/" target="_blank">a new deal will have to be made. Blame it on the wall. 
 Despite the slight differences in the House and Senate tax reform bills, overall both are good for American innovation. <br> We need a new tax plan to support American innovation, because our history and success as a nation derive from our primacy in this area. Our relatively young nation has excelled because of our scrappy, can-do entrepreneurial culture and diverse immigrant roots. We’re all attracted by – and based in – bedrock of strong constitutional freedoms. This alone makes us unique. <br> The scorecard judges each nation on a total of 27 indicators across 12 categories. It lays out a strategy that says innovation is tied to having an environment that embraces disruptive technologies, promotes civil and economic liberties and fosters a diverse and talented population. Spoiler alert – the U.S. does well, but not by every measure. Our country’s worst score is in the tax category. <br> Simply put, our tax laws today – along with our immigration policies – incentivize American companies to shift jobs abroad. Our rates are so high that there is a perverse incentive for American companies to be acquired by foreign companies that enjoy a lower tax rate. By lowering corporate taxes and shifting to a territorial system of taxation the rest of the world uses, U.S. companies will have a level playing field and be able to invest in and hire more American workers. <br> Last year, for the first time in 30 years, more U.S. manufacturing jobs were created or returned from overseas than left our country. Technology drives the U.S. economy, supporting 15.3 million U.S. jobs and accounting for ten percent of gross domestic product in 2015 alone. Imagine a tax system that can further unleash America’s strongest industries to compete more vigorously. <br> As a matter of long-standing policy, CTA does not lobby or ask the federal government for money specifically for our industry. We have not sought, nor are we receiving in the tax bill special deals for innovators and the technology industry. But our corporate leaders believe the growing federal debt is an existential problem threatening our nation and our children’s future. 
 The mainstream media is cynically using a lot of traumatized teens from Parkland, Fla., in their latest shameful attack on President Trump and the National Rifle Association. <br> <b>Tired of Facebook blocking Conservative Conversation? Click here for a free subscription to Todd's weekly newsletter; a must-read for Conservatives!</b> <br> You sicken me, said one child on CBS. President Trump, you control the House of Representatives, you control the Senate, and you control the executive [branch]. You haven’t taken a single bill for mental health care or gun control and passed it. And that’s pathetic. We’ve seen a government shutdown, we’ve seen tax reform, but nothing to save our children’s lives. Are you kidding me? You think now is the time to focus on the past and not the future to prevent the death of thousands of other children? <br> Another student threatened to dismantle the NRA and others hurled vile profanities at President Trump and law-abiding gun owners. <br> Honestly, we can't fault the kids. They have been through an unimaginable ordeal, and long before that, their minds were poisoned by liberals who believe there's something wrong with the Second Amendment. <br> And now CNN and MSNBC are using the kids as political pawns. 
 The GOP tax plan is, to quote Joe Biden, a “big f***ing deal.” For Republicans, it is a chance at redemption, having failed miserably to follow through on their number one campaign promise: repealing and replacing ObamaCare. For Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, it is an opportunity to demonstrate the leadership that was lacking in the health care battle. For President Trump, passing comprehensive tax reform would show supporters that he can navigate the swamp, and that their votes meant something. For the country, the proposed changes rolled out Wednesday could be a major shot of B-12, energizing investment and spending. <br> Most important to that end is the suggested 20 percent tax rate for corporations, down from 35 percent, the resolution of our one-off treatment of overseas-earned income and lower taxes for so-called “pass-through” entities. The latter include many millions of small businesses whose owners have historically filed as individuals and paid a top rate of 39.6 percent; under the plan, their rate declines to 25 percent. Since small firms (defined as having fewer than 500 employees) account for well over half of job growth, providing tax relief for that sector will boost hiring and investment. <br> Those measures are welcome. Donald Trump was elected because millions of working people were discouraged by our nation’s sluggish growth and miserly income gains. During the Obama years the economic cylinder that failed to spark was business investment. The torrent of regulations, White House hostility to the business community, anxieties left over from the financial crisis and excessively high taxes combined to staunch spending, resulting in below-par growth and reduced productivity. That under-investment hampered wage increases, and makes this effort at tax reform critical. <br> On the individual side, the news is mixed. The plan calls for a modest hike in the lowest tax bracket (from 10 percent to 12 percent), but claims that, Typical families in the existing 10 percent bracket are expected to be better off under the framework due to the larger standard deduction, larger child tax credit and additional tax relief that will be included during the committee process.” Elsewhere, rates are lowered, and the near-doubling of the standard deduction will help most Americans. <br> In addition, getting rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax will be celebrated by those caught in its ever-expanding and unintended web. As Mercatus Center fellow Veronique de Rugy once wrote, “The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was created in 1969 to prevent 155 wealthy taxpayers from using deductions and credits to avoid paying any federal income taxes.” Last year it ensnared over four million taxpayers. <br> Rather than provide tax relief to people with high incomes, the Group of Six legislators and White House participants who crafted the plan decided to ditch the inheritance tax. Prepare to hear howls from Democrats, who will charge that the program is a big give-away to the rich. In fact, they are right; only people who die with an estate valued at more than $5.49 million will owe any inheritance tax. Taxing income rather than wealth, in my view, is a questionable priority but doing away with the inheritance tax has long been a priority for the GOP, and rightly so. <br> Much of the details of the plan will be hammered out in committee. There, legislators will have to stare down the harsh glare of Nancy Pelosi et al, and endure the inevitable demagoguery from the liberal media. They will have to show some fortitude, and some cohesion, which they failed to do in the health care battle. 
 Democrats have a lot to say about the Republican tax-reform plan, including that it is a “middle class con job” and is going to cost the GOP its congressional majorities. That’s quite the bold claim, coming from the party that is in fact in uncharted tax-politics territory. <br> Americans have short political memories, which means it is no longer possible to remember a world in which Democrats didn’t hate tax cuts. And in the mainstream media—which shares the left’s penchant for class warfare—it’s also no longer possible to read an analysis that doesn’t assume Democrats are on the right side of history, that these tax cuts are “unpopular,” and that this reform holds grave political risks for Republicans. <br> Based on what? Democrats certainly have no modern evidence of these propositions, since they’ve never uniformly opposed tax cuts. In fact, it’s been 16 years since the party even engaged in a big tax brawl, during George W. Bush’s first year as president. What’s striking is just how many Democrats enthusiastically signed on to Mr. Bush’s tax bill, and just how far off the political rails the party has gone in the intervening years. <br> While the Bush tax package was hardly as sweeping as today’s reform, it contained similar provisions. It cut marginal rates across the board, even knocking nearly 5 points off the top marginal rate for the 1 percent. It cut capital-gains taxes and lowered the estate tax to zero in 2010, before the reductions expired. These are all cuts that House and Senate Democrats today uniformly decry as giveaways to the rich and powerful. 
 When the Republican-controlled Congress first approved its tax bill in December, most Democrats believed it would be a political loser for the GOP. Indeed, a New York Times poll found that just 37 percent of Americans approved of the plan. “To pass a bill of tax cuts and have it be so unpopular with the American people is an amazing achievement for the Republicans — it’s never been done before,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.)<a href="https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/943566295571804162" target="_blank" title="twitter.com">crowed. <br> He’s not crowing any more. In January support had risen to 46 percent, and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/business/economy/tax-overhaul-survey.html?mtrref=undefinedgwh=BE9F87CA13BE95CC196994BC3E60A702gwt=pay" target="_blank" title="www.nytimes.com">this weekit reached a 51 percent majority. Meanwhile, disapproval has dropped from 57 percent in December to 45 percent today. That is a swing of 26 points. <br> It is taking time for voters to figure this out. In 2001, when President George W. Bush<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/president-bush-signs-tax-cut-into-law-june-7-2001-223868" target="_blank" title="www.politico.com">passedhis across-the-board tax cuts, his message was simple: Every American who pays taxes will get a tax cut. But in 2017, Republicans overhauled more of the entire tax code. They cut tax rates and<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/?utm_term=.9e0309d16b05" target="_blank" title="www.washingtonpost.com">doubledthe standard deduction but also eliminated many traditional deductions for those who itemize. As a result, a lot of taxpayers didn’t know whether they would end up winners or losers. <br> Now, more Americans are starting to discover that they are winners. Millions are starting to receive their Trump tax cuts as employers lower their tax withholdings, leaving more money in their paychecks. And the bill will become more popular as more people learn the good news. Even now,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/business/economy/tax-overhaul-survey.html?mtrref=undefinedgwh=D117CDC919EB81A438C5665C45D1BEDFgwt=pay" target="_blank" title="www.nytimes.com">only one-third of Americansthink they will see an income tax cut. Many voters are going to be pleasantly surprised when they discover their taxes are being reduced thanks to President Trump and Republican lawmakers. And that does not take into account the bonuses and raises that many Americans are receiving from their employers because of the corporate tax cuts — or the wage increases they will get from the economic growth that tax reform unleashes in the months and years ahead. <br> Democrats are in a bind because they voted against that increase in take-home pay. The growing public support for tax reform is especially a problem for the five vulnerable Senate Democrats running for reelection in states that Trump won<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/?utm_term=.c3f404f42a06" target="_blank" title="www.washingtonpost.com">by double digits. All of them will have a hard time explaining why they sided with the “resistance” and opposed giving their constituents a tax cut. 
 It’s the middle of July, and President Trump still doesn’t have a chairman for his Council of Economic Advisers. His nominee, Kevin Hassett, is a world-recognized expert on taxation, but he has been stuck on the sidelines despite tax reform being one of the administration’s big goals this year. He is the one person who could explain how the different parts of the tax bill fit together. <br> White House advisor Gary Cohn has reportedly told associates that time is running out for tax reform. He worries that if tax reform doesn't get done by the end of the year, it likely won’t happen at all. Missing key players such as Hassett doesn’t help. <br> The Senate Banking Committee very easily advanced Hassett’s nomination last month, with only Elizabeth Warren opposing. Other liberal Democrats such as Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Jack Reed (R.I.), Robert Menedez (N.J.), and Brian Schatz (Hawaii) all voted in Hassett’s favor. <br> The economists who know Hassett best also support him. Forty-four prominent economists, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike, signed a letter supporting Hassett’s confirmation. <br> It read, in part, as follows: “While the signers of this letter hold a range of views on President Trump’s policies, we all believe that the formulation of economic policy would be advanced by the analysis and advice that Dr. Hassett would bring to the table.” They also noted Hassett’s “record of serious scholarship.” The signers included all of President Obama’s Council Chairmen (Jason Furman, Alan Krueger, Christina Romer, Austan Goolsbee), President Clinton’s chairs (Laura Tyson, Martin Baily), Vice President Joe Biden’s chief economist Jared Bernstein, and Obama economic advisor Mark Zandi. <br> Hassett’s confirmation stands at 76 days and counting. For past incoming administrations, the chairman would have officially started his job by around February 26. <br> So far, only 24 percent of Trump's nominees have been confirmed. At this point in their administrations, Obama had 57 percent of his nominees confirmed and George W. Bush had 59 percent. And the low confirmation rate isn’t because Trump has clogged up the system with nominees. Trump has made just 206 nominations, compared to 355 for Obama and 313 for Bush. <br> People in the White House have told me that the current Council of Economic Advisers has been useless, staffed as it is with only Democrats who are hostile to Trump’s policies. As a result, others in the White House have had to do the research and put together the analyses that would normally be done by the Council. <br> President Trump runs an efficient ship. Under Melania, the first lady’s staff is 4. Under Michelle Obama, there were 22 people doing the same job. For Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, there were 18 and up to 19 respectively. The whole Trump administration is making do with less, but the Democrats won’t even let him fill those positions. 
 Democrats are expecting to retake control of Congress in the November midterm elections, and anti-Trump political “experts” and their media allies are predictably jumping on the Democratic bandwagon. &nbsp; <br> “History is on our side,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicts. <br> FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-wave-could-turn-into-a-flood/" target="_blank">recently suggestedthe “Democrats’ wave could turn into a flood.” <br> While the November elections will certainly be a challenge for Republicans,<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/01/09/republicans-will-keep-control-congress-this-year-heres-why.html" target="_blank">as I recently explained, Democrats shouldn’t be too overconfident. <br> But suppose the Democrats are right and the anti-Trump media get their way. What would a Democratic takeover of Congress mean for Americans? <br> Public Citizen, an anti-Trump advocacy group,<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/donald-trumps-properties-reveal-unprecedented-conflicts-of-interest-warns-public-citizen-report.html" target="_blank">recently accusedPresident Trump of “unprecedented conflicts of interest.” Why? Because Republican candidates and other individuals stayed at properties linked to the president. <br> At the same time, more than 100 Democrats have<a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/more-than-100-democrats-demand-house-investigation-of-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations/article/2643254" target="_blank">joined togetherasking the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to launch an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against President Trump. <br> Stock market slump <br> Much of the Trump boom can be traced to consumer confidence, which remains at a<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/27/news/economy/us-consumer-confidence/index.html" target="_blank">17-year high. And tax reform certainly hasn’t hurt. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/details-analysis-2017-senate-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/" target="_blank">increase America’s gross domestic product by nearly 4 percentover the long term, while creating almost 1 million full-time jobs. <br> Imagine the market shock if Democratic leadership makes it a top priority to investigate and impeach President Trump, while obstructing his pro-growth agenda of lower taxes and fewer regulations. <br> Open borders on overdrive<u> President Trump continues to take the lead on border security and is seeking $25 billion from Congress for a wall along our southern border. 
 Editor's Note: This first appeared in The Hill. <br> An old proverb says a leader with no followers is “onlytaking a walk.” <br> A Morning Consult poll released last week found Trump losing support in states he easily carried last year. He is down 23 points in Tennessee since his inauguration in January, down 21 points in Mississippi, down 20 in Kentucky, down 19 in Kansas and down 17 in Indiana. <br> On Capitol Hill, House and Senate Republicans are also walking away from Trump. <br> In part, this is due to his attacks on Senate Majority Leader<a href="http://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker<a href="http://thehill.com/people/paul-ryan" target="_blank">Paul Ryan, R-Wis. <br> Bannon said last week he plans to challenge incumbent Republican senators in seven states, including Arizona’s<a href="http://origin-nyi.thehill.com/people/jeff-flake" target="_blank">Jeff Flake, Mississippi’s<a href="http://thehill.com/people/roger-wicker" target="_blank">Roger Wicker, Nebraska’s<a href="http://thehill.com/people/deb-fischer" target="_blank">Deb Fischer, Nevada’s<a href="http://thehill.com/people/dean-heller" target="_blank">Dean Hellerand Wyoming’s<a href="http://thehill.com/people/john-barrasso" target="_blank">John Barrasso. <br> Speaking on Sean Hannity’s radio show, Gingrich stated the obvious: It would be better for the GOP if the president and his allies spent their time trying to beat incumbent Democratic senators. <br> Corker denied that, shooting back that it is a “shame the White House has become an adult day care center.” He added that Trump has hurt U.S. foreign relations with his impetuous tweets on world affairs, including “things that are not true.” <br> Corker was not “set up” by the Times. A transcript showed the senator stating, “I understand we’re on the record.” <br> “Last time I checked, you are the president of the United States, so tweeting out these tacky insults just seems beneath you,” Neil Cavuto of Fox News said on his show last week. “You are running out of friends faster than you are running out of time. You might not like Bob Corker, but a lot of senators do, and you need those senators, sir.” <br> Thomas Barrack told The Washington Post he was “shocked” and “stunned” by Trump’s recent comments. <br> To win back some followers, Trump needs a win. <br> But once again he is strutting with no one behind him as he abandons tax reform. He is focused on tax cuts for the rich. <br> The New York Times analysis of the tax cut plan concluded it would be a “huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans” and “not directly benefit the bottom third of the population.” Polls show Americans oppose tax cuts for the rich. <br> Trump has also failed to deliver on his campaign promise to build a southern border wall and have Mexico pay for it. He continues to say it will get done. But, again, polls show voters don’t want a wall. <br> Instead, having failed to win a full repeal of the health care law from the Republican majority in Congress, he signed an executive order allowing low-cost insurance to be sold across state lines. <br> So it’s no wonder Trump now walks alone. He remains a celebrity figure for his hardcore base. But10 months into his presidency, Republicans are starting to drift away as he fails to deliver on nearly every major campaign promise he made. 
 <b>Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Resurgent.</i> <br> Mitch McConnell, in public, says he wants to pass a health care reform plan that repeals ObamaCare. Remember, McConnell says he wants to scrap ObamaCare “root and branch.” <br> McConnell, again and again, stacks the deck against conservatives, setting them up to be the fall guy for his own failures. <br> ObamaCare repeal is just about dead, even though it cannot be filibustered either. <br> Tax reform is dead on arrival. 
 The economy has responded well to the tax cuts that became law in January. Growth is up, as is take-home pay. But there was a glaring omission in the tax bill that President Trump signed into law: there was no cut in the capital gains tax rates that act as a brake on more jobs and investment. <br> President Trump’s appointment Wednesday of supply-side economist Larry Kudlow as head of the National Economic Council could change that. There is no more passionate advocate of having the president issue an executive order to index capital gains for inflation. Unlocking frozen assets and stimulating investment, such a move would further turbocharge the U.S. economy. <br> Eliminating the tax on inflationary capital gains makes sense on the grounds of both growth and fairness. Back in the 1980s, President Reagan included in his tax reform the indexing of much of the federal tax code for inflation, so wage earners wouldn’t be automatically bumped into higher tax brackets. <br> Larry Kudlow was then the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration. He notes that the horse-trading that led to the omission of capital gains indexation from the Reagan program “has bedeviled economists who consider it bad policy to levy a tax on inflationary gains.” <br> In other words, the capital gains tax paid on such investments can easily exceed 100 percent once inflation is factored in. <br> Kudlow quoted Robbins’ prediction that indexing capital gains for inflation starting last year would, by 2025, create an additional 400,000 jobs and boost our gross domestic product by roughly $500 billion. That would translate into an additional $3,600 for the average American household. <br> McIntosh, a former Republican congressman from Indiana, says that key White House players have recognized the pro-growth elements of such a move. He notes that his successor in Congress was Mike Pence, now the vice president, who introduced a bill to index capital gains for assets held for more than three years. One of the co-sponsors of the Pence bill was Mick Mulvaney, the current head of President Trump’s Office of Management and Budget. <br> Prior to that, President George H.W. Bush was stymied in his efforts to get capital gains reform by a Democratic Senate. Boyden Gray, President Bush’s White House legal counsel, told me that the president had extensive research done into whether he could fix the problem through an executive order. <br> At the last minute, objections were raised by Justice Department lawyers who questioned if President Bush had the legal authority to reinterpret the section of the Internal Revenue Service Code covering the definition of the word “cost.” <br> Since then, the legal case for the president’s authority to act has grown. Charles Cooper, who headed the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under President Regan, and attorney Vincent Colatriano wrote in 2012 in the Harvard Journal of Law Public Policy that jurisprudential developments over the last two decades have confirmed ... that Treasury has regulatory authority to index capital gains for inflation. <br> A 2005 case affirmed the right of a federal agency to interpret an ambiguous provision of the law, while a 2011 case made clear that Treasury Department regulations could be interpreted in this way. <br> Ryan Ellis, the former director of federal tax policy for Americans for Tax Reform, said Kudlow understands that “now is the time, and now is the moment” for President Trump to act. 
 <b>Editor's note:The following column originally appeared in The Resurgent.</i> <br> Let’s be honest here. The Republicans in Congress were always going to find some deal with the Democrats.

By giving the Democrats a three month extension, the president has essentially compressed the legislative calendar. The GOP will now have to do tax reform, immigration, spending, and debt ceiling all at one time. This exponentially increases the odds of a terrible deal. <br> Using the newly compressed legislative calendar as an excuse, they will undoubtedly cut several bad deals with Democrats and lump them all together in a couple of pieces of legislation. Remember, there are two parties in Washington, the stupid party and the evil party.

 Not many years ago, an ad for a newspaper warned that, “If you miss a day, you miss a lot.” <br> Now you don’t need a day to miss a lot. Mere seconds of inattention can get you behind the curve. What, you didn’t hear about the latest predator to fall on his sword? <br> Then there’s the White House, where the dynamics of upheaval are entering a crucial phase. Although many deplorables believe they finally have a government looking out for them, much of Washington and the American left are preparing to dance on the grave of Donald Trump’s presidency. <br> That is one way to look at Flynn — if you assume he has beans to spill. He was close to Trump but it’s worth noting that Flynn pled guilty to a single count of lying to the FBI, including about a phone conversation he had with a Russian official last Dec. 29 — seven weeks after the election. <br> That’s the same call that got Flynn fired after less than a month as Trump’s national security adviser because he lied to the vice president about whether the conversation covered sanctions. <br> “No collusion,” Trump said Saturday. “There was absolutely no collusion. So we are very happy.”

That is a pretty big division. <br> The Senate Republican leader openly criticizes the Republican president. Republican John McCain returns to D.C. just in time to sink the Republican health care plan. And if you think there is agreement among republicans on tax reform, dream on! <br> ObamaCare is collapsing and millions are hurting: fix it! 
 Liberal billionaire George Soros grabbed headlines at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday by attacking internet giants Google and Facebook. Conveniently ignoring his own investment in these companies, Soros branded them a “menace to society.” <br> “They deliberately engineer addiction to the services they provide,” Soros said. “This can be very harmful, particularly for adolescents. There is a similarity between internet platforms and gambling companies. Casinos have developed techniques to hook gamblers to the point where they gamble away all their money, even money they don’t have. Something very harmful and maybe irreversible is happening to human attention in the digital age. Not just distraction or addiction: social media companies are inducing people to give up their autonomy.” <br> But let’s remember: it’s money he made off the backs of the poor and the working class. Soros’ gambling happens to have wrecked the lives of millions of working people, not least in the United Kingdom, where his manipulation of the currency markets in the early 1990s caused a deep recession and untold misery for millions. <br> Soros claimed that President Trump is attempting to turn America into “a mafia state,” and – really amping up the hyperventilation (was it the mountain air?) – he argued that “not only the survival of open society but the survival of our entire civilization is at stake. The rise of leadership such as Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States have much to do with this.” <br> In this one absurdly overblown sentence, the ludicrous hysteria of the Trump-hating elite is revealed. What on Earth is Soros talking about? <br> It is particularly upsetting to me personally to see Soros, a fellow Hungarian, make these over- the-top-claims, given our shared history. My father was a contemporary of Soros in Hungary, where both experienced an actual assault on the open society in the form of Soviet-backed communism. 
 Now that President Trump has survived his first 100 days, a burning question in Washington is whether House Speaker Paul Ryan will survive the second 100 days. A miracle might be needed. <br> Ryan’s repeated inability to pass anything resembling a repeal of ObamaCare goes beyond simple failure. It’s shaping up as a potential disaster for the Trump presidency and the GOP congressional majority. <br> But Friday’s<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/04/28/still-short-on-support-gop-delays-health-care-vote/" target="_blank">second collapse of the effortsuggests Ryan can’t deliver the GOP’s majority caucus. And if he can’t deliver it to drive a stake in ObamaCare, why should anyone think he can deliver it for tax reform or immigration, both of which will be even more contentious among Republicans? 
 Should the government borrow against the future? Should it guarantee higher taxes for your children and grandchildren in return for lower taxes for you? <br> If government’s moral legitimacy depends on the consent of the governed, as Thomas Jefferson argued in the Declaration of Independence, can the federal government morally compel those who haven’t consented to its financial profligacy -- because they are not yet born -- to pay higher taxes? <br> In fact, with the exception of a few courageous senators, such as Rand Paul of Kentucky, and representatives, such as Justin Amash of Michigan and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, most in Congress in both parties think the only limit on the government‘s taxing power is what it can politically get away with at any given moment. <br> The numbers are chilling. <br> The federal government collects about $2.5 trillion in revenue and spends about $4 trillion, annually. The difference between what it collects and what it spends is made up in borrowing. But it doesn’t borrow money as you or I do or any business does -- with a planned schedule to pay back the principal it owes plus interest. Rather, it goes deeper into debt to pay its debts. <br> Since the presidency of Woodrow Wilson 100 years ago, however, with two then-novel revenue-generating tools -- the personal income tax to produce cash and the Federal Reserve to print cash -- the federal government has rolled over debt but has never retired it. Stated differently, the feds have always made timely interest payments, but when principal has come due, they have simply borrowed more money to pay the principal and of course thereby incurred more debt. <br> No household, no business, no bank, no government can long survive by doing this. <br> The Republican House tax changes -- they cannot be called a “reform,” because they reform nothing; they just redistribute wealth and add debt -- would lower taxes for some and raise taxes for many and add $1.5 trillion in debt for all. <br> But you won’t hear any of this debated in Congress because there -- and in the White House, as well -- we have insufficient political courage to address this problem prudently. <br> The bubble, soon to consist of $1 trillion in annual federal government interest payments on $25 trillion in debt, has been characterized by no less a warrior than the current secretary of defense and by his colleague the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the greatest contemporary threat to national security America faces -- greater than Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korea and all the terrorist crazies who wish us ill combined. <br> Happy Thanksgiving.

 With the U.S. Senate still working on critically important legislation to replace the collapsing ObamaCare law, President Trump is focused on making sure that the American Dream is obtainable now and for future generations. Already, he has proven to be the greatest advocate for America, its proud citizens, and our working men and women since President Reagan. <br> One of the reasons Donald Trump ran for president in the first place was that he realized our leaders in Washington had forgotten about American jobs, American workers and American security. Hardworking American taxpayers were fed up with politicians in D.C. focused on seemingly everything but them. <br> The optimistic message of ushering in a new era of American exceptionalism begins and ends with American job creation. <br> Last week, for example, the White House hosted companies from all 50 states that make their products right here in the United States of America, providing good jobs for American workers. This Made in America initiative launched by President Trump should be a priority regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. <br> Since his first day in office, President Trump has worked to help American job creators, mindful of the wise observation by the late Republican Congressman Jack Kemp of New York that “you can’t have employees without employers.” <br> The president also understands the importance of opening up America’s vast untapped domestic energy resources for exploration and production. This type of comprehensive energy policy will create many thousands of American jobs and reduce our trade deficit with foreign nations. It is decades overdue. <br> Dramatically reducing the high U.S. tax burden will help to accomplish this. The president’s plan would slash the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. Job creators yearn for the certainty that taxes are going down and won’t be raised. Individual tax rates must also be lowered and our tax code must be simplified. <br> A robust tax reform plan must be taken up as the top priority for this Congress and signed into law by President Trump later this year. Americans heard this campaign promise from Republicans and then elected Republican majorities in the House and Senate to make the promise a reality. Every American will benefit from this enormous pro-growth reform measure. <br> I’m hopeful that some Democrats in the Senate who represent states carried by President Trump in 2016 will join with him and Republicans to support tax reform. These include Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Bill Nelson of Florida, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Their constituents all deserve common-sense tax relief. <br> Throughout the eight years of Barack Obama and during the failed candidacy of Hillary Clinton, Democrats lost their way. 
 What happens when small business regains the spring in its step? Let’s hope we’re about to find out; 2018 could be a historic year for the half of our economy that has always made America great. <br> In 2017, small-business owners returned to their characteristic optimism, reversing years of discouragement with a level of cheer and hopefulness that can only be found in American entrepreneurs who feel free, and who feel appreciated (or at the very least not persecuted) by their government. <br> I used to work with Dunkelberg; he’s very smart and very diplomatic. I think what he meant was: Small business owners like Trump, and his policies, a lot more than they liked Obama. They sense that Trump “gets” them – he’s a business owner himself, so he understands the realities of being a risk-taker, an employer and a jack-of-all-trades (from marketing to personnel, from regulatory and tax compliance to sales, independent business owners wear an incredible number of hats and bravely shoulder an enormous amount of responsibility). <br> What will determine the success of small business in 2018? Sentiment will matter, just as it does on Wall Street and with consumers. Fortunately for our economy, those feelings of freedom and appreciation that entrepreneurs have been experiencing of late are likely to be bolstered by the reality of public policy, and presidential leadership, in 2018. <br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes (which they find to be too high, too complicated and too many); <br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health care (which, for them, is so expensive that the price of premiums can make them re-think their decision to be self-employed). <br> Regulatory relief should be real for small firms in 2018 as well. President Trump’s commitment to reducing the number of federal regulations is likely to continue – it is already one of his most prominent accomplishments as president. <br> The shrinking of the community banking sector is another potential limitation on small business births and growth, and there is cause for concern about cultural shifts – younger generations claim to aspire to business ownership, but also display an aversion to risk which is antithetical to starting and running a business. 
 Just a week ago President Trump released his proposal to reduce tax rates on corporations and individuals, and already the administration and its critics are talking past each other. The White House says its overall goal is to accelerate economic growth, while detractors reply that the tax plan will benefit the wealthy. But since when is tax relief for high earners and private sector job-creators at cross-purposes with a faster-growing economy? <br> In 1961 a reporter asked President Kennedy why he supported a tax cut. “To stimulate the economy,” Kennedy replied. “Don’t you remember your Economics 101?” The economy Kennedy inherited from President Eisenhower was still expanding but the pace slowed in the second half of the 1950s. There had been three recessions during Eisenhower’s two terms, and the last one was still in progress when Kennedy took office. 
 House Republicans have unveiled tax reform and reduction legislation that is also an amazingly powerful job creation bill. <br> After eight years of the slowest “recovery” in modern American history, we are now poised to create millions of jobs and move from our Obama-era 2 percent economic growth rate to our historic average of 3 percent growth and beyond.President Reagan’s growth rates were over 4 percent. We will match and likely surpass that. <br> Every decision was focused on “what creates the most jobs and income increases for Americans” and “how do we make this permanent,” so we do not have a repeat of the 2012 disappearing tax cuts, when the Bush-era tax cuts expired. <br> It would double the standard deduction from $12,000 for a married couple to $24,000.This makes the claim by Democrats that this legislation raises taxes on middle-income Americans look foolish. Heck, even the Washington Post “fact checker” called out the Democrats for faking the numbers to suggest this is not a tax cut for the vast majority of Americans, in a story headlined: “Senate Democrats falsely claim GOP tax plan will raise taxes for most working-class families.” <br> The tax bill would also cut rates for all Americans.The new rates would be 0 percent, 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. Yes, the top rate would still be the same as what we have now (all the others would be reduced), but it wouldn’t kick in until an income of $1 million for a couple. <br> The alternative minimum tax would be abolished.That was imposed in 1969 to hit 115 people and now hits several million. <br> Manufacturing would rebound because the tax bill would allow businesses to expense all new business investment in the first year, rather than over a decade or more.That drops the cost of new investment in job-creating, income-enhancing technology. <br> The next step is to move the legislation through the House Ways and Means Committee, which should happen quickly because the members were part of writing the bill, and then through the full House. <br> The president called the tax legislation “a great bill” when it was unveiled Thursday and said his administration is “working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas.” 
 The growing momentum behind federal tax cuts has defenders of high taxes worried. Witness their decision to start badmouthing Kansas tax cuts. <br> Tax-and-spend liberals and their media allies are trying to tie President Trump’s tax reform framework tothe 2012 tax cuts in Kansas, which browbeaten Republicans largely reversed earlier this year.<br /> “Kansastried a tax plan similar to Trump’s. It failed,” reads a recentNew York Timesheadline. “A warning to Washington fromKansas,” reads another from CNN. “Kansasabandons massive tax cuts that provided model for Trump’s plan,” saysThe Guardian.</i><br /> A closer look atKansas’ tax cut experience reveals this argument is more style than substance. That’s not to say Republican tax reform advocates in Congress and the White House can’t learn fromKansas– just not the lesson that pro-tax activists are trying to impart.&nbsp;<b> Some background: In 2012,KansasGov. Sam Brownback signed a bill cutting taxes for all state income earners and eliminating them for small businesses that had previously been subject to individual rates. Brownback wanted to give some relief to hardworking taxpayers and boost tepid economic growth.<b> The fallout, according to media accounts, was near apocalyptic: a “spectacular failure” (Los Angeles Times) that caused “hemorrhaging government revenue” (New York Times).<b> But looking at objective government figures, the results are far more positive. According to Census Bureau<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/KSTOTLTAX" target="_blank">data,Kansas’ total tax revenues actually rose in 2012, the year the tax cut<a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/" target="_blank">took effect, to $7.4 billion – a 9 percent increase from $6.8 billion in 2011. Revenues grew further to $7.6 billion in 2013.&nbsp;<br /> How can reality be so different from rhetoric? Well, it’s true thatKansas’ total tax revenue dipped to $7.3 billion in 2014, largely due to the commodity price crash and fiscal cliff federal tax hikes that reduced revenues in several states. <br> Meanwhile, the tax cuts allowed all employees in Kansas to keep a little more of their earnings, which helped Kansas’ real median household income to increase by 15 percent between 2011 and 2016. This income growth was four times faster than the Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma average, and noticeably outpaced the national rate of 11 percent. <br> This isn’t to say thatKansas’ income tax cut could not have been designed better. Rather than eliminating the small-business tax rate entirely, policymakers should have simply cut it deeply, so it could still capture revenue from ensuing economic growth. Similarly, eliminating deductions, credits, and loopholes – part of Brownback’s original plan – would have broadened the tax base to make the tax code fairer and more efficient. <br> The proposal Republicans in Congress are working on would do both these things, cutting the small business rate to 25 percent from about 40 percent, and eliminating deductions like the one for state and local taxes that force people in low-tax states to effectively subsidize high-tax states.&nbsp; 
 President-elect Donald Trump’s dramatic deal with air conditioner manufacturer Carrier to keep jobs in America is not the only major campaign promise that he's working to keep. <br> “We're already sitting down and discussing this with Congress,” Mnuchin said. “And this is going to be something that happens absolutely within the first 90 days of this presidency. We're going to have a major tax reform, biggest tax reform since Reagan. And it's not just going to be a cut in corporate taxes, but it's also going to be a very large middle income tax cut that's going to help this country.” <br> Mnuchin is also revealing that the Trump team is moving ahead with the president-elect's plan to allow multi-national corporations to repatriate trillions of dollars in profits that are held overseas at a 10 percent rate. That means companies can bring all of that money back to America to build factories, manufacturing centers and create jobs. <br> “The president-elect's made it very clear he wants the Congress when they convene in early January to take up the task of repealing and replacing ObamaCare first,” Pence said. <br> He won’t be sworn in for another 50 days, and he is already checking boxes. 
 President Trump is not looking for bipartisanship; he’s looking for insurance. If your agenda hinged on support from the likes of John McCain, you’d want insurance too. <br> Trump’s reported DACA deal with Democrat leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi has unhinged conservatives, who were already alarmed by the president’s agreement with the same duo to raise the debt limit and provide relief to the victims of Hurricane Harvey. Gleeful media types have characterized these overtures as Trump “pivoting” to Democrats; they are playing it for all that it is worth. The New York Times ran a recent front-page story titled “Agenda Increasingly Set by Democrats.” The Washington Post weighed in with: “A new strategy’for Trump? Democrats cautious but encouraged by fresh outreach.” What could be more incendiary to Trump voters? What could be more delicious to the president’s enemies? <br> That was the upshot of recent polling done for Democrat operatives trying to devise a strategy for the 2018 Congressional elections. As reported by Politico, strategists on the left are shocked that people are “still impressed with Trump’s business background and tend to give him credit for the improving economy.” Voters also like the fact that he’s shaking things up, and are “inclined to give him a chance to succeed.” In other words, Trump’s low overall approval ratings do not tell the whole story. And, Democrats’ full-on “resistance” is helping their cause not at all. <br> Trump’s opponents finally see an opening, pouncing on the president’s recent bargain-hunting with Democrats to paint Trump as caving on campaign promises. They figure his base will not tolerate his maneuvering with “Chuck and Nancy,” two figures detested on the right. And, there certainly has been some outrage among conservatives as he negotiates on controversial matters like resolving DACA’s future. But, as confirmed by Politico, people see Mr. Trump as a deal-maker, someone who wants to get things done. They also see members of his own party obstructing his agenda. The GOP’s failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and the perfidy of John McCain, provided a teaching moment for the president and for the country. <br> That Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was blindsided by his long-time colleague McCain reveals not only the depths of the Arizona senator’s disloyalty but also his personal animus towards Donald Trump. He’s not alone. Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse are only some of the Republicans in the Senate who have opposed Trump on one issue or another. Can Trump rely solely on McCain and his colleagues going forward? Would you? <br> On DACA, the president is similarly taking a realistic approach. Fully 73 percent of the nation, and 68 percent of Trump voters, favor allowing the so-called “Dreamers” to stay in the country. Republicans in Congress would likely work towards codifying the DACA program, in exchange for beefed-up border security. But, there is a worse scenario in which the dysfunctional fissures in the House blocks any attempt at resolving the issue, and the GOP again is embarrassed. If the president can exact from Democrats significant measures to strengthen our borders, is that not a reasonable outcome? 
 President Trump’s style has dismayed many on the right as well as the left. But when it comes to actions, conservatives find much to delight them. <br> While the 2016 presidential elections were underway, policy analysts at The Heritage Foundation (my employer and one of the nation’s leading think tanks) compiled a six-volume series of conservative, research-based policy recommendations for the next president. <br> At the end of 2017, we reviewed all 334 recommendations presented in our “Mandate for Leadership” series and found that the Trump administration had embraced fully 64 percent of them. That’s nearly two out of three – and that’s very good indeed. <br> Most Americans are already familiar with some of the conservative agenda items adopted in the last year. <br> And many are aware of how Congress acted on another key recommendations to exercise its authority under the long-ignored Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn ill-considered rules implemented by regulatory agencies. During the first few months of its session, Congress used CRA resolutions to eliminate 14 major rules finalized by the Obama administration in its waning days. <br> By year’s end, the Trump administration had withdrawn or delayed 1,500 proposed regulations. It has made a difference. On Dec. 14, the administration reported that the regulatory rollback had saved the American economy $8.1 billion, and would save another $9.8 billion in fiscal 2019. <br> By the end of 2017, the Senate had confirmed 12 circuit court of appeals judges – the largest number ofappellate judges confirmed during the first year of any president in history. Why does that matter? Because most federal cases stop at the appellate level. Only one of every 700 cases heard by these courts goes on to the Supreme Court. <br> From pulling America out of the unaffordable and unworkable Paris Protocol on Climate Change to ending the damaging Obama era regulations on net neutrality, the Trump administration has advanced a broad conservative agenda on dozens more fronts in 2017. 
 On Wednesday you could hear howls of misery and disbelief coming from Democrats and Never Trumpers. What now, you may ask? <br> After all, the power and popularity of the president’s tax cuts has already hit. His rolling back of regulations and the killing of the ObamaCare mandate has already fueled an economic renaissance. What else could have made the morose even less amiable? <br> It was actually the most debilitating news of all: The Trump campaign announced that 2016 campaign digital guru Brad Parscale is the 2020 campaign manager for the president’s re-election bid, confirming the happy likelihood that people will be saying the words “President Trump” until early 2025. <br> But for those who have been living in the 24/7 Never Trump fantasy universe – working on their fake Russian dossiers and “insurance policies” to derail President-elect Trump from becoming President Trump – this fresh proof that he’s not going away dealt a blow like no other. <br> The frantic attempts during the past year by the president’s opposition to nullify the election were meant to achieve his removal from office, one way or another. Nope, didn’t happen. <br> Remember the idiotic obsession with the 25th Amendment to the Constitution? Thinking the Cabinet would declare the president “incapable of performing his duties” and remove him from office? Yeah, good for a laugh, but nope, didn’t happen. <br> And the Michael Wolff book would be the death knell to Trump’s presidency. Well, someone did leave the White House after that dumpster fire, but it wasn’t President Trump. <br> For those who thought they could make Donald Trump and his family miserable or afraid, the president’s commitment to another four years confirms they continue to underestimate the man and still don’t understand what the revolution of 2016 was all about. <br> Instead of the government celebrating a strong economy, the Obama administration touted driving Americans onto food stamps, and boasted about how many people were forced into ObamaCare, making even access to health care a pipe dream. <br> The Washington Examiner reports: “With unprecedented speed, the Trump administration has already implemented nearly two-thirds of the 334 agenda items called for by the Heritage Foundation, a pace faster than former President Reagan who embraced the conservative think tank’s legendary‘Mandate for Leadership’ blueprint.” <br> Paraphrasing Binion, the Examiner article also states that the president “hasn’t just focused on one agenda area, but he and his team has pushed through administrative moves on foreign policy, deregulation, immigration, tax reform and health care, moves often ignored by the media.” <br> Even some Democrats are beginning to understand the extent of the Trump sea change. From the liberal magazine New Republic: “Last year, it seemed certain that he would be a one-term president – if he even lasted that long. But he has a plausible path to victory in 2020.” 
 While the nation's capital is at its most divided, a cadre of Republicans and Democrats -- refugees from earlier administrations -- is quietly reaching over political divides to get the nation's work done. <br> Despite the loud rhetoric from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, there are a core group of us who have served in multiple administrations, who hail from industries outside of Washington, who hold different points of view, who find ways to collaborate. <br> I am by no means unusual among a strata of people who line up on one side of the aisle but find ways to work with the other side. <br> In 2009, 16 CEOs from consumer goods companies joined me as members of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation. Working collaboratively with public health agencies and the Obama administration, the conservatives and liberals among us joined forces to implement the largest voluntary food and beverage industry marketplace initiative, ultimately removing 6.4 trillion calories from the American diet by reducing the sugar and fat content of hundreds of products. In 2005, as U.S. Commissioner General I worked alongside governors – from both parties -- and the private sector. We overcame our ideological differences and many challenges and together launched the US Pavilion at the Aichi World EXPO, formerly known as the World’s Fair. <br> “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it,” Mark Twain wryly noted. His observation is shared by many across the political spectrum with whom I have worked. <br> We politely keep commentary to ourselves unless it’s relevant to the discussion at hand. We focus on fixing the problem--no rat holes are allowed. Tension may reign at the beginning of each relationship as battle lines are quickly drawn and cynicism prevails, but soon data-driven progress brings a continuity of results, a collegial environment and a celebration of success. Over dinner or on the Acela, good humor prevails as we find ourselves sharing stories and learning about each other’s children, grandchildren, lives and challenges. We agree to disagree but commit to the facilitation of success. We become friends. 
 Leave it to the Senate to take a flaming hot Trump economy and throw swamp water on it! The booming stock market speaks for itself. President Trump has our economy rolling and now the Senate comes along with business as usual tactics to mess things up. Free-market lovers will never stand for this! <br> The version of tax reform legislation unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday is another indication that the swamp is alive and well. This is a repeat performance of the failure of Congress to get health care done. <br> Effectively, the Senate tax bill calls for a slightly lower top tax rate for individuals of 38.5 percent, versus the 39.6 percent in the House bill. The Senate measure also would double the estate tax exemption, but not repeal the tax, as House Republicans proposed. <br> The duration of real estate depreciation will be reduced from 39 years to 25 years. This initiative alone will create another real estate asset bubble like the 1980s, where the rush to invest in real estate was not matched with economic demand. This in turn created a supply-side bubble – not enough tenants to fill the buildings and a subsequent mortgage default, followed by the savings and loan crisis. <br> The scoring of the proposed Senate tax bill shows this will cost the federal government $5.8 trillion in reduced revenue over 10 years, adding to the national debt. <br> Once again, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., capitulated to the needs of a few American taxpayers. Once again, the special interests win, not the American voter. <br> The increasing pressure to deliver a bill the President Trump can sign illustrates just how purposeful Congress is at enabling gridlock. Congress fails to understand that the voter is engaged and is already mobilizing and supporting candidates for the 2018 election cycle who support the president’s agenda. 
 American industry has always been a primary source of strength and jobs in our nation. But today, a great industry that has played a vital role in building and defending the United States – the steel industry – is in crisis. <br> Surging steel imports, largely subsidized by foreign governments, have hammered prices, forced some steel mills to close, and cost thousands of steelworkers their jobs. Since 2000, more than 60,000 steelworkers have seen their jobs disappear, including 14,000 in 2015 and 2016 alone. <br> Foreign steel producers continue to find every way possible to circumvent trade laws and dump products in our market. <br> But there is a solution to this crisis. In April, President Trump recognized both the importance of steel to U.S. national security and the crisis facing the industry. He announced that his administration would begin an investigation pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The law authorizes the secretary of Commerce to conduct investigations to determine what effects imports of any product have on U.S. national security. <br> Launching the investigation was an important signal that the Trump administration would not tolerate further erosion of the steel industry. <br> Despite the urgent need for action, reports now are that a decision on trade violations will be delayed until after Congress deals with tax reform. <br> Steel is used to build the ships, armored vehicles and weapons that keep our troops safe. It is used to build the roads, bridges, railways and airports that keep our economy running. And the steel industry provides jobs that support steelworkers and their families. 
 What would you think of an individual or a company that earned a pre-tax profit of $29.9 million in one year, paid nothing in taxes and still received a $3.5 million refund? <br> In other words the Times took advantage of tax laws that only good tax attorneys understand and in doing so was no different than Donald Trump. The Times, which obtained Trump's supposedly confidential tax returns, made a big deal out of the Republican presidential candidate's use of loopholes to avoid paying taxes. <br> The federal government is taking in record amounts of tax revenue, but is approaching a $20 trillion debt. The problem, noted Ronald Reagan, is not that the American people are taxed too little, but that their government spends too much. <br> Leaking sealed or private documents is not a new strategy for Democrats. When Barack Obama was a candidate in the Democratic Senate primary in Illinois, the sealed divorce papers of his opponent, Jack Ryan, were shamelessly used to help defeat the family values Republican. Had that dirty trick not been used, Obama might never have been a senator, much less president. <br> The left's narrative -- stated and implied -- is that everything government does is good, and so it is only right that taxpayers pay increasing amounts of taxes no matter how irresponsible government is in spending them. In this thinking, government has replaced God and taxes have replaced the collection plate, which at least amasses voluntary contributions. <br> Republicans in high tax states and at the federal level should use the left's smoking gun on Trump's taxes as a weapon to demand tax reform. Flat and fair taxes have been suggested. Anything is better than the current system. Real tax reform would ensure that Trump paid some taxes, though they would likely be lower for him than for everyone else who pays them. 
 The modern Democratic Party is hoping you care more about Trump’s tax returns than your own. <br> “Trump’s tax returns.” Maybe if they say it three times while walking backwards around a cemetery drinking goat blood the world will be restored on its axis. <br> One notes that polling has consistently showed that the vast majority of Americans believe no American now matter how rich should pay more than 25 percent of their income in total taxes.The 25 percent tax paid by Trump was his federal tax alone. Doesn’t count property taxes, sales taxes, state and local taxes. <br> This brings us to the real story of 2016: Trump ran promising to reduce the tax burden on Americans and American businesses that create jobs. <br> Next, Trump will move to comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform. Individualrates will move from seven different rates to three rates: 33%, 25% and 12%.The Death Tax will be repealed.Business taxes will fall from 35 percent to 20 percent or lower -- closer to the worldwide average -- making America more competitive. And job-creating investment will be immediately expensed -- which reduces the cost of new investment and will turbo charge growth. <br> Repeating “Trump’s tax returns” did not turn back the clock or stop the movement towards tax reform and abolishing ObamaCare’s tax hikes on the American people. 
 It is hard to overestimate the damage the Freedom Caucus has done to the fledgling presidency of Donald Trump, and to the country. By blocking the American Health Care Act of 2017, the conservative group has guaranteed that Americans will struggle forward under the burden of Obamacare. In the next few months insurers will announce their premium hikes for the coming year; chances are, given the continuing withdrawal of major companies from the marketplaces and the ongoing failure of the bill to attract enough young and healthy participants, the new rates will not be pretty. Last year premiums went up 25%; it’s likely the increases will be higher this year. <br> Now the Republican Party inherits the Sisyphean task of managing Obamacare’s inevitable decline. They are no longer critics; they are now the producers of the show. It is unlikely that House Speaker Paul Ryan or Trump will have the political will and patience to return to the drawing board and attempt to craft a brand new bill. They have made other commitments to voters, and so Obamacare, as a defeated Paul Ryan admitted after withdrawing the AHCA, is the law of the land. Live with it. <br> It is the young Trump presidency, however, that takes the biggest hit here. Trump was elected because people across the political spectrum thought he could fix some of our problems. He was the businessman who could import common sense to Washington, and the deal maker who could bring people together. He made big promises; a country tired of stalemate and disappointment believed that he could bring back jobs, reduce our debt, build the wall, find a better healthcare solution. <br> Who is to blame? House Speaker Paul Ryan will be dragged through the mud for failing to win enough votes. He will also be criticized for concocting an arguably complicated and overly cerebral approach to the mission at hand. The AHCA was only part of the solution; Ryan vowed to press forward with more changes – like allowing insurers to compete across state lines, expanded health savings accounts and Medicaid reforms – in future legislation. It was a complex three-step approach; framing a sales pitch was all but impossible. <br> Nancy Pelosi mocked Trump for bringing the bill to the floor before he had the votes; that won’t sit well with a president who likes winning. So far, he is blaming Democrats, but he will doubtless find others – including perhaps the Speaker – to chastise for the loss. That will be unfortunate. As an outsider, President Trump has to rely on some seasoned hands to move bills through Congress; notwithstanding this recent defeat, Vice President Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan are an excellent and necessary team. Relying on executive orders, as Obama did, produces unsustainable measures easily overturned by the courts. <br> Caucus leader Mark Meadows, who hails from western North Carolina, may find himself under scrutiny. People may wonder why the American Society of Anesthesiologists was one of the top five funders of Meadows’ campaignand why health professionals were among the top five industries donating to his reelection in 2016. Medical groups typically like Obamacare, which provides healthcare services to an expanded population. Did they count on Meadows undermining Obamacare repeal? Did they know that thanks to his efforts, Obamacare would carry on? <br> And Meadows may not be alone. The National Republican Congressional Committee has been hauling in record amountsof money these past few months – money that can go to fielding candidates that support the White House. The Chair of the NRCC is Ohio’s Steve Stivers, who was a yes vote for the AHCA. His predecessor at the NRCC was Oregon Representative Greg Walden, who campaignedall-out for the AHCA. It’ unlikely either Stivers or Walden will champion the reelection of Meadows or his colleagues. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 Last week President Trump’s tax cuts started to get personal as people across the country logged into their bank accounts and began to find increases in their paychecks. The doom and gloom tax cut scenario the Democrats tried to sell the American people started to become exposed as nothing more than highly charged rhetoric. This from a party desperate to justify why not a single one of them voted in favor of letting people keep more of their money. <br> As people’s wallets began expanding this week it just got real. More money back in the hands of people of every income level - brought to you by President Trump and the Republicans in Congress. <br> In an interview with the Washington Post, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was asked what keeps her up at night. Her answer: the tax cuts. Specifically, she calls them a “dark cloud.” <br> Mrs. Pelosi is worth $29.35 million and ranked the 15th richest member of Congress out of 541 rankings, but what keeps her tossing and turning on her high thread-count sheets all night is letting the American people keep more of their hard-earned money. Let that sink in. <br> It’s worth pausing for a moment to remember how far we’ve come since President Obama’s promises of hope and change, which proved to be nothing more than a clever campaign slogan. He left office with our country needing the hope and change he promised more than ever. <br> For four straight years — 2012-2015 — the number of people on food stamps didn't drop below 45 million; one out of every seven people in the United States. In President Trump’s first year in office, before the tax cuts even took effect, that number was down to 42.2 million. <br> Unemployment for women is at an 18 year low, and the overall unemployment rate is the lowest its been since 2000. <br> It’s becoming clear that Democrats have a messaging problem, as they continue to tell people that getting back more of their money is bad, even as people across the country are starting to see more of their money in the paychecks. But damn the cognitive dissonance, full speed ahead. <br> Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., is also on message, having dismissed $1,000 in bonuses as not going “very far” for most people. 
 While we glorify football players for their accomplishments on the field, they are not heroes. I recently visited with a real hero – a young Army sergeantfrom my congressional district who still gets body tremors when he stands. Bombs bursting in the air exploded over his unit in Afghanistan, leaving shards of metal stuck in his skull. <br> When I entered his room at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he proudly stood at full attention, brimming with nervous energy. I had come to thank him on behalf of a grateful nation, and the sergeant was as respectful as he was inspiring in his patriotism. Although he winced with pain, he would not take the meeting lying down. <br> The teacher and the sergeant are the regular folks who make up my North Florida district, which boasts of more military bases than Starbucks, and more veterans than pelicans. These are the folks who do not understand why NFL players would disrespect our anthem or our flag or why the NFL Commissioner's office has embraced this unpatriotic conduct. <br> Our nation is increasingly diverse in thought, values, and background. Yet throughout our history, America has given proof through many nights that our flag is still here, and that freedom still reigns. <br> It is bizarre to see the NFL attacking an America that has treated it so well over the years. Taxpayers pay over 70 percent of the cost of stadiums. Our citizens pay more and more for tickets, and valuations of professional sports franchises have skyrocketed. Player compensation keeps growing. But the NFL Commissioner’s office can choose at any point to stop paying taxes altogether.Only in America, baby! <br> As for the NFL Commissioner’s office, why do they get special treatment in the tax code in the first place? Why do any professional sports leagues enjoy tax advantages unavailable to regular folks or small businesses? Special loopholes in the tax code for pro-sports leagues will shortchange the U.S. Treasury by over $150 million during the current budget window. <br> President Trump has called for massive tax reform to get our economy moving again. We must cut taxes for hard-working Americans, while ending the swampy loopholes crafted by special interest groups. Ending the exemption for pro-sports leagues is an obvious place to start — and President Trump agrees with that, too. 
 President Trump discussed many important issues in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but left out one of the most important – the need for major reforms in two giant entitlement programs for senior citizens, Social Security and Medicare, that account for most mandatory federal spending. <br> With control of both houses of Congress and the White House, Republicans have the opportunity now to make the reforms needed to prevent these two critically important programs from running out of money in the decades ahead. <br> Republicans in Congress have shown that when they stand together they can do big and necessary things – witness their passage of tax cuts at the end of last year. Now with a new year and an administration that has found its footing, it’s time for a moonshot to save America’s entitlement programs before they go broke and bankrupt us all. <br> I understand as well as anyone that many politicians believe that the mere mention of reforms to Social Security and Medicare will raise the ire of senior citizens. <br> Seniors are tired of being manipulated on these issues by organizations claiming to speak for them. Mature Americans are smart enough to understand that the dire risk to our entitlement programs will not only hurt them, but their children and grandchildren who depend on their sustainability. <br> After years of deficit spending – especially considering the excesses of the Obama administration – these programs still remain the top contributors to our rising national debt and deficit, with $2.9 trillion of the debt held by the two Social Security Trust Funds. Washington’s worst-kept secret is that Social Security will soon be insolvent. <br> There are four straightforward action items that Congress should take this year to set Social Security on a path of sustainable future solvency: <br> 2) Gradually lower Social Security benefits for high-income earners, while keeping low- income earner benefits the same. <br> 4) Provide all earners the ability to save more with Early Retirement Accounts (ERAs), which provide tax-deductible savings and allow future retirees to begin accessing funds in their ERAs at age 62. <br> House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has made it clear he intends to tackle entitlement reform this year, and he has already entered into discussions on the issue with President Trump. This is a brave and responsible position, but he will need all the help he can get to persuade more timid politicians in the United States Senate to follow his lead. <br> The chamber that calls itself “the world’s greatest deliberative body” can actually live up to its name by buckling down and working together with the president and committed colleagues in the House to fix these entitlement programs for future generations. But they will need courageous and visionary leaders like President Trump and Paul Ryan to show them the way. <br> Along with cutting taxes, one of President Reagan’s major successes on the domestic front was his landmark Social Security reform, which he signed into law in 1983 after working closely with Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill of Massachusetts. 
 Opinion poll after opinion poll shows that a Democratic wave is building. If the November midterm elections were held today, Republican control of the House and the Senate would be in jeopardy. <br> Make no mistake about it, conservatives should not underestimate what a complete and total disaster it would be to lose one or both houses of Congress. Not only would President Trump’s conservative agenda come to a screeching halt; we could look forward to two years of non-stop partisan witch hunts by Democrats thoroughly committed to destroying President Trump. All is not lost. Ten months is an eternity in politics. The truth is, however, that there is only one person who can turn back this impending blue wave – President Trump himself. We have been in this predicament before. Months before the 2016 election, the polls showed Donald Trump would lose and that the Republican Senate majority might go down in flames with him. President Trump proved the pollsters and the pundits wrong last time and he can do it again. The president didn’t defy the odds and capture the White House (and save the Senate) by following the failed establishment playbook – and he won’t save Republican majorities in Congress by following the establishment playbook this year either. To save Republican majorities in both chambers, President Trump must rally the coalition that swept him into office. To do so he must refocus on the issues that motivated his working-class base – and he can start with his State of the Union address Tuesday night. First, and most importantly, the president must deliver on immigration. If you asked Trump voters to name just one of his campaign promises they would say “build a wall.” <br> The president needs to make it clear that there will be no deal to allow the roughly 700,000 illegal immigrants brought here as children – and are now protected from deportation under DACA – to stay in the U.S if it doesn’t include funding for the wall. Period. Secondly, the president must focus now on infrastructure. President Trump’s tax reform package was a tremendous victory for conservatives and for American workers, and its long-lasting positive impacts on the economy cannot be understated. However, if the president really wants to deliver on his promise to Make America Great Again then he absolutely must prioritize an infrastructure plan to rebuild American roads, bridges, railways and airports. Investing in America’s infrastructure is an investment in the working-class voters who are the backbone of the Trump base. <br> For far too long, the battle over infrastructure has been between Democrats who propose spending mountains of federal dollars and Republicans who simply oppose the effort. There is another way forward, which President Trump should embrace – free-market approaches that will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure without bankrupting us. <br> Take, for instance, airport infrastructure. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/321811-lawmakers-push-to-lift-cap-on-passenger-fees-for-airport-upgrades" target="_blank">has a proposal in the Housethat would remove the federally imposed cap on the passenger facility charge (PFC), thereby allowing airports to raise the revenue necessary to meet<a href="http://www.aci-na.org/content/aci-na-infrastructure-needs-study" target="_blank">more than $100 billion in infrastructure needsand creating tens of thousands of new jobs. <br> Third, President Trump should remind voters that he has broken from the disastrous Bush-Obama foreign policy approach. The president should remind Americans that his foreign policy isn’t about “isolationism” and it doesn’t represent an abdication of America’s responsibility. At the same time, it does end the failed foreign policy adventurism of his predecessors.</i> <br> The very people who opposed President Trump in the general election, who refused to vote for him, and who ridiculed him and his voters are now pushing him to do the bidding of the establishment on issues like dismantling our public lands. 
 With a successful first year under his belt and the wind in his sails, President Trump is set to outline the record-setting accomplishments of his inaugural year and priorities for his second year in office when he delivers his first State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday night. <br> Whether it’s a record stock market, 17-year low in unemployment, 17-year low in illegal border crossings or growing American optimism, the president has many successes to tout. <br> According to senior White House officials familiar with the president’s prepared speech, President Trump will cast an inspiring vision for building “a safe, strong and proud America” for years to come. <br> Advanced excerpts of the president’s speech show that he plans to say: “We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work, we want every child to be safe in their homes at night, and we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.” <br> Senior staff suggest that President Trump’s first State of the Union address will be “hopeful, visionary, patriotic, strong and unifying,” but they also say that America will see a softer side of the president. He intends to speak to the American people directly from the heart. <br> On policy issues, expect to see President Trump take a victory lap on the American Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He plans to tout the windfall in employee bonuses – estimated by USA Today to be worth at least $1.7 billion for more than 1.3 million U.S. workers. The president is also expected to call attention to pledges by businesses to return manufacturing to America and new hiring that has followed his tax reform plan’s passage. <br> Looking forward, President Trump will also push for $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. He intends to spotlight the need for rebuilding our depleted infrastructure to help America compete globally and create jobs, improve productivity, and keep Americans safe on roads and railways. <br> The president will also address illegal immigration and DACA head-on. He will share his intention to help the so-called “Dreamers” – immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children through no fault of their own. But in exchange, he will require reforms to immigration and border security that will protect the jobs, safety and wages of American workers. The president will also continue his push for a wall along the porous southern border of the U.S. <br> Fresh from his trip to Davos in Switzerland, President Trump will also talk about trade, putting the world on notice that from now on, the U.S. will insist upon “fair” and “reciprocal” trade. 
 During last Saturday's “Greg Gutfeld Show” (named after me, oddly), I went over the accomplishments made during Donald Trump’s first year -- and there were prominent ones -- from the defeat of ISIS, to the explosive economy.&nbsp; <br> I've done this summarizing before, and every time I do it, I notice that it doesn't feel as great as it should. It's as if these achievements count less because it's coming at some emotional cost that I've felt over these last 13 months. <br> Yet every day, things seem to turn out fine. Sure, we live the Trump presidency in a day by day fashion, but each day seems to be working out for the American people. Hell, even his adversaries are having to admit the guy’s tax plan has kicked the economy into a higher gear. I'm watching bonuses getting doled out by the millions, and thousands of new jobs created, thanks to his policies. <br> He's like a drunk walking home during an earthquake. Both effects (booze and seismic shakes) cancel each other out, and he makes it home in a straight line, without a scratch. <br> But this emotional fallout still exists. <br> But this is how it feels with Trump, for me -- until I slow down and see what's really going on. <br> And good news. <br> No. But in good times, we'll put up with almost anything. <br> Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years! <br> Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years! <br> Whether you like him or not, you have to credit him for targeting so much good-natured tomfoolery at a group of people who might tear him to shreds if given the chance. <br> And by responding to that tweet with anything but a smile, you're on the other side of fun. You're part of the non-fun. <br> But if you slow down and take a step back you realize that the tweet isn't reflecting unease at all -- but reveals a country operating at full steam -- so productive and peaceful that its boss can tweet out his cheerful thoughts just for kicks and giggles. <br> For the overwhelming message his tweets convey is that, hey pal, things are great, lighten up, we can have fun here. <br> Fact is, you can learn to embrace the appearance of chaos, and the churning emotional unease it causes, by taking these steps: <br> 2. Admit that there is a cost to Trump -- that such a personality/force like him will create disruption, and highly vocal animosity that can be jarring 
 President Trump’s frustration with congressional gridlock led him to make a bold suggestion last week:bring back congressional earmarks. But while the notion that earmarks help grease the lawmaking process is not without merit, Congress should not return to the corrupt free-for-all we banned in 2010. <br> The end of earmarks is when it became difficult to pass a federal budget without threatening to shut down the government. In 2010 Republicans, including me, ended the practice of congressional earmarking – in which individual members would agree to take a tough vote in exchange for getting a big spending project in their home district. By passing out the candy, leadership was able to shore up faltering support and build bipartisan coalitions. <br> Congress has lost that spoonful of sugar that made the tough legislation go down. While a legitimate argument can be made that Congress – and not the executive branch – should direct spending, the earmarking process had become ripe with abuse. <br> Here’s how it worked: When a tough vote was looming, leadership would routinely ask members what they wanted in exchange for their vote. In other words, what pet project would it take to get you to vote yes on a bill you don’t fully support? Need a road? Want to expand the military base in your district? Vote aye and earmarked funding for your pet project is available. <br> Earmarks also included commitments by the federal government to buy unneeded equipment, supplies, weapons, or even ships that were manufactured in a member’s home district. Leadership on both sides of the aisle greased the system with earmarks to get bills passed and to give members an accomplishment to brag about back home. <br> With the candy went the prime tool that leaders in the House and Senate used to get tough legislation to the president’s desk. <br> In 2010 – the last year earmarks were permitted – members of Congress sought earmarks for 39,000 projects totaling $130 billion, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. The two Republican senators representing my home state of Utah did well that year – with Sen. Orrin Hatch seeking 256 earmarks valued at $1.2 billion. Sen. Bob Bennett submitted 321 earmarks worth $1.36 billion. This was multiplied in each state. <br> Congress eventually grew tired of embarrassing itself, a new wave of Republicans were swept into office, and the practice was rightly ended. <br> Behind the scenes members of Congress make a valid argument that Congress has the legitimate constitutional responsibility to direct spending. They’re not wrong. But if they really want to resurrect this practice, they’re going to need to do a much better job policing abuse. 
 As President Trump nears his  first anniversary in office, he  faces an unforgiving political  landscape. Every word he says and every action he takes will either help him keep a Republican Congress or hand control to Democrats. <br> And if Dems get the gavel, impeachment could be the result. <br> Despite his denial<a href="https://nypost.com/2018/01/11/trump-blasted-for-shithole-comment-about-haiti-africa/" target="_blank">that he used the words “s---hole countries,”most of the media instantly branded him a racist. After a few days of saturation coverage, polls will show a disapproving public and the ritual beatdown will be complete. <br> That’s been the pattern for a year, and the president has managed to keep his head above water. But past performance is not a guarantee of future results — especially in an election year when passions against him are already overheating. <br> Consider that a potty-mouth president is hardly a new phenomenon. John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon said far worse things, not to mention the words Bill Clinton must have used during his Oval Office trysts. But Trump is in a unique position. <br> Not because of what he says or does, but because of the reaction to it. With over half the country needing no more reason than his election to demand his removal, and with many Democrats promising impeachment if they gain power, every mistake is potentially fatal. <br> Yet while a biased media hyperventilating is no virtue, Trump’s great flaw is that he keeps giving them ammunition. One minute he’s riding high, the next he’s running for his life. <br> Still basking in the afterglow of getting tax reform passed, Trump confidently convened a bipartisan group of congressional members for a televised meeting Wednesday on the “Dreamers” and related immigration issues. <br> The next day, the president boasted about the compliments — and then acted as if he were beloved from sea to shining sea. At a follow-up meeting, he unleashed the furies with his derogatory remarks. <br> For my money, “s---hole countries” is not by itself a racist remark. It’s certainly crude and shouldn’t be said by a president, but those countries are a total mess. Central America is the murder capital of the world, and Haitians have been fleeing their country for years because they’ve given up hope it can be fixed. <br> You don’t have to be a racist to conclude that isn’t sound immigration policy, and that America should pick the immigrants who can contribute to its prosperity and security. Indeed, there is a growing bipartisan consensus on that point, which is why chain migration and the visa lottery were on the table. 
 President Trump is already set to move decisively on the economy than his predecessor, but he must scale huge hurdles to accomplish 3 to 4 percent economic growth. Why? Because radical policy changes will be required. And that's tough to do even in this era of aggressive executive orders. <br> Still many large businesses, and most small ones, are organized as limited liability corporations and pay taxes through the personal tax code—after corporate tax reform they would be saddled with effective rates above 40 percent while their corporate rivals pay half that rate or less. <br> Whenever and whatever Congress ultimately decides, genuine tax relief will require bigger deficits. Those are an anathema to many Republicans and in any case don’t guarantee growth. <br> Trade deficits with China and on oil directly subtract $500 billion annually from the demand for American made goods and services, kill millions of jobs, stifle RD and tax growth. <br> Trump must gird for a broad crisis with China, deploy the full range of America’s geopolitical and economic assets and compel Beijing to reckon with the fact that their shaky economy cannot withstand an all front confrontation with the United States without risking the Communist Party’s grip on power. <br> On the supply side, it’s a lot more expensive to start a business and make things in America than it was in the 1980s and 90s, because of the growth of the regulatory state. Just compliance with labor market, health care, financial, environmental regulations and the like require hundreds of thousands of employees and cost businesses billions of dollars. <br> A good deal of what Obama imposed was by fiat—executive orders that can now be repealed. However, he also imposed overly aggressive and burdensome regulations established under statutes, and those are more difficult and time consuming to nix. <br> All can be axed or reshaped by congress, but the Trump administration can expect a pitched battle from progressive Senate Democrats dedicated to remaking the American economy in the low-growth, high unemployment model of continental Europe. <br> In the end, Republicans in Congress may have to resort to a grand budget reconciliation bill—or for their senators to reluctantly vote to suspend the 60 vote rule—to push through a panoply of reforms, and Trump will have to marshal public support for radical measures to overcome a barrage of criticism and protests from liberal politicians and the media. <br> America’s first dealmaker is not a man inclined to small deeds, and these will be the measure of his presidency. 
 What just happened? President Trump cut a deal with Democrats to pay for hurricane damage relief and raise the debt ceiling without getting anything in return, except the temporary avoidance of a government shutdown. How to describe this? Was it a sellout, or a pragmatic act? <br> It’s football season again, so let’s call this deal the “option play.” It isn’t used much by today’s professional players, but the play is designed to give a quarterback the option of running the ball, or, if he sees he can’t make it through the defensive line, toss it to a player trailing behind him in an effort to gain yards. <br> President Trump might consider these options in an effort to push through his agenda. <br> The second option might be to embarrass Republicans sufficiently to force them to unify and pass a true Republican agenda. That used to include lower taxes, smaller government and reducing the debt through less spending and economic growth. I’m not betting on this option. <br> There’s also an option the Republican majority hasn’t tried. Rush Limbaugh mentioned it on his radio program: “If just at any time in the past six months, or any time in the next six, if for just three months Ryan and McConnell would work with Trump to advance his agenda, they would own everything for who knows how long. If they would have repealed and replaced ObamaCare, if they would have then moved on to tax cuts and … real tax reform, and if they had built the wall. … If those three things had serious action with an appearance of unity within the Republican Party on those issues, the Democrats wouldn’t stand a prayer for 25 years.” <br> Trump’s deal with Democrats excluded the children of “undocumented” immigrants. Perhaps the president could allow DACA kids to remain in the country in exchange for money to build the wall. But why should Democrats compromise when they get what they want anyway? <br> The deal Trump made with Democrats expires in 90 days. Will Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi use an option they have successfully employed in the past to win more concessions from the president? It’s called the Christmas option and it is designed to smear Republicans as “heartless” politicians who would harm children by not giving in to Democrats’ demands. 
 It’s become nearly impossible to turn on the TV or scroll through your newsfeed without seeing some sort of political fretting or fuming. Never in my memory has the partisan fighting in our nation been so intense. <br> Problems that should concern everyone – hurricane relief, sexual harassment, even library book donations – have been turned into platforms for our partisan grandstanding. I hope that 2018 can be different. Each January, I see remarkable feats of human innovation as tech companies from around the world gather in Las Vegas to showcase the daring and dynamism of the human imagination at the world’s biggest tech show, CES, which begins this week. <br> International leaders put their heads together and brainstorm new strategies for partnership. Businesses actively seek out ways to source top talent and fund exciting concepts. CES is a global show. But its success evokes America’s deeply-rooted, entrepreneurial spirit. Our unique values and culture, our remarkable legal framework, our diverse population – all combine to create an environment where innovation can flourish. 
 With the retirement of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, it is almost certain that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney will be running for and likely win Hatch’s seat in November. <br> Recent polling has shown that Romney has an over a 69 percent approval rating in the state, including over 81 percent among Republicans, and would defeat the presumptive Democrat in the general election by over 50 points. <br> Nonetheless, I think a voice like Romney’s is also very valuable for both the GOP and our country as a whole. Romney’s brand of aspirational and internationalist conservatism is one that is greatly needed now, due to the major policy challenges our nation faces on the economic and foreign policy fronts, as well as pressing political problems for the GOP. <br> Romney’s expertise on international affairs is undoubtedly one reason why President Trump seriously considered making Romney his secretary of state. <br> Romney’s diverse experiences and perspectives in business also are needed at a time when our economy is experiencing extraordinary transformation. Romney has been not only a governor but also a successful businessman, whether at the Olympics or in venture capital. He was exposed to the frontier strategic questions facing many different companies across all sectors. <br> Furthermore, Romney’s successful turnaround of the 2002 Winter Olympics demonstrates an efficiency-oriented financial mind very much needed when voting on our federal government’s budget and structure. We see massive federal waste and a big deficit that continues to increase our national debt. <br> However Romney’s reputation has taken a sour turn these past two years among many Republicans as he emerged as one of the most vocal anti-Trump voices during the 2016 presidential primaries and general election. <br> However since Trump was elected, Romney has changed his tone significantly. While Romney has remained critical of President Trump frequently and very ruthlessly at times, such as after Charlottesville, nonetheless Romney has also praised President Trump on issues that Romney seems to believe are in agreement with the aspirational and internationalist conservatism Romney espouses. <br> The primary reason for my belief that Romney would be even-handed to President Trump, as he has been since the election, is that I believe Romney is truly a man of integrity. <br> Furthermore, we need more people of character in politics after what’s been a very disgraceful year for public virtue, due to the revelations about sexual misconduct in Hollywood, the media, Congress and elsewhere. 
 BUDAPEST </span>Congress has returned to Washington after another unearned vacation and faces at least two immediate challenges, in addition to the familiar ritual of raising the debt ceiling. <br> President Trump has called the indecipherable U.S. tax code “self-destructive.” He has also decided to end the Obama-era program that allows “undocumented” immigrants who came to America as children to gain work permits. Congress would be given six months to replace it. <br> On Jan. 1, 2017, the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban lowered the corporate tax rate from 19 percent to 9 percent, the lowest rate among the 28 member states of the European Union. By comparison, the United States’ top marginal tax rate is 38.92 percent, just behind Puerto Rico and the United Arab Emirates. <br> In the last seven years, Kovacs says, 700,000 new jobs have been created in Hungary, only 150,000 of which are government jobs. The government jobs are mostly for people who had relied in the past on social welfare programs. Even here, he says, they know the meaning of the word “workfare.” The unemployment rate in Hungary is 4.5 percent, according to Kovacs, down from 11.4 percent in 2010 when the current government took power. Economic growth ranges between 3.5 percent and 4 percent, he says. <br> While American debt keeps rising, Hungary’s debt is falling. In 2010 it was 85 percent of GDP. Today it is 74 percent. True, Hungary has a high value added tax of 27 percent, but Kovacs says that is “temporary” (is there any such thing as a temporary tax?) and the government’s goal is to reduce it as revenue continues to increase. <br> The charges for this policy are familiar to Americans: “We are racists, we hate those people who come in,” when in fact, Kovacs says, it is about maintaining Hungary’s culture and way of life. <br> “We do not underestimate that element,” he responds. “Islam is mostly fundamentalist. Europe is mostly secular, but even for those who don’t believe in God, or go to church. The very culture of Europe is Christianity.” 
 It happens like clockwork in Washington.Every year or two when we approach the federal debt limit, countdown clocks start, doomsday scenarios are assumed, and backroom negotiations begin in earnest to prevent our country from defaulting on our obligations. <br> The prevailing theme of debt ceiling negotiations is usually avoiding default. Lost in the conversation is how we got here in the first place, and how we can get out of the cycle of deficit spending. <br> But the original intent of debt ceiling votes was to discourage or prevent our nation from getting into more debt. At this point, the debt limit conversation has created so many headaches that some have advocated a total repeal of it. <br> As the debt ceiling is currently constructed, it is nothing more than an arbitrary political tool that tends to produce more crisis theater than reform. Budget experts on the left and right have increasingly come to the conclusion that the debt limit no longer prevents, curbs, or restrains debt. <br> However, instead of repealing and eliminating the debt limit authority, Congress should reform it to make it a legitimate legislative mechanism to fix our nation’s massive debt problems. <br> For example, the debt limit could increase every two years with a signature from the president if the deficit has been reduced to a preset target. However, if the deficit has not reduced to the preset target in the past two years, Congress would be required to debate the issue and raise the debt limit through regular order. <br> This forward-looking date-certain debt limit reform would provide a transparent avenue to course-correct when the preset targets are missed. It would also provide an incentive for Congress to decrease the deficit and predictability for world markets when our deficits decrease. 
 What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago, the country was ending one of the most fiscally irresponsible presidencies of the modern age. Now we’re wrapping up a year of bold fiscal leadership from President Trump and conservatives in the U.S. House of Representatives. <br> I became chairman of the House Budget Committee one year ago and have been proud to serve in that role along with our new president. He has pushed an agenda of action – responsible budgeting, repealing ObamaCare’s worst mandates, and aggressive tax-cutting to get our economy going. This has been exactly the kind of work I came to Congress to do and we have done it. <br> When I was elected to Congress in 2010, I had three main goals: repeal ObamaCare, reform the tax code and start attacking the growing federal debt and deficits. In just one year, the Budget Committee has taken significant steps to achieve all of these goals. <br> While the House of Representatives passed the AHCA, the Senate let us all down. <br> Since the Senate’s initial failure, we successfully repealed ObamaCare’s individual mandate in our tax reform bill, to reduce this burden on middle-class Americans. This provision is the foundation of ObamaCare’s entire flawed scheme. With its repeal, the rest of the law will now be much simpler to dismantle. The House is ready to do just that, so let’s hope Republicans in the Senate muster the nerve to join us. <br> Some in my own party counseled that we skip the hard work of budgeting and merely pass a meaningless legislative placeholder, but I refused and insisted that our Budget Committee show real leadership. <br> We paved the way for historic tax cuts for the American people. And we led the House to endorse the largest cut to mandatory spending programs, which make up about two-thirds of all federal spending, in the last 20 years. <br> The budget produced by my committee launched us toward tax relief. When we began writing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we focused our attention on the middle class. This focus was particularly important to me – I was once a single mom with three children. I worked the night shift as a nurse so I could be home during the day and take care of my kids, and every dollar was important. <br> Our law cuts taxes for the middle class, giving an average family about $1,400 back. On top of that, we cut taxes for job creators, which will help them hire more workers, raise wages, and invest in research and technology. We’re already seeing results, with companies like ATT, Boeing and Comcast announcing that they will raise wages, give employee bonuses and invest in job creation. 
 <b>Editor’s note:</b>The following column first appeared in The Hill newspaper and on<a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/366398-juan-williams-gop-will-suffer-for-tax-giveaway" target="_blank">thehill.com. <br> Republicans say the big news on Capitol Hill last week was that they passed tax cuts. <br> The bigger news on Capitol Hill was that Americans now trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle taxes and the economy, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. <br> Now, the Journal poll has voters favoring Democrats by 33 percent to 29 percent on taxes, and by 35 percent to 30 percent on the economy. <br> This is a total 180-degree, world is upside down, hell just froze over reversal. <br> How can this be happening when Republicans are lining up to praise the president and the tax cuts? <br> That sycophantic acclaim for a president who just destroyed voters’ trust in the GOP’s ability to deliver good economic results is strong evidence the party has lost its identity as the standard-bearer of fiscal conservatism. <br> With his tax plan now signed into law, the curtains are finally pulled back on the Wizard of Trump Tower. <br> Cutting corporate taxes — from 35 percent to 21 percent — is “probably the biggest factor in our plan,” and not tax reform to benefit the middle class, the president admitted as the bill made its way to his desk. <br> And what about creating new jobs? <br> The man who did the survey of corporate leaders, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, told CNN Money that Trump’s claim that tax cuts will result in more jobs is “a lot of smoke and mirrors.” <br> Not a single Democrat voted for Trump’s tax cuts. <br> “By the end, the<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GOPTaxScam?src=hash" target="_blank">#GOPTaxScamwill… raise taxes on 86 million middle class households, hand 83% of the benefits to the wealthiest 1% of Americans. This will go down as one of the most scandalous, obscene acts of plutocracy ever,” Pelosi tweeted. <br> With so much money concentrated in the hands of so few Americans, it is no wonder that polls show this law is wildly unpopular, with support ranging in major polls only from 26 to 32 percent. <br> And now for the political fall-out: <br> Look for those numbers to sink even lower when Trump voters realize they’ve been had. They were sold a bill of goods by his party when they voted for Trump-style economic populism in 2016. <br> The Trump party argues they have to make the cuts to keep the deficit from ballooning. 
 In November 2016, middle-class Americans sent a clear message to Washington, D.C. <br> They were frustrated with stagnant wages. They were fed up with shrinking opportunity. They were tired of watching America lose ground to our competitors overseas. <br> The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which passed the Senate on Tuesday and which President Trump will soon sign, is the most sweeping overhaul of our nation’s tax code in more than 30 years. It includes a host of hard-fought conservative victories that will help families next year while making America stronger for decades to come. <br> Our primary goal was to cut taxes for American families. Ten years ago, middle-class Americans in Kentucky and across the country were hit hard by the Great Recession. Job opportunities dried up. Take-home pay stopped growing. It became difficult for families just to get by, much less to get ahead and save for their children’s futures. <br> Helping them was our first priority. That’s why the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cuts tax rates across the board, doubles the standard deduction, and significantly expands the Child Tax Credit. Thanks to these and other changes, a typical family of four earning the median family income gets to keep more than $2,000 that they would have otherwise had to send off to the IRS. <br> The bill goes even further to help families by repealing the unfair individual mandate tax at the very heart of ObamaCare. Under ObamaCare, if Americans didn’t buy the kind of health insurance that Washington thought they should buy, they were punished with a tax penalty. But if the plans available under ObamaCare are not affordable or not desirable, the blame lies with the failing law itself. The last people who should be fined or penalized are the working Americans whom ObamaCare is letting down. <br> In addition to cutting workers’ taxes directly, the law puts America on a trajectory towards higher wages and better job opportunities by making our country a better place to do business. It cuts taxes on job creators and Main Street businesses, eliminates incentives for shifting manufacturing abroad, and makes America a more attractive destination for jobs, profits, and investment from around the world. <br> And that’s not the only part of this historic law that will give pause to our international competitors. <br> American families have waited long enough. They cannot afford to be burdened any longer by an outdated, unfair, inefficient tax code that takes too much money out of their paychecks. That’s why it was so important that President Trump and Congress seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity. <br> It’s unfortunate that Republicans had to do this on our own. In the past, including as recently as the Obama administration, prominent Democrats claimed to support many of the pro-growth, pro-worker ideas at the heart of our reforms. 
 Editor's note: The following column first appeared in the Washington Times. <br> You know journalism is in a sorry state when a New York Times columnist makes news simply by admitting the truth that President<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Trump’s leadership crushed ISIS. <br> As a conservative columnist at The Times, Mr. Douthat’s approach was similar to that of many previous<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Trumpskeptics — he peppered his commentary with a variety of reasons he thinks<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Mr. Trumpis still an oafish boor. Sure, he defeated ISIS and the media ignored it, but it’s<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s fault. He’s a scandalous, controversial president, and if he was just more normal, then the media wouldn’t be so distracted. <br> In his column, Mr. Douthat sets a tone at the start so no one should mistake his eventual admission as recognition of<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s masterful foreign policy approach. He starts by blaming the president for media malpractice: <br> “There is nothing more characteristic of the Trump era, with its fire hose of misinformation, scandal and hyperbole, than that America and its allies recently managed to win a war that just two years ago consumed headlines and dominated political debate and helped<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/" target="_blank">Donald Trumphimself get elected president — and somehow nobody seemed to notice.” <br> Provisionally. Sure. <br> “But this is also a press failure, a case where the media is not adequately reporting an important success because it does not fit into the narrative of Trumpian disaster in which our journalistic entities are all invested. I include myself in this indictment.” <br> On one hand he feels compelled to admit media reports only what it sees through its Hillary-colored glasses, and in the same breath begs the question by delivering the tired and usual media indictment of how the president is a bumbling court jester who stole the throne. Moreover, Mr. Trump is a scandal machine, forcing the media to miss all the real, important news. <br> While Mr. Trump was crushing ISIS by allowing our military to do their job, the media’s obsession with fake “Trump narrative” news prevailed. Viewers of legacy news were drowning in false stories such as former FBI Director James B. Comey preparing to tell Congress Mr. Trump was under investigation, and a CNN story that Anthony Scaramucci was under investigation for Russia ties. That little, contrived gem led to the resignation of three journalists. <br> Earlier this month, David Harsanyi at the Federalist provided a reminder of what else the media’s “Trump narrative” created while the president was getting this nation back on her feet: <br> “ABC reported that Trump had directed Michael Flynn to make contact with Russian officials before the election. He didn’t (as far as we know). The New York Times ran a story that showed K.T. McFarland had acknowledged collusion. She didn’t. Then CNN topped off the week by falsely reporting that the Trump campaign had been offered access to hacked Democratic National Committee emails before they were published,” he noted. 
 The left’s hysterical attacks against the GOP tax bill, which was passed by the House Tuesday and was expected to win Senate approval, tells you something big is going on. Democrats have knowingly lied that the reform effort will hurt middle-class Americans, earning an unusual dressing-down from the Washington Post, and have aggressively flayed individual Republicans who support the bill. <br> The New York Times, in one last death rattle fit of umbrage, declared in an editorial that there was “cynicism and mendacity underlying the Republican tax bill.” The newspaper also published another outrage special from columnist Paul Krugman, who suspects that Republicans are supporting the legislation because it is “good for them personally” and ran a lengthy piece on how the bill would significantly burden the Internal Revenue Service. As though we care. <br> Let’s be honest: the GOP tax plan is the Democrats’ worst nightmare. After a year of “resistance” against a duly elected president, stalling on Cabinet confirmations, slow-walking the exodus of Obama appointees, issuing purposefully damaging and often untruthful rumors about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia, attacking each and every initiative of the incoming administration, wailing about Congress moving forward on a partisan basis (as though ObamaCare didn’t follow the same path), threatening impeachment and detailing gleefully every misstep and foolish tweet made by President Trump, Democrats are about to face an emboldened adversary. <br> Throughout this past year, Democrats and elites have mocked President Trump for rookie mistakes, sneered at his exaggerations, and expressed horror when he followed through on campaign pledges, such as bowing out of the Paris Climate Agreement.&nbsp; <br> But the Democrats’ most telling and harmful critique was that President Trump, a political neophyte, was not able to deliver. They claimed his inexperienced team was ill-equipped to carry out his agenda, and they were not entirely wrong; the ill-fated ban on immigrants from Muslim countries comes to mind. More damaging, Democrats also said that because of candidate Trump’s toxic behavior during the primaries, he had so alienated fellow Republicans that he would never get Congress to enact his agenda. <br> They were wrong. The GOP – led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. – moved forward with renewed vigor on tax reform. Unlike the ObamaCare effort, this push included the White House. For many months the Gang of Six worked feverishly towards a tax bill that would make U.S. businesses competitive again, and lower taxes for most Americans. That’s what this final bill does. That’s what Democrats are screaming about. <br> But here’s what should worry Democrats; that poll indicates that the public’s dislike of the bill is because they don’t really think their taxes will go down. What happens when they find out that Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who called the bill a “punch in the gut for the middle class,” or House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, R-Calif., who has called the bill a “scam” and “Armageddon,” are lying to them? <br> The liberal media has also scoffed at the notion that lower taxes could inspire businesses to increase investment and hiring. I heard the CEO of a cement company interviewed the other day on Bloomberg; the reporter was openly hostile to the manager’s claims that yes, he would be expanding as a result of the proposed tax changes. Almost 95 percent of those responding to a recent National Association of Manufacturers poll said they were optimistic about their prospects – an all-time record. More than 60 percent said the tax overhaul would likely lead them to invest more. As businesses gear up hiring and investing in new plant and equipment, won’t people feel even better about their job prospects? 
 It’s beginning to feel a lot like Christmas, everywhere we go, from the sight of inflatable reindeer on the neighbor’s lawn to the thought of Cousin Eddie in a dickey, drinking egg nog and talking politics at Christmas dinner. <br> Every family has a Cousin Eddie and every family’s holiday gathering holds forth the possibility of awkward or tense moments. But out of all the Christmas anxieties—overextended budgets and calendars, overcooked turkey and undercooked ham, inebriated cousins and argumentative uncles—nothing seems worse than having to “mix it up” politically with the odd assortment of people in our extended family. <br> But I’m here to tell you, “It’s OK. Don’t worry your elastic-waisted britches about it.” <br> How? Here are a few tips: <br> Set the tone. <br> Consider telling a personal story. <br> Refuse to be baited. <br> Admit it when you’re wrong or have overstated your case. <br> If needed, steer the conversation in a different direction. <br> Go ahead, mix it up. <br> For many Americans, having family conversations in today’s toxic political environment feels like having a bowling alley inside of our brains, with each family member hurling their own 13-lb. ball of opinions at our neural duckpins. 
 Roy Moore, the Republican defeated Tuesday in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama, turned out to be a deeply flawed candidate and one who traditional Republican voters – including people of faith and suburban men and women – could neither muster enthusiasm for nor support. <br> Moore had a well-established track record for controversy, low approval numbers in polls and was portrayed in the media as a dirty old man at best and a pedophile at worst. So his election loss should not come as a big surprise. <br> Moore drew so much opposition for some of his extreme positions and sexual misconduct allegations, it would be wrong to read his narrow defeat as a repudiation of President Trump or the Trump agenda. <br> And the victory of Democrat Doug Jones does not signal that Democrats have solved their own deep-seated problems and are about to capture control of the House and Senate in the 2018 midterm elections. That’s wishful thinking by Democratic partisans – not a sober assessment. <br> On top of this, the mainstream media worked hard to make the Alabama Senate election a referendum on President Trump, on Steve Bannon and on the future of the GOP in an effort to hurt the president and the Republican Party with Moore’s unpopularity, arising out of his alleged sexual misconduct. <br> If the Republican Party fails to show results when it controls both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, there will be hell to pay at the ballot box in 2018, no doubt about it. <br> Virginia has been trending Democratic for almost two decades, especially in areas where turnout will always be greater than in rural parts of the state. And the Republican candidate for governor did not fully embrace President Trump. <br> When President Trump has been invited in to campaign for a Republican candidate, where his message is welcomed and received, and where the candidate and President Trump are aligned, good things have happened. But bad things happen – as took place in Alabama – when the president and the candidate have been opposed by the Republican establishment. 
 “Sound practical judgment that is independent of specialized knowledge, training, or the like; normal native intelligence.” —<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/common-sense?s=t" target="_blank">Dictionary.com’s definition of common sense. <br> Sometimes what used to be called “common sense” can seem radical in Washington, which is used to practicing senseless policies and funding programs that don’t work. <br> Thanks to Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.), we now have a plan worthy of serious consideration, even implementation. <br> Last week, they introduced legislation that, according to USA Today, that would “overturn the rules for becoming an American citizen and cut in half the number allowed in.” <br> The second key concerns numbers and the goal of eliminating chain migration. Despite counter arguments based on the Emma Lazarus poem about the world sending America its “tired and poor,” poems are not the Constitution, or the law, otherwise Emily Dickinson might have become president. Poems are about sentiment. The right immigration policy is about survival. <br> Key number three is language. It isn’t difficult for immigrants to learn enough English to function in America. I meet them in Washington and everywhere I travel. Here’s the official government position for becoming a citizen: “To become a naturalized U.S. citizen, you must pass the naturalization test. At your naturalization interview, you will be required to answer questions about your application and background. You will also take an English and civics test unless you qualify for an exemption or waiver.” <br> The Cotton-Perdue measure would also eliminate the Green Card Lottery, which, in an effort to add diversity to the country, grants 50,000 green cards each year to countries that don't normally send many immigrants to the U.S. 
 Three cheers for Nigel Farage! <br> Farage, who is a Fox News contributor, told shocked and angry members of parliament from the rest of the continent that he is glad his country has decided to leave the European Union. That’s what happened last week when Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50, formally embracing the results of last year’s shockwave vote for a “Brexit.” <br> The comparison to a criminal organization earned Farage a stiff reproach from the Italian occupying the president’s chair in the chamber, but what does he care? He was speaking for the millions of Britons who have expressed their disdain with being dictated to by an entity that has little regard for the unique history of Great Britain. <br> Farage was an early supporter of pulling out of Europe. For too long, he argued, the country has ceded decisions to the European Union in Brussels. It had lost control of its ability to control its borders. And it was losing its identity as a proudly independent island nation with a rich history of economic freedom and self- government. <br> But Farage deserves to be noticed – even if you don’t agree with Brexit. Because he said what he meant. He wasn’t talking for the TV cameras. He wasn’t pulling his punches. And that is a virtue in short supply in politics these days. 
 Ever get the feeling that President Trump, and by extension his closest staff, can do nothing right in the eyes of the Washington press corps? It sure seems that way when they pick apart even sweet traditions like serving our troops on Thanksgiving or the decorations chosen by the first lady for Christmas. But let’s be honest, aside from the president, his female staff receive the harshest and most dishonorable treatment. <br> Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Press Secretary of the Trump administration, innocently baked a pie for Thanksgiving and posted it to Instagram. It looked delicious. It shouldn’t have been controversial – it’s a pie – but leave it to the media to stoke conspiracy, ridiculously accusing Sanders of posting a stock photo and labeling it #piegate. <br> Liberal Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, who makes a career of pettiness and the denigration of conservative women (to the point of being obsessive and creepy), wrote, “And so, at Monday’s off-camera briefing, she stood on the podium, frequently cocking her left eyebrow and raising the left corner of her lips to convey displeasure at the line of questioning. Then, as frequently, she opened her mouth and, with a heavy Arkansas twang, said a lot of nothing.” Most recently, he railed against the “Trump mouthpiece” for her “infantilizing of the press corps” by asking them to say what they are thankful for before submitting a question. The tone of the article went downhill from there. <br> A piece earlier this year by Pulitzer prize-winning Los Angeles Times’ columnist David Horsey was so nasty they were forced to take down. In it, he called Sanders a litany of things I’d rather not write here. <br> And do I even need to mention the childish, expletive-packed rant by Wonkette Senior Editor Evan Hurst, who apparently has never met an F-bomb he didn’t like? <br> Beyond bad form. <br> The job requires calm under intense pressure. I have yet to see Sanders lose her cool, even when faced with difficult, ridiculous, or from-left-field questions posed by members of the press over and over again. She’s also funny, exclaiming, “Christmas had come early” when alerted to the fact that CNN was boycotting the White House Christmas party. <br> Dana Perino, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, was only one of two female press secretaries in history (Sanders is the third). She wrote an open letter to Sanders at the beginning of her tenure, urging her to be the “most knowledgeable person in the room” and to “take a moment of gratitude” when walking into the West Wing. <br> One would think that the feminist members of the media would be thrilled to see a courageous woman place another crack in the glass ceiling of power and influence but not so much. Sanders has faced a barrage of negativity from the very people who handled the Obama administration with kid gloves. 
 President Trump’s announcement Friday via Twitter that he is replacing White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus with retired Marine Corps General John F. Kelly could bring more drawbacks than benefits. <br> This is the latest shakeup in the Trump administration, as the president struggles to better organize the West Wing and increase his administration’s efficiency and effectiveness. <br> To be sure, the public feuding going on within the White House up to now has been unacceptable. An administration simply cannot operate with a chief of staff who is the subject of continuing abuse from the president. Further, the administration is only hurt when a chief of staff is fighting openly with the communications director. <br> It seems that given the ouster of two seasoned establishment Republicans – Press Secretary Sean Spicer on July 21 and Priebus on Friday – the White House is trading experience for loyalty, bringing on new Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci and Chief of Staff Kelly. <br> Yet the consequences of the latest staff moves, which may lead to further changes in staffing, will bring extensive political obstacles. <br> However, given the president’s slow pace at gaining Senate confirmations for his key appointees, replacing Kelly may take much longer than desirable. <br> With Priebus as chief of staff, President Trump’s top priority has been repealing and replacing ObamaCare. That has failed so far in Congress, where Republicans are divided on the best course of action. <br> President Trump was originally drawn to Kelly for secretary of Homeland Security because of his security expertise, specifically along the southern border. Given Kelly’s new appointment, this may signal that the president will now prioritize border security as well. <br> The degree to which everyone in our country, both Republicans and Democrats, is hurt by this polarization cannot be underestimated. 
 Congressman Paul Ryan recently said that Congress must “make meaningful strides on tax reform by the end of the summer in order to stand a chance of achieving consequential changes to the tax code in the near future.” There’s no more significant legislative leader in Washington when it comes to tax reform than Ryan, the newly-appointed Chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, and he’s clearly serious about tackling the inequities and inefficiencies of our current tax code. <br> He may, however, be overlooking the single most effective way to get the ball rolling on real tax reform. It needs to begin from a blank slate, not from the absurdly complicated current code – a piece of labyrinthine legislation that is 2,652 pages long in the shortest form published by the Government Printing Office, and 73,954 pages long in the version published by the Commerce Clearing House, which is what most tax practitioners use. <br> Any attempt at tax reform that begins from that point will almost never get off the ground, and certainly not by this summer. What Congressman Ryan should champion as the first step in the tax reform process is to sunset the current tax code at a specific date, far enough into the future to avoid roiling the financial markets with uncertainty, yet soon enough to force serious action. <br> As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich once said, “Find 75 or 80% [popularity] issues. Stand next to them and smile. Let your opponent frown!” Seventy-five or 80% issues are rare, but they have the potential to upset the usual political calculus. <br> If it were promoted so that it became a major issue with the public, isn’t it at least plausible that it could win the support of seven Democratic Senators? If it passed the Senate, President Obama would be faced with an interesting veto decision: would he really want to veto the will of the American people – especially when there was no real downside to signing the bill, since the effective sunset date would be well after he left office? <br> It would also tee up tax reform as a major issue for debate during the 2016 presidential, senatorial and congressional campaigns. 
 Vice presidents don’t often get a chance to change history, unless they become close advisors to the man in the Oval Office (Al Gore, Dick Cheney), or succeed him following death or resignation (Andrew Johnson, Gerald Ford), or get elected to the presidency themselves (George H.W. Bush). <br> But Vice President Mike Pence may be in a position to be not only the most important person in the Trump administration but very possibly the most important man in America right now. <br> How President Trump decides to utilize this unique human asset to bridge the transition will determine whether his presidency is a success or failure. <br> The New Politics is driven by visceral distrust and hatred of the Old Politics. It thrust Donald Trump into office against all expectations; it may do the same with Judge Roy Moore. Its home is not Washington but the nation at large, and what drives it is social media and their attendant apps. <br> That power should not be underestimated. Right now we have seen social media’s power to polarize and inflame. But over the long haul its real impact will be empowering individuals to connect and act together to address issues of genuine national concern, not just the ones that appear on the front page of the New York Times. In that sense, Trump’s Tweets are actually the wave of the future as social media becomes a tool for taking away the mainstream media’s ability to define the national agenda, whether it’s kneeling during the national anthem or the deep state’s reluctance to prosecute wrongdoing when it’s a Democrat or one of their own. <br> Freedom will be an app we literally hold in our hand. The New Politics based on the sovereign individual, and crowdsourcing the sovereignty of the people, will spell the end of Old Politics as we know it, and the birth of a new America. <br> No doubt Trump imagined his formal status as president would be enough to overcome their opposition, especially within his party. It hasn’t happened. &nbsp;Instead, Trump needs a spokesman who has the trust of both the Old and the New Politics, and who can negotiate the dark dangerous currents that run between them. &nbsp; 
 One of the fundamental problems in Washington is the attitude that the money that people make belongs to the government. That’s why you hear arguments about how much a tax cut “costs,” or big government advocates disingenuously and breathlessly complaining about the people who pay taxes getting a tax cut. <br> I believe it is the other way around. Our default position should be that the money you earn belongs to you, and government has to justify why it should take it from you. <br> This is absurd, and so is the fact that government will collect over $3 trillion from taxpayers next year but still is not satisfied. <br> One of the main differences between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans, in general, favor less government and more tax cuts. That’s why I’m pleased to see us moving forward on a plan for tax cuts, and why I hope to vote to pass such a cut in the coming weeks. <br> I’m also pleased to note that, in part by my urging, the Senate tax-plan writers have included repeal of the ObamaCare individual mandate in the tax plan. The mandate is clearly a tax, a fact that was established by the Supreme Court when it upheld ObamaCare. So including it in the tax bill only makes sense. In addition, with CBO scoring it as a $350 billion savings, repealing the mandate helped pave the way for increased middle-class tax cuts, like an expanded child tax credit. <br> This bill is not perfect. I would prefer a larger cut. I would prefer that the Senate bill match the House bill and keep some form of state and local deductions so that no one gets caught in the trap of losing too many deductions at once and failing to benefit from the tax cuts. Lastly, I’d like to see more permanence on the individual side. <br> The good news is — we can do this every year. Want a bigger tax cut? Urge your legislators to do one every single year. I’ll sponsor it. Want them to be permanent? Well, one good start is to keep extending them, every single year. 
 Occurring largely behind the scenes, President Trump’s most significant contribution to a more prosperous America is also his least understood: his assault on the administrative state. <br> The administrative state is the manifestation of a form of government that invests power in an unelected bureaucracy that can write the rules, enforce the rules and sit in judgment on the rules – essentially combining the power of three branches of constitutional government into one. <br> De Tocqueville wrote that excessive regulation by government “compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.” <br> A little more than 40 years after the Federal Register’s creation, former U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy, D- Minn., quipped that “the only thing that saves us from the bureaucracy is inefficiency. An efficient bureaucracy is the greatest threat to liberty.” <br> In the last full year of President Obama’s term, the Federal Register contained more than 185,000 pages of regulations. Many of these regulations can, if not followed to the letter, lead to imprisonment and financial ruin. Moreover, bureaucrats lacking accountability to the voting public wrote these rules. <br> We are funding an army of 220,000 highly trained people, many of them lawyers, to develop new and more complicated ways to tell the rest of us how to work and live our lives. Were these regulators an actual army, they’d outnumber the army of France. <br> Employing progressive rates, loopholes, and credits, the tax code rewards some financial behavior while discouraging other behavior. The tax code thus guides economic decisions in the same way the road network channels vehicle traffic. <br> While regulators, their rules, and a complex tax code take their toll on jobs and prosperity, excessive federal spending also plays a part in misallocating scarce resources. <br> Combining the four previously discussed factors can give a sense as to the soft tyranny exerted on society by the federal government. 
 Editor's note:The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and<a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/330105-juan-williams-trumps-100-days-wound-gop" target="_blank">TheHill.com.</i> <br> This Saturday marks President Trump’s 100th day in office. <br> The GOP establishment still holds that view after 100 days of President Trump. <br> Trump’s most striking achievement in his first three months is being the least popular new president in modern history. <br> Even Trump’s supporters have to admit these first three months have been defined by the administration’s failure to deliver on campaign promises. <br> No repeal of ObamaCare. No tax reform. No Muslim travel ban — in the sense that the attempt to enact one is bogged down in the courts — and no evidence to support the incredible claim that President Obama had Trump wiretapped. <br> And in the last few weeks, the reversals on campaign promises have come thick and fast. <br> Senate Majority Leader<a href="http://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell(R-Ky.) put all the flip-flops in delicate terms so as not to offend the Trump faithful: <br> Trump’s singular success was getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court. <br> Now, let’s look ahead to Trump’s next 100 days. <br> He has proven to be a weight on Republican congressional candidates in two special elections in Kansas and Georgia. <br> That ballot question was simply, “If the election were held today, would you vote for the Republican or the Democratic candidate?” Enten’s average of the polls has the Republicans down by six points. <br> That gives Republicans every reason to start distancing themselves from the Trump White House. Democrats are already standing far away. <br> After a two-week Easter recess, Congress returns to work tomorrow with just four days left until funding for current government operations is set to expire on April 29. <br> “We’ll be talking to Senate Democrats,” McConnell said before Easter. “They will be relevant to the process. It will require 60 votes. I’m confident that Senate Democrats are not going to want to shut down the government.” <br> But Democrats know that Trump’s plans for future budgets anger their base. So why would they help him? <br> Trump recently said he remains focused on health reform and is threatening to withhold subsidies to insurance companies to force Democrats to help him pass a bill to replace ObamaCare. <br> If you are a Democrat who enjoyed the disastrous GOP civil war over their health care bill, then you are going to love the upcoming GOP slugfest over spending and taxes. If past is prologue then Trump will be frustrated, and fail to get his tax and spending plans passed by the splintered GOP Congress. 
 Thanks to the beneficence of the federal government (and the calendar), we Americans have until midnight on April 18 to file our income taxes. It’s too bad filing taxes wasn’t an easier process. <br> Does anyone believe this tax code language is something we should maintain? “Enter 6 percent of the smaller of line 40 or the value of your Archer MSAs on December 31, 2015, including 2015 contributions made in 2016. Include this amount on Form 1040, line 58A or Form 1040NR, line 56B.” This little gem is in T.R. Reid’s book “A Fine Mess,” a work about our tax system that should raise the ire of any taxpayer not already irate. <br> The federal government collected record amounts of individual income taxes and payroll taxes through the first six months of fiscal 2017, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement published by CNS News. <br> “The federal government also collected $547,491,000,000 in Social Security and other payroll taxes during the first six months of fiscal 2017. That is about $2,731,820,000 more than the $544,491,000,000 in Social Security and other payroll taxes (in constant 2017 dollars) that the government collected in the first six months of fiscal 2016.” <br> As Ronald Reagan said, the reason we have a deficit (and a debt approaching $20 trillion) “is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is that government spends too much.” <br> “And I said, Michael, how do you do your taxes? They’re due tomorrow. He says, well, I pop a beer. I go online and see if the government’s got the numbers right. And if they do, I hit a button. Takes five minutes. He says, but you know, sometimes I start checking the numbers. (If) you start checking the numbers, it could take almost half an hour just to pay your taxes. He was outraged.” <br> Instead, taxpayers struggle to decipher the undecipherable while politicians and lobbyists, who donate to their campaigns, continue to block comprehensive tax reform. 
 A couple of months before the 2016 election, and in the crucible of then-candidate Donald Trump’s contretemps with a Muslim Gold Star family, I wrote a piece headlined “Five Reasons a Sane Person Might Still Vote for Trump.” <br> Here we are, a year into the Trump presidency, and those five reasons still explain why I would again vote for President Trump. He is on the right side of these critical issues and is actually moving forward on promises he made on the campaign trail. That is rare. <br> Federal agencies have withdrawn or delayed 1,579 planned regulatory actions. Rules already rescinded – impacting restaurants, communications companies, power plants, finance, health care, oil drilling and many other sectors – are estimated by the White House to be saving nearly $600 million annually. That number is sure to grow. <br> The Trump agenda has boosted business optimism, which has led to an upturn in capital investment. Spending by companies, which had been flat during most of the Obama era, grew 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of last year. As even the unfriendly New York Times has reported, increased capital spending is linked to rising productivity, which is essential to higher wages. <br> Two: ObamaCare. Democrats have fallen in love with ObamaCare now that the GOP has to manage it. In reality, while the health-care law has made insurance accessible to millions who could not afford it otherwise, middle-class Americans are increasingly finding that health care coverage is unaffordable. <br> Notably, ObamaCare did not rein in the steady increase in health-care costs. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that last year the average worker paid $5,714 for afamily health-insurance plan – 30 percent of the total $18,764 cost. Five years earlier a family shelled out $4,316, or 27 percent of the total $15,745 cost on average. Bottom line: health-care costs have continued to rise faster than incomes. <br> Democrats know the current system is unsustainable; their answer is to double down and give the government an even greater role. That is exactly the wrong approach. I count on the Trump White House and Republicans in Congress to pursue free-market solutions that could meaningfully alter the trajectory of spending. <br> High school is supposed to prepare kids for college. In 2016, ACT results indicate that just 38 percent of students who took the test were “college ready” in at least three out of the four subjects included: math, science, reading and English. That’s an appalling statistic, and only covers the 64 percent of the country’s young people – presumably the most able – who took the test. That’s not good enough. <br> Four: The Supreme Court. </b>The death of Justice Antonin Scalia imperiled the moderate balance of the Supreme Court. For conservatives alarmed by President Obama’s overreach and the leftward drift of judges placed in lower courts over the past eight years, the appointment of a conservative on the court was essential. Neil Gorsuch was a brilliant choice. It is highly likely that another opening will occur in the next few years. We look to the Trump White House to again choose a capable and responsible candidate. <br> State and local governments fared better in the Gallup Poll. Indeed, in 2016, 62 percent of Americans said they trust state government to handle problems and 71 percent said they trust local government to handle problems. <br> These are all critical issues. President Trump is on the right side of every one. Would I vote for him again? In a heartbeat. 
 About 25 Democratic lawmakers have signed on to a bill that would create an Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity. <br> Their goal: declare the President of the United States mentally incompetent under Section IV of the 25th Amendment and remove him from office. <br> Particularly disturbing is the fact that lawmakers would turn to this as Americans are coming together to celebrate the birth of our nation, this Independence Day. <br> John D. Feerick is a former Dean of Law at Fordham University who was a chief architect of the Section of Article 25 that the lawmakers are attempting to use. He cites the original congressional debate on the section that he spearheaded, and he says that policy and political differences are not grounds for enacting Section IV of Article 25 to declare the president mentally incompetent. <br> These lawmakers are 100 percent Democrat, and this is a partisan effort designed to undermine the work of this president. <br> It is unethical to attempt to make diagnoses on living public figures one has not clinically evaluated. This is commonly accepted across the medical and mental health professions. <br> This is low-brow, even for Democrats who worked with Russian nationals to create a now discredited dossier on the president. This is low for a party who has lost more than 1,000 state and local elections in the past eight years, and is 0-5 in special elections since this Republican president was inaugurated. 
 In the world of conservative thought, few issues are as popular as tax reform. It's an accepted truth, by nearly anyone on the right, that the tax code is too complicated for an average citizen to understand and too laden with loopholes to be fair. <br> Beyond the structure of the code itself it's a fairly standard conservative view that taxes themselves are unjust, that government should not be confiscating a large chunk of our hard-earned pay and they certainly shouldn't then be helping themselves to additional taxes after that first take. <br> The marriage tax benefit, for example, is there to encourage people to get married. The electric vehicle credit exists to encourage people to reduce their oil consumption. The American Opportunity Tax Credit encourages people to go to post-secondary school such as colleges or trade schools. And so on. <br> The plan does absolutely nothing to simplify the process. No matter how many times Republican leadership promises that we’ll be able to do our taxes on a postcard, that’s not what the reality will be for nearly anyone. Credits and deductions will still exist though some have been targeted by this plan seemingly at random. <br> One such nonsensical target is the adoption tax credit. Where is the ideological sense in getting rid of a credit to ease the financial burden of adoption? Conservatives always suggest adoption as an alternative to abortion. But adoption is incredibly costly and the credit has been a boon to families looking to adopt, so why cut it? <br> Why get rid of the write-off for medical expenses? It’s practically an admission that single-payer is coming and Republicans don't plan to stop it. Why else not work to defray the costs of people paying for medical care out of pocket? How is that conservative? <br> The mortgage interest rate deduction will drop from $1,000,000 to $500,000--an amount seemingly aimed specifically at people in blue states and the upper middle class. <br> This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills. The free-market organization Club for Growth put out a statement noting that the bill “effectively punishes success and caves to the Democrats’ class warfare rhetoric.” 
 “Puerto Rico, my heart’s devotion. Let it sink back in the ocean.” — West Side Story <br> The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is drowning. The island, so popular with tourists, is $123 billion in debt. That’s more debt than the $18 billion bankruptcy filed by the city of Detroit in 2013. In May, San Juan declared a form of bankruptcy after creditors filed lawsuits demanding their money. A federal district judge appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts will handle the case. <br> Fortuno was elected in 2009. In a telephone interview from his Washington law office, he tells me that during his one term he cut government expenses by $2 billion and the island’s bond rating went up. “We refinanced the debt on better terms” and by the time he left office in 2013, “we had brought down the budget every year and lowered corporate taxes. People believed they could take risks again.” <br> In the 2012 election, Fortuno lost to Democrat Alejandro Garcia Padilla by a narrow (0.6 percent) margin. Fortuno blames the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) for contributing to his opponent’s campaign. “They invested heavily against me,” he says. Padilla renewed the spending policies of the past and, though he left office earlier this year, the damage was done. <br> As the Journal noted, under Fortuno “Puerto Rico implemented tax reform and permit reform, legislated a world-leading public-private partnership (P3) act, reduced government expenses and paid its suppliers…” <br> A referendum on the status of Puerto Rico was held in Puerto Rico on June 11. Three options were open to voters: remain with the commonwealth, independence or statehood. Statehood won. <br> Fortuno doesn’t believe it is a given that Democrats would win those seats. He draws a distinction between the mostly liberal Puerto Ricans who have left the island for places like New York City and those who remain. He says current residents “are social and economic conservatives,” suggesting Republicans could pick up seats. 
 What a mess. Any way you look at it, the Russia probe is a mess and distraction. The president needs to calm the waters, ignore his detractors, and legislate. He has eighteen months, at the outside forty-two, to work with a bicameral Republican Congress. Every day counts. <br> Yet the drumbeat continues. Thursday it was a Washington Post report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could try to thread the needle and take a look at “obstruction of justice” charges, but based on what? Not much there. Ninety-nine of a hundred legal scholars would say that, speaking legally, there is an inadequate basis for a finding of corrupt intent, let alone direction, in context of former FBI Director James Comey's prior public actions and President Trump's separate authority and basis for the firing. <br> Mueller likely knows all this, and sees it clearly. So why interview on the topic? Hopefully, dotting I’s and crossing T’s.&nbsp; Why are those inside now leaking his methods to the Washington Post, perhaps disgorging “law enforcement sensitive” information? To score political points, probably. Who is investigating them? Not clear. <br> In any event, an obstruction claim would just go to Congress for inaction. The best possible outcome for Democrats and anti-Trump bureaucrats might be a constant flow of leaks, rumors and innuendo, trying to render the sitting American president distracted, and possibly ineffectual. <br> Un-talked about is this fact: Mounting political backlash against Democrats, for pressing unsubstantiated claims, is certain to materialize. Like mounting backlash against those pushing violence on college campuses and against Republicans, this mess may get bigger. What a miscalculation, if the Democrats think that is their ticket to 2018, or 2020. <br> In the process, Americans would get real movement on health care, real tax reform, strong national security and law enforcement, needed infrastructure, and predictability. That would be more than enough. 
 Let the Congressional Budget Office howl. It’s time for Republicans in Congress to understand what Reagan understood, what JFK understood, and what our friend and mentor Jack Kemp definitely understood: Big tax cuts produce big returns, and the more widespread the cuts, the larger the number of Americans who benefit from them. <br> If Republicans take off the self-imposed straitjacket of Congressional Budget Office revenue estimates based on unrealistically low growth rates and embrace bold, across the board tax cuts, they will trigger the economic growth that past cuts have produced. Tax cuts are simple - if you want growth, jobs, and a balanced budget, go big. <br> Tax cuts have worked everywhere, around the world. Look at what happened to Singapore after they reduced taxes to incentivize growth. Its economy reached staggering heights and is still going strong. <br> There will be no vigorous growth without huge tax cuts, both for investment and consumption. Congress needs to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent - not 20 percent - and remove taxes on overseas profits. Depending on whose numbers you believe, there is anywhere from $2 trillion to $3 trillion in U.S. corporate profits locked away offshore, held hostage by shortsighted tax policies that discourage companies from reinvesting their gains in domestic ventures. That has to end. Congress should also cut or slash the tax rate “for so called pass throughs” – partnerships, S -corps and the like – to 20 percent rather than the proposed 25 percent. This covers most small businesses which are big job creators and sources for innovations. <br> Why is there no discussion of reducing the capital gains levy? After all every time that rate has been reduced, revenues go up immediately. This is a great twofer: more investment and more revenue. <br> Stop taking things away from people; give them something. This way everyone sees their paychecks go up even if they don’t pay federal income tax. <br> These dramatic reductions would boost economic growth to 4 percent or higher. Contrary to the CBO and to root canal, eye shade Republicans, federal revenue growth would easily eliminate the federal deficit within 10 years. 
 President Obama and Democrats in Congress appear willing to use every legal (and maybe some illegal) tools available to undermine the Trump White House. Illegal leaks, misleading news stories, demonstrations, bureaucratic meddling, and Congressional obstruction have morphed into the Left’s partisan playbook, intentionally slow walking those trying to move forward on the Trump agenda. <br> Here’s why. The best response to the coordinated attacks on the Trump presidency is to repeal and replace ObamaCare, enact tax reform, confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and roll back Obama’s damaging environmental legacy. <br> There are 115 week days from now until Congress decamps on July 31. For fully 22 of those days, Congress is scheduled to be in recess. With Democrats assembling a full-out campaign of obstruction and delay, that is way too many days off. <br> A recent piece from BuzzFeed chronicles the build-up of a so-called Democratic “war room” aimed at slow-walking everything GOP. <br> That’s not all. The group is also working to fuel the ongoing brouhaha over connections between Trump supporters and Russia, gin up protests that greet Congressional Republicans on their visits home, offer Democrats strategies for undermining GOP policy initiatives and generally “expand indefinitely” their efforts to oppose Trump. The group is rapidly adding staff, which has swelled to 340 operatives. <br> Democrats think this is a winning strategy, but polling shows that’s not true. Almost two-thirds of likely voters in a recent survey said they thought it would be good for the country if Democrats worked with Trump. The same number thought the obstruction wasn’t even good for Democrats. Americans know we have serious challenges that have not been addressed over the past eight years. Everyone talks about infrastructure; it’s high time we did something about it. All parties know we need to revamp our dysfunctional tax system and over-regulated state. Trump wants to address those issues, if only Democrats will play ball. <br> Worse, there are some 552 executive positions to be filled. Only 18 have so far been confirmed, while an additional 17 have been nominated. The New York Times chides the Trump White House for failing to fill the queue, but it’s pretty tough to roll out a well-coordinated hiring process when your top folks aren’t yet in place. Also, given the scrutiny that activists will give every nominee, the process is more gummed up than usual, with even those ready to fill less important positions requiring what President Trump might call “extreme vetting.” <br> Republicans cannot afford to lose the confidence of their backers. Cancelling vacations would help. It would also deny liberal activists the opportunity to stage demonstrations as the members of Congress return home to host town hall gatherings. These rallies make for great TV and help Democrats portray the nation as not happy with Trump’s policies. Polling suggests otherwise, and indicates the GOP needs to push ahead. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 If a metaphor could be used for this White House, it might be a two-sided coin with President Trump the head and Vice President Mike Pence the tail. <br> The president tends toward the bombastic to get people’s attention and make his points, while his vice president is calm and measured in his response to questions, sometimes resembling a contemplative monk. In many ways they complement each other. <br> Why the optimism? Because, he says, “there is broad-based and more than a little bipartisan support for tax relief to get this economy growing again.” Pence thinks the “failure to repeal ObamaCare in 2017 has created (an) even greater sense of urgency. There’s a great sense of anticipation among the American public. I think members of Congress are very aware of that.” <br> What about ObamaCare and the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace it, leading to a number of executive orders (issued Thursday) to address what the president feels is the harm caused by that law? <br> What about Iran and the decertification of the nuclear deal made during the Obama administration? Pence said the president considers the deal a “disaster agreement for the United States.” From the White House on Friday, the president announced he was decertifying the deal, imposing new sanctions and asking our allies and Congress to address the deal’s “serious flaws.” <br> I ask if a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and getting Kim to stop production of nuclear weapons can be achieved without war and get the standard answer the president has given: “We remain hopeful we’ll be able to achieve it by economic and diplomatic means, but all options are on the table.” <br> Would he care to comment on the Harvey Weinstein story everyone is talking about? 
 There’s lying like a rug and lying like the media. In the former, the person just collapses motionless. In the latter, the person actively seeks to distort the truth and convince people that a tax cut is actually a hike. <br> That’s the script of almost every major media disaster in 2017. Journalists misrepresent the details and try to convince their audience with a mix of invective and shouting. It’s precisely what happened with the GOP’s tax cut vote. <br> NBC “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie seemed shocked that Republicans thought the tax cut would help employees. She even asked House Speaker Paul Ryan: “Are you living in a fantasy world?” <br> The attacks were almost nonstop, with news reports and pundit talking points indistinguishable. ABC hyped: “The biggest tax cuts will go to the wealthy, corporate America.” MSNBC host Rachel Maddow mirrored that spin, whining about how corporations were getting an “embarrassing amount of money.” <br> In the end, only 17 percent of those surveyed thought they would get a tax cut, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey. But the reality is that 80 percent of taxpayers are scheduled for a cut. <br> Scott’s response was a slam dunk and called out the obvious racism of his accuser. “Uh probably because I helped write the bill for the past year, have multiple provisions included, got multiple Senators on board over the last week and have worked on tax reform my entire time in Congress. But if you'd rather just see my skin color, pls feel free.” <br> Utilizing her characteristic class, O’Donnell responded with an obscene expression directed at Shapiro. <br> The broadcast networks censored the news story for three straight days. After all, who wants to know when a president ignores the efforts of terrorists to fund their operations by selling drugs in America? Author Josh Meyer appeared on Fox News Channel to defend his story, making the point it wasn’t a grand conspiracy. “Their policy of rapprochement with Iran and their effort to get the nuclear deal created a political climate where that result was a derailment of this policy.” <br> The Times decided “he does not need to be fired,” but it is removing him from the White House beat where his left-wing reporting made him a flashpoint. Vox had written a damning piece about Thrush that set in motion the suspension. “If Thrush is acutely aware of what young women face in the business of political journalism, he should also know it’s because he himself is one of the problems women face,” wrote Laura McGann, adding details of her own issues with him. <br> This story has been floating through social media for weeks. Yet Rolling Stone has seemingly ignored it. <br> It was a bad week for the “sports” network. Liberal CEO John Skipper, who the Washington Post called a “gangly, Southern hippie,” also resigned due to substance abuse. <br> Only it wasn’t the Post that broke that story. It was The New York Times. Back in May, the Columbia Journalism Review showed how angry Times staff were about it in “Hell hath no fury like The New York Times scorned by Hollywood.” <br> That hasn’t stopped the Post from going Hollywood about its movie, writing more than 3,300 words about itself. All of those ego-inflating sentences were meant to push one agenda item: “It couldn’t be more timely.” Hint, hint: It’s about Trump. Add to it that the film was produced by lefty Participant Media, which also produced former Vice President Al Gore’s “Inconvenient Truth” quasi-documentaries. <br> Mediaite sums it up quite clearly that President Trump “regularly starts his day watching” the show. “Since they have captured the President’s attention – which often then gets tweeted and covered by the media – the topics they cover essentially set the national agenda for the rest of the day,” it wrote. President Trump even tweeted congratulations. 
 An important provision of the tax cut legislation passed by Congress this week allows the American people to finally benefit from abundant petroleum resources that experts predict will be found in a very small area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) on Alaska’s northern coast. <br> The legislation directs the Interior Department to hold at least two lease sales over the next 10 years, for a maximum of 2,000 acres opened to drilling. Analysts say the sales could fetch as much as $2.2 billion. <br> The narrow coastal plain affected by the legislation contains an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil, says Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who chairs of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This could produce about 1 million barrels of oil each day, amounting to about 20 percent of daily U.S. oil production, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. <br> The U.S. Geological Survey and Congressional Research Service say it’s 95 percent likely that there are 15.6 billion barrels of oil beneath ANWR. With today’s prices and fracking technology, up to 60 percent of that oil may be recoverable. <br> At $50 a barrel, all that oil represents $460 billion that we will not have to send to other countries to buy foreign oil. It also represents tens of billions of dollars in royalty and tax revenues to Alaska and the U.S. government. And opening up a tiny part of ANWR for our energy industry will create thousands of jobs in oilfield, manufacturing and many other sectors. <br> Companies that extract oil from federal onshore and offshore leases pay royalties of up to 18 percent of wellhead prices. They then pay corporate taxes on profits and sales taxes at the pump. Workers pay income taxes, instead of receiving unemployment and welfare checks. <br> As they have for some four decades, activists continue to claim drilling would destroy the entire ANWR area’s wilderness character and threaten its caribou, polar bears, birds and other wildlife. That is a completely false narrative. <br> The potentially oil-rich area of ANWR is actually flat, treeless tundra, 50 miles from the beautiful Brooks Range mountains that feature so prominently and deceptively in Sierra Club and other anti-drilling campaigns. <br> The harsh winter conditions mean drilling can be done using airstrips, roads and drill pads that are all constructed with ice and snow. Come spring, all of this will melt, leaving only puddles, little holes and a few permanent facilities. <br> In fact, the Prudhoe Bay oilfield’s Central Arctic caribou herd has over 20,000 of the animals today, compared to just 5,000 in 1975. Arctic fox, geese, shore birds and other wildlife also return each spring, along with giant mosquitoes. <br> Coupled with the ability to fracture rock formations and stimulate them to produce far more oil and natural gas liquids than previously possible, this accuracy means that the 2,000-acre footprint could produce up to 15 billion gallons of petroleum annually. <br> Inuit natives who live in or near ANWR have supported drilling by an 8-to-1 margin. They no longer want to live in poverty – after having given up their traditional land claims for oil rights that Congress, greens, presidents and courts have repeatedly denied them. <br> Drilling in ANWR will also ensure sufficient production to keep the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in operation. Right now, declining North Slope production threatens to reduce oil in the pipeline to a point where it cannot stay sufficiently warm to flow under months-long winter conditions. 
 While there is far more to be done, President Trump has the right idea on health care reform. The low hanging fruit is strategic deregulation, specifically rolling back the ACA-imposed requirements on health insurance that not only directly raised insurance premiums but furthered the inappropriate construct that insurance should minimize out-of-pocket payment for all medical care. When insurance covers nearly everything, patients have little incentive to consider price of care, so doctors and hospitals don’t need to compete on price. The consequences are the overuse of health care and unrestrained costs. <br> The president’s directive will allow more insurance choices for millions of people who don’t want to buy bloated coverage filled with mandates for care they do not value and will not use. Part of this is the opportunity to buy insurance from other states and without the burden of ObamaCare’s “essential benefits” that increased premiums by almost 10 percent, and many of the 2,270 state coverage mandates for everything from acupuncture to marriage therapy. This will generate cheaper insurance. <br> Could people consider price for medical care? Yes - almost 60 percent of all expenditures by privately insured adults under age 65 is for elective outpatient care, and these are amenable to price-conscious purchasing. Even for the top one percent of spenders who spend for more than 25 percent of all health spending, a full 45 percent is for outpatient care. <br> For patients to effectively seek out the best value for their money, more reforms must also occur. <br> First, the visibility of information that patients require for assessing value must be radically improved. We know that price transparency encourages price comparisons by patients for outpatient care like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outpatient surgery. Doctors and hospitals would certainly post prices and qualifications once they are competing for price-conscious patients empowered with control of the money. <br> Third, introduce the right incentives into the tax code and eliminate the harmful, counterproductive incentives of<i> </b>the current tax code. Today’s unlimited income exclusion from taxes for employer-provided health benefits encouraged higher demand for care, regardless of cost, while distorting insurance into covering almost all services. Likewise, artificially propping up high insurance premiums for bloated coverage that minimizes out-of-pocket payment via subsidies or tax credits prevents patients from caring about price. This reduces incentives for doctors to compete on price. Any new tax reform should cap health care deductions and limit eligibility to catastrophic premiums and HSA contributions to incentivize patients to consider prices.<i></b> 
 In 2008, President Obama claimed that saddling the American people with $9 trillion in debt was “irresponsible” and “unpatriotic.” Yet, after eight years of his tax-and-spend policies, Obama is rightfully dubbed the King of Debt for doubling our national debt, which stood at a staggering $20 trillion when he left office. <br> This reckless approach to spending by Democrats launched our country into an unprecedented fiscal crisis. But last year, the voters said ‘enough is enough’ when they elected President Trump and Republicans at all levels for their bold vision to get our country’s fiscal house in order. <br> Republicans know that our nation’s entrepreneurs and small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. By making federal government more efficient and less intrusive, we empower them to invest, create jobs, and grow our economy. We want families to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, because we know they can spend their money better at home than the federal government can in Washington, D.C. <br> By enacting comprehensive tax reform that eliminates unnecessary, burdensome Obama-era regulations, our country can save as much as $1.2 trillion. This is a significant amount of money that will help bolster President Trump’s America First priorities. <br> One of the most crucial among those priorities is rebuilding our nation’s military, which was left depleted and out-of-date after years of neglect by the previous administration. President Trump’s budget includes a 10 percent increase in defense spending, providing a long-overdue modernization of military assets and support. This means our servicemen and servicewomen, who risk their lives daily for our freedom, would be fully equipped to succeed in the line of fire. <br> While many hard choices were necessary to reach this budget, the spending reductions reflect President Trump’s charge to reduce the size of the federal workforce and create a leaner, more accountable, and less intrusive government for the American people. 
 Donald Trump’s war on Senate Republicans continues unabated. Sunday, Trump took to trashing Sen. Bob Corker on Twitter. In a series of dyspeptic tweets, the President blamed Corker for the Iran Deal, and berated the senator from Tennessee for announcing that he would not seek a third term. <br> Yes, Corker had earned Trump’s ire by complaining of the chaos that surrounds Trump, but Corker is not a club-of-one. Trump has lashed out at other senior Republican senators for saying far less. More ominously for Trump, his tantrums could even earn him a primary challenge, something no president wants. <br> To be sure, little good can come from these attacks by Trump on members of his own party. At a minimum, they will not help advance Trump’s legislative agenda. On the other hand, they could help make New York’s Chuck Schumer the next Senate Majority Leader, and kill any chance of a tax cut, not exactly desired outcomes for the GOP. <br> With Korea, the Iran Deal, and tax reform all hanging in the balance, a different approach would have been in order. As a matter of political self-preservation, the president should not treat Corker as he does North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Unlike “Little Rocket Man,” Corker is legally eligible to challenge Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. <br> Already, Corker has let everyone know that he, like Trump, is someone who won’t back down, and for the record, Corker gave as good as he got. Responding with a Tweet of his own, Corker intimated that Trump was addled, saying “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” <br> As Corker put it, “Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we’re dealing with here,” adding that “of course they understand the volatility that we’re dealing with and the tremendous amount of work that it takes by people around him to keep him in the middle of the road.” <br> And while Trump and Steve Bannon gloat over Corker’s refusal to run again, they would do well to remember that Breitbart’s own Joel B. Pollak, the website’s executive editor, has already threatened Trump with the prospect of a primary if he did not toe the line on immigration and populist orthodoxy. Pollak’s words, not mine. <br> If -- and it’s a big if -- Corker takes a flier on the White House, he would do well to remember Davy Crockett, another Tennessean who stood his ground back in the day, the day being 1834. Crockett, then a congressman, confronted President Andrew Jackson, another Tennessean and a Trump favorite, over the continued removal of the Cherokee Indians from their homes. 
 Democrats are overjoyed that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against President Trump’s immigration order. That figures; never mind the legal issues or the possible impact on the White House’s ability to enact measures aimed at keeping the country safe. Most important: it was a blow to Trump, and Democrats couldn’t be happier. It’s gotten personal. <br> Which path would that be? Maybe Trump’s immigration order, which, notwithstanding the ruling of a notably liberal court, gets approval from 55% of the country, versus 38% that disapproves? Or his proposal to revoke federal funds from sanctuary cities, a policy supported by 55% of registered voters and opposed by only 33%, according to the same new Morning Consult/Politico poll? <br> This toxic posturing could well backfire as Democrats try to win back disaffected voters. As important, it could hurt the country, and for that they will not be forgiven. <br> Since then, as Democrats have slow-walked confirming Trump’s cabinet nominees and have placed themselves squarely in front of every policy he has suggested, consumer confidence has slipped almost three points, giving up much of the post-election gain. That could quickly translate into slower spending, meaning fewer jobs. <br> The liberal media will blame Trump for everything that goes wrong, including less-than-immediate gratification on Obamacare and tax reform. The media, though, get worse marks than the president these days; their incessant attacks on Trump have undermined their credibility. <br> Meanwhile, where is the vision that will lead Democrats out of their self- inflicted political exile? Where are their policies that will boost incomes and win back the hearts of traditional blue collar Democrats? <br> At the retreat, Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House, tied future gains to rebuilding “our state and local parties.” He doesn’t seem to understand that attracting voters requires a winning message. Hillary Clinton didn’t have one, and neither does the party today. <br> Warren tweeted to call out Sessions’ supposed “radical hatred” and “racism, sexism bigotry”; evidence for those charges during Sessions’ decades of public service are scant. Sessions is hated by the Left because he will execute the laws of the country – laws that are under attack from numerous sides. Laws that were often ignored by former Attorneys General Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder. <br> In fact, voters appear to like most of the executive orders signed by Trump. Some 54% think freezing new regulations is a good idea (33%), 48% like Trump’s decision on the Keystone Pipeline, against 37% that do not. Similar portions of the electorate agree with his moves on building a wall, withdrawing from the TPP and not giving federal money to organizations providing abortions. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 With the November 2020 Presidential election over three years away, it may seem strange to be discussing the prospects for President Trump to be re-elected. <br> Yet, even at this early stage, some things are clear if he is around and runs again. His biggest problems are his inability, despite majorities in the House and Senate, to pass any major legislation. He has not built the famous wall, torpedoed ObamaCare or done tax reform. He has repeatedly battled senior members of the Republican Party (Mitch McConnell and John McCain), tweeted frequently at three in the morning and even spoken about consequences for those who fail to salute the American flag at NFL games. <br> President Trump has already started campaigning for 2018 congressional elections and the 2020 presidential and congressional elections. He has visited so many red states so many times (like Mississippi, Alabama, Iowa, Indiana and West Virginia) that Real Clear Politics calls him the President of the Red States. <br> President Trump has a reasonable chance of being reelected. Historically, 70 percent, or twelve of seventeen 20th century incumbent presidents seeking a second term have won re-election. Fully six of seven Democratic presidents and six of ten Republican presidents have been re-elected. <br> The likely Democratic candidate, as reflected in the 21 people most frequently mentioned as possible nominees, have their own problems. Overwhelmingly the great majority are either lawyers (12) or billionaire business entrepreneurs (5), people whose wealth and working places are far removed from those of the average American. This is reinforced in the fact that almost half of them (9 of 21) graduated from Ivy League schools, which account for only 1 ercent of college or professional graduates. The early leaders are white and wealthy which puts them far away from the large middle and working-class elements and the powerful Democratic base in the African American, Latino and Asian American identity groups. <br> Also, they are overwhelmingly from the West or East Coast, areas that any Democratic candidate is likely to carry. Only a handful come from the middle of the country’s red states and working class/middle class elements that Trump carried so well in 2016. 
 Despite its previous failure in March, House Republicans successfully passed the American Health Care Act Thursday afternoon, a major step toward repealing and replacing ObamaCare. <br> While Republicans have campaigned on this issue for nearly a decade though, Thursday’s replacement bill is as bad if not worse than the bill’s first iteration and even further, it’s DOA in the Senate. <br> The impact of these amendments is more pernicious however. These hasty changes, which show how desperate for legislative victory President Trump truly is, threaten coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions, as well as all patients’ coverage for the critical categories of services defined in ObamaCare’s Essential Health Benefits. <br> In terms of the Upton amendment’s impact, its additional $8 billion in funding over five years for states to create high-risk pools only puts a band-aid on a serious problem. <br> Critics of the AHCA on both sides of the aisle insist that $8 billion is not nearly enough funding to successfully nor adequately cover all patients with preexisting conditions. <br> Although the AHCA could bring a harbinger of problems for Donald Trump, Republicans critically needed to pass some form of legislation promised to their constituents before advancing onto tax reform, infrastructure investment, and other much-needed economic reforms. <br> Considering how exasperating it has been for President Trump, Speaker Ryan, and the Republican Party as a whole to push through their signature legislation promise of repeal-and-replace through, the outlook is grim for any upcoming legislation. <br> Rather than resist the president at every step, the Democrats in the Senate must now proactively find a way to not only minimize the estimated tens of millions of Americans who will lose their health care, but also rescue some vestiges of President Obama’s landmark health bill. 
 Last week the Trump Administration put plans in place to reverse a ban blocking the importation of elephant trophies back into the U.S. from Zimbabwe and Zambia. The true motive behind the move was cleverly disguised by its proponents as a feel-good story designed to benefit conservation efforts as new data, allegedly provided by Zimbabwean officials, indicated increased hunting would actually help the threatened species. <br> As someone who spends time behind the scenes supporting projects focused on protecting elephants in East Africa, I can tell you that I have been scratching my head all week wondering what idiot in our government thought this was a good idea in the first place. Who thought that they could actually sneak this one in and the American people would just whistle past it? Well we didn’t. <br> The facts of poaching are very clear: there are more elephants being killed every day in Africa than are being born. If the killing of the species continues at current rates, it won’t be long until we are taking our children to see them in the Smithsonian museum and having to explain why they can no longer go see them alive in their natural habitat. <br> What this new decision sounds like is a bunch of bored, rich guys got together to tell hunting stories and bet each other that they could get a guy in Washington to pass a law for them that helps fill empty space on their walls. This has good old boys club written all over it. What we are seeing is an abuse of power. President Trump should have the head of whoever was behind this new policy. <br> What surprised me even further was that the Department of the Interior seemed to stand behind the ban reversal based on shoddy research. The unlucky U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official who was given the task of defending the decision publicly stated that “new data” received from Zimbabwe supported reversing the ban, that well-regulated sport hunting as part of “sound management” conservation program can benefit certain species. <br> Let me be clear, this is not about bashing hunting. I am no stranger to the world myself. I grew up hunting in Texas. I spent most of my career in U.S. Army Special Ops community – you should have seen the guns I had access to. At one point in my career you could even argue that I hunted and killed people for a living. But there is a significant difference between hunting as a legal practice in the U.S. and the hunting of designated endangered species in countries that have proven track records of corrupt conservation practices. So when someone tells me that promoting the hunting of endangered species is a great way to protect them and also put money back into the cause, I have a hard time not laughing at their complete ignorance of it all. 
 Lost in the alt-left's extreme and ruthless opposition to President Trump is the fact that he's been very busy keeping his promises and checking off items on his agenda, one by one. <br> “Over the past two months, the American people have gotten to know, respect and truly admire our newest member of the United States Supreme Court,” he said. “In Justice Gorsuch, they see a man of great and unquestioned integrity. They see a man of unmatched qualifications. And most of all, and most importantly, they see a man who is deeply faithful to the Constitution of the United States.” <br> President Trump is busy bringing back jobs, making phone calls to the CEOs of companies day and night. He's gutting Obama-era regulations, and the president has said he could eliminate up to 75 percent of government rules and regulations. The war on coal is over and the red tape from the Obama administration is gone. <br> President Trump has drafted a plan to defeat ISIS. His administration has sanctioned Iran over its missile program and put the rogue regime on notice. Our commander-in-chief responded to Syria's use of chemical weapons by approving a Tomahawk missile strike. <br> While the president is enacting his agenda every day, there's still plenty of work do. Failing to repeal and replace ObamaCare was a big misstep.Republicans need to learn from that mistake and build consensus before introducing such an important bill. And while the health care bill is not dead, Republicans are moving ahead on a massive tax reform plan. <br> While President Trump works to advance his agenda, the alt-left, propaganda, destroy-Trump media, breathlessly reports on infighting in the White House. Who knows whether or not the press has blown this out of proportion, like everything they cover. But the reality is that it's irrelevant. Whomever President Trump wants around him is his business. If you work for the president, your job is to put his agenda in place, serve him and serve the country. <br> Adapted from Sean Hannity’s monologue on “Hannity,” April 10, 2017 
 The historic 2016 election suggests very strongly that despite the relatively close popular vote and somewhat wider, but still significant electoral margin, Democrats need to rethink their politics, policies and approach. <br> But most of all, the outcome reflects a clear sense that the Democratic party cannot and will not be able to win elections unless it moves back to the center of the electorate. <br> The Democrats now have to put aside partisanship and seek to find common ground with Donald Trump on issues like immigration, tax reform on both corporate and individual level and most of all on infrastructure given our crumbling roads, bridges and highways. There is so much more that we can work on together than politicians acknowledge and a majority of Americans have long wished that politicians in Washington would work with one another. <br> The Democrats have to make it clear that they will seek consensus and compromise. For the Democratic party to feel in any way that the closeness of the race is an indication that they should accept the politics of the far left would be a profound mistake. <br> To this end, in one sense, the far left agenda contributed greatly to Secretary Clinton’s loss and it’s certainly one of the reasons that we need a change in the party if we are to return to the strength and ideological and substantive positioning the party achieved in the 1990s when I worked for Bill Clinton. <br> Douglas E.

 On Monday evening, President Trump addressed the nation to outline his new strategy to win the war in Afghanistan. <br> After a series of accusations by lawmakers and the media suggesting that the president had been dragging his feet onthe conflict, Trump confidently committed to sending an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan and indicated that the United States will work closely with NATO allies, as well as regional allies in Pakistan and India to resolve the conflict. <br> Although President Trump could not have effectively made a speech about the events in Charlottesville and the need for unity in our country alone, he did use tonight’s address to lay the groundwork for healing the wounds of division in our country, essentially using the examples of unity and common purpose that our armed service members consistently display. <br> This is the first step in a national reconciliation process that will take more time effort and commitment to implement. Along these lines, the President needs to lower his voice, reduce his tweets, and seek common ground with Republicans and Democrats alike. <br> Further, President Trump needs to begin working toward compromise on key issues like health care, tax reform and infrastructure. <br> On Monday night, however, the president successfully changed the national conversation to foreign policy and military strategy. <br> At this time, 4,000 additional U.S. troops are far too few to stop the full range of terrorist and insurgent threats menacing the United States and challenging the Afghan government. <br> However, as Senator McCain continued, “the unfortunate truth is that this strategy is long overdue, and in the interim, the Taliban has made dangerous inroads.” <br> It is my view that despite President Trump’s overt confidence and soaring rhetoric on Monday night, his new plan is too little, too late. <br> Modern Middle Eastern history tells us that no foreign power has ever succeeded in Afghanistan and there is no reason to believe things will change with this small additional troop allocation. <br> Given the recent gains made by the Taliban, Haqqani, Islamic State in Khorasan, and other terrorist groups, more is needed to successfully reassert the Afghan government’s control, as well as bring American involvement to an end. <br> But given the complexities of the political and military situations on the ground in Afghanistan, this achievement will take a serious commitment, extending well beyond what the United States has already dedicated over the past sixteen years. <br> These causes are all well and good and it is my hope the president and our military succeeds. <br> As echoed in Monday night’s address, President Trump’s reassertion of U.S. leadership around the world was a foundational component of his campaign. 
 Back in the 1980s, syndicated TV journalist Geraldo Rivera appeared live on TV to open a secret vault in a Chicago hotel that had once belonged to mobster Al Cabone. <br> But at least he didn’t know what would be inside when he hyped the story. <br> As Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post concluded the result was a “nothing burger.” <br> The return showed that Trump had paid $38 million in federal income tax off a $150 million income that year. While Trump has frequently boasted that “I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.” But the Alternative Minimum Tax, which works to make it hard for multimillionaires to evade all federal income taxes apparently worked in Trump’s case. <br> The White House noted that “it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns” and said the president will continue to pursue “tax reform that will benefit all Americans.” &nbsp; <br> Regardless of the source, Trump’s adversaires and the media will continue to obsess about the tax returns. David Brock, a longtime court jester in the camp of Hillary Clinton, is offering a $5 million reward to anyone who hands over President Trump's complete and legally obtained tax returns. That’s bait and switch. If someone sent him the tax returns, Brock would cheerfully publish them and point out he didn’t have to pay the money beccause there’s no way an outside party can “legally” reveal tax returns. <br> It was outrageous that Trump would often promise to release the returns, and then spuriously claim he couldn’t release even returns from two decades ago because his current returns were under audit. <br> I strenously argued that Trump would sink his chances of beating Hillary Clinton by becoming the first major presidenital nominee since Nixon not to release his returns. <br> But it’s time for the media to ponder cutting their losses, and moving on to other and fresher problems with the Trump presidency -- like his continued failure to fill sub-Cabinet positions that are key to allowing his govenrment to function. <br> Rachel Maddow’s attempt to pump air into her deflated balloon of a story is yet another example of the mainstream media not willing to acccept defeat. 
 Despite record job growth, the Dow over 22,000, illegal immigration down 70 percent and massive deregulation, the mainstream media still reports that Donald Trump’s presidency is a failure. To put the final nail in the coffin of the opposition (Republicans, Democrats and the failing mainstream media) President Trump needs victories in three areas: legislative, the court of public opinion, and national defense and diplomacy. <br> First, legislative – more specifically, health care. A handful of Republicans – after campaigning, raising money on and promising the repeal of ObamaCare – failed to deliver. This is why “we the people” like the president more than Congress. But it is not too late for Trump to post a victory here. He can propose a bill to repeal only the individual mandate and he needs to do it louder than anything else he has done to date. That is the single most unpopular element of the health care law and might even garner support from across the aisle – even Democrats have admitted it needs changes. This would be very hard to vote against and the president would post his first legislative victory. <br> Also in the legislative column: tax reform. What legislator would not want to go home to constituents and be able to say “we put more money in your paycheck?” Here is how you roll it out: send Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the podium with an average middle class American making $50-60,000 a year, hold up his current paycheck, what he makes and what he takes home. Then you hold up a second paycheck with the same salary under Trump’s tax plan highlighting the difference in the take home pay. “This is what President Trump stands for. Congress, the bill is on your desk, make it happen.” She walks out without taking any questions and does not hold a press conference until Congress votes on it. <br> In the court of public opinion, Trump has been convicted by the mainstream media of Russian collusion. The problem, though, is they have yet to produce any evidence for any of their criminal allegations. Here’s the play: Trump challenges his largest critics on this. Calling out Schumer, Pelosi, Waters and a few more saying that he will participate in the investigation to the fullest for 90 more days on the condition that if nothing is found, they resign their seats. Look, there is no precedent or legal grounds for this. If they don’t respond in 10 days, he fires Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It’s simply a PR play, they will NOT agree to this which gives Trump the opportunity to go on the offense and say, “The Democrats don’t even believe in this investigation.” <br> Finally, national defense. Even with the 15-0 global decision against it at the UN Security Council, North Korea is going to continue to push the envelope until we do something. Sanctions will not work and will only further enrage the regime. North Korea is so poor that people are eating the frogs and bugs in the streets – any sanctions placed on them simply re-directs any limited funds away from his people and back to his military complex. 
 First they said he would never run for president. Then they said he would never be the Republican nominee for president. Then they said he could never be elected president. The latest false narrative being pushed by the liberal media is that some Republicans are making moves to run against President Trump in 2020. <br> These fake news stories are in the interests of the liberal agenda because they raise manufactured questions about the president’s standing with Republican primary voters and are meant to cause division among conservatives. Try as they might, the American people are too smart for the elitist gamesmanship going on in the boardrooms at the New York Times and Washington Post. <br> On pro-life issues, the National Right to Life Committee gave President Trump an A grade for his performance through his first 100 days in office. On 2nd Amendment rights, President Trump is the first president to address the National Rifle Association leadership forum in 34 years and their Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said that he sees “a tremendous pride wave out there in the heartland of the country with this president.” Social conservative leaders praised President Trump’s recent decision to not allow transgender people to serve in the military. And if all this isn’t enough to satisfy conservatives, Justice Neil Gorsuch’s stellar service on the Supreme Court is icing on the cake. <br> There’s much more that conservatives like about the job President Trump is doing. When it comes to sanctuary city reform and border security, President Trump’s leadership has exceeded all expectations. In fact, President Trump has been so effective in dealing with sanctuary city lawlessness that elitist liberal Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is suing the Trump Administration to try and keep Chicago a dangerous sanctuary city. <br> No one knows this better than Vice President Mike Pence. Since becoming President Trump’s running mate a little over a year ago, Vice President Pence has been a full partner with the president in their mission to enact their conservative reform agenda and “Make America Great Again.” The vice president is focused like a laser beam on fixing health care, tax reform, and various other initiatives and is doing a great job. When Vice President Pence travels to Iowa or Ohio to advocate for the president’s agenda it means exactly that and nothing more. President Trump and Vice President Pence are looking forward to defeating Congresswoman Maxine Waters or whatever leftist the out-of-control Democrat Party nominates in 2020. 
 The Democratic Party is a mess. It has no effective national leader. It has no serious agenda. And Democrats have no idea how to win back the Rust Belt voters who propelled the ultimate political outsider, Donald J. Trump, to the presidency. <br> During President Obama’s eight years in office the Democrats became primarily a coastal party that caters to out-of-touch wealthy elitists in liberal enclaves like Manhattan and Hollywood, while ignoring the hardworking Americans who are the backbone of our country. <br> Forgotten voters in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina – whose families had voted for Democrats since President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s time – have finally had enough. They feel like they’ve lost their country and that their leaders in Washington have lost faith in them. <br> Then Donald Trump came into their communities, talking America First, American jobs, and American exceptionalism. Trump has backed those words up with an optimistic agenda anchored on the central promise to get Americans working again. The Make American Great Again effort is focused on reform: tax reform, trade reform, regulatory reform, domestic energy production reform, and health care reform. <br> A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that only 37 percent of the American people think that the Democratic Party stands for something. And 52 percent said all that the Democrats do is oppose President Trump. This polling data reflects reality. President Trump has been in office for six months and the Democrats up until now have done nothing more than run a permanent obstruction campaign against the president and his agenda. <br> I will go a step further and offer what I hear from the liberals in Washington and in the mainstream media about what I would call the real Democrat agenda: <br> This list represents the deep hole that Democrats have dug for themselves outside of their shrinking far-left base. 
 There were scores of pressing queries for the White House press corps to put to presidential spokesman Sean Spicer at Wednesday’s daily briefing: President Trump’s new immigration restrictions, relations with Mexico, China and Russia, tax reform, ObamaCare, the fight against Islamic terror. <br> As Bellwether noted last week, several state legislatures were dismayed, during the closing year of the Obama administration, to receive a letter from the Departments of Justice and Education instructing them to let students who claim to be transgender use whatever bathrooms, locker rooms and showers they want, based solely on which gender they feel they are. States that refused to comply were threatened with a cutoff of federal funds. <br> The Trump administration is widely expected, sometime this week, to rescind those Obama-era instructions, and let individual states deal with the issue as they see fit. <br> “It’s not a priority,” answered Spicer, pointing out that the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a case this week involving transgender rights, and the new administration has to decide before then whether to continue, or amend, the Obama-era guidance. <br> Texas, which voted for Trump and is considering a state law that requires people to use the bathroom assigned to them according to the gender on their birth certificate, is an example. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told me last week, “This is not a law aimed at discriminating against transgenders. It’s aimed at sex offenders who could use this to pretend they’re transgenders. It’s intended to protect the right of a woman not to have to share a bathroom with a man if she doesn’t want to.” <br> Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is trying to ignore interference by sports associations like the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. Both have hinted strongly that if the proposed legislation is passed into law, Texas will not get to host major sports events like All-Star games or the Super Bowl. 
 Exit polls from the 2016 presidential election find that the biggest motivatingfactor for voters in the contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was a desire for “real change” (39 percent). Of those voters, Donald Trump won an astounding 83 percent. That is the biggest reason he won. <br> But when it comes to the nuts-and-bolts of his tax and economic plan, Trump has been attacked by liberals as offering“warmed-over supply-side nostrums” with the New Yorker sneering that Trump represents “Palin populism in the streets, but Reagan in the balance sheets.” <br> As for personal income tax rates, Trump would create four brackets of rates ranging from 12 percent to 33 percent. The standard tax deduction would be increased, and at the same time over 90 percent of Americans would no longer have to itemize their deductions. <br> No doubt Trump will be slammed for having refused to release his tax returns during the campaign. Trump doesn’t deny he employed legal means to lower his tax burden as much as possible. But he says many tax provisions should be sunsetted. “One of the major reasons Iam running is to reform our broken tax code,” he told an audience in Colorado in September. “Who better to fix it then someone who knows just how crazy it is?” <br> “What might compel [action], especially in this era of populism, is this broader sense of how much some folks are getting away with, lawfully or not,” says Sage Eastman, a lobbyist at Mehlman Castagnetti and former top aide to retired House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.)The trick, he says, is to make sure that corporate welfare and egregious tax provisions for special interests are addressed as part of any reform <br> Why is tax reform so important? <br> For the Obama-Hillary team of economic experts, permanent subpar growth is not a crisis. Wealthyspecial interests are prospering in an easy money environment while their lower-income voters are promised more social programs. <br> It already has. We are living through the weakest expansion since World War Two. President Obama has yet to preside over a single year in which the economy grew by 3 percent. The Federal Reserve does not project the economy to grow above 2 percent through 2019, and its longer run expectations are for the economy to grow about 1.8 percent a year. Current signals are bleak -- factory orders have been down for 22 straight months and business optimism is at the lowest level since the financial crisis. <br> Trump’s economic team indicts currentpolicy makers as too complacent about the anemic economic growth of the last decade, “If we slash regulations, tap intoour bountiful domestic energy reserves and reduce business taxes while avoiding a trade war we could see an explosion of economic growth,” says Steve Moore, a Fox News contributor and economist at the Heritage Foundation. <br> Because tax and budget issues can’t be filibustered in the Senate they require only a simple majority vote. <br> It will be the first big test of his administration, and one that many of the people who voted for him expecting “real change” will be watching carefully. 
 Maybe I have baseball on the brain, but when I watch President Trump what I’ve seen to date is one fastball after another. <br> This was one of several unresolved questions going into Tuesday night’s joint address to Congress: could Trump deviate from the rhetorical heat that proved effective as a candidate to a president capable of mixing speeds (rhetorically, at least) and keeping Democratic batters off-balance and behind in the count? <br> Trump’s address -- he billed it as “a renewal of the American spirit,” calling on Congress to join him “in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country” -- weaved in and out of familiar places. But with the occasional surprise detour – the sort of focus-group approach that made Bill Clinton’s speeches before Congress so long (Trump spoke for an hour) but politically effective. <br> Democrats were forced to take notice of Trump’s call for paid family leave, just as Republicans couldn’t ignore a stronger-than-usual call for school choice. <br> The effectiveness of it all? I’ll wager that it tested well with voters willing to put aside the man’s personality and listen to his ideas. <br> And President Trump? <br> Here are four takeaways from Trump’s speech: <br> For Trump, it’s a little from column A, a lot from column B. The economy’s a mixed message: stocks have never been higher; Target, the epitome of Main Street America, is struggling thanks to the digital monster that is Amazon. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats refuse to grant Trump presidential stature. <br> In a realigned Washington, a Republican president now touts victimhood (bad trade deals stealing American jobs; illegal aliens preying on lawful citizens). Congressional Democrats bemoan government over-reach in the form of Obamacare stepped-up immigration enforcement. <br> 2. The State of Trump’s State. The 45th president entered his first joint address to Congress with a 39 percent approval rating, per the Fox News Poll (Obama was at 60 percent at the same point in 2009). <br> What does work for Trump is the novelty of his appearing in prime time television (as a politician, that is) working off a TelePrompter and having an adult conversation with the American public. Unlike the a.m. version of Trump – the one prone to manic tweeting and extemporaneous remarks at press avails that set off dumpster fires – the p.m. version is less abrasive and makes a more convincing case that he’s serious about the job and has a lot of ideas that makes sense. <br> What he should consider: more speeches like this and town hall venues outside the beltway, where the presidential agenda has far more resonance – with Democrats representing districts that didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton in a tough spot. <br> The surprises: <br> -- Trump’s call for bipartisanship included fair trade and a new “border tax” – not “drain the swamp” reforms such as lobbying restrictions that were mentioned earlier in the address (and met with Democratic sarcasm). <br> -- While the economy got large play, the specifics of tax reform didn’t. The president made a vague reference to reducing for businesses and families, but didn’t give it the same play as infrastructure investment or regulatory reform. One imagines that Wall Street was hoping for more. <br> It’s been almost 1,000 hours since Barack Obama left office. To the extent the left has complained about the former president, it would be: despite talking a big game (climate change, gun control) he didn’t engage with Congress on a personal level to win over lawmakers. <br> This isn’t to suggest that Trump should rent a copy of HBO’s “All The Way” and mimic Lyndon Johnson’s handholding and arm-twisting. But perhaps it’s time to shift gears and push for the agenda in the same struggling economic pockets that made the politically impossible last fall. 
 President Trump caused some head scratching when he told a plane full of journalists en route to France that “what I’d like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan.” But as the Russia investigations drag on, the prospects for health care reform are on hold, and tax reform continues to be a work in progress, this seemingly far-fetched plan may in fact be the most likely opportunity for the president to land a signature legislative victory during his first year in office. <br> It’s not the conventional bet, but this is not a conventional time nor a conventional president – and, this is not the first time we’ve seen him lay some groundwork for such a pursuit. <br> Even before his comments on Air Force One, President Trump had signaled a desire and willingness to go beyond enforcement to fix the broken visa system and address the fact that 11 million people live here without legal status. <br> These comments may be far from setting administration policy – indeed, Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly just indicated he may not defend Obama-era protection for DREAMers and Politico is reporting that some in the Trump Administration are advocating for cutting legal immigration in half – but they do make clear that a broad immigration overhaul is on the president’s mind and he is open to taking on the issue that has stymied every president since Reagan. <br> I’ll be the first to acknowledge reasonable skepticism, but working on this issue from a nonpartisan vantage point, I believe there are three compelling reasons to believe immigration reform is and should be at the top of the agenda: <br> The bill didn’t skimp on the border, either. It included $46 billion for security and enforcement, double what President Trump is requesting for his wall now. It mandated hundreds of miles of walls and fences, doubled the number of border patrol agents, and funded aircraft, watchtowers, ground sensors, and mobile surveillance to further monitor the border, while also cracking down on employers who hired undocumented immigrants. <br> In this Congress, Republicans in both chambers have already introduced four distinct bills that would provide undocumented immigrants with legal status. (One such bill in the House has attracted more than 200 co-sponsors, including 99 Republicans.) <br> Multiple polls show that Americans of all political persuasions, including a clear majority of Trump voters, overwhelmingly support immigration reform that would secure the border, grant legal status to non-criminal undocumented immigrants, and bring the visa system into the 21st century by increasing protections for American workers while also allowing companies to recruit the top talent and necessary workers to fill gaps in the American workforce. <br> To get a deal, President Trump needs to sweeten the pot by adding broadly popular reforms that would grow the American economy. According to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, such comprehensive reform would cut the deficit by $900 billion over 20 years because of tax revenues from the millions of people who would be able to formally enter the workforce, and would actually result in a 0.5 percent wage increase for all American workers. It would go a long way toward supporting the administration’s economic growth and job creation goals – the president’s own chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has written extensively on the large gains immigration reform can bring – while also creating the budget room for other major priorities. 
 President Donald Trump was elected our nation’s 45th president not beholden to Washington or any special interest in its swamp. President Trump is a change agent unlike any President the American people have ever seen. He’s the first non-politician to be elected president since General Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. &nbsp;President Trump was elected as a successful businessman to break up Washington’s failed status quo. What we are witnessing is the ultimate political outsider enacting real change. <br> So all the sound and fury emanating from Washington? That’s what it sounds like when an entrenched political class that is radically averse to change is forced to confront it, head-on. And all the noise is obscuring one very important fact, and that is that 161 days into the Trump Presidency – once you cut through the permanent obstruction campaign being waged by the Democrats and all the noise emanating from the liberal media – genuine progress is being made on the Trump agenda. <br> This week’s unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court ordering that the President’s executive order on immigration can largely take effect is an enormous victory for the White House and our national security. The Supreme Court put its stamp of approval on the fact that the President of the United States has the power to secure our country and that our immigration vetting system needs major improvement. <br> Through President Trump’s “America First” leadership, much progress has already been made. The nomination and confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch for example is a promise made and a promise kept by our president. This widely praised decision sent a signal to the American people that this president will appoint only supremely qualified defenders of the Constitution to our nation’s highest court.&nbsp; Similarly, President Trump’s consequential decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord makes clear he is prioritizing the economic interests of the United States of America and the American worker first and foremost. <br> Going forward, it is critically important that the U.S. Senate continue to improve their health care reform legislation and get it to President Trump’s desk for his signature. This landmark accomplishment will enable our country to finally move on from the divisive ObamaCare years and onto policy measures such as tax reform which will make dramatic economic gains and job creation become a reality. Job creators at businesses both large and small are craving for some economic certainty from our federal government. They want the certainty that taxes and regulations are going to be cut and that our tax code will be streamlined for the hardworking taxpayers that they employ. These optimistic pro-growth reforms are something that the American people will rally around. Hopefully some Senate Democrats from states President Trump carried will feel the same way. 
 <b>Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.</i> <br> How times have changed on ObamaCare. <br> And then there is the GOP failure to find a palatable substitute. <br> Even President Trump on a visit to Capitol Hill last week reportedly told Republican senators that he doesn’t like the House GOP’s American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it is “mean.” <br> Seeing Trump jump off the House plan is a very bad sign for Congressional Republicans as they get ready to talk health care with constituents over coming recesses around Independence Day and in August. Even when the president was celebrating the House bill, Republicans faced unruly Memorial Day town hall meetings, with outright protests against their health care proposal. <br> They are reported to be looking at increasing subsidies for the poor while providing more time to achieve the far-right goal of doing away with federal guarantees of Medicaid funds to pay medical bills for the poor. The GOP Senate majority also may include special grants to areas hard hit by opioid addiction. <br> Senate Majority Leader<a href="http://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell(R-Ky.) is keeping his caucus on board this night train ride by promising bright days ahead. The dawn will bring tax reform that will cut taxes for the rich – another promise the GOP wants to keep ahead of the 2018 midterms. But they can only get there once passage of a health care deal is in the rearview mirror. <br> The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page buys into the McConnell strategy. It contends the big players know what is in the Senate bill. Also, the paper views Democrats as insincere on the grounds that nothing will please liberal critics except renewal of ObamaCare. <br> Let’s see if the GOP can put a plan before the public that provides medical insurance to more people than ObamaCare and lowers premiums; that offers protections for people with pre-existing conditions; that pays bills for mental health, maternity and drug problems; that does away with yearly and lifetime caps on spending; and that protects young people from being prematurely pushed off of their parents’ plans. <br> Noticeably not on board are female GOP senators, including the most senior Republican woman in the Senate,<a href="http://thehill.com/people/susan-collins" target="_blank">Susan Collinsof Maine, who has a background as a state insurance regulator. Also excluded was South Carolina Sen.<a href="http://thehill.com/people/tim-scott" target="_blank">Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the upper chamber, who made his fortune as an insurance executive in the Palmetto State. <br> Polls show the public consistently rejecting the House plan. A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month found 62 percent of voters disapprove of the House bill while just 17 percent approve of it. <br> Meanwhile, Democrats are rushing into the town square in advance of the 2018 elections pointing to rising support for ObamaCare. And they are damning the Republicans with charges of hypocrisy. <br> “Look at how this bill was written,”<a href="http://thehill.com/people/john-boehner" target="_blank">Boehnerfumed. “Can you say it was done openly, with transparency and accountability, without backroom deals struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell, no you can’t! Have you read the bill? …Hell, no you haven’t! ...Shame on this body!” <br> Even if the Senate bill gets 50 votes once the deal is public, it will still have to survive a conference committee with the House Freedom Caucus hardliners. 
 Ever since Republican Sen. Rand Paulsaid hewas blindsided and seriously injured byhisneighbor while mowing the lawn of his home in Kentucky on Nov. 3, media speculation has abounded as to what sparked the attack. Some of it has been quite nasty. <br> Paul’s neighbor, Rene Boucher, has been charged with misdemeanor assault and has pleaded not guilty. <br> I sat down with the senator at his office in Washington this week for his first exclusive interview since being attacked. I gave him a chance to set the record straight about what happened, why it happened and how he is recovering. <br> Nevertheless, I couldn't help but notice that the senator – who is also a physician – did not in any way draw attention to his obvious pain, discomfort or injury. He is tough and does notwant sympathy. <br> What Paul did emphasize was the detail of what it takes to overcome an injury like the one he suffered. He also showed me a dexterity of thinking that enables him to range from discussing a complex injury as a doctor to discussing taxes as a senator. <br> “I think people see someone on TV andtheythinkyou are not real, that youdon’t deserveany sort ofcompassionand that maybe you don’t hurt like a normal person,” Paul told me. “I think my wife said it best when she saidI sort ofgot assaulted twice, you know,once in my yard somebody attacked me from behind and then themedia, who thought it wassort offunny or gleeful, orthatmaybe I deserved it somehow.” <br> “I was working in my yard withmyear muffson, you know,to protectmyhearing from the mower,” Paul said. “AndIgot off the mower facing downhill and the attacker came running full blown. I never saw him, never had a conversation.In fact,the weird thing is Ihaven’t talked to him in 10 years.” <br> The senator explained to me the nature of his injury. <br> Paul continued: “You can run pretty fast down a hill. He speared me in the back,and theyeitherarebroken (ribs) then or as I hit the ground, his shoulder probably plowed into meas I hit the ground. But it was on impact,theinitial impact, or as we probably went through the air 10 to 12 feet, and then hit the ground againandso it happened withthe initialimpact,but it wasfromtheforce of his head and shoulderssort ofspearing me in the back.” <br> I asked Paul if he knew what was going on in his neighbor’s mind. He replied: “I didn’t beforethe attack because we had no conversation. After my ribs were broken,thenhe said things to me totry toindicatewhyhe was unhappy.” <br> There has been speculation, Paul said, that he was attacked in a dispute over yard clippings, but he dismissed that. Paul said he doesn’t know if the attack was motivated by hatred of President Trump, hatred of the senator, or because the attacker was angry at the senator for opposing ObamaCare. Or, maybe, there was something about the yard that motivated him. <br> How badly was he hurt? <br> Paul added: “Iknew Icouldn’t lift my hands over my head to take my shirt off, andsoI knew something had happened. I didn’t know how bad it was untiltheX-rays came back. It was also one of those things where the initial pain, the initial shortness of breath,wasn’t the full extent oftheinjury.” <br> What happened with the pneumonia? <br> However on the plane ride home, while on ibuprofen, his fever hit 102.6 and he says he realized it was time to get treatment. Paul says hegot pneumonia in the area with the bruising of the lung, but is now on the mend. <br> How long to completely heal? <br> Message to America 
 With all the media focus on Russian investigations, tax reform, attempts to repeal and replace ObamaCare and President's Trump bold budget, it would be easy to overlook the impressive progress being made on the unglamorous but crucial area of liberating the U.S. economy from suffocating regulations – another form of taxation. <br> Experts believe these rules cost the American people up to $2 trillion a year. Now the ball of sensible deregulation is advancing, a stunning change from the Obama administration where hardly a day went by without some new anti-business mandate being promulgated. <br> A number of Obama anti-growth rules have been repealed through the Congressional Review Act. <br> Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., recently asked the right question in a hearing on improving our infrastructure: “Can performance-based regulations be more effective than command-and-control regulations in achieving safety goals while imposing less of a burden on industry?” <br> The answer, of course, is yes and there is now a bill before Congress that would codify this common sense approach, The Revamping American Infrastructure Act of 2017. The proposed legislation would call on federal bureaucrats to “identify those regulations, guidance and policies that in current form establish prescriptive requirements for regulated entities; and are able to be replaced, consistent with Federal law, with outcome-based performance standards.” <br> Thanks to deregulation in 1980, the industry morphed from an inefficient, loss-ridden system into the finest, most efficient in the world. Nonetheless, the industry is still weighed down unnecessarily by countless, archaic operational mandates. It is ready to deploy new technologies for inspections such as drones, trackside detection systems and sophisticated X-ray machines that would provide crucial information in real time. Yet the industry must abide by a rigid set of procedures established by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) that seems to think the world is still dominated by those legendary steam engines of yore. <br> This dinosaur mentality has begotten a rule mandating current crew sizes in perpetuity. The head of the Association of American Railroads points out that this is how government seeks to address a problem, in this case “accidents caused by human error by dictating to the railroads a specific approach: use of two-person crews. [Yet] it does so without any data or analysis to support the notion that the second person in the cab will actually result in a reduction in human-error accidents--which was, after all, the goal.” <br> We had mentioned the EPA's jihad against fossil fuels. One example is its so-called haze rule that it issued during the Obama administration, ostensibly to improve visibility. Trouble was, objective observers find it would do next to nothing to achieve that goal. What it would do, however, would be to force the closure of several coal-fired power plants and kill numerous jobs. 
 President Trump’s economic team paints a rosier picture of what his policies can accomplish than the economics profession is willing to endorse. <br> Trump’s team is formulating<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-aims-to-balance-budget-with-deep-cuts-bullish-growth-projections-1495155600" target="_blank">budget and tax proposals that project 3 percent annual growth, while the number crunchers at the<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52370" target="_blank">Congressional Budget Office estimate only 1.9 percent. <br> Thanks to baby boomer retirements and a declining birth rate, the prime working age population — those aged 25 to 65 — is not likely to grow even 1 percent annually — even with<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/immigration-reform-could-be-the-win-that-trump-and-the-economy-need-2017-03-27" target="_blank">well-conceived, needs-based immigration reformsand changes in entitlement programs that encourage more adults to work. <br> There’s no doubt that cutting corporate and personal income taxes and spending more on roads and highways could give the economy a Keynesian jolt and raise growth above 3 percent for a few quarters. But Trump’s policy reforms are likely to be watered down by political infighting. <br> The prospects that those proposals will carry long-term punch for productivity and growth are limited by congressional politics and, perhaps more fundamentally, by conditions limiting the efficacy of pushing up investment through tax cuts. <br> Similarly, using private money to improve roads and bridges has some potential<u>,but<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/immigration-reform-could-be-the-win-that-trump-and-the-economy-need-2017-03-27" target="_blank">many improvements will likely require unpopular new taxes and user fees. Trump’s promise to get tough on trade faces strong opposition even among skeptics inside his own White House. <br> These days, they say, important new technologies — game machines and handheld devices that permit comparison shopping while roaming the aisles at Target — do more to entertain and enhance our leisure time than boost productivity. <br> Our models look at recent trends, cast them in concrete and then extrapolate into the future. They can’t accurately predict GDP growth two or three quarters from now, never mind tell us much about how emerging innovations will change work and the broader contours of the economy one or several decades into the future. <br> In the decades ahead,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-machines-think-and-feel-1458311760" target="_blank">machines that can feel and think<u> — replacing the tactile advantages of the human hand and genuinely solving tough problems, as opposed to merely accelerating the searching and processing of information — will boost productivity in ways we can hardly fathom. 
 Most presidents’ budgets are “dead on arrival” in Congress. It happened to Obama and Bush, and there are those who hope it happens to President Donald Trump. <br> That would be a huge mistake. <br> Every GOP Member of Congress ran on limiting the size and scope of government, and bemoaning the ever-increasing national debt and the impact it will have on our children’s economic future must be part of Republican candidate training schools. <br> Our nation must get our fiscal house in order now, or else we may never have another opportunity, and President Trump has provided a pathway to bring our nation back from the brink of insolvency. The GOP Congress should work closely with him to bring their joint visions of our nation’s economic priorities into law. <br> The hard fact is that the past decade’s $10 trillion in deficit spending has produced the worst economic growth as measured by Gross Domestic Product in our nation’s history. You read that right, in the past decade our nation’s economy grew slower than even during the Great Depression. This stagnant, new normal, low-growth economy is leaving millions of working age people behind who have given up even trying to participate, and has led to a malaise where many doubt that the American dream is attainable. <br> The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney described this shift in government spending focus in an on-the-record conference call Monday as, “looking through the lens of the taxpayer.” <br> Border security, including funding the wall on the southern border, and national defense spending are also increased so that our nation can be secure allowing the economy to grow. And the President demonstrates his commitment to veterans by upping dollars to the Department of Veterans Affairs coupled with a renewed commitment to wring out corruption and incompetency from the system. Mulvaney specifically focused on the “taxpayer lens” test when mentioning the President’s commitment to ensure that disabled veterans get the assistance they need. <br> It is imperative that the GOP Congress work with the President using this budget as a guidepost, and together create a coherent spending plan which meets their joint priorities. After that agreement is reached, they should join shields and bring Senate Democrats into the negotiations, making necessary compromises to get Democratic votes without sacrificing GOP spending priorities. <br> The President and OMB Director Mulvaney have crafted a remarkable starting point for this process, and the GOP Congress needs to embrace it and work with them to create a spending plan that restores America’s economic growth and sets the stage for the renewal of hope for millions of Americans who believe that opportunity has been outsourced overseas. 
 Environmentalists should be pleased with Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention Thursday night, because it was largely recycled talking points we have heard for decades. <br> First there was the charge that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump cannot be trusted with the nuclear codes. The same was said about Ronald Reagan in 1980. Democrats called him a cowboy who might blow up the world. Instead, he rebuilt America's military, as Trump has promised to do, and helped bring down the Soviet Union. Can Hillary be trusted with classified documents? <br> Hillary Clinton's proposals will add hugely to the debt, now approaching $20 trillion. But wait. She will pay for all this new stuff by taxing those obscenely wealthy Wall Street people, who paid her and her husband millions to speak to them. No one knows what about. She won't release the transcripts. <br> -- Increasing income taxes by $350 billion in the form of a 28 percent cap on itemized deductions. <br> -- There's the euphemistically named fairness tax of $400 billion she says would restore basic fairness to our tax code and an increase in the death tax. Real fairness would eliminate the undecipherable tax code and replace it with a fair tax, but Democrats would never go for that. <br> To my surprise, many in the mainstream media, who couldn't stop talking about the historical significance of the first woman nominated for president by a major political party, thought her speech fell flat. Robert Draper of The New York Times tweeted: Not well written, not well delivered. Tom Bevan of Real Clear Politics tweeted: Clinton is giving the eighth best speech of the convention. Ben Dreyfuss of the far-left magazine, Mother Jones, tweeted: This speech isn't great. <br> Polls increasingly indicate a majority of voters want real change this time around. More people are being drawn to Trump's message that the political system is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is crooked. <br> Donald Trump also suffers from high negatives, but because of Hillary Clinton's thin record of accomplishment she will have to tear down Trump because as Kimberley Strassel concludes in her Wall Street Journal column, It's Hillary against Hillary. This November is about whether Americans can look at 40 years of Clinton chicanery and nearly a decade of broken Obama promises, and still pull the lever for her. 
 Just over one hundred days into a new administration, what are American businesses thinking? What do they need to succeed? What public policies will help them spur greater economic growth? <br> One of the U.S. Chamber’s top priorities is to listen to Main Street businesses—and make sure Washington listens to them as well. In conjunction with our state and local partners, the U.S. Chamber invited hundreds of businesses to share their ideas on how to boost economic growth in a series of meetings across the country. <br> In our discussions with these Main Street businesses, there were five key takeaways: <br> Second, despite their renewed optimism, businesses tell us tax and regulatory burdens impede their growth and success. A business owner in Michigan said: “There will always be regulation, but it doesn’t have to be so burdensome. There will always be taxes, but they don’t have to be so punitive. Give us an opportunity to grow our business and let us be able to reinvest and hire people.” <br> Third, finding qualified workers is the single biggest challenge facing business. We are a nation of people without jobs and jobs without people. Businesses can’t find workers with the proper education and skills to fill openings. This is an anchor on their growth and is undermining our economy. <br> Fourth, businesspeople have a true passion for our free enterprise system. Many argued that they never would have been able to go into business, fail, try again, and succeed beyond their expectations under any other system. And all agreed that free enterprise was not only about helping yourself, but ultimately helping others. <br> Fifth, businesses expect Washington to produce results, and are ready to engage with political leaders to get things done. There was little tolerance for gridlock and gamesmanship. Most businesspeople described themselves as practical, nonpartisan, and solution-oriented—and they expect more of that in the nation’s capital. <br> There was strong and united support among the businesses we talked to for a public policy agenda to spur economic growth. It’s main elements include: enacting regulatory relief and regulatory reform; producing more American energy; making America’s infrastructure the best in the world; reforming our tax, legal, and immigration systems; selling more American goods and services abroad; improving education and training; expanding access to capital, especially to smaller companies; and renewing our country’s culture of innovation. 
 GOP members of the House finally climbed aboard the Trump Train. <br> It’s about time. <br> It wasn’t easy, but as Joe Biden might say, “This is a big f—ing deal!” <br> Voters were incredulous that after seven years of railing about the deficiencies of ObamaCare, Republicans didn’t have a shared vision for what should replace it. <br> The inability to muster votes on the first bill exposed long-simmering disputes within the Republican party – disputes barely muted by Trump’s astonishing victory in November. <br> Trump wheedled and cajoled, invited objectors from across the political spectrum in for an Oval Office chat, encouraged compromises and won over recalcitrant members of his own party. This is what we expect from Trump; this is the Art of the Deal. <br> Not only is the vote a win for health care reform; it is also a win for tax reform. The repeal of the taxes that supported the Affordable Care Act will save Americans one trillion dollars over the coming decade. That savings makes further tax cuts much easier to pass, since the reduced rates will be applied to a lower tax base. As the GOP struggles to produce a tax bill resulting in revenue neutrality, that trillion will loom large. <br> Democrats cleverly put the GOP on the defensive early on in this fight, portraying President Obama’s legacy plan as the Holy Grail of health care solutions. Even as it continues to fail across the country. <br> The central failure of ObamaCare is that it does not allow insurers to charge more for customers that will require higher expenditures. Women, for instance, who require higher medical expenditures, pay the same as men under ObamaCare. Also, people with so-called “pre-existing conditions” pay the same as all others. Simply put, this is not insurance, it is welfare. <br> The vote comes before the Congressional Budget Office has had a chance to score it. Democrats will jump on the eventual CBO report, which will most likely project that some people will lose coverage. The GOP bill will be portrayed by Democrats as heartless and mean-spirited. <br> Or how many parts of the country no longer have an insurance exchange available. <br> ObamaCare is simply not working; it is indefensible. <br> Nancy Pelosi has accused Republicans of wanting to destroy health care and take protections away from millions., all the while providing massive tax breaks for plutocrats. <br> That’s what they were elected to do. 
 Will Donald Trump be re-elected in 2020? <br> I know this because I follow the betting odds at ElectionBettingOdds.com. <br> But betting odds are usually right. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that if the bettors gave a candidate, say, a 65 percent chance to win, and he lost, bettors were wrong. But remember, 65 percent means bettors also thought there was a 35 percent chance that candidate would lose. <br> Bettors accurately picked Oscar winners, American Idol winners and most important elections. ElectionBettingOdds.com named VP picks Mike Pence and Tim Kaine a week before they were picked. <br> Last week, right before France's election, reporters claimed that the terrorism in France would help elect Marine Le Pen. Saturday, Fox News headlined: Le Pen sees Trump-like boost. <br> The New York Times hyped Jean-Luc Melenchon, France's socialist candidate (of course), claiming he was gaining steam. But betters weren't fooled. They gave Melenchon just a 5 percent chance. <br> I should explain: ElectionBettingOdds.com is a website my TV producer and I created. He takes the odds from legal betting markets, mostly from the biggest and most reliable one, Betfair (based in the U.K.). Our site converts Betfair's complex formulae to percentages that are easy to understand. <br> Actually, you Americans can't make that bet, because restrictive U.S. anti-gambling regulations prevent Betfair from dealing with Americans. <br> They do offer other interesting bets, however: <br> Tax reform fares better: There's a 50 percent chance individual income taxes will be cut. <br> None comes close to Trump in the odds. Pence is in second place, with just a 9 percent chance. Pence probably leads other Republicans because many bettors don't think Trump will complete one term. If Trump quits, Pence would have the incumbent's advantage. Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz are the next Republicans, but both are below 3 percent. <br> Of course, it's early. We should be skeptical of predictions of events four years in advance. But when I want the most accurate possible clues about the future, I turn to ElectionBettingOdds.com. <br> We'd have more valuable predictions if nervous U.S. lawmakers would just legalize political prediction markets. Unfortunately, they've been too close-minded to do that. 
 I’m a Hillary Clinton fangirl and I feel no shame. <br> Does that mean I don’t see her faults? Of course not. <br> I could go on and I could certainly also discuss the bizarre twists that undoubtedly hurt Clinton on November 8th. They include, but are not limited to, the role of FBI Director James Comey, Russian interference, Anthony Weiner’s sexting scandal, an overblown server scandal and viral rightwing media (I’m looking at you “performance artist” Alex Jones) that spread lies and disinformation about Clinton. <br> Soon President Donald Trump will have been in office for 100 days and with very little to show for it. <br> The American Health Care Act crashed and burned in spectacular fashion. Majority of the blame rests on Paul Ryan’s shoulders as he let his ego get ahead of good policy, public sentiment and the numbers. What good is a Speaker who can’t deliver his caucus? President Trump learned the hard way that there are actually principled conservatives (shocked this Democrat, too!) <br> And while we’re on the subject, there is no wall. <br> I do wish he would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That is what we have the White House for, GOP Senator Joni Ernst commented. We would love to see more of those State Department visits in Washington D.C. I have not spoken to him about the Florida issue yet, but that is something I think has been bothering not just me, but I think other members of our caucus.” That’s right, the guy who criticized President Obama for nonstop golfing can’t stop golfing – on our dime. His party is noticing. <br> Then there’s the flip flopping. On NATO, on the Fed, on intervention, on Chinese currency manipulation. And that was just one day! <br> Moreover, I’ll spare you a diatribe on rolling back worker and environmental protections – you know what I’m thinking. <br> So candidate Trump sold America a bad bill of goods and they bought it. Now we’re getting a bad bill of goods from President Trump. Clinton surely had something to do with that and we’ll continue re-hashing how it all went so wrong until the end of time (or at least the next four years). <br> I remember her message every time President Trump does something that makes my jaw hit the floor. It’s going to take us all working together. That starts with the occupant of the highest office in the world and trickles down to each and every one of us. 
 Conservatives wonder: what the heck is Gary Cohn doing in the Trump White House? Cohn, a life-long Democrat and latecomer to the Trump train, is White House Economic Council Director. The former president of Goldman Sachs is reportedly ascendant, while Steve Bannon, Peter Navarro and Stephen Miller see their stars fading. This is not good news for Trump supporters, or for the GOP. <br> His backers didn’t care that Trump knew little about policy or Washington; he was in a sense an empty vessel when it came to translating common sense ideas into legislation and regulations. Now, though, they see that vessel being filled in part by individuals who do not share their views. One of those is Gary Cohn, who has emerged as a powerful but discordant voice. <br> When Gary Cohn recently lofted the possibility of bringing back Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that allowed big banks to engage in investment banking, Senator Elizabeth Warren was reportedly giddy with joy. The law, which was repealed by Bill Clinton in 1999, is viewed by progressives as having helped cause the financial crisis. Leaving a meeting in which Cohn mused about reinstating the bill, Warren reportedly said to an aide, “Has the whole world gone mad? Am I on the same page as a former Goldman executive? My entire worldview has been shattered.” <br> It is worth noting that while reinstituting Glass-Steagall would be problematic for all the leading financial institutions, it would hurt Goldman much less that the big banks who are its major competitors. <br> Cohn is also reportedly a free-trade advocate, and has appointed Andrew Quinn to the Economic Council as Special Assistant to the President for International Trade. Quinn was one of the lead negotiators of the multi-national TPP trade pact that Trump savaged on the campaign trail and has since junked. How will Quinn work to revise our trade commitments and revise NAFTA? <br> It is also true that there are other sound voices on economic policy within the administration. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is nobody’s fool, and will support an aggressive U.S. trade posture. Though conservatives have reservations about Steve Mnuchin, they applaud some of his picks, like economist David Malpass for international affairs and Drew Maloney for legislative. Mnuchin’s choice of major Hillary fundraiser Craig Phillips to oversee financial regulation, is less popular. <br> It is early days, but ongoing power struggles could well determine the success of the Trump presidency. He needs to remember who put him in office, and who he will rely on to keep him there. It wasn’t Manhattan elites or Democrats, it was people who are counting on him to cut taxes, bring back jobs, dismantle our stifling red tape, and rein in illegal immigration. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed Trump losing ground with exactly the people who elected him – Republicans, white voters and men. And guess what, he isn’t making up for those losses with newly affectionate Democrats. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 Tax-cutting fever is in the air again and many of Washington’s talking heads are citing the tax policy of Ronald Reagan but with many of them getting the Gipper wrong. Typical. For Reagan, it just wasn’t about the economy or jobs but about the more deeply important expression of the assignment of power. At one point in 1981, Reagan told a group of conservatives his belief that cutting taxes was really about reordering man’s relationship to the state. Reagan, the libertarian, Reagan, who embraced Federalism, saw Washington as an illicit power grabber and wanted to re-address the imbalance. He wanted to take power away from the corrupt government and give it back to the citizenry. <br> “The Era of Reagan” or “The Age of Reagan” sounds sweeping, epic, and generational. And it was. And it is. It sounds like a time similar to the Pax Augusta of Ancient Rome, spanning centuries of peace and prosperity. The Era of Reagan did not last three hundred years, but still it was impressive, world altering and many believe we are still living in the shadow of the 40th president. After all, who is more cited? Obama is gone and forgotten, as are the Bushes. Reagan never compared himself to other presidents but all succeeding presidents have compared themselves to him. <br> One of this plethora of ways America prospered under the Gipper was through massive tax cuts and the economy. Reagan was not a late comer to tax cuts, having returned to California’s taxpayers the largest rebate in years, $500 million, in 1970. But the GOP was pretty much the green eyeshade party in those days. Even more ironic, during Nixon’s first term, Senators Walter Mondale and Ted Kennedy proposed huge cuts in personal taxes as a means of jumpstarting the economy, but the Nixon Administration objected, advocating instead massive federal spending as a means restarting the languishing economy. <br> But supply-side economics was something else, and it was Dr. Arthur Laffer, Jude Wanniski of the Wall Street Journal, and conservative activist Jeff Bell who first introduced the radical (and hugely successful) economic theory to Governor Reagan (though they later flirted with the possible 1980 candidacy of Jack Kemp), who first talked it up in September of 1976 in a radio address. <br> Reagan defeated Carter in November of 1980 in one of the biggest landslides in presidential history. His philosophy of individualism, smaller federal government, and American optimism reverberated with a Carter “malaise” pessimistic public. Famed journalist Hedrick Smith of the New York Times said only four months after Reagan took office that he “has managed to tap and nurture a budding mood of national self-confidence even before his major policies have had enough time to achieve real practical impact or to be properly tested.” <br> Both his ’81 and ’86 Tax Acts made it fairer for the American worker, closing loopholes and simplifying the tax bracket. The Economic Recovery and Tax Act of 1981, called Kemp-Roth, reduced income tax rates by 25 percent, and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 significantly lowered tax rates. On the economy, the effects in only eight years were significant from the recession during Carter’s run. By 1988, the GDP went from a negative growth to an astonishing 4.1 percent. Annually, the average GDP during the Reagan years was 3.5 percent. Inflation dropped by nearly 10 percent. “It was the equivalent of adding the West German economy to the U.S. one,” wrote Kyle Smith in Forbes in 2014. Burton Yale Pines at the Heritage Foundation, in the spring of 1988, had a much more poignant and contemporary opinion, writing that “we have had the longest period of economic growth in peacetime in American history-probably world history. A record number of new American businesses have been created; a record number of new jobs have been created (and, in fact, experts now worry about a labor shortage in America); we are producing more new products and new ideas and are doing so more efficiently than at any time in our history.” <br> The economy spiked so much, that there was a net increase of about 21 million more jobs in eight years. Labor participation went from 63.9 percent in January 1981 to a whopping 66.5 percent in January 1989. The median income of a family grew by $4,000, from $37,868 in 1981 to $42,049 in 1989. By comparison, it did not grow at all during Carter’s administration, and income actually shrunk during Bush 41’s years. 
 President Reagan left us with many useful lessons in his 1989 farewell address. <br> But today, a different passage from his speech caused me to rethink the current approach to tax reform. <br> Reading this, I was struck with a single thought: If eight years from now, President Trump can point to 19 million (or more) new jobs, Americans – and others around the world – will regard his presidency as a success. <br> So, for the Trump administration, Republicans should stop saying we want to reform the tax system. Reforming will not create jobs on its own. We want to cut taxes and reform the system. <br> But there are six more steps lawmakers can take to create space for tax cuts that will drive job creation. <br> Consider the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which jumped to 125.6 points this month – the highest confidence has been 17 years. The Conference Board CEO Business Conditions Survey increased from 17 points last quarter to 60 points this quarter. The CEO Short Term Forecast hiked from 25 points to 60 points, while General CEO Confidence jumped from 50 points to 65 points. <br> Second, unused federal assets should be leased or sold. This will generate non-tax revenue which could offset the cost of some of the tax cuts. Aggressive leasing of oil, gas and mineral rights combined with selling federal housing and office stock currently being mismanaged could generate billions to support tax cuts. <br> Fourth, creating pro-American trade policies will clearly have positive impact on growth. This growth might not be huge statistically, but even an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent can yield billions over a decade that could be leveraged for tax cuts. <br> Sixth, we should have a bias for pro-growth tax reforms that have compounding, revenue generating effects. Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal for a border transfer tax will increase American manufacturing jobs. It will also generate revenue paid for by foreign importers. Because we are still the world's largest economy, the Ryan border transfer tax will incentivize foreign manufacturers to open factories in America. The result will be even more economic growth and future government revenue to pay for tax cuts. 
 WASHINGTON </span>For the first time since Election Day, President Obama is on the defensive. That's because on March 1, automatic spending cuts (sequestration) go into effect -- $1.2 trillion over 10 years, half from domestic (discretionary) programs, half from defense. <br> It backfired. The Republicans have offered no concessions. Obama's bluff is being called and he's the desperate party. He abhors the domestic cuts. And as commander in chief he must worry about indiscriminate Pentagon cuts that his own defense secretary calls catastrophic. <br> What should the Republicans do? Nothing. <br> Republicans should explain -- message No. 1 -- that in the fiscal-cliff deal the president already got major tax hikes with no corresponding spending cuts. Now it is time for a nation that is $16 trillion in debt to cut spending. That's balance. <br> If they do nothing, the $1.2 trillion in cuts go into effect. This is the one time Republicans can get cuts under an administration that has no intent of cutting anything. Get them while you can. <br> Naturally, the Democratic Senate, which hasn't passed a budget since before the iPad, has done nothing. Nor has the president -- until his Tuesday plea. <br> Otherwise, Mr. President, there is nothing to discuss. Your sequester -- Republicans need to reiterate that the sequester was the president's idea in the first place -- will go ahead. <br> It's not. Tax reform, as defined even by the White House's own webpage on the subject, <b>begins</i> with lowering tax rates. It then makes up the lost revenue by closing loopholes. <br> Obama has zero interest in lowering tax rates. He just got through raising them at the fiscal cliff and has made perfectly clear ever since that he fully intends to keep raising taxes. His only interest in eliminating loopholes is to raise more cash for the Treasury -- not to use them to lower rates. <br> Hence Republican message No. 3: The sequester is one thing, real tax reform quite another. The sequester is for cutting. The only question is whether it will be done automatically and indiscriminately -- or whether the president will offer an alternative set of cuts. <br> The country needs tax reform. But first it needs to rein in out-of-control spending. To succeed in doing that, Republicans must remain united under one demand: cuts with no taxes -- or we will let the sequester go into effect. <br> Any time, any place. Geneva, perhaps? The skiing is good. Skeet shooting too. 
 This is the truth: the Freedom Caucus has breathed new life into the demolished Democratic Party. <br> For eight years Democrats have accused Republicans of being the “Party of No”, only capable of obstruction and posturing but not of governing. In defeating the efforts of Paul Ryan, Mike Pence, Tom Price and Donald Trump to dump ObamaCare and replace it with a slimmed-down, more intelligent and flexible program, they have given Democrats incalculable ammunition to make that case. <br> Now that they actually have a chance to <b>do </i>something meaningful – repeal the taxes and fees that are the undercarriage of the Affordable Care Act – they can’t make it to the finish line. <br> Number One: Conservatives are not in the majority in the United States. If they were, Evan McMullin would be president. <br> Number Three: Crafting a compromise health care bill that will safeguard popular provisions that President Trump vowed to keep, like protections for those with preexisting conditions or the ability to keep children up to the age of 26 on their parent’s insurance, is not easy. <br> The Senate, too, will have a chance to weigh in. <br> The Freedom Caucus and others opposing the ACA must accept that the push for this bill is bigger than their principles and it is bigger than health care. <br> The United States has entered a danger zone, where trust in our political leaders and our institutions has plummeted. The only way out is for President Trump to follow through on the promises he made to voters, promises which will put the country back on track. <br> Since other measures, and most especially tax reform, are backed up behind the ACA, it is quite possible that the reckless behavior of the Freedom Caucus will derail the Trump train. <br> They are hopeful that Obama’s progressive agenda will be swept aside, allowing the country to return to policies buttressed by common sense and a common purpose. That agenda hangs by a thread. <br> That said, they are not the voice of the nation or even of the Republican Party; what they want is unrealistic. It is not politically possible to repeal ObamaCare and not put something in its place. Imagine the confusion and anxiety; real people will suffer, and for what? Only 20 percent of the country wants ObamaCare repealed, according to a recent poll. This is not a popular position. <br> The Freedom Caucus needs to get on board – now. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 President Trump says he wants to “drain the swamp.” His strategist Stephen Bannon calls for “deconstructing the administrative state.” They face fierce opposition. But their biggest obstacle may end up being of their own making. There are nearly 2,000 political vacancies within the Trump administration, most of which did not require Senate confirmation, according to the tracking service Leadership Directories. <br> The White House won’t respond to inquiries about its Presidential Personnel Office, and there may be a good reason. It is headed by John DeStefano, who served as former House Speaker John Boehner’s political director and senior adviser. At age 38 his only major personnel experience has been advising newly elected 2010 Tea Party members on who to hire. <br> The bottleneck inside the Trump White House has gotten so bad that some jobs such as who should serve as general counsels in agencies are being effectively handled by the White House Counsel’s office. <br> While admirable on some level, in practice such a stance amounts to being penny wise and pound foolish. The Washington Examiner reports that “the White House has not submitted any names to fill the 10 jobs below Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin that will require confirmation. There’s no way President Trump can fulfill his promise to improve veterans’ health care without those officials. <br> “I wish I had more of my staff on board,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions plaintively said Thursday, as he recused himself from the Russia probe. <br> As Kori Schake, a research fellow in government management at the conservative Hoover Institution, told the Washington Post: “The president risks looking like he appointed an admirable Cabinet he intends to make ineffective by denying them staff.” <br> I don't know yet, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, told the Associated Press on Wednesday when asked about Perdue's paperwork. I wish to hell I did. We need a champion for agriculture, we need him on board. <br> “Personnel are policy, and if you don’t have key personnel and enough of them the home team of Washington bureaucrats will wear you down and win every time,” a key Trump appointee awaiting confirmation told me. <br> “If something is broken, you fix it,” Donald Trump frequently said on the campaign trail. <br> If President Trump wants to have the last laugh on his critics, again, he needs to address an appointments process that is clogged, if not downright broken. 
 Tuesday night, with his speech before a joint session of Congress, President Trump raised the stakes, making obstructionist Democrats look foolish at best – at worst, unpatriotic. <br> Like schoolyard bullies, they have called the president names and insulted his family. They have ridiculed his policies and platform, and worked to undermine his legitimacy. <br> Democrats have dug deep trenches of petty defiance, even as polls show that such moves are unpopular with voters. A poll by Harvard-Harris ten days ago showed that 73 percent of Americans want Democrats to work with Trump. <br> Is Chuck Schumer listening? Is Nancy Pelosi or Tom Perez, the new head of the DNC? Not on your life. <br> The hypocrisy of their stance is breathtaking. After eight years of preaching the costs of GOP obstructionism, they now embrace even more absolute resistance. Even on policies they presumably embrace, such as spending on infrastructure, they have cut themselves adrift. <br> In 2016 Union workers swung to Trump in greater numbers than for any Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan; they will stick with him if they see him jawboning corporate CEOs to bring jobs home and promulgating tax policy intended to boost U.S. production. They applauded him walking away from the TPP, and believe he’ll lead the fight for fairer trade pacts. They like that he puts America first. <br> President Obama talked in eloquent and grandiose terms about Hope and Change, but neither generated the former nor produced the latter. <br> Bloomberg reported just a day ago that consumer confidence leaped “unexpectedly” in February to the highest level since 2001, a 15-year high. Unexpectedly to Bloomberg maybe, but not to Trump supporters, who see him following through on his campaign promises and walking away from the boneheaded progressive agenda of President Obama. Very few people seem to think that the federal government’s highest priority should be dictating which restrooms transgender children should occupy. <br> It also reminded Republicans in Congress that Trump is a power to be reckoned with. He wants to carry through on his promises of tax reform and ObamaCare replacement. If Congress dithers, and tries to score political points by resisting these measures, they will suffer for it in 2018. The country wants action, and has given the GOP all the tools necessary to comply. <br> Trump cannot be laughed off; he isn’t going to disappear, as some loons on the Left have predicted. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 “We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.”</i> <br> But what exactly is the country’s most urgent economic challenge? Scanning the headlines, one might think the answer is tackling the negative impacts of foreign trade, reversing the decline of American manufacturing, or slowing the rapid pace of technological change. <br> Put more simply: Americans are reeling from the negative effects of<i>too littleeconomic change, not too much. This low-dynamism era is quietly calcifying our economy, resulting in less competition, widening inequality, and fewer pathways to the American Dream. <br> Enter the Great Recession, which turned what had been a slow startup decline into an accelerated collapse. For the first time on record, the rate of business formation dropped below the rate of business closures. Even after years of economic recovery, the startup rate has barely budged from its record low. The news gets worse when it comes to geographic mobility and labor turnover rates–two important measures of dynamism that demonstrate the extent to which workers can access better opportunities. Both have fallen to<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__eig.org_dynamism-23workersd=DwMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=TzD3VbQ-L0ieXytmJoeKebFcbDoWchds3FDjqzodUSks=q_ijWQyi3bh4eBaLdfNC-lPhLC3HFMG0ejz5RS4_Sace=" target="_blank">historic lows. <br> Indeed, the recession ushered in a troubling new normal: most metro areas now see more businesses close than open every year, reversing decades of nearly universal expansion. As a result, an economy that for decades added an average of over 100,000 firms per year instead had 182,000<i>fewerfirms in 2014 than in 2007, even though GDP increased by $1.1 trillion over that period. <br> The low-churn, startup-less recovery has been quite good for one constituency: incumbent big businesses. Indeed, facing less competition, large older firms (think Carrier, Toyota, and Boeing) are enjoying something of a golden age: they have never been more profitable, more dominant within their industries, or responsible for a larger share of the U.S. workforce. <br> Restoring dynamism will require presidential leadership across a broad set of policy areas. Every proposalfrom tax reform, to infrastructure, to regulatory overhaulshould be evaluated through the lens of dynamism. Will it increase mobility for workers and reduce geographic inequality? Will it foster competition? Will it improve access to capital for entrepreneurs? 
 On Tuesday Pfizer Inc., one of America's iconic pharmaceutical companies, announced that it is dropping it's bid to merge with Dublin-based Allergan. <br> Pfizer must now pay up to $400 million to Allergan for expenses associated with the cancelled wedding. Shareholders in both companies are the big losers. So are patients hoping for new miracle cures for diseases. <br> Pfizer was only one of the latest major American company that had announced it is packing up and moving to a foreign country because of lower tax rates in India, Mexico, Canada, Ireland, and almost anywhere else on the globe. First it was Burger King, then Medtronics, and then Pfizer, Johnson Controls and on and on. Can Disney and Mickey Mouse be far behind? <br> Obama complained that these companies are moving to avoid paying their fair share of the taxes. His new inversion rules will only make America less competitive by effectively preventing companies like Pfizer from ever leaving. This only makes it less likely that technology, manufacturing, drug, and financial services company are formed in America to begin with. If you can't ever leave, you don't come in the first place. <br> There was a much simpler and less punitive solution here. ‎ Mr. President: why not just cut the U.S. tax rate to make America tax competitive? Shouldn't it be a wake up call when socialist Sweden and France have lower corporate taxes than we do? <br> Our corporate tax rate is almost 40 percent and many countries in the rest of the world are closer to 20 percent. ‎Every year other nations around the world cut their tax rates some more. Japan was the latest tax cutter. <br> Republicans like Paul Ryan, now the House Speaker, have wanted tax reform for years. ‎ <br> Small businesses saw their highest tax rate rise from 35 to 41 percent under Obama. <br> The best way to stimulate growth is to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 or 20 percent right now. Then let companies bring back the $2 trillion stored in offshore accounts and pay a 5 percent penalty tax. This could raise $100 billion and bring repatriated capital back to the states where the money will be invested by American businesses. <br> Why not do what Reagan and JFK did? Cut tax rates and the businesses and jobs will come back home. 
 Donald Trump’s presidency is only one month old, but already the buzzards are circling. The president cheered supporters by assailing his critics at yesterday’s press conference, but there is little doubt that the Trump White House is struggling to keep its momentum. The drama over Michael Flynn’s departure and the defeat of Labor nominee Pudzer raise concerns over organization and focus, and feed headlines reporting “borderline chaos.” <br> First, some perspective. At this point in his presidency, Bill Clinton’s White House was in disarray. His chief of staff, a lifelong friend named Mack McLarty, a person described by his grade school teacher as Just a real nice boy who grew up into a real nice young man, was way over his head, unable to rein in the bigger-than-life personalities that typically occupy the West Wing. Infighting between the staffs of the president and Hillary was undermining the young administration. Chaos reined. <br> Sound familiar? Woodward also reveals how Clinton staffers leaked damaging information – about each other and the president -- to the press. George Stephanopoulos, one of Clinton’s closest aides, told a reporter that the president was incapable of making decisions, while others took potshots at Hillary’s healthcare initiative, Bill’s “dishonest” budget and so on. <br> What’s different today? Trump faces an extraordinarily hostile media, which Clinton did not. Though some in the press criticized Clinton’s inexperienced apparatchiks, most supported the president’s agenda. They were not out for blood. <br> And, from time to time, he throws gasoline on the smoldering rage ignited by the election. <br> First, it may be that he should take a page from the Clinton playbook and bring in a time-tested barracuda chief of staff (think Rahm Emmanuel). Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax Media, says Priebus is over his head; it’s possible the former RNC Chair is simply too nice a guy to knock heads. It wasn’t until hard-knuckle Leon Panetta became Clinton’s Chief of Staff in July 1994 that the White House got its act together. Given the hostility arrayed against him, Trump can’t wait that long. An ideal candidate would look like Newt Gingrich without the ego, or Chris Christie without the ambition. <br> Third, Mr. Trump needs to erect a speedbump in his Twitter feed. Just one set of eyes, one person who has the authority to say “go” or “no-go” on the 3 am tweets. Trump is engaging, still, in too many petty battles, when there are big ones to be fought. However, he should not shut it down; his tweets have increased in popularity since his inauguration, being “favorited” on average 120,000 times, and retweeted over 40,000 times. Those who are irate over the mainstream media’s treatment of their president are delighted he can address them directly, and they can respond. <br> Finally, Trump should invite John McCain and Lindsay Graham to lunch, and hear them out. Both are respected GOP senior statesmen and they are aligned against the president. Their resistance will give cover to others, and the president needs a united party. Some of it is policy; some is personal. Trump has a big personality; he must win them over. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 <i>Editor's note:</b>The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.
 <b>Editor's note: Dana Perino, co-anchor of The Five on Fox News Channel, recently sat down with radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt to talk with him about his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Way-Conservative-Playbook-Majority/dp/1501172441/" target="_blank">The Fourth Way:The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority.</i> <br> HUGH HEWITT: Early in the campaign I asked President Trump about Iran's Quds Force. He heard --as happens in radio often-- Kurds not Quds. Thus his answer was disconnected to the question. The MSM [mainstream media] cut him zero slack and it sounded like a gotcha question which I always think are counter-productive. He wasn't happy with the exchange, buthe came back on the program a dozen more times, so we got past that. <br> DP: In order to successfully achieve the GOP policy goals Republicans hope to put forth this year, who does the president need as his greatest ally? <br> DP: What do you expect will be the greatest hurdle the president must overcome during his first 100 days in office? <br> DP: How do you think the media will adapt to a Trump presidency? And might President Trump find that the relationship with the press can be mutually beneficial to reporters doing their jobs and a president wanting to advance an agenda? <br> Selling the MSM on unified GOP initiatives is going to fall on the Speaker. <br> HH: People live in homes that they can afford because of the mortgage interest deduction, in states where the tax burden is enormous --but deductible-- and deeply involved in their churches to which they make tax deductible contributions. It is political suicide to tamper with much less eliminate any of the big three deductions. I hope the GOP doesn't love the theory of tax reform more than the reality of voters' lives. <br> HH: I pitched this book to Simon Schuster the day after the election. I thought President Trump would lose --badly. But the stunning result opened up an opportunity to realign politics, one that was obvious to me. <br> DP: What audience do you recommend this book to most and what do you hope the audience learns from it? 
 As Donald Trump prepares to assume the Presidency, Republican friends have asked moderate Democrats like me why we don’t join the GOP. After all, the party of Lincoln dominates state legislatures, Governorships, and all levers of power in Washington D.C. <br> Growing up in rural Oregon, being a Democrat was a good thing. My grandparents celebrated President Roosevelt and his efforts to pull the nation from the brink of the Great Depression. There were good government jobs for those with strong backs and willing hands. The elderly and disabled could count on Social Security to comfort them in their hardest years. <br> As my parents grew up, they took inspiration from President Kennedy and his call for shared sacrifice and service. They agreed that their fellow citizens ought to first ask what they might do for their country, not the other way around. Everyone was expected to work and contribute, especially as we battled the Soviet Union and the evils of communism. <br> In the 1980s, my siblings and I grew up witnessing the power and importance of compromise. Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill (D-Mass.) worked closely with President Reagan to find common cause on tax reform and immigration despite profound ideological differences. Later, we watched a rural leader and neighbor – Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.) – work with President Bush as the Soviet Union collapsed and the U.S. emerged as the leader of the free world. <br> But throughout the 1990s, things started to change. For the parties. And for the country. <br> But rural Oregon wasn’t alone. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, this same scene played out across the nation. Steel mills, canneries, furniture plants, and mines. Gone. Their loss impacted not just white working families but black and brown too. <br> But there was also another guilty party: urban elites. These rich-getting-richer Americans viewed our land as Fly Over States, filled with poor-getting-poorer hillbillies. We may have grown the food on their plates, but we weren’t good enough to enjoy it with them. <br> Both political parties understood this sad development and took advantage. <br> Democrats took their own turn, using identity politics to cobble together their coalition of women, minorities, and urbanites that cast the rest of America aside. <br> The result? Our democracy lost the people and temperament for compromise and empathy. <br> Is it any wonder that nobody’s happy with this political arrangement? Approval ratings for members of Congress are about the same as those for communist North Korea. <br> But if Trump fails, how do we break this fever of division? And how do Democrats help encourage that process? After all, we need multiple voices in America’s democracy. We are not North Korea – or China or Russia – with their single political party. <br> First, we’ve got to find, train, and promote candidates who put <i>America first</b>, not our party. No more ideologues who are unwilling to compromise. That means things have to change at the Democratic National Committee – a topic I’ll cover in another column. <br> Democrats and Republicans. <br> I have no illusions that collaboration will be easy or without conflict. In fact, I embrace civilized debate. Most of us do. But we’re tired of the endless fighting. And we have no shortage of problems to tackle. There’s little time to waste. <br> And that’s why I’m sticking with – and will help reshape – a new Democratic Party. 
 For President-elect Trump, boosting economic growth and creating more good-paying jobs recovery will not prove easy. George W. Bush campaigned on -- and delivered -- lower taxes and more limited government, but his economic expansion was no more robust than Barack Obama’s and ended with the 2007/08 financial crisis. <br> Still public confidence is as important as government policies for inspiring growth, and he can still spell out a robust agenda during his first 100 days. Here are five things to look for in the new president's first days: <br> Repealing ObamaCare is easy but replacing it requires the GOP to craft programs to insure Americans with pre-existing conditions and who need financial assistance can obtain coverage. <br> Federal and state programs are two-thirds of health care spending, and those often permit service providers to drive up prices rather than contain costs. More competition, as congressional Republicans prescribe, may help but the Germans have found they simply must regulate prices to stem profiteering by pharmaceutical companies and the like. <br> 2. Tax Reform <br> Trump should table a plan to simplify the personal tax code and lower rates enough to provide a modest cut for everyone. That would encourage small businesses—which generally file under personal, not corporate, laws—to create more jobs and in turn pay for the tax cut. <br> 3. Infrastructure Spending <br> He should send to congress a plan to distribute money directly to the state and local governments with “use or lose” deadlines but subject to broad guidelines. Local governments have lots of schools, bridges and the like in queue for repair and replacement. Private accounting firms could audit spending to ensure funds are used properly. <br> 4. Deregulation <br> 5. Trade <br> China accounts for about two-thirds of the trade imbalance and its undervalued currency is a problem. However, so are its high tariffs, administrative barriers to U.S. exports, pirating of intellectual property and other trappings of its socialist-market economy. <br> In addressing China, Mr. Trump should seek balanced trade while acknowledging that its system is not about to become a western-style market economy, and work to manage trade to eliminate the bilateral trade deficit. 
 Eight years ago, Charles Krauthammer assessed America’s future and famously wrote, “Decline is a choice. … Decline – or continued ascendancy – is in our hands.” <br> Obama’s presidency was defined by the expansion of government at home and appeasement and retreat abroad. Justly so, President Trump’s mission to correct our course has involved a wholesale rejection of his predecessor’s approach to government and view of the world. <br> Obama pledged to “fundamentally transform” the United States and tried many methods to do so. Changing the dominant judicial philosophy of the Supreme Court would have meant changing the very character of our country, but thanks to a major promise kept, that will not be happening anytime soon. <br> Ironically, the same pen used by Obama to enact much of his agenda is now being wielded by his successor to undo it. With each pillar of the Obama legacy he pulls down, President Trump is effectively unleashing our economy and setting America in a more dynamic direction. <br> The Obama years saw overregulation reach a record high with more than 20,000 new rules that collectively cost our economy more than $100 billion. The Trump years are already promising the opposite. By utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA), the president has signed more bills to repeal more regulations in his first 100 days than any president before him. <br> Once targets of frustrating political obstruction, the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines have now been approved for construction and completion. Once a cornerstone of liberal climate policy, the war on coal is now over. With the abolition of the EPA’s Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United Sates rule, an industry that employs thousands and provides affordable electricity to millions will no longer be strangled by smug federal bureaucrats. <br> Other areas of domestic policy have also been addressed by President Trump’s multitude of executive orders. With each action, he has commanded the federal government to ease burdens on the American people and set the stage for larger projects, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare and pro-growth tax reform. <br> No better snapshot of our rediscovered spine was seen than when Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad once again attacked his own people with chemical weapons. When this line was crossed in 2013, Obama publicly dithered for weeks and ultimately failed to enforce his own threat. This time, President Trump responded decisively within days and sent 59 Tomahawk missiles to destroy the airbase from where the gas attack was launched. <br> Above all, we are an America that respects itself again. <br> Now, we have a president unafraid to use both his inaugural address and a primetime speech to Congress to call our enemy by its name, condemn ISIS as “a network of lawless savages,” and declare it our war’s goal to “extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.” <br> This renewed confidence in our righteousness was felt as we dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb in combat history on an ISIS cave in Afghanistan. It is why our Guantanamo Bay naval base is no longer at risk of being closed for ridiculous symbolic reasons. <br> No president’s agenda has ever or will ever be completed in 100 days or even a year. There is still much work to be done and many promises to be fulfilled. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that our trajectory of weakness has been stopped and reversed. 
 Wednesday morning at Trump Tower, President-elect Donald Trump held his first extended media gathering in over five-and-a-half months – in Trump’s words, a “general news conference”. <br> Here are five takeaways. <br> Trump began by taking the Russia dossier report head-on, trashing it as “disgraceful” and “fake news”. <br> Repealing and replacing ObamaCare? A plan will be offered as soon as his choice for health and human Services Secretary, Rep. Tom Price, M.D. is confirmed. <br> The biggest news nugget in this regard: Trump said he’ll make his Supreme Court pick ”within two weeks” of taking office, after “some pretty good signings” (presumably to roll back past executive orders). <br> That still happened, though it won’t grab the same headlines it might have nearly a month ago. However, it did have one advantageous effect for Trump: the financial briefing brought the media to dead silence – a lull between two storms. <br> Trump’s handling of the matter, I thought, was politically deft – he left it to an aide to calmly detail the creation of a firewall and explain the nuances of the family operation; donating the profits to charity was a nice touch. <br> As such, it was the opposite of the typical Obama White House press conference, where the principal usually fielded about a half-dozen-or-so questions during the allotted time. <br> Trump, on the other hand, was direct in his responses – at times seeming to draw energy off the contentious nature of some of the questions. <br> 4. Not A Release Valve. Why do presidents hold press conferences? If not to break news or control a bad story/trend, then to release some pressure from a media entourage clamoring for interaction. <br> Trump opened his remarks by crediting most news outlets for not running the latest Russia dossier allegations. But his dislike for the institution of the press (not to mention his lack of dependency, thanks to his Twitter feed) is palpable. Then again, that contempt is two-way traffic. <br> Which takes us to the final point . . . <br> Once in office, there’s little chance of Trump going dark for six months. Some presidents have – but not until the closing chapter of their White House years (George W. Bush held two solo news conferences in the last 13 months of his presidency). <br> Barack Obama held 10 solo news conferences during his first year in office. He averaged one presser for roughly every six weeks of his presidency. <br> Bill Clinton? Twelve solo news conferences during his first year; only 10 during his last three years, with reporters wanting time to delve into impeachment. <br> Trump’s choices moving forward? <br> As for more traditional news conferences? Make the Bush 43 statistic – four solo press conferences a year – the over-under. 
 For nearly seventeen months now, I presumed that Donald Trump was playing an elaborate game of chicken with the American people. <br> But Trump kept going – through the primaries, then the general election, to a stunning Election Night upset that earns him a four-year stay in a white, albeit less ornate mansion that’s a short stroll from the fancier hotel he recently opened in the nation’s capital. <br> Repeat, exhale . . . then say it again. <br> The trick now: solving the Bill McKay question. That’s the fictional politician Robert Redford played in the 1972 movie “The Candidate,” which ends with the senator-elect asking: “What do we now?”. <br> 1. Seize the Moment. I was going to start this by suggesting Trump spend a week in Palm Beach seclusion for some much-needed RR. That can wait until Thanksgiving and beyond, when it’s time for the big transition decisions that can be done behind the scenes. <br> Trump should invite Hillary Clinton for a private lunch. He should also let it be known that he wants to sit down with President Obama and discuss an amicable transition. <br> In 1824, it was John Quincy Adams staving off a populist challenge from Andrew Jackson, the man who statue sits in Lafayette Park, across the street from the North Portico of the White House. <br> This could have been the scenario in 2020. Much to everyone’s surprise, the revolution came four years ahead of schedule, with the unlikeliest of generals leading the charge. <br> 3. Time to Let Go. Assuming Trump is able to be a gracious winner (and his speech Wednesday night was a good start), it’s time to pivot out of campaign mode. He’s now tasked with acting as a statesman, not a showman treating presidential political like a reality TV show. <br> For Trump to have any semblance of dignified leadership, he has to let go of the petty insults and juvenile denigrations that are simply unbecoming of a president. <br> 4. Meet With GOP Thought Leaders. Can Trump work with a Republican Congress? Some members will be on board right away; for others, it will take time (hint: handing out presidential goodies has a way of healing wounds). <br> There’s nothing stopping Trump from holding a series of dinner salons with influential conservatives in New York (The Wall Street Journal editorial board, for example) and in the District of Columbia (Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, George Will, to name just a few). <br> 5. Put Someone in The West Wing Who’ll Challenge You. Throughout the saga that was the Trump campaign, there was always the question of adult supervision: an aide, a confidante who could tell Trump things he didn’t want to hear and convince him to moderate bad habits. <br> This is a job for the new chief of staff. Who has the stature to pull this off? New Gingrich? Rudy Giuliani? Would either be willing to be the West Wing’s bad cop, confronting Trump when they think he’s wrong on policy, strategy or execution? <br> 6. Build a Cabinet of Insiders and Outsiders. Are we in store for talk of another “Team Of Rivals” approach to building a presidential cabinet (in reality, the gang Barack Obama assembled wasn’t all that Lincoln-esque). <br> A reminder for Trump: in addition to promising to drain the Washington, D.C. swamp, he began the campaign vowing to bring a business sensibility to the federal government. If he doesn’t sprinkle his cabinet with secretaries possessing a private sector, outsiders’ perspective, then the president-elect has broken his first pledge. <br> Most new administrations get a period of grace before the press starts turning the screws. Not Trump – certainly not after months of demonizing his press entourage. <br> Just as stressful for the press secretary will be dealing with the new president when there’s bad press – that’s not an if, but a when. We know Trump can be overly sensitive to negative coverage. If he’s smart, he resists the urge to storm into the Briefing Room and tell the press corps what’s on his mind. <br> For Trump, this first big speech is more than the opening act of his presidency. It’s about making a good first impression with a skeptical public. He foes that by demonstrating the enormity of the vow he will have just taken. <br> Trump should task a team to study how past presidents approached their first address, pair it with some solid polling and focus groups, and keep the rhetoric to a minimum and the style muted. If so, Trump just might get off to a good start. <br> Here is a list of 13 things Trump could do in his first day on the job: <br> And maybe the biggest blow of all: he could kill the Iran nuclear deal. <br> Bill Clinton and Barack Obama almost didn’t get that second term because they bit off more than they could chew once they took office. For each, a big reach on health care reform would have devastating consequences I midterm elections. <br> So where should Trump start? I’d choose tax reform. There’s arguably more bipartisan consensus on that than anything else he’s proposed. And the promise of new revenue will help justify any extra dough Trump wants to spend on a Pentagon buildup or an infrastructure blueprint. 
 Somebody out there in TV Cable Land has a sense of humor. <br> The good news: FBN didn’t take the bait and turn the night into a conversation about Southern discomfort – the notion that the modern GOP is too Dixiefied in its social conservatism to win national elections. Even though the debate was held in a state – yes, governed by a vibrant Indian-American woman – that took down its Confederate flag only last year. <br> With but one gripe: tax reform didn’t come up until far too late into the evening. There’s a wide gulf within this field over tax reform – in particular, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (a flat-taxer) and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (a more traditional rate-reducer). Voters deserve to hear more. And hopefully they will, unless Cruz and Rubio devote their energies to attacking their respective Senate records as they did at the debate’s end. <br> That leaves Ben Carson as the odd man out. Nothing personal against Dr. Carson: he’s a wonderful man with a candidacy that’s exceeded expectations. But his moment seems to have passed. <br> For openers, it was a reminder that Cruz, like him or not, knows his way around a debate stage. He framed himself as one half of a humble couple of limited means in dismissing this week’s New York Times hit piece on his Goldman Sachs loan. <br> A word of caution here for the Cruz Crew: Jeb Bush tangled with Trump; his candidacy cratered. The same is true of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Thursday’s lone debate holdout. Like falling into a black hole or marrying a Kardashian, the contact sport that is extended sparring with The Donald is a ticket to oblivion. Trump knows this, which is why he doesn’t relent. <br> A second observation: this was anticipated as an “everyone hates Marco” event – the rest of the establishment quartet ganging up on the Florida senator, who’s pushing for third place in Iowa and second place in New Hampshire. <br> Third, it was, in fact, a pretty good night for Christie. He flashed some edge and was strong in clarifying his New Jersey record (point of irony: while the New Jersey governor talked guns, Scarlett O’Hara was blowing away a Yankee trooper on a Tara stairwell). <br> Finally, as for Bush, it was a middlin’-to-good night – he fared well at times, especially when he countered Trump’s Muslim ban. <br> The problem for Bush: it’s what Southerners call “catawampus” – a situation that’s gotten out of hand. The Bush super PAC is spending tens of millions of dollars on ads that effectively belittle other candidates but haven’t boosted Jeb’s poll numbers. Standing as he was at the end of the stage, the ex-frontrunner looked like he was from a distant planet, not the center of the solar system – a far cry from a year ago. <br> That’s plenty of time. After all... tomorrow is another day. 
 Donald Trump is already Making America Great Again. True to his campaign theme, this consummate deal maker and now president-elect has now put his negotiating savvy to work for the American people. <br> PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S THREE GREATEST CHALLENGES <br> It is also possible that Trump hinted that Carrier’s parent company United Technologies, which derives some 10 percent of its $56 billion in revenues from the federal government, would do well to play ball with the incoming administration. <br> Bottom line: We don’t know and we don’t care. This unexpected win is why the stock market has been soaring since the election, and why consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in over nine years in the past month, in spite of the incessant gloom broadcast by the liberal media. This is why voters elected Trump, upending politics as usual. And, it’s just the beginning. <br> The Carrier decision, and the resulting 1,000 jobs, is a drop in the bucket, but it is a powerful symbol at a time when working people in our country are just regaining their optimism. Carrier had long broadcast its intention to shift the manufacturing of its gas furnaces and fan coils from Indiana to Monterrey. The move was expected to save Carrier some $65 million per year, but became a rallying cry on the campaign trail. The planned move became the poster child for the seeming indifference of U.S. companies to its workers, as well as the negligence of the Obama White House, which did nothing to prevent the devastating seepage of manufacturing jobs from our land. <br> Trump’s picks for key cabinet spots confirms that he means business and should bolster those expectations. Choosing Tom Price, a doctor and member of Congress who has spent years crafting alternatives to ObamaCare, shows Trump’s readiness to replace the dysfunctional health program. In selecting Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary Trump has served notice to the teachers unions: there’s a new sheriff in town, and he’s will demand changes in our failing public schools. Ditto Elaine Chao, who if confirmed will be Trump’s Secretary of Transportation. Chao, wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, knows her way around the capitol, and will be an excellent shepard for Trump’s infrastructure initiative. <br> The liberal press will minimize the Carrier deal, pointing out that 1,000 jobs will not of itself lift economic growth, and that structural cost problems remain for U.S. manufacturers. Paying Mexican laborers three dollars an hour is a powerful enticement; workers in Indianapolis are making more than $20. <br> The Carrier reversal also shows our billionaire president-elect ready to use the power of the Oval Office to negotiate a better deal for our country – from corporations as well as from foreign countries. Underlying that premise is Trump’s recognition that the U.S. is the exceptional nation, and that our prestige and clout can be leveraged on behalf of American workers. What a welcome change. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com. She is a financial columnist who also writes for <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/">The Fiscal Times
 According to one expert, the average American unwittingly commits three felonies every day, due to the massive size and scope of criminal laws in the United States. As shocking as that is, somehow the idea is even more concerning during tax season. After all, according to the Tax Foundation, federal tax laws and regulations have grown to over 10 million words in length. <br> The tax code is the way the government exercises power over the people, and enables a few to become more powerful at the expense of many others. This needs to change, and a serious overhaul of the tax code is the only way to ensure equity in economic opportunity and wage growth for all Americans. <br> Ordinary Americans who are dutifully making an effort to properly file their taxes can only hope for the best to make the task easy. Those who can afford an accountant are fortunate to have someone who can handle the tangled web of forms, deductions and general filing process for them, but not everyone is so lucky. The tax code has grown so complex that just the instruction book for filing a 1040 form has grown to over 200 pages. Even former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner failed to pay the taxes he owed, explaining that he made “careless and unintentional mistakes.” If Tim Geithner can’t manage to file his taxes properly, odds are rough for the rest of us. <br> An unnecessarily complex tax system raises barriers to opportunity for every American. Rather than allowing the spirit of American entrepreneurship to simply flourish and inspire new generations to follow their dreams of starting a business, it is as though the government is actively trying to make it more difficult. <br> Hispanics in the U.S. start businesses at double the national rate. The number of entrepreneurs could be higher, but more are being held back by the unreasonable and costly demands of occupational licensing requirements and the bewildering complexity of the tax code. <br> Our current system favors the powerful and the wealthy. It empowers individuals and entities that have the resources to hire armies of lobbyists to carve out loopholes and exceptions, and accountants and lawyers to find more loopholes and ensure compliance, or to play defense if something goes wrong. The tax code is the way the government exercises power over the people, and enables a few to become more powerful at the expense of many others. This needs to change, and a serious overhaul of the tax code is the only way to ensure equity in economic opportunity and wage growth for all Americans. <br> Marilinda García is the national spokeswoman for The LIBRE Initiative 
 After an emotional ride, an evening of surprises and possibly the biggest political shakeup this country has seen, the voters have spoken and we now prepare to embrace President Donald J. Trump. <br> What was missed through this election, and also underreported and clouded by the immigration noise, was the fact that the top issue for Hispanics is jobs and the economy. <br> Many Americans mistakenly believed that Trump’s hard line on immigration and polarizing epithets like ‘bad hombres’ would ruin his chances with Hispanic voters. This logic relied on an assumption that immigration and race relations were the most important issues for these voters — yet the data says otherwise. <br> Some early reports show a 34 percent Hispanic support in Florida, which is exactly aligned with CuturIntel™'s non polling method of measuring opinion: two days ago, the method showed Trump had 32 percent of Latino support in the Sunshine State. <br> Back in June we reported Trump securing 34 percent positive opinion among Hispanics, which was reported by Fox News Latino, Drudge Report and covered by The O’Reilly Factor. It unleashed a wave of tweets in disbelief that I backed with data and an N sample of over 1.9 million. Our data also always reported them almost in a dead tie for positive opinion nationally. <br> Over the last 12 months, jobs and the economy dominated 35 percent of Hispanics’ political conversation, which possibly made a winning difference for Trump. <br> The number of Latino-owned businesses has grown nearly 50 times faster than non-Latino-owned businesses, yet Latino businesses lag far behind in revenue compared with those owned by non-Latinos, as reported by the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative. This represents a $1.4 trillion opportunity for the U.S. economy that could be positively impacted with less regulation and incentives for small business owners. <br> Peter Navarro, one of Trump’s economic policy advisors, claimed that the lag in entrepreneurship and successful small businesses started with government restrictions. Trump articulated that it was most important to focus on growing GDP to 3.5 percent through deregulation. <br> This is particularly attractive to small business owners, as the National Small Business Association reports 2 in 5 of the owners of small businesses as Republicans and 95 percent of them as active voters in national elections. <br> Certainly, this election leaves us with many lessons to learn. Polls need to be reconsidered and advanced data extraction techniques and big data should be considered as complimentary technology. Also, Hispanics are not a single-issue community. We are highly entrepreneurial, motivated by a vibrant economy and jobs and ultimately vote for candidates and not for parties. <br> Allie George is a XL Alliance Marketing Coordinator. 
 Donald Trump is again gaining on Hillary Clinton. Is it because of ObamaCare? Is it because of WikiLeaks? Or could it be because frustrated voters demand change, and that Clinton is the poster child for the status quo? Trump is not the perfect messenger, to be sure, but he is embracing a perfect message: it’s time to shake up the establishment, or, as he says, to “drain the swamp.” It is time for a new Contract with the American Voter, and he is offering just that. <br> Predictably, the mainstream media focused on Trump’s threats to sue his female accusers instead of the content of his speech, which was a shame. Nonetheless, as he has continued to campaign on some of the promises contained in that program, voters are paying attention. Simply put, he is saying what the majority of Americans wants to hear, and Hillary is not. She sounds out of touch with the country, because she is. <br> By contrast, whether it is calling for term limits on members of Congress, or freezing the size of the federal workforce, Trump is laying out ideas that voters applaud. <br> Trump is calling for a 5-year ban on government officials becoming lobbyists, a lifetime ban on White House workers lobbying on behalf of a foreign government and a “complete” ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for candidates in American elections. <br> By highlighting corruption issues, Trump reminds voters that Hillary is entangled in endless controversies, almost all of which have to do with the questionable means by which the Clintons have personally amassed hundreds of millions of dollars. <br> Trump also promised to protect American workers, by renegotiating our trade deals, by holding China and other trading partners to account, by encouraging domestic energy production and by redirecting taxpayer money from overseas climate control ventures into domestic infrastructure projects. <br> He also promised to launch tax reform aimed at growing the economy, to employ private-public partnerships in rebuilding our infrastructure, send education dollars and policy-making back to communities, where they belong, and repeal and replace ObamaCare. The list of common-sense proposals goes on to include securing our borders and tamping down crime. <br> It was a gift to those worried that our economy is incapable of providing opportunity, and that, thanks to failing schools and crumbling infrastructure, our country is becoming uncompetitive. <br> People sense that nothing can be fixed until everything is fixed, that incrementalism is not enough. <br> The real question before voters is whether they will be bold enough to elect a candidate who wants to change the trajectory of the country, to push back against the failed policies that have crushed our entrepreneurs and degraded our schools, to clean out the corrupt stables of Washington and to give power back to the people. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 People are constantly asking me – “What makes the president tick?” <br> If people who are struggling to understand Donald J. Trump just took the time to do their due diligence, they would realize that there is a method to his professional life. There are principles he adheres to and protocols he follows. <br> Chapter 1: “A Week in the Life” – In 1987, he liked flexibility in his schedule. He wrote that he cannot be “imaginative or entrepreneurial if you have too much structure.” <br> His typical business day officially starts at 9am and ends at 6:30pm. <br> There were no “tweets” in 1987 when he published his book so we can assume phone calls at that time took the place of them at that time. <br> He will settle on less but only if he feels that is what it will take to close the deal. And, when a deal is closed, he will always claim he got the best of the deal. <br> So, what impresses Trump is a person’s track record, instincts and impression. <br> 1.Think Big – Immigration, Repeal and Replace ObamaCare, Tax Reform, etc. <br> Compromise is a necessary component. <br> 4.Know the Market – Take counsel from the best and brightest who know their “market.” Cabinet Secretaries are the best and brightest in their “markets” and that is who was hired and that is the counsel he will take. <br> 5.Use Your Leverage – Never show desperation for a deal. Deal from strength using all the tools available to you to project strength. Sometimes that requires “imagination and salesmanship.” The U.S. government and the president have a great deal of leverage to exert, economically, militarily, politically, etc. <br> 7.&nbsp;Get the Word Out – You can have the best policy and solution but if the people don’t know it then they can’t appreciate it. <br> You must create excitement. <br> The more sensational or outrageous the sale, the better, because the press eats it up. <br> He uses “bravado” as a tool of promotion. He plays to “people’s fantasies” like: “Making America Great Again.” <br> Puffery is allowed as part of the sale because it is a tool allowed in the marketplace. <br> Trump will fight back harder than the attack itself. And, he will fight back on multiple fronts, i.e. courts, press, etc. <br> 9.Deliver the Goods – Trump realizes that after all the hype, promotion and excitement there must be a deliverable. You have to be able to talk a good game but in the end you must deliver. <br> 10. Contain the Costs – Spend what is needed but no more. If you feel you are being taken advantage of – pick up the phone and let the party know. <br> 11. Have Fun – The excitement of making the deal is playing the game. Trump does not rehash or relive deals because he is on to the next one. He claims that if you enjoy what you do, you will be successful. It is just that simple. <br> President Trump is applying his business principles to governing. He believes that by applying tried and true principles and protocols that made him successful as a businessman he will also be as successful as a president of the United States. 
 Not since George and Martha in the play “Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” or for older readers Don Ameche and Frances Langford in the radio comedy “The Bickersons,” have we seen the kind of verbal pugilism practiced in Sunday night’s presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. <br> Sunday night, Clinton recycled the familiar Democrat playbook that the wealthy aren’t paying their “fair share” in taxes, when the real issue is that government already receives record amounts in tax money, but misspends much of it and never seems to have enough. <br> In the debate, Clinton said she “only” wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, not the middle class. ATR notes she has said just the opposite on many occasions. It calculates that if all of her tax proposals are enacted, it would cost taxpayers $1 trillion over 10 years and gives the following examples: <br> She wants a tax on sodas that ATR estimates would add $2.16 per 12-pack. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) charged this would violate her pledge to protect the middle class from tax hikes: “Frankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal violates her pledge.” <br> Trump purports to favor school choice, which is an essential tool for escaping poverty and would do more than any federal anti-poverty program to help poor children obtain a good education. Hillary Clinton claims to favor school choice, but only as far as publicly funded charter schools. Since she and many Democrats receive political contributions from teachers unions, it’s unlikely she’ll let poor children escape failing schools. In the latest debate she tried to claim credit for all she has done for children, but what she has not done by refusing to support school vouchers, which allow parents to use public funds to pay for some or all of their child’s private school tuition, overcomes whatever good she may have accomplished. <br> The hypocrisy meter is in hyper drive when you consider that some of the same Democrats condemning Trump said of Bill Clinton’s numerous affairs “it’s just about sex” and had nothing to do with his performance as president. These are people who still hold John F. Kennedy in high regard, despite his long list of women with whom he had sex, including secreting some into the White House. 
 I am in the lucky position of being someone who has both a lot of conservative friends and a lot of liberal friends. I value these friendships greatly both because I like my friends and because I benefit from hearing both sides off all issues. <br> My friend Erwin Chemerinsky sincerely believes that Donald Trump is anti semitic even though his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism, Trump has given a key White House appointment to his Jewish son-in-law with whom he is very close, and Trump has adopted the most pro-Israel foreign policy of any president in American history. <br> Liberals are hysterical over Trump’s ban on immigration from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and the Sudan while overlooking the fact that there are violent civil wars going on in those countries. The vast majority of Muslim countries are not affect by Trump's ban including: Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf states, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and many parts of North Africa including the Northern half of Nigeria. <br> I have pointed out to these liberal friends that there are all sorts of checks and balances built into the Constitution that would prevent Trump from doing to Muslims or Hispanics what President Franklin D. Roosevelt did with Japanese-Americans during World War II, which was to round them all up and put them in a concentration camp – another worry a liberal friend has expressed to me. <br> Former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is so good that even my liberal friends think he won the vice presidential debate last fall with Democratic rival Tim Kaine. <br> Trump’s pick of Steven Mnuchin to be Secretary of the Treasury is also brilliant. Mnuchin understands supply side economics and the way in which real tax reform could jump start our largely stalled economy. <br> Betsy DeVos is in my opinion the best pick for Secretary of Education in the history of the Department of Education. Her support for school choice and vouchers is essential if we are ever to repair our failing public schools. <br> The pick of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to be ambassador to the United Nations is yet another very wise Trump choice. Haley is first East Indian-American to serve in that job, and she reflects both the excellence and the diversity that characterizes the United States. <br> Most recently, on January 31, President Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court in an absolutely brilliant and superb move. <br> If Gorsuch is confirmed, as he deserves to be, it will mark the first time in U.S. history that a Supreme Court justice will have served on the bench with one of hiss law clerks. <br> His Supreme Court nominee is as good as was Justice Scalia, who was Reagan’s best Supreme Court appointment out of four tries. Donald Trump is a genius at hiring highly talented and well credentialed officials. 
 On Oct. 2, Colombians will vote on whether to approve or reject a flawed peace agreement reached by the government and the FARC narco-terror group. <br> In effect, Santos has wagered too much of Colombia’s interest on a peace deal, forcing government negotiators to grant many costly concessions. The lack of jail time for war criminals, the inclusion of special economic benefits to demobilized guerrillas not available to law-abiding citizens and the granting of automatic congressional seats to a FARC political party make this deal unacceptable to many Colombians who have suffered from the FARC’s 50-year terror campaign. <br> If rejected, years of negotiations will have been wasted, and the country will face a return of war and of a host of economic and societal problems largely ignored by the government – all without the international goodwill and financial support which the peace process has garnered. <br> For all its faults, the agreement to end the conflict will provide opportunity for renewed economic growth and stability for Colombia that was previously unavailable. The government will be able to extend its presence into previously ungoverned spaces, allowing the private sector to regain safe access to and develop natural resources which will foster growth for the country. The end of the conflict will also attract renewed foreign investment crucial to stimulating the economy. <br> At the same time, Santos and others should be wary of overselling the benefits of the agreement with predictions of dramatic economic growth and social progress to an already skeptical public that has too often felt the sting of false promises. <br> A weak government presence, outdated investment and tax codes, deep societal and economic divisions, corruption and criminality will remain after the agreement and must be addressed before Colombia can take full advantage of the opportunity presented by peace. <br> While the conflict with the FARC would end, remaining organized criminal elements such as the ELN and BACRIM will still be a source of violence that will continue to require significant attention and resources to combat. <br> To prevent history from repeating itself, the Colombian government will have to be vigilant in ensuring that the vast wealth the FARC has derived from narcotrafficking does not find its way into the political campaigns of its candidates and that criminal entities do not reoccupy the space left after demobilization. <br> By signing this agreement, Colombia can begin to close this sad chapter of its history, and the U.S.'s key ally in the region will be all the stronger for it.

The end of the conflict will also attract renewed foreign investment crucial to stimulating the economy. <br> At the same time, Santos and others should be wary of overselling the benefits of the agreement with predictions of dramatic economic growth and social progress to an already skeptical public that has too often felt the sting of false promises. <br> A weak government presence, outdated investment and tax codes, deep societal and economic divisions, corruption and criminality will remain after the agreement and must be addressed before Colombia can take full advantage of the opportunity presented by peace. <br> While the conflict with the FARC would end, remaining organized criminal elements such as the ELN and BACRIM will still be a source of violence that will continue to require significant attention and resources to combat. <br> To prevent history from repeating itself, the Colombian government will have to be vigilant in ensuring that the vast wealth the FARC has derived from narcotrafficking does not find its way into the political campaigns of its candidates and that criminal entities do not reoccupy the space left after demobilization. <br> By signing this agreement, Colombia can begin to close this sad chapter of its history, and the U.S.'s key ally in the region will be all the stronger for it. <br> Andrés Martínez-Fernández is a research analyst with Visión Américas, which represents U.S. and foreign clients. 
 As I’ve analyzed the field of viable presidential candidates for the past year, I’ve been in search of a conservative leader with three vital qualities -- experience, an abiding belief in the American people, and a clear vision for our future. <br> Marco is a leader who can unite conservatives and inspire all people. He was elected Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives by his peers, demonstrating that he is a leader among leaders. <br> Marco is effective, developing thoughtful policy initiatives and building broad coalitions on issues ranging from reducing the size of government to championing tax reform. <br> What’s far more important than experience alone however, is a belief not just in America, but in the American people. Too often I hear pundits and leaders speak in terms of the inevitable decline of our nation and without hope for the next generation of Americans. <br> The American people have done more to advance the cause of freedom and to improve the human condition than any society in the history of the world. <br> Finally, I am convinced that Marco Rubio’s conservative vision for the future of our country is his strongest qualification for the presidency. <br> I myself am the grandson of immigrants and have lived the dream of rising from ordinary circumstances to achieve the extraordinary. <br> Marco Rubio is a conservative leader for this generation and the next. When he looks at the American people, he sees great possibility and knows our best days are just ahead. 
 In the 1970s, the “Dirty Harry” movies presaged the death of politically correct liberalism and the rise of Reagan Republicanism. “Dirty Harry” was a San Francisco cop played by Clint Eastwood, who was legendary for apprehending killers, rapists and thieves. His secret was that he broke politically correct police force rules with reckless abandon, as audiences cheered. <br> They regularly save the world from terrorist mass murderers, but they can’t always stop terrorist assaults from harming innocent bystanders. The Avengers consequently take the rap for not caring about “collateral damage.” In the opening scenes, the Avengers foil a vicious band of terrorists threatening the world with a stolen biological weapon in Lagos, Nigeria. But as they fought, one terrorist explosive rebounds to kill nearby humanitarian volunteers from the Wakandan tribe. <br> But as the Wakandan King addresses representatives of the 117 nations in celebration of their new global accountability treaty, the terrorists blow up the UN building in which they are meeting, apparently killing them all. <br> Donald Trump is the political beneficiary today of the surge of American nationalism, in which the American people yearn for someone to speak up for the USA. If Trump can just accomplish a few simple, obvious things as president, he can carry this mantle of Captain America. <br> Trump has already shown he knows what needs to be done, proposing tax reform with lower tax rates than even Reagan accomplished. Lower marginal tax rates, the rate on the next dollar of income produced, provide incentives for job creating investment, whether starting new businesses or expanding existing ones. The resulting increased demand for labor drives up wages. <br> Reliable low cost energy would be the foundation for the renaissance of world leading American manufacturing, which would mean the revival of America’s world leading middle class. These policies would be enough to unleash a booming, world leading economic recovery, which still lurks within this economy, yearning to break out. <br> If Trump can then just rebuild America’s national defenses, and appoint a new generation of Constitutional conservative Supreme Court Justices, which he has recently shown he knows how to do, these achievements alone would be enough for him to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents ever. 
 Friday the Labor Department is expected to report the economy added 245,000 jobs in December. That’s down from 321,000 in November, and a slower economic growth will likely drag on jobs creation through much of 2015. <br> Going forward, household finances are in their best shape since the financial crisis and consumer spending should continue to lift the recovery. Also, much postponed business investment—for example in the commercial real estate and accompanying office fixtures and IT businesses—may be expected to boost growth. <br> However, weakening conditions in Europe and foreign governments’ policies that artificially overvalue the dollar against the yuan, yen and euro will slow U.S. exports, especially for technology-intensive capital goods and software that compete with Chinese, Japanese and European offerings. <br> Overall growth should range between 2.5 and 3 percent in 2015, and that will not support jobs creation of more than 235,000 per month unless productivity growth is weak. <br> Since 2000, Congress has enhanced the earned income tax credit, and expanded programs that provide direct benefits to low and middle income workers, including ObamaCare and Medicaid, food stamps, and rent and mortgage assistance. <br> Similarly, many women with good skills and education, who might enjoy the fulfillment and independence of full-time work, are encouraged to avoid employment or accept only part-time positions. <br> The whole system encourages retailers and other employers to chop two jobs into three and limit hours to less than 30 per week. <br> The GOP Congress could work with President Obama to fire up growth and jobs creation. With gas prices so low, raising the excise tax that funds federal highway trust fund in line with inflation since it was last adjusted in 1997 could be used to finance sorely needed investments in urban roads and transit systems. <br> Congress should require that the proposed trans-Pacific free trade agreement include provision with real teeth to eliminate currency manipulation by the Japanese and other participating governments. <br> An aggressive effort to rebuild America’s infrastructure, tax reform and sound trade policies could easily raise growth to 4 or 5 percent and increase jobs creation to 300,000 to 400,000 a month. 
 Puerto Rico’s governor announced this week that the small island territory would be unable to repay its $70 billion in outstanding debt. The commonwealth is in its tenth year of a depression and is losing its tax base as thousands of residents relocate to the mainland for better economic opportunities.</u> <br> Flawed policies from Washington have aided Puerto Rico’s descent into fiscal insolvency in a number of ways. Washington inflated the island’s transportation costs, destroyed the island’s labor market with an abnormally-high minimum wage and lavish entitlement programs, and pushed flawed tax policy that created an economic bubble.</u> <br> The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour applies on the island. The minimum wage’s effects are well-known, but it has disproportionate influence in Puerto Rico. <br> The high minimum wage raises the cost of employment and prices many employers out of the market, causing unemployment to rise and thus tax revenue to dry up. The minimum wage is a partly why the island’s unemployment rate is almost three times that of the mainland. <br> Finally, Washington fueled the Puerto Rico bubble with inconsistent tax policy. Per Congress, Puerto Rican municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxation—like other states—but they are also exempt from state and local taxes too. Triple tax exempt bonds are a great investment. That attracted buyers to the bond market, allowing Puerto Rico to issue billions and billions in debt cheaply, and postpone spending restraint.</u> <br> Puerto Rico’s inability to limit spending, reform its protectionist labor laws, and institute broad pro-growth tax reform all contribute to its precarious debt situation. But it isn’t alone. Bad policies from Washington have made the pain much worse. 
 By now it is quite clear that Americans are not supportive of another Washington bailout of entities that have taken irresponsible risks, whether these be banks or municipalities. Particularly in the midst of a weak recovery and a recent market downturn, the prospect of Congress rewarding reckless behavior by putting taxpayers on the hook is not going to appeal to the average voter. <br> Congress has a vital interest in ensuring that Puerto Rico survives its current debt crisis and builds a better, more sustainable future. It should not squander that opportunity and risk a social and economic calamity in the process. <br> Puerto Rico is in the middle of a financial crisis, and longstanding issues with Medicare and Medicaid have only further exacerbated the problem. Though Puerto Rico has the highest participation in the nation for Medicare Advantage, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the island has experienced an 11 percent cut in MA reimbursement rates. This is why I recently sent a letter to the Department of Treasury asking them to provide Puerto Rico with temporary relief from the fee under Section 9010 of the ACA during the Territory’s economic crisis. Territory residents are not eligible to access the ACA marketplace to purchase insurance and do not receive any tax credits to purchase coverage. This relief would greatly benefit the the people of Puerto Rico. <br> The dimensions of the island’s plight are stark. The government has already endured several smaller defaults and faces a raft of lawsuits from the creditors left holding the bag. Large payments—of principal as well as interest—loom in May and June; unable to meet those obligations, government officials are frantically negotiating with creditor groups in hopes of restructuring some $49 billion of the total $72 billion debt. <br> Default is not an option. Despite the rhetoric of some who advocate letting Puerto Rico twist in the wind and pay the consequences without any federal action to allow bankruptcy status, such a course would be both catastrophic and unsustainable, all but guaranteeing more dramatic action and expenditure of taxpayer dollars when the dominoes start to fall. <br> As Puerto Rico’s 3.5 million residents quickly realize how desperate their situation has become in the wake of a default, with cutoffs of services and social chaos, that influx to the mainland is sure to spike. These transfers in population have increased federal and state government expenses as Medicaid eligibility levels for Puerto Rico tend to be significantly lower and a great deal of Puerto Rican immigration will receive Medicaid and CHIP benefits, costing taxpayers billions of dollars over several years. <br> Puerto Rico’s debt crisis presents a unique opportunity to put some pro-growth policies in place and demand fiscal transparency on the island. Over-regulation, a mandated minimum wage that the island’s economy cannot sustain, the abuse of workers’ compensation, and the withdrawal of one of the world’s largest U.S. Naval facilities a decade ago have led to a stagnant economy for residents with 40 percent of the population on food stamps and workforce participation at a miserable 40 percent. <br> Congress has a vital interest in ensuring that Puerto Rico survives its current debt crisis and builds a better, more sustainable future. It should not squander that opportunity and risk a social and economic calamity in the process. <br> Carlos Curbelo is a U.S. representative from Florida's 26th congressional district. 
 Some credit Aesop and his “Fox and the Lion” fable with first coining the phrase: “familiarity breeds contempt.” <br> A better Aesop fable in honor of Thursday night’s gathering in Houston, the tenth such GOP debate dating back to August? <br> A better choice: “The Frightened Hares,” given the Republican establishment’s growing panic over the very real prospect of Trump actually winning the party’s nomination. <br> Did Trump Lose Ground? In a word: no. <br> From the time he first latched on to illegal immigration and changed the dynamics of this race, it’s been clear that Trump knows how to speak to the fed-up side of the GOP electorate – more so than any other candidate still alive in the race. <br> The establishment hates the man’s style and antics, but the one-third-plus of the primary electorate that’s propelled Trump to the front of the multi-candidate pack – and won’t be leaving him anytime soon – adores the show. Which is why Trump likely will fare well on Super Tuesday, despite spending a great deal of time on the defensive and on the bad side of some pretty nasty put-downs. <br> Rubio must have heard the griping, as he went right after Trump on the get-go. It began with allegations of Trump hiring foreign workers for his Palm Beach estate. After that: construction labor forces, Trump-signature products manufactured overseas, the lawsuit over the entity formerly known as Trump University. And on it went, throughout the night. <br> This tactic will get Rubio a lot of air time between now and Super Tuesday. It’s also a second-guesser’s delight, as the cling-free Trump has been the Teflon Don of this field. <br> But on Thursday night, Cruz seemed consistently missing from the action. Part of it had to do with Rubio and Trump noisily locking horns. But having to ask Wolf Blitzer for a chance to weigh in on Obamacare? It seemed . . . well, kind of weak for a debate champ on his home Texas turf. <br> If Thursday night was closing the deal in Tuesday’s Texas primary, Cruz failed at the task. <br> To be fair, both gentlemen brought this on themselves – just as they have in previous debates. <br> Carson decided months ago that he’d speak only when spoken to. Yes, the retired neurosurgeon had a valid complaint when he pointed out to Hewitt that he was left out of the tax-reform discussion. And he scored the other big sound bite of the night, underscoring the fact that he was going unnoticed amidst the food fight: “Can someone attack me, please?” <br> A final thought: <br> At this point, with only two scheduled GOP debates remaining (March 3 in Michigan; March 10 in Florida), the Republican field should be approaching its closing arguments. <br> The 150-minute debate in Houston underscored how the situation is driving mainstream Republicans nuts. Trump gets attacked all night long – in the process, giving Hillary Clinton’s oppo team writer’s cramp as it races to jot down the many vulnerabilities – yet he seems impervious to attacks personal, professional and policy-wise. <br> And no one can figure how to get it off the freeway. 
 There will be tremendous hardship on family pocketbooks if Washington drives America over the fiscal cliff come January 1.But the financial damage from that will be as nothing compared to the fiscal crisis and debt that await the Millennials--Americans aged five to 30 who seem doomed to be remembered as America’s Debt-Paying Generation. <br> Will Washington really let this happen?It will as long as it continues to doggedly ignore basic facts about our debt problems. Here are three basic mistakes our leaders make—to the peril of the rising generation. <br> One: Both parties carefully chose their facts when they talk about making tough cuts. The House Republican budget targets Medicaid spending and entitlements – both good things. Yet it fails to embrace much needed spending reforms in defense and Social Security. <br> According to calculations done by the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Data Analysis, 69% of the federal budget is made up of 47 programs, most of them social spending. Add in interest payments, and over 80% of the federal budget is made up of 48 areas of federal spending. Yet Democrats focus on defense, a large but shrinking percentage of the federal budget, and Republicans would rather look at nutrition programs for poor mothers than eliminate energy and farm subsidies. <br> How important are interest payments to balancing the budget over time? In 2011, they amounted to $454 billion, or 12.5% of the budget, or about 3% of Gross Domestic Product for all debt, and $227 billion for publicly held debt. But these reflect current record low interest rates, as calculated by CBO, of 2.1%. Now suppose the economy pulls itself out of the doldrums, and interest rates return by 2016 to a more normal 4%? Interest on the borrowing for that year’s deficit will be $14 billion greater as compared to today’s debt servicing, and payments over the following decade would jump by 90% as compared to CBO’s expectations of that time period. All told, that extra $1.67 trillion equals $5,352.56 greater debt per American. And as the debt continues to grow, so will those payments. <br> The simple fact is that revenues are down because of the stagnant economy, but in all actuality the federal government would have plenty of revenue with current rates, which it did prior to the recession. Therefore, it is an error for conservatives to fall prey to the same mistakes liberals make when analyzing the nation’s fiscal and economic problems, and pretend that spending is not the entirety of the problem. 
 Donating to charities is a part of American life. According to the World Giving Index, the United States is the most generous country in the world, followed by Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Britain. According to another study, ordinary individuals gave 73 percent of the money donated to U.S. charities in 2010 — more than $200 billion. <br> Loving your neighbor is not judged in dollars donated. In fact, it should not be judged at all. Anyone who gives something to someone in need expecting nothing in return is to be respected. <br> Americans should be proud that philanthropy and charitable giving is not just a practice of the wealthy. It is ingrained in our culture. <br> As we approach 2016 many candidates are advancing their tax plans and some incorporate the elimination of all deductions including the charitable deduction. These plans must be scrutinized and understood in the macro and micro of their economic cause and effect. <br> Congressional tax writers have spent months scouring the tax code in a complex effort to overhaul the nation’s tax laws, and insist they are looking at every provision with a fresh, scrutinizing gaze. But the broad group of senators contended that the charitable tax deduction is unique and should be left untouched as part of any overhaul effort. <br> “The charitable deduction is unique. It is the only provision that encourages taxpayers to give away a portion of their income for the benefit of others,” the senators wrote. “Analysis has repeatedly shown that proposals to cut, cap, or limit the charitable deduction could cause charitable donations to decline by billions of dollars annually. <br> Backers of the deduction cheered the letter, calling it a “clear signal” on the importance of the charitable deduction. <br> I implore all men and women of good will who are seeking the office to the presidency, U.S. Senate and House to preserve the charitable deduction. <br> Nancy G. Brinker is founder of Susan G. Komen and Race for the Cure. She served as ambassador to the Republic of Hungary from 2001-2003 and was chief of protocol at the State Department from 2007-2009. 
 In the wake of the Republican wave that swept the country last week, people have been asking me two questions. How did it happen, and what does it mean for the future? <br> No sitting Republican senators lost, and a bunch of races that were supposed to be close were blow outs. [pullquote] <br> Why the difference? <br> The answer is simple. Republicans in the House could point to hundreds of common sense bills passed under their watch. The Democratic Senate, on the other hand, was a place that good ideas, even bipartisan ones, went to die. Instead of legislation encouraging energy exploration or export expansion or regulatory reform, Democrats pushed show-votes designed to further their divisive political strategy. <br> The lessons both parties should learn from the results are clear. The American people expect leadership, and they expect to see Congress pass legislation to help them and their families. And that’s what we must deliver. <br> We will end the job-killing medical device tax and begin the process of repealing and replacing ObamaCare. <br> We will begin work on comprehensive tax reform that will make America the best place to do business again, increasing wages and benefits for workers in the process. <br> When we move ahead with a positive legislative agenda, the ball will be squarely in the President’s court. He says that he heard the message that voters sent to him on Tuesday night, that he understands they are ready for him to come to the table and work with the Republican Congress. We will do our part. The president must do his. <br> And we won’t forget it. 
 As Congressional leaders come together at the White House Friday to meet with President Obama there are two questions on everyone’s mind. <br> And second, will the president be serving Kentucky bourbon? <br> [pullquote] <br> President Obama was more opaque about where he sees the potential to work with Republican leadership, even though he was clear that it was his priority to make sure that the government keeps working during his final two years in office. <br> But more importantly than any specific issue, the legacy of Obama’s presidency is very much tied to whether he will work with Republicans in these next two years. <br> To be sure, the president has accomplished a great deal on social issues. He will always be remembered for ObamaCare as well as key pieces of legislation like the Equal Pay Act and his support for gay marriage and women’s rights . <br> This would be the wrong approach on two levels. First, it would mean that government will continue to get nothing done. That’s a losing scenario for both parties and the American people. <br> In a recent WSJ/NBC News poll, 50% of Americans said they would rather a candidate “who will make compromises to gain consensus on legislation,” up from 34% at the 2010 midterms. <br> In many ways, his legacy depends on it. 
 Former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) is thinking seriously about running for president in 2016, according to his son, George P. Bush. <br> Politico, and many others, assert it's because of an answer Bush gave in 2012 to a hypothetical question posed by a member of the House Budget Committee, which resurfaced now as he contemplates running for president. Bush was asked if he could accept tax increases of $1 dollar for every $10 dollars in spending cuts. He said he could and seemed enthusiastic about the 10-for-1 formula. <br> Norquist and other anti-tax advocates perhaps see in Bush's comment a replay of his father's pledge at the 1988 Republican National Convention: Read my lips: no new taxes. He violated that pledge when congressional Democrats promised to cut spending in exchange for tax increases. Bush raised taxes. Democrats did not cut spending. Many have long believed that broken promise contributed to his failure to win a second term. <br> The Treasury Department last week released figures showing tax revenue in fiscal 2014 exceeded $3 trillion for the first time in American history. Treasury also said the deficit was nearly $500 billion. The national debt has passed $17 trillion, and continues to climb. As Ronald Reagan and other conservatives have noted, the reason we have such massive debt is not because the American people are undertaxed; it is because their government overspends. <br> Republicans need to reject the notion that government needs more money and change the subject to the elimination of wasteful and unnecessary spending. Deep within our DNA remains a Puritan ethic of living within one's means and not borrowing to pay for what we can't afford. <br> The collection of any taxes which are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to the public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. <br> And this: No matter what anyone may say about making the rich and the corporations pay the taxes, in the end they come out of the people who toil. 
 Pope Francis’s visit to the United States is attracting a flood of attention, and preparations have been underway for months in the cities and communities that will welcome him. While the pope will be greeted by thousands as he visits our nation’s famous landmarks and cathedrals, he has also planned a stop where the residents cannot come out to greet him: a local jail in Philadelphia. <br> The pope has often implored us through his words and actions to treat the people we put in jail or prison with respect and mercy. Some of those in jail have committed serious crimes, while others have committed relatively minor offenses. Many struggle with mental illness or drug addiction. Many simply can’t afford to make bail. Treating them justly and fairly is a strong Christian, and quintessentially Catholic, imperative. After all, Jesus taught us to visit those in prison. He also told us that what we do for the least of our brothers and sisters we do for Him. <br> Pope Francis continues the tradition of Catholic leaders urging us to offer hope and a second chance to prisoners. <br> The pope’s visit to the jail in Philadelphia will call attention to a part of our criminal justice system that receives too little notice: local jails. Prisons are the focus of most of the discussion about criminal justice reform, even though 20 times more inmates (12 million) pass through our jails each year compared to our prisons. The jail population is different from prisons because most jail inmates are nonviolent offenders awaiting trial, and innocent in the eyes of the law. <br> We see time and time again that overincarceration tears families apart by locking up fathers, mothers, brothers, and daughters mostly for minor crimes. The vast majority of people in our jails are there for nonviolent offenses like traffic violations or drug use. When they are finally released, most have lost their jobs, which leaves them unable to support their families and puts stress on their loved ones and the community. <br> There is a broad consensus on both left and right that our criminal justice system is failing us, and is in need of transformation. <br> We have worked over the last decade to build conservative support for criminal justice reform, rooted in our political views as well as our faith. <br> A cornerstone of the Catholic faith is that redemption is available to everyone, no matter what they have done. We are all sinners, and the ground is level at the foot of the Cross. 
 You should get to know the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is only polite, because the IRS wants to get to know you better. Much better. Soon. If President Obama is re-elected his ObamaCare legislation will continue to go into effect step by step.You already know about the 20 taxes, many conveniently phased in after the 2010 and 2012 elections: The rationing board or IPAB that will decide how much health care older Americans really need; taxes go up on medical devices; If you have a flexible savings account or health savings account, new taxes damage your insurance. But most Americans are not yet aware of the role the IRS will play in enforcing ObamaCare. Whenever the federal government wants to make us do something the easiest enforcement agency are the nice folks at the IRS and they are preparing the paperwork to police your health care decisions so they fit Washington’s plans. <br> One wonders if ObamaCare's mandate is a good idea, why it was delayed? Obama and those Democratic Senators and Congressmen who voted for ObamaCare appear to think you might not be happy with what happens in 2014 and they prefer you come face to face with the non-negotiable mandate after you vote in 2012. So what does happen in 2014 if Obama wins? What is he hiding? To help out American taxpayers who like to be prepared, today Americans for Tax Reform released the projected tax form that will be required of all American citizens not presently in prison. You can view and print out your projected IRS form at www.ObamacareTaxForm.com. The Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare forces all Americans to buy a health insurance plan deemed “qualified” by the Department of Health and Human Services. The HHS bureaucracy will decide what your insurance will include.You don’t get to choose. The old slogan that if you liked your health insurance you could keep it was suckers bait and is “no longer operative.” As they said in Animal House—you screwed up kid, you trusted him.<br /> If you don’t buy the insurance Washington tells you that you have to pay a tax penalty ranging from $695 to $2085 or higher depending on the size of your family. The dollar amount will grow over time. So the IRS form will require that you certify that you had Uncle Sam-mandated insurance each and every month of the year.You will have to disclose your personal identifying health ID number, the nature of the insurance and any information from your health insurance card the IRS regulations demand in the future. Now if you are a prisoner in a federal penitentiary or an undocumented immigrant or a welfare recipient you don’t have to pay the tax penalty. You might want to print out the form---based on the legislation and congressional testimony where they explained everything ObamaCare will require you and your family to do—to begin the process of reporting everything toWashington.You will note that because an estimated 6 million Americans will be forced to pay the tax as they are unable or unwilling to buy the health insurance demanded by the federal government, they will find that penalties and interest payments will pile up over time. It is best to prepare now to save up to pay these taxes and to open your personal health ID information to be shared with the nice government workers at the IRS. They are just doing what the law commands. And we will have to also. Or you could vote in such a way that the IRS forms will go into the dustbin of history. 
 We are just one week away from the Iowa Caucuses. The presumed front runner last year at this time? Jeb Bush. Or rather “Jeb!” as his campaign has dubbed him, hoping to add a little excitement to the mix (and possibly to underplay his famous last name.) &nbsp; <br> Not only are his poll numbers far from where his supporters thought they would be by now, Jeb is also acting as spoiler, destroying the candidate most likely to beat Hillary Clinton. In doing so, it appears his nasty campaign against Marco Rubio has wrecked his own chances. In clobbering his popular rival and one-time mentee, Bush has shown himself either incapable of bucking the operatives running his Super PAC, or full of baloney. <br> For months, Jeb Bush publicly agonized over whether he should run for president. Bush worried that he would be forced into the political gutter, claiming that he would only run if his campaign could focus “on the issues.” He was eager to lay out his prescriptions for solving the country’s ills, to push education and tax reform, for instance, but not keen to engage in a cage match with the other contestants. He wanted to run “joyfully” because he thought the country needed a candidate who would “lift the country’s spirits.” <br> Some of the ads target Rubio’s attendance record in the Senate, and his numerous missed votes. Some paint him a flip-flopper, changing positions with the shifting political winds. And then there was a cheesy ad mocking Rubio’s boots, of all things, which surely was another rung down into the gutter. (In fairness, the New York Times ran no less than four pieces on Rubio’s boots.) <br> Has the assault on Rubio helped Bush? Certainly not in Iowa, where R2R has spent $8.5 million blasting Rubio. In that state, Bush is languishing in fifth place with only 3 percent of the vote, compared to 14 percent going to Rubio and 37 percent to Trump. In more moderate New Hampshire, a state where the Bush-Rubio rivalry is critical to both campaigns, the Bush Super PAC has spent $7.5 million attacking Rubio. <br> Perhaps more important, the attack ads haven’t helped Bush nationally. Back in September the former Florida governor claimed an almost 10 percent support amongst GOP primary voters; now he’s under 5 percent. In terms of how voters see Bush, the news is not good. Some 54 percent have an unfavorable view of Jeb compared to 32 percent who see him more kindly. <br> Jeb Bush has disappointed followers who expected him to run as he had promised, on solving the nation’s issues. As a successful governor of a successful state, Bush brings gravitas and stature to the race. He has also disappointed those who expected Bush’s ability to raise huge early money to put him and keep him out front; Donald Trump upended those expectations, and every other aspect of the race. <br> The most likely answer is that he won by being himself, not the puppet of his Super PAC. Though there is supposed to be clear distance between the campaign and R2R, Murphy’s influence is undoubted. Murphy and Bush have worked together on campaigns since 1997; Murphy claimed in a Bloomberg interview, “I understand what Jeb wants, I understand what kind of campaign he wants…” So, was Bush’s promise of a “joyous” campaign utter bunk, or has he been hijacked by his operatives? <br> That was not Bush’s only awkward campaign moment. Like Hillary Clinton chastising the banks that pay her so well, the more inauthentic Jeb becomes, the more likely he is to flop. Perhaps that’s why he can barely deliver a sentence that doesn’t include a verbal hitch. In his head, he is thinking one thing, but his directors have him saying another. <br> Take back control of the campaign, ditch the nastiness, and he might have a shot. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 Burger King’s decision to acquire Tim Horton’s, a Canadian purveyor of coffee and doughnuts, is a good business move but its choice to locate the newly created company's corporate headquarters north of the border is the direct result of President Obama’s anti-business tax policies. <br> McDonald’s is getting into coffee—a high margin business—in a big way, and Tim Horton’s java knowledge offers Burger King the opportunity to do the same. <br> Also, Burger King could apply its knowledge of foreign franchising and restaurant regulations to expand Tim Horton’s limited global footprint, as rival Dunkin’ Brands is doing in Asia. <br> In the second quarter of this year, Burger King’s federal and state income taxes were 24 percent of its operating costs and 34 percent of its profits. Locating in Canada would cut those figures by up to 25 percent. <br> What American businesses actually pay in federal and state income taxes varies a lot, thanks to many exemptions, deductions and provisions to delay taxes on foreign earnings; however, the average combined U.S. and foreign tax burden on profits is about 30 percent, whereas the average for foreign rivals is about 23 percent. <br> If Congress doesn’t act, Lew is threatening to bypass Congress and make tax inversions illegal by “reinterpreting” tax laws—likely as suits the convenience of Obama’s political agenda. <br> A 2013 study undertaken by a European think tank ranked the United States 94th out of 100, right after Zimbabwe, for its impact on business competitiveness. No wonder the U.S. economy is not creating enough jobs. <br> It is no accident that telecom companies, which are highly regulated entities, are big donors to the Democratic Party. In fact, the home of Comcast’s CEO is one of the president’s favorite fund raising venues. <br> As Lew’s recent actions demonstrate, that will come down to burdening firms led by Republicans paying even higher taxes and dolling out advantages to industries whose management support the Democratic Party. <br> Nothing will change until we get a president with some understanding of business and a treasury secretary with some sense of shame. 
 President Obama, as promised, is changing America. High taxes and enforcement abuses are driving businesses and ordinary citizens to leave the country altogether. <br> The United States stands alone among industrialized countries by requiring U.S. businesses to pay taxes on profits from overseas operations and investments—in addition to taxes paid to foreign governments. <br> Of course, what American corporations actually pay varies a lot, thanks to many exemptions, deductions and provisions to delay taxes; however, the average combined U.S. and foreign tax burden on profits is about 30 percent, whereas the average for foreign rivals is about 23 percent. <br> Ordinary citizens permanently living and working abroad also must pay U.S. and foreign taxes, face burdensome dual filing requirements and abusive penalties. U.S. tax laws can impose penalties of more than $1 million on unpaid taxes of as little as $20,000. <br> Imagine trying to run a small sales organization or live and work in Rome without a local banking account to pay bills. <br> Recent IRS abuses of American businesses, taxpayers and non-profits for political views and contributions -- and Justice Department reluctance to prosecute malefactors -- only add to perceptions that the U.S. tax system makes America no place to do business. And increasing numbers of businesses and individuals are making that choice. <br> Similarly, private citizens living abroad -- unable to obtain bank services, faced with huge tax and compliance costs, and the risk that even a hangnail error or whispered politically incorrect view could put them in the cross-hairs of the IRS -- are disavowing their U.S. citizenship. <br> Democrats and Republicans alike say they want tax reform, but Obama is unwilling to reduce the overall tax burdens. He only wants to move around and reduce certain deductions but maintain or increase revenues. 
 At the start of 2015 President Obama had a goal: use the blunt force of taxation to effectively kill 529 college savings plans. <br> It was a spectacular failure. The public backlash against his proposal was immediate, heartfelt, and fierce. <br> As the year comes to a close the Obama administration would prefer we all just forget the whole ordeal. There is scant coverage of the issue in beltway journalists’ end of year look-backs. But it is important to review what happened not as a way to spike the football, but as a lesson of what the Left might do to your savings if given full control of the federal government. <br> One of the reporters on the call provided the document to Americans for Tax Reform, whose tax policy director Ryan Ellis published a late night analysis ringing the alarm bell on the Obama 529 tax. <br> It took the mainstream media nearly a week to realize what was happening. On Jan. 22 the New York Times finally reported on the issue with an article headlined, “White House Proposals on 529 College Savings Plans Would Reduce Benefits.” On Jan. 23, the Washington Post came out with a piece titled “Critics Pounce on Obama’s Plan to Cut the Tax Benefits of 529 College Savings Plans,” and POLITICO deemed 529s “The Hot New Tax Debate.” <br> Embarrassingly for the White House, at the same time Team Obama was calling 529s “upside down,” “ineffective,” and “tilted towards the upper end,” Ellis and ATR rolled out a series of items detailing official White House and Obama family experience with 529s that told a different story. <br> It was also revealed that in July 2010, during a lengthy interview on ABC's Good Morning America, Obama cited his own 529 accounts as an example of how he can identify with the middle class. He was asked, Can you feel the pain directly that other Americans are feeling?&nbsp;His answer: <br> The hits kept coming. It turns out the Obama White House was for 529s before it was against them. <br> 529 plans are an attractive and convenient means of saving for college.</i> <br> “Today I want to highlight one program in particular, Section 529 savings plans. </i> <br> An official White House statement from the same day praised 529s as “a convenient, tax-preferred way for families to save for college.” <br> On Jan. 27, 2015 public pressure reached fever pitch. An unnamed White House official told the New York Times the 529 tax hike would be dropped. The 529 issue had become a “distraction,” said the official. <br> Even after formally dropping the 529 tax hike from the budget, the White House stood firm in support of the policy itself. During the Jan. 28 White House press briefing the following exchange took place: <br> White House spokesman Eric Schultz: “Sure. We do.” <br> A fitting coda. The tax is dead. For now. 
 Monday's announcement by President Obama that he wants Congress to extend tax cuts for middle class families earning under $250,000 for one year is a vivid demonstration of his campaign taking the initiative in the 2012 race. <br> The president's one year tax cut is for Americans making under $250,000. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) want the tax cut to apply to those making $1 million or less. <br> Monday's announcemet is a huge win for the president and a clear indication that the Romney campaign was once again backfooted. <br> So far he hasn't done it. 
 So the fondest Washington hopes for a grand debt-limit deal have broken down over taxes. House Speaker John Boehner said late Saturday that he couldn't move ahead with a $4 trillion deal because President Obama was insisting on a $1 trillion tax increase, and the White House quickly denounced House Republicans for scuttling debt reduction and preventing the very wealthiest and special interests from paying their fair share. <br> We think Mr. Boehner is making the sensible choice. No one wants to reform the tax code more than we do, but passing a $1 trillion tax increase first on the promise of tax reform later is a political trap. If the president were really sincere about reform and a willingness to keep the top tax rate at or below 35%, he'd negotiate that at the same time he does a debt deal. Mr. Boehner will have a hard enough time getting any debt-limit increase through the House, much less one that raises tax rates. <br> The following editorial appeared in today's Wall Street Journal.

 With frustration building over Washington’s refusal to behave in the public interest, perhaps it’s worth noting a drastic solution tried by the Irish. <br> The measure to abolish the Seanad lost by just 42,500 votes out of more than 1,226,000 cast (51.8 percent to 48.2 percent). <br> [pullquote] <br> The Republican Governors Association (RGA) has produced a video in which five Republican governors highlight successes in their respective states. <br> Bobby Jindal (Louisiana) who wants you to know that his state’s GDP has grown by $36 billion since 2008, nearly twice the national rate. That puts Louisiana eighth best in the country and third best in the South. <br> John Kasich (Ohio) closed an $8 billion shortfall without raising taxes and cut taxes by $3 billion. He eliminated the “death tax,” modernized Medicaid, eliminated the bureaucratic Department of Development and created a private, nonprofit corporation — JobsOhio — to “respond to job creators’ needs at their pace instead of at ‘the speed of statute.’” <br> Nikki Haley (South Carolina) pushed through tax reform on small businesses, which she claims, resulted in South Carolina having the fastest growing manufacturing sector on the East Coast and creating 38,000 new jobs, which have contributed $9 billion in new investment. <br> Oh, and those “controversial” union reforms that caused demonstrations at the state capital two years ago? Gov. Walker says those reforms saved the state more than $2 billion. <br> The “American Comeback” campaign should resonate with those who long for an economically, politically and culturally sound America, something we do not have under the Obama administration. <br> Real problem-solving is taking place in states headed by Republicans. If you’re tired of the bickering, turn away from dysfunctional Washington, follow their lead and emulate their successes. 
 Saturday, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum affirmed his support for Bruce Jenner as a transgender woman,<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.cnn.com_2015_05_04_politics_rick-2Dsantorum-2Dbruce-2Djenner-2Dtransgender_d=BQMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=H-YxWUs17R9RDLYYXfOsy985BTjGUtlMRiPRguX9sE4s=NsdheB70HM01lU8v0sRgFZtQ5_F-n1cUiITRLxkKQXYe=" target="_blank">explaining: “My responsibility as a human being is to love and accept everybody. Not to criticize people for who they are.” <br> This compassionate response defied the expectations of Republican intolerance fueled by liberal media outlets who continue to wildly speculate<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.huffingtonpost.com_dean-2Dhamer-2Dand-2Djoe-2Dwilson_how-2Dbruce-2Djenner-2Dcould-2Dre-5Fb-5F7148038.htmld=BQMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=H-YxWUs17R9RDLYYXfOsy985BTjGUtlMRiPRguX9sE4s=CEeBouMqmvgphR2l81ARMlqe4qlkgAvjFyamoceI1RMe=" target="_blank">whether the GOPisreadyto embrace atransgenderRepublican celebrity. Support from Republicans such as Santorum suggests that members of the GOP are indeed ready and willing to do so. <br> But there’s another question thatnobody has asked yet:Areliberalsreadyto accept a proud, highly-public LGBT Republican? So far, it seems the answer isno. <br> But conservative support for marriage equality—and, by extension, identifying as a gay ortransgenderRepublican—isn’t as counterintuitive as it might seem. <br> At Log Cabin Republicans, we believe there isnoconflict between conservative principles and our endorsement of civil marriage equality. Rather, our group holds that legal same-sex marriage is a natural extension of the conservative doctrines of limited government, individual liberty, and a strong family unit. <br> Case in point:Santorum is just the latest Republican to receive Jenner with tolerance and compassion.Strident voices in the Republican Partyhave hadnoproblem acceptingJenneras a faithful conservative. <br> These reactions focus on supporting shared interests—low taxes, broadening the Republican base—rather than exacerbating points of difference. &nbsp; <br> AsoneTwitter user emphatically<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.nationalreview.com_article_417543_tolerant-2Dliberals-2Dstart-2Dinsulting-2Dbruce-2Djenner-2Dwhen-2Dhe-2Dsays-2Dhes-2Dconservatived=BQMFaQc=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQr=kaAUPcZhpO1MvBc6jwa0VBiGZWXka6ART1tFuyQjLfcm=H-YxWUs17R9RDLYYXfOsy985BTjGUtlMRiPRguX9sE4s=azFqvB6XIR7GwWJiQlhntrl8zV3Um7P-nfP7LSf-g7Ae=" target="_blank">explained, “#BruceJenner I was with ya til i [sic] read you’re a conservative Republican.No,no,no...” <br> The closed-minded responses from the political left belie its reputation of tolerance and inclusion. And the implications of this stunning liberal hypocrisy are dangerous. <br> Consider the recent backlash that ensued when two gay advocates hosted a meeting for presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The gathering was purportedly intended as an opportunity to discuss gay rights and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. Sen. Cruz and his hotelier hosts disagreed on the former subject, but were in consensus on the latter. <br> The reasons for boycotting businesses owned by Ian Reisner abound, but being in conversation with someone with whom you may not entirely agree is notoneof those reasons. Instead, it’s precisely this kind of dialogue—characterized by a mutual willingness to reach across the aisle—that should be lauded, rather than criticized. <br> Conservatives appearreadyto acceptBruceJenneras atransgendermember of theGOP—indeed,support keeps growing. Can theliberalswhoquestionconservative inclusion say the same? 
 Spring cleaning is a healthy tradition. If only politicians did it! <br> When Barack Obama ran for president, he promised to clean house, I'm not a Democrat who believes that we can or should defend every government program just because it's there. There are some that don't work. <br> I cheered when I heard that! But politicians always say they'll get rid of waste. Then, once in power, they spend more. Obama sure has. <br> We just need to cut back! said Obama, the candidate. He promised to end waste at the Economic Development Agency and the Export-Import Bank that's become little more than a fund for corporate welfare.&nbsp; <br> Yet both programs thrive: The Ex-Im Bank just gave another $8 billion to Boeing, and the EDA spent $2 million to build a wine-tasting room and culinary amphitheater. <br> Both the left and right denounce the other party's spending, but expensive waste is supported by both. Neither party makes much effort to cut farm subsidies or NASA -- or to end subsidies for big corporations, the people who need it least. <br> On my Fox Business show Stossel (Thursdays 9- 10 pm ET) this week, he points out that the Pentagon destroyed $7 billion worth of weapons in Afghanistan and Iraq instead of shipping them home. That just shows you the inefficiency, says Coburn. <br> Welfare for businesses is even more harmful than welfare for poor people, because it kills the free enterprise that creates real prosperity. <br> Centrally planned economies bring stagnation and poverty. <br> Today I worry even more about the sheer <i>quantity of rules. There are now 170,000 pages of federal laws and many more local rules. If you can't get a job, there's a good chance that this spider web of regulations is the reason why. <br> I'd be <i>afraid to build a serious business. Today's laws are so complex even the lawyers don't understand them. <br> So now that spring is about to arrive, let's give government that overdue cleaning. Eliminate half the 170,000 pages of federal laws, scrap useless Cabinet departments, and cut the $4 trillion in spending in half. We could move about so much more freely if our lives weren't buried in government's junk. <br> Clean this stuff away! <br> To clean house, pass the Stossel Rule. It's simple: For every new regulation bureaucrats pass, they must repeal five old ones. 
 Tom Price, the new chairman of the House Budget Committee, has just released the GOP budget blueprint for the years ahead this week. This will have a big impact on how the government spends more than 20 percent of our economy, and where the revenues will come from to fund this behemoth operation. <br> Mr. Price tells me: “My budget stays faithful to the budget caps. We repeal ObamaCare. We eliminate hundreds of programs. We make room for tax reform. And we block grant many of the welfare programs back to the states.” The goal here, the Georgia Republican says, “is faster economic growth and more spending discipline. That is what our party should stand for. <br> It's pretty much the antithesis of the Obama budget that was released last month. President Obama wants to grow the government by $500 billion through 2017 and raise tax rates across the board on workers, investors and employers to pay for it. Mr. Price doesn't run from that fight. He ‎tells the White House, in effect: Bring it on. Just three months ago voters went to the polls and flat out rejected the Obama-Pelosi-Reid vision of income redistribution and government expansionism in Washington. <br> Holding the sequester is essential to keeping the budget under control. Before the sequester, federal expenditures from 2007-11 exploded by $874 billion, a one-third blowout rise in spending. But with the sequester in place, federal outlays have fallen by $168 billion – a 16 percent decline relative to inflation. <br> Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote last week in the Wall Street Journal that “the country cannot meet its national security responsibility within the caps on defense spending imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act (BCA) and sequestration.” <br> Only inside Washington is that considered a cut. <br> Mr. Obama desperately wants to repeal the spending caps and sequester as well. He calls it a “mindless” budget reduction tool because it cuts spending across the board. But this is only because the White House and Congress won’t cut spending in any other responsible way. <br> Mr. Price has it right. One of the greatest long-term threats to our nation’s security is our out-of-control economy -- our massive $4 trillion budget and the $18 trillion national debt that keeps growing by nearly $1 trillion a year. As Ronald Reagan taught us all so well: When you’re weak at home, you’re weak abroad.” <br> Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who supports more money for the Pentagon, says this budget is “a defining moment for our party.” But if fiscal restraint, balanced budgets, growth and tax cuts don’t define the GOP, what does? 
 The bottom line on Emailgate? It won’t move the needle. <br> Who are these stalwarts? Women. Women who think Hillary Clinton deserves to be the next president, because she has worked so hard for so long to land that plum assignment. Women who feel Hillary is held to a higher standard, who feel sorry for her, who believe she is the perfect candidate to shatter what she has called the “highest and hardest glass ceiling.” <br> Women like Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, who says of her: She's more than an idol … She's an inspiration … <br> This strategy was evident in her carefully scripted comments at the U.N. press conference. She deleted her personal emails, she said, because she wanted personal communications – about matters such as planning Chelsea’s wedding or her mother’s funeral – to remain private. <br> Here’s the problem: Women won’t get Hillary elected. While becoming the first woman president might have been a strong playing card in 2008, when she ran against the man who would become the first African-American president, the moment has passed. She can show up at another hundred women’s conferences over the next year – and it looks as though she will – but she will only be cementing the ardor of a group already in her column. What she needs is men, and in particular white men. <br> More specifically, the Post reported, “non-white men and women are pretty similar when it comes to the former secretary of state, but while 58 percent of white women back Clinton, 54 percent of white men oppose her.” This polarization is not new; in 2008 a survey showed that in a match-up with John McCain, Hillary’s backing would split along similar lines. <br> Both could happen. Hillary’s feminist message seems a bit stale, especially for the younger generations, who have fewer grievances. Equal pay is the law of the land, and many of the once hot-button issues (like access to contraception) have been resolved. Some think there is actually a backlash brewing that has generated, for instance, more than 32,000 “likes” for a Facebook page called Women Against Feminism. <br> Meanwhile, men could be forgiven if they are tiring of hearing about the travails of women – especially as they see females earning 60 percent of college and graduate degrees, holding 52 percent of all professional-level jobs, and enjoying lower unemployment. <br> Society has focused on obstacles faced by women in recent years, and rightly so. The attention has paid off. While there remain opportunity gaps, American women have made enormous strides. This is not the case in many other countries, where there is much work to do. But Hillary wants to be the president of the U.S., not Kuwait. Her zeal is impressive, but voters may regard other issues – like jobs, tax reform, unsustainable entitlement programs and terrorism – as equally important. <br> Hillary’s emails won’t do her in. But she could be in trouble nonetheless. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 The president did what he had to do. He delivered a well-written, well-crafted speech that hit all the right notes and drew the appropriate applause lines. <br> There were indeed the gestures towards bipartisanship lawmaking and a shift away from the brinksmanship that has paralyzed our system that we heard from Obama on the campaign trail, in his inaugural address and during the fiscal cliff negotiations. But these points fell flat when considering that there has been no genuine desire and willingness to achieve bipartisanship or to call on the Republicans for any bargain that would produce immediate legislative results from the president. <br> To be sure, bipartisan lawmaking is what we need. As I have argued for years and in my latest book, we are on the brink of collapse due to the divisiveness that dominates our legislative system. To this end, President Obama failed to tell us how we will achieve it, especially considering the divisiveness of Washington politics today. <br> It follows that while Tuesday night’s State of the Union was a great speech, to see it as anything other than a reiteration of the themes that the president has articulated previously would be a mistake. <br> The real question then becomes, can the Republicans offer a credible alternative to the president’s vision for America? <br> But make no mistake, it is the president’s night and it will always be the president’s night. 
 Why is President Obama asking for “Authorization for Use of Military Force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant”? Why ask for permission to carry on with operations that have been underway for more than six months and that are permitted under a 2001 authorization that is still in place? Because he doesn’t know what else to do. <br> As many have noted, he has been unwilling even to identify our enemy as Islamist extremists or to acknowledge that this is a religious confrontation. Though he has made the case that our coalition forces are holding the line against ISIS’ further advance, Americans are not so sure we are making progress. They are more impressed by the horrifying murders perpetrated by the ISIS savages, and they want more from their president. <br> Meanwhile, the unnerving battle against terrorism threatens to upset the president’s legacy pursuit here in his final innings. Each time Mr. Obama reveals another leftist agenda item, ISIS rolls out another barbaric video. In the public’s imagination, free community colleges are no match for the incineration of a Jordanian pilot. The murder of Kayla Mueller trumps increased maternity leave. Unwillingly, Mr. Obama keeps being dragged back to the Middle East. <br> President Obama has decided that he will bring Congress in to debate the merits of his still unformed strategy, specifically to argue about the circumstances under which our military will continue to battle ISIS. <br> The John McCain wing wants an all-out assault on the enemy, wherever they are, by whatever means we have at our disposal. Take no prisoners. <br> With good reason, Mr. Obama is confident that his will emerge as the voice of reason. <br> At the same time, requesting this authorization will allow Mr. Obama to embellish his favorite meme — that Congress has prevented him from carrying out his agenda. But for the Republicans on the Hill, he has often claimed, he would have enacted measures that would have added even more jobs, slowed the rise of the oceans, boosted the middle class and burnished our image overseas. <br> Americans are fed up with Obama’s tendency to go it alone — his executive action on immigration, for instance — and they are ready for a change. Nothing could be more damaging for Mr. Obama’s legacy (or for his party, though that appears a secondary concern) than the emergence of a unified, successful, responsible Republican Party. Such a renewal would pave the way to electing a GOP president next year who might well roll back the most unsavory aspects of ObamaCare, or EPA regulations — undoing Obama’s most cherished programs. That he cannot tolerate. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 House Speaker John Boehner said something noteworthy at the recent House Republican retreat on Maryland’s Eastern Shore: “It’s important that we show the American people we’re not just the opposition party, we’re actually the alternative party.” <br> However, opposing only gets you half the way there; blocking the other side’s forward motion is not the same as making forward motion yourself. So yes, opposing is fine—but winning is better. And winning, as Boehner said, requires the power of a superior alternative. <br> Continuing, Boehner added, “We’ve passed dozens of bills this year to help the economy, to help improve education, improve energy production in America”—but then noted that most of these bills then went into limbo in the Democratically-controlled Senate. <br> Boehner also declared, “Republicans have to do more to talk about the better solutions we think we have that will help the American people grow their wages and opportunities at a better job and clearly have a better shot at the American dream.” <br> Yes, ObamaCare may continue to unravel, and yes, the economy may be softening. Even The New York Times had to concede that the recent jobs report was “a disappointing showing that is likely to spur fears that the labor market is poised for yet another slowdown.&nbsp; <br> For example, there’s a decent chance that Obama will approve the Keystone Pipeline. And if he doesn’t, well, Republicans have effectively framed the Keystone debate as a jobs issue, and jobs are popular; a recent poll found that 56 percent of Americans support the pipeline, while just 41 percent oppose it. So for the sake of the Democrats in Congress, Obama would be well advised to endorse the pipeline. <br> In other words, lower the rate and broaden the base, in the same way that Ronald Reagan worked with Congressional Democrats to enact tax reform in 1986. (I am the co-chair of the RATE Coalition, a bipartisan group working to make the U.S. corporate tax code more competitive.) <br> But Democrats have other issues. For example, there’s health care, specifically, national health insurance. That’s been a core Democratic issue, going back to the 1940s, when President Truman first proposed it, later followed, of course, by President Clinton in the 1990s. And without a doubt, the cause of national health insurance helped Obama win in 2008. <br> Still, for Republicans, there’s the issue of providing an alternative. Can Republicans do it? The answer seems to be, yes, they can. <br> “The Patient CARE proposal repeals Obamacare and focuses on targeted reforms that will lower costs and expand access to quality care. We can lower costs and expand access to quality coverage and care by empowering individuals and their families to make their own health care decisions, rather than empowering the government to make those decisions for them.” <br> Yet that could change; The Washington Post recently reported on a statistical model that showed that the GOP has a better-than-even chance of winning the Senate this November. <br> We might further note that health care consists of a lot more than insurance. Even more fundamental is the issue of health itself. As noted here at Fox News Opinion last February, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor spoke out on the value of cures: <br> In other words, medical research and cures are the key to holding down health care costs. The logic is simple: To cite just one medical example, if tens of millions of Americans develop Alzheimer’s Disease, then the costs will be so astronomical—some $1 trillion a year by mid-century—as to overwhelm any kind of health insurance at all, public or private. <br> Earlier this month, House Energy Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, (R-Mich.), added his public voice to the cure-cause. Upton took note of a new collaboration between 10 big pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health, aimed at achieving breakthrough cures for dreaded diseases, including Alzheimer’s, diabetes, lupus, and arthritis. <br> “The search for cures must be an all-hands-on-deck effort. This landmark effort exemplifies the very best of a public-private collaboration, and we in Congress also want to do what we can in the name of breakthrough research.” <br> Republicans now have a double-barreled approach to health care. Thanks to Burr, Coburn, and Hatch, they have a solid ObamaCare alternative. And thanks to Cantor and Upton, they have a new vision of cures and hope. <br> After that, the Republican challenge will be to find a strong messenger who can keep faith with familiar GOP issues while also carrying the new double health care message into the 2016 presidential election. 
 Is President Obama trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run? That’s one take-away from his feisty State of the Union address, in which Mr. Obama did three things: first, he moved the Democratic agenda far to the left, where Hillary is not entirely comfortable; second, he rebuffed the clear preference of voters that he work with Congress, by making the cornerstone of his address proposals unacceptable to the GOP and third, he assured the country that our foreign policy (Hillary’s foreign policy) is working. <br> None of these messages works for Hillary. <br> Mr. Obama’s focus on the middle class is unsurprising. Lagging income growth for the average American has emerged as the likely debate in 2016, for good reason. The numbers show that during the Obama recovery, the middle class has, as Joe Biden put it, been “left behind.” <br> Despite Americans listing job creation as their number one concern for the past six years, putting people to work has never been President Obama’s priority. He has not encouraged businesses to hire, either through reducing tax rates on employers or by expanding business opportunities – through trade, or reduced regulations, for instance. <br> As of this SOTU address, he has doubled down, since many of the suggested tax hikes will land on small companies that pay taxes as individuals, and as his proposed sick pay and maternity leave will raise the costs of hiring. Such policies have led to labor participation rates that are still bumping along historical lows, a crisis in our disability program, and stagnant wages. A short course in economics might help the White House: a tighter jobs market will raise wages. The government raising wages will put people out of work. It’s that simple. <br> It’s a tired song, and Americans have never bought the program. <br> The tax proposals outlined by President Obama are old school, and dead on arrival in the Republican Congress, as he well knows. Congress has indicated an eagerness to work with the president on tax reform, but has prioritized changing the dysfunctional corporate tax code. <br> This is a slap at Hillary, for two reasons. First, Hillary is unquestionably uncomfortable putting on a progressive cloak. <br> Hillary is a successful, wealthy woman who pretends otherwise and stubs her toe on money issues, such as when she described herself and her husband as “dead broke” upon leaving the White House. Also, Hillary has difficulty distancing herself from Wall Street; the Wall Street Journal has reported that she and her husband have raised nearly $5 million from Goldman Sachs alone. <br> Voters have shown they want the government to function – to repair our infrastructure, reform our dreadful tax code, to compete more effectively with our trading rivals, to streamline our outdated government agencies. <br> Voters do not like the president’s “go it alone” program; they understand why the nation’s founders included those pesky checks and balances. Obama will make it more difficult for any Democrat trying to succeed him to convince voters that he or she will “work across the aisle” – a claim that Hillary might actually credibly make. <br> His embarrassing absence in Paris, his waffle on Syria, his underestimation of ISIS – it all speaks to his pretense that we have won the War on Terror. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 Some crank apparently has it in for John Boehner. No, I’m not talking about Ted Yoho; rather, the bartender who supposedly threatened to poison the House Speaker’s drinks – a low blow. Seems like there’s no end of folks eager to attack the GOP leader. <br> They failed, but in the process they gave wounded Democrats ample fodder for ridicule. They also steered the narrative away from the popular programs mainstream Republicans hope to pursue and that Americans hunger for. <br> The pundit chorus should stand down. While they were sniping over his tactics, the New York Times reports that Boehner participated in some 150 campaign events during 2014, raised $102 million — and transferred $23 million from his own political action committee to the National Republican Campaign Committee. That GOP majority that conservatives accuse Boehner of squandering — he helped build it. <br> Florida Rep. Daniel Webster, who came closest to ousting the speaker (which is to say, not very close), is considered a moderate by most of the organizations that rate such things. For instance, the Heritage Foundation gives him a 56 percent score — lower than the 61 percent rating accorded the average House member. Still, the dissension was embarrassing. <br> Over the past several years, Boehner has mollified the right by allowing more than 50 votes to repeal ObamaCare, a symbolic undertaking that most of the country rightly views as a waste of time. <br> Most recently, the far right is furious over Boehner’s endorsement of the Cromnibus. The rebellious group in the House wanted Boehner to stall passage of the government’s omnibus funding bill — shut down the government — in retaliation for Obama’s amnesty measure. As usual, they never articulated how this would help the GOP, or the country. And, by the way, the dissidents were not even united on this approach; Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, one of the right’s ringleaders, actually voted for the Cromnibus. <br> Some on the right dispute that, arguing that the GOP’s extraordinary sweep in the midterm elections proves that the 2013 shutdown failed to harm the brand. They are wrong; it took an unbelievable cascade of disasters emanating from the White House to turn around GOP fortunes. <br> Polling after the 2013 GOP-led government shutdown showed that 80 percent of Americans — 8 in 10 — opposed the move. And, not just Democrats were teed off. Two-thirds of Republicans and independents who lean right disapproved of the gesture. Because that’s what it was — a futile gesture. <br> Having U.S. credit downgraded over political uncertainty summed up the damage. Worst of all — throughout the fracas, President Obama’s approval ratings were untouched, while approval of Republicans sank to an all-time low of 32 percent; 63 percent of the country held an unfavorable view of the party. It doesn’t get much worse than that. <br> The GOP cannot become complacent. <br> Another survey showed that 50 percent of millennials consider themselves independents, an unheard-of desertion of our political parties. Those votes, come 2016, are up for grabs. <br> My guess? He’s just getting started. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 Last week's largest decline in the stock market since October 2008 combined with zero growth in employment in August will certainly re-ignite a debate about what the federal government can and should do to get the economy moving and reduce unemployment. In addressing this issue, it's important to learn from the past and focus on the future. <br> Relying primarily on additional deficit-financed government spending is not the answer to our problems. It's time to start treating the diseases rather than the symptoms. To do so, government policy must take steps to increase private sector lending, enable further refinancing of homes at today's historically low rates, and unleash the trillions of dollars of cash and long-term oriented investment capital held by businesses and institutional funds both domestically and internationally. These steps can be accomplished through changes in existing tax policies and regulatory approaches. <br> As we look to the future, the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction needs to exceed its $1.5 trillion 10-year deficit reduction target by taking credible actions based on the individual elements in the CBO's current law baseline. The federal government must also take concrete steps to provide more certainty to businesses regarding future tax policies and regulatory conditions. This means taking steps that will result in comprehensive tax reform and regulatory relief beginning in 2013. <br> It's time to quit trying to use 20th century strategies to deal with 21st century problems. We need to quit just living for today and to start taking steps to help create a better tomorrow. The time to start is now! 
 Now is the moment for the GOP to blink. A nervous world hopes and prays that the Congressional Deficit Committee aka the Super Committee will agree to serious measures to plug our yawning budget gap. <br> Why now? Because they have won the battle and now must win the war. <br> Today, after the pressure brought to bear on both Republicans and Democrats by disgusted taxpayers, realigning our revenues and outlays tops the nation’s agenda. Imagine: Democrats on the deficit committee are offering up six dollars of cuts for each dollar of revenue increase. The proposal smacks of capitulation. This would not have happened without the Tea Party and its Republican allies. <br> During the summer’s fractious debates over the debt ceiling limit, who could not but admire the resolution of Rep. Paul Ryan and others in Congress who pushed hard – successfully-- for unprecedented spending cuts. And, who resisted equally forcefully any offsetting tax hikes. <br> However, that battle left scars. The brinksmanship is blamed for adding to the insecurity of the nation and the downgrade of our triple-A credit status. Americans wonder: if cutting spending is so positive, why would it impair the standing of our bonds? <br> Americans are not stupid. They know our country is in trouble, and they want the problems fixed. They desperately want leaders who will address our needs – jobs, education, infrastructure, more jobs. They are also pretty sure that simply cutting government spending is not the answer. <br> Also, the country has been convinced – rightly so- of the need for tax reform. Republicans should take the high ground here, allow the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts for the top income brackets and at the same time push for serious tax reform, allowing a net increase in revenues. <br> Government spending is too high relative to GDP today, an excellent argument for cutting spending. However, because of the recession, revenues are also too low. While raising taxes during a slowdown is not appealing, the impact should be softened by having the increases take hold in 2013 or 2014. It doesn’t matter. <br> Our great country needs new leadership. Our jobless need hope, our workers need inspiration. President Obama provides neither. It is essential that Republicans provide both. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 “Today I had a chance to speak with John Boehner and congratulated Mitch McConnell on becoming the next Senate majority leader,” said Barack Obama in the opening of his White House press conference following the Democrats’ Tuesday massacre. “And I told them both that I look forward to finishing up this Congress’s business and then working together for the next two years to advance America’s business.” The president is looking forward to “working together to deliver for the American people.” <br> This begs the trillion-dollar question: Is Obama still relevant? Given the truly historic proportion of this Republican victory, is Barack Obama about to become the lamest of lame-ducks? <br> Before Republicans get too excited, I would caution that a president is never irrelevant, simply due to the sheer power of the office. We don’t call it the Bully Pulpit for nothing. There are plenty of muscles for the commander-in-chief to flex, even if the opposing party runs the fitness center. <br> I would point conservatives to a notable example from their presidential icon, Ronald Reagan. Six years into his presidency, in 1986, Ronald Reagan’s party likewise lost the Senate, and again lost the House. And yet, Reagan’s final two years were rich with success. He and Mikhail Gorbachev held four summits, in Geneva, Washington, Moscow, and New York. They signed history’s greatest nuclear-missile treaty: the INF Treaty. Domestically, Reagan reaped the benefits of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, a further boon to economic prosperity. <br> Could Republicans seek the same against Obama? I doubt it. Any attempt to do so, no matter the validity, would be met with the loudest wails of “racism” and everything and anything else from the progressive corner. <br> But while Barack Obama might not be the subject of Capitol Hill hearings, the Democrats’ presumptive nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton, likely will be. This seems inevitable, given that Benghazi demands continued investigation. But back to the Reagan analogy: Ronald Reagan generally enjoyed an excellent final two years from a policy standpoint, especially in foreign policy. Could Obama do the same? No, I don’t think so. Consider: <br> Domestically, his signature policy achievement, Obama-care, will be slowed if not stopped. It has now lost all momentum and assistance from the legislature. Obama is no longer on offense. That’s especially true given his pronounced inability to reach across the aisle over the past six years, an opposition he once called “hostage-takers.” <br> The rhetoric is nice, but given Obama’s ideology and perhaps psychology, I don’t foresee him suddenly becoming the great unifier, initiating a cascade of bipartisan triumphs. I can’t even imagine what those would be. <br> He will also hammer out a long-term liberal legacy with the courts, where he can help shape law and culture. Given the opportunity, he will seize the chance to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with another leftist in the mold (and youth) of Elena Kagan. The long-term impact on issues like religious freedom could be dismal. If Obama has made any particularly discernible “change,” it is in the courts. 
 Voter discontent will soon give Republicans control of the Senate, but Americans may quickly become dissatisfied with the new cast on Capitol Hill. <br> Here are five big challenges where public resistance stifles progress. <br> Voters can’t seem to accept that putting everyone to work would raise productivity and wages enough to offset paying a bit more for a coffee table or cell phone at Walmart. <br> Most voters seem unable to accept that those restrictions don’t reduce environmental risks but merely shift them to developing countries. <br> Income taxes could be junked in favor of a lower, value added tax that treats everyone the same, but Americans cling to their privileges. <br> Computers and sophisticated apps have eliminated many of those jobs, but Americans send half of high school graduates to college and many end up underemployed and terribly in debt. <br> Colleges should have fewer students and resources should be redirected into vocational education, but educators and parents won’t accept that most children should not go to college. <br> Republicans keep preaching vouchers and competition, and ObamaCare will drive up costs by subsidizing an already inferior system. <br> 6. Bureaucratic Bloat. State and municipal governments have amassed huge union dominated bureaucracies that make everything from keeping a car to putting up a backyard deck a morass of regulations and compliance. <br> Americans are correct to demand change but more gridlock in Washington is likely. <br> Still the Senate Republicans can hold hearings and encourage a bipartisan dialogue about how we could better manage globalization, energy, tax and other policies that need to change. <br> Reason can prevail—and that’s why the framers of the Constitution gave us a Senate. 
 There are a number of basic questions that will be answered very soon.We will know if Democratic control of theSenatecontinues and what kind of support President Obama willhavefor his agenda overthe next two years. <br> If the past six years area good guide – and I believe they are – we’re most likely to see more of the same. Confrontation and discord will continue to characterize inter-party dealings, and even intra-party dealings. <br> It follows that evenifRepublicans controltheSenate –the most likely outcome as final polling shows toss-up races across the country steadily shifting toward the Republicans – it is unlikely that they will be able to govern effectively. This is partly due to internal divisions that will make it difficult to come together in support of an agenda – orsignificant bills for that matter. <br> Compounding this problem is the fact that it’s extremely unlikely that President Obama will bedoinganything otherthan vetoing Republican bill after Republican bill. Considering that the president has shown little interest in compromising with Republican lawmakers over the course of his tenure, evenwhen Democrats had at least some control of the House, I can’t imagine a scenario wherein the legislation Republicans come up with on their own will become law. <br> House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthybluntly told a group of donors, “I do know this: If we don’t capture the House stronger, and the Senate, and prove we could govern, there won’t be a Republican president in 2016.” <br> There is much to be excited about in the agenda that Sen. Portman laid out. But there’s also very little reason to think that anything like that would even get enough Republican support to get to President Obama’s desk. <br> The president's promise todelivercomprehensive immigration reform after the election byway ofexecutive orderhas naturally ruffled feathers. McCarthyleft open the possibility of an immigration overhaul, but added that if the president approached it by executive order it would “stop everything.” <br> In other words, w e will be right back where we started. <br> Truth be told, there’s no reason for the Republicans to do anything differently. If they take the Senate, they will have managed to win the election without a clear plan or strategy. <br> It follows that the Republicantake-awayfrom thisvictorywill bethat the way to win in 2016 iswithmore attacks. 
 It’s almost surreal to imagine a time when a government so sharply divided between Republicans and Democrats could still get things done in Washington. Right now Americans see their elected officials lunging from one crisis to the next without ever seeming to accomplish much of anything. It’s true that political leaders are in a difficult time. They face a deteriorating conflict in Syria, a potential government shutdown over the budget, entitlements in desperate need of reform and finding solutions for poor economic conditions. Taken all together, it makes for a tough workload. <br> But as hard as it might be to believe, it isn’t anything that we haven’t seen before. <br> Clinton used his deft political skills to win reelection in 1996 after a difficult first four years in office, and then went on to lead Democrats to electoral success in 1998 even under the dark cloud of impeachment. Yes, the government did shut down in 1995, and yes, Congress impeached Clinton, but Republicans and Democrats in Washington found a way to overcome their political differences and govern. Talk about multitasking! It wasn’t easy and it wasn’t perfect, but Congress and the president found solutions to our nation’s problems without succumbing to political gridlock. The Washington we see today doesn’t need to be this way. Congress and the White House can and should reach a grand bargain on spending restraint, tax reform, entitlement modernization and a path to a balanced budget. Just think about how the American people would respond if the grand bargain that everyone knows needs to happen actually happened. It certainly wouldn’t be perfect, but it would provide certainty to an economy that is struggling. It would enable employers to focus on growing their business and creating job opportunities, and not trying to anticipate how Washington will impact their viability. Washington’s leaders were capable of multitasking then. They can multi-task now. And Americans should demand that they do so. 
 To add even more bite to the new “Contract from America” from a coalition of Tea Party activists, here are sound bites I recommend to spread the message.

 Thursday, Reince Priebus, the Dickensian-named Republican Party chairman, gave what he billed as a major address on “Principles for American Renewal.” <br> The performance brought to mind the vapid and sub-grammatical motto of Jebediah Springfield, fictional town father in Fox’s The Simpsons: “A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.” <br> Twenty years ago, the little-known House minority whip, Newt Gingrich, stood on the steps of the Capitol with scores of congressmen and candidates to announce the Contract With America. The pact’s bold ideas helped make the 1994 midterms a wave election and paved the way for welfare reform, balanced budgets, tax cuts, and stronger economic growth. Today, the conservatives again need new, bold, positive ideas. They can’t count on congressional bosses who have decided to play it safe. Those leaders believe that ObamaCare, scandals, foreign disasters, and voter fatigue will drag down the liberals this November. <br> Senator Harry Reid set the precedent for limiting filibusters. A Congress under new management should follow suit, sending popular measures to the White House on simple-majority votes. Let the liberals explain to the American people why they oppose reform. 
 President Obama greeted last week’s rotten news on unemployment by saying the economy is facing “serious headwinds.” It took him three-plus years to figure that out? <br> Fine, Obama took office in the teeth of the Great Recession, with businesses shedding jobs in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But that was three-plus years ago. <br> Then his party lost big in 2010 -- and he apparently gave up on doing anything to help the economy. He even ignored the recommendations of his bipartisan deficit-reduction panel -- including its push for tax reform, probably the best economic-growth idea to ever come near this White House. <br> Dodd-Frank almost assures that taxpayers will have to bail out the “too big to fail” banks in the next blowup, while heaping so many regulations on them that they aren’t lending to small business. For all the handouts given to people with underwater mortgages, housing prices remain depressed. And the twin culprits of the housing bubble, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, remain largely intact, still running up new taxpayer-backed debt. <br> They told us the stimulus would bring unemployment down to less than 6 percent by now; it’s 8.2 percent -- and rising. <br> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/nothing_but_excuses_Ggvp7jlCuTqEODdpcAEQpO">Click to read Charles Gasparino's complete column in the New York Post</i> 
 <b>The Mount Vernon Statement
 Frustration with efforts to get to the bottom of IRS targeting of conservative groups should illustrate to even the most ardent supporters of big government that the federal tax agency is dangerous to civil liberties, irrevocably broken and corrupting national politicians. <br> Thanks to presidential executive orders, the union representing IRS employees is deeply involved in the management of the agency. Its leaders have the self-proclaimed goal of doing whatever it takes to defeat conservative politicians. The union consults regularly with leading Democratic politicians—including President Obama—on electoral strategy. <br> Simply put, the IRS has cultivated a culture that encourages employees to exercise discretion in ways harmful to free speech and association. <br> The IRS is not a neutral tax-collecting institution but a collection of grass roots activists, enjoying virtually unchecked sovereign power to destroy the personal reputations and finances of those who oppose liberal ideas. It inflicts terror on ordinary Americans through the arbitrary and capricious interpretation of tax rules and onerous audits. <br> There is little hope of curbing such behavior or reforming the IRS when his colleagues in the Senate take no substantive action to censure him, and the mainstream media finds nothing much to investigate having learned about such egregious conduct. <br> Moreover, the present quagmire of incentives and disincentives from the agency distorts business investment decisions and consumer choices. It reduces economic growth and leaves all of us less satisfied with our lives. <br> Business and institutions would then pay to Treasury the taxes they collected minus sales taxes they paid on purchases of materials and equipment, rent and the like. This subtraction would avoid the double taxation of materials and create a “value-added tax” so often proposed by advocates of tax reform. <br> Individuals would file no tax return at all! <br> If Congress wants to spend more, it could raise the rates. That would make the cost of spending more on government activities completely transparent to all Americans. <br> Elegant, egalitarian and efficient, such a value-added tax without exemptions would give Americans the tax reforms they want but that privileged rich folks and big businesses spend a fortune forestalling. 
 As of Sunday, April first, the United States will have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. This new record is not something that would make most Americans proud. <br> The United States was in the middle of the pack when we last changed our rates in 1993. Since 2000, however, 30 of the world’s leading developed countries -- looking to boost their economies -- have cut their rates. <br> Canada cut its by 13 points. <br> Today the worldwide average is 25 percent. <br> Despite this disadvantage, Democrats in Washington have resisted calls to cut America’s exorbitant tax rates. They view corporations as bottomless wells of potential tax money. It doesn’t work that way in the real world. <br> High taxes also leave less money for businesses to expand, innovate and create jobs. The prospect of saving millions of dollars in taxes has caused some U.S. businesses to move overseas, taking their jobs with them. <br> America needs a simple, fair, broad-based tax system with lower rates and fewer loopholes. <br> The United States is a world leader in countless ways. “World’s Highest Taxes” is a title we should give up as soon as possible. 
 It is time your leaders in Washington tell you the truth: the fiscal crisis caused by America’s national debt and deficits is a real problem that needs to be dealt with now. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Further delay will only threaten future hopes and dreams of all Americans. <br> Enough is enough. <br> It’s time for real leadership that puts an end to irresponsible spending in Washington. That begins with the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House all presenting serious budgets that tackle the catalysts of our spending-driven debt crisis. <br> This year will be the first time in four years that the Democrat-controlled Senate has written a budget, forced to finally do so by House legislative action. For its part, the Obama administration's budget will be more than two months late from its legally required deadline when it finally gets to Congress. <br> House Republicans recognize that the way things have been done in Washington simply has not worked. <br> The House Republican budget is a long-term solution that ensures Washington is using your hard-earned tax dollars in an accountable and effective way. <br> No more budget gimmicks. <br> Most importantly, “The Path to Prosperity” will create a healthier economy where job creators are hiring, job seekers are finally finding work and more American families and entrepreneurs are realizing their dreams. <br> Some may try to convince us that we cannot reduce government spending while still honoring our commitments to America’s most important priorities. <br> In fact, our budget saves and strengthens Medicare, protects our national security, cares for the poor and sick by repairing America’s safety net programs and expands economic opportunities for everyone. <br> The American people have demanded real solutions and real results, and House Republicans have done more than just listen. <br> Now, we invite President Obama and Democrats to join us in reaching this common sense goal – correcting America’s fiscal course so that we may regain control of our future. 
 I first met Mitt Romney in the fall of 1985 when he took a chance on me and my idea to sell discount office supplies. Together we then worked to found Staples. <br> That was the idea behind Staples. <br> Now that he’s campaigning for president, Mitt’s brand of leadership could not come at a more critical time. <br> What we do have is unemployment over 8 percent for 39 months, the longest stretch since the Great Depression. <br> President Reagan once said that “the more plans fail, the more the planners plan.” Nothing more aptly captures the behavior of the Obama administration. <br> That is a recipe for more failure of the kind we already have seen. <br> In actuality, his policies are deeply unfair. They involve having the federal government pick winners and losers in the marketplace. <br> The $2 trillion dollar price tag for ObamaCare is Exhibit B. <br> It’s time to let Mitt Romney clean up this mess. <br> He’s spent his life turning around failing enterprises and starting new ones. He has a keen appreciation for how our overgrown tax code strangles job creation. He understands why high marginal tax rates undermine investment. <br> Mitt’s tax reform plan will also increase America’s global competitiveness at a moment when we desperately need to compete. By reducing the corporate tax rate to 25 from the current 35 percent—the highest rate in the developed world—his plan would level the playing field for American companies. This, together with elimination of the repatriation tax, would create incentives for companies to bring capital and jobs home from overseas and broaden the tax base. Mitt clearly understands that cutting taxes sometimes can increase revenues. <br> Mitt Romney has put forward such a plan. <br> Tom Stemberg is the founder of Staples. 
 Newt Gingrich can’t win a primary for love or money, but he sure has gotten under President Obama’s skin. His attacks on the president’s energy policy, or lack thereof, appear to have unnerved the normally unflappable Mr. Obama. <br> The president describes suggested measures that could bring down gas prices as akin to waving a “magic wand”; his press secretary Jay Carney accused anyone promising $2.50 gas of “lying”. How can Mr. Gingrich, who is nearly out of the GOP race, so rattle the White House? <br> He has consistently portrayed fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas as energy products of the past while expressing an almost unimaginably nave optimism about the potential of alternatives. His attachment to high-cost “green” energy has played well with environmentalists but for most of the country – the roughly 50% not concerned about global warming -- it is increasingly viewed as an expensive boondoggle. <br> Mr. Obama further compounded his difficulties by blocking the Keystone XL pipeline. To be sure, the politically motivated decision will have no near-term impact on gasoline prices, but it surely furthers the narrative that the president has turned his back on oil and gas. And to what end? <br> Perhaps Gingrich’s most nettlesome issue for the president, however, comes from the notion that the former House speaker is, as the Washington Post describes him, one of the GOP’s “most visible and prolific idea men.” <br> The irony is that it is President Obama who is out of step with new technology. Remarkable advances in oil and gas extraction have caused a profound change in expectations for our fossil fuel potential. Vastly increased estimates of oil and gas reserves are a serious game changer – and they should be influencing today’s energy policy far more than they are. <br> Instead of championing our local oil and gas producers, the Obama administration has promised to roll back tax breaks meant to encourage exploration and production, putting more onerous energy taxes at the heart of its “tax reform” agenda. <br> This isn’t about tax reform but about reallocating so-called tax expenditures to White House- favored organizations. Polling shows oil and gas companies to be unpopular, and so an easy target. Ditto the corporate jet industry. Heaven forbid the president espouse serious reform, that might undercut farmers, or ethanol producers or some other group receiving tax benefits – he might lose a vote or two. <br> In fairness, there’s not much that can be done in the near term. The White House has fallen back on the canard that higher prices are the work of evil speculators, and has vowed a crackdown. President Obama is also mulling releasing crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to bring down oil prices. <br> This is a foolish gesture, which last time did nothing to rein in prices. Instead, the extra supplies were bought by the Chinese, who are filling a similar reserve. In China, officials doubtless would view an “emergency” need as a serious supply cut-off. For the Obama White House, the emergency is a dip in polls. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 For too long in Washington, the budget process has been broken. With over $17 trillion in debt, there is no arguing this point. I hear it time and time again from constituents all of whom are frustrated with Washington’s lack of discipline when it comes to producing a budget. They tell me we can’t continue to borrow 40 cents of every dollar we spend. The House has always done its work but Harry Reid’s stewardship in the Senate has always been where the shortfall lies. That’s why it was so important last year when the Senate agreed to a “no budget no pay” provision forced each chamber to the table to negotiate a budget or personally face the consequences for not doing their job. To my constituents, this kind of logic is common sense. And even though this might be widely considered a positive step forward here in Washington, to my constituents, this doesn’t pass the smell test because it is so evident there is much more work to do. The budget the House will vote on this week is a clear path forward to growing our economy and creating jobs. The way we do this is by bringing our nation’s finances to balance in ten years. We can no longer kick the can down the road by putting off the tough decisions to future generations. Our children and our grand children deserve better. The rampant out of control spending requires that we look at making tough decisions and in order to get that done everyone – including President Obama – must have some skin in the game. Everyday, families sit around their kitchen tables and make tough decisions about whether they should save for retirement, save for a child’s education, or start a business. In the Obama economy, many middle class families are feeling the squeeze living paycheck to paycheck, struggling with increased prices at the pump and rising health care premiums. Building a nest egg is difficult for many in today’s economy. <br /> And unlike the federal government, many struggling families don’t have the option to borrow for the future because unlike Congress, they have to pay their bills. There is no raising the debt ceiling for an average middle class family. Since I came to Congress, I’ve made it my priority to introduce a balanced budget amendment each Congress simply because I don’t believe Washington has the fiscal discipline to keep our nation’s finances in order. The only real way we can do that is by amending our constitution to require Congress balances the federal budget. Under the plan the House will vote on this week, the budget will make our troops a priority by making sure they have the appropriate levels of training, compensation and support they need to keep our country safe. <br /> Keeping our promise to our seniors is also something this budget does by protecting Social Security for current retirees and strengthening it for future generations. There is great concern, as well there should be, from the younger professionals that I hear from that they’re paying into a system that might not be there in the future. We must protect the solvency of social security and allow The House Republican budget also suggests much-needed reforms to our tax code to incentivize American competitiveness and create jobs, which is the appropriate focus of tax reform. With three out of four Americans living paycheck to paycheck, and a cost of living rising, we should be encouraging more personal economic freedom by giving people a chance to get ahead. &nbsp;I’ve always believed our economy grows when people are allowed to keep more of their hard-earned money. With rising gas prices and insurance premiums, our constituents deserve this relief. The House Republican budget provides this relief by completely repealing Obamacare and saving working families from the anxiety of the President’s broken promises. My friends on the other side of the aisle propose their budget that includes $1.5 trillion tax hikes to pay for bloated government. And that’s the fundamental difference I have with my Democrat colleagues. Workers shouldn’t be punished by Washington in the form of higher taxes. That’s no way to grow our economy and it’s certainly no way to govern our country. 
 President Obama made clear in his Rose Garden speech on September 19 that he has abandoned all efforts to seek accommodation with the Republicans. The president in his Rose Garden speech made it abundantly clear that he will be aligning himself with the left wing of the Democratic party going forward-- a faction which has previously accused him of selling out to the Republicans. There will be no more grand bargains, no more efforts to reach broad accommodations on tax reform, on reforming entitlements, on cutting defense, and putting together a fiscal plan for our nation's future. <br> The president is effectively banking on the fact that as limited as the public confidence he is that he is now engendering, the Republicans, and at this point that means Rick Perry, will engender even less confidence. Moreover, the president is effectively setting up a campaign where he will say Think I'm bad? They're worse! <br> It is a discouraging set of circumstances which makes clear the point that Pat Caddell, John LeBoutllier and I have all offered on FoxNews.com Live's Campaign Confidential -- that there is a broad center in America that is frustrated and unrepresented, and that the American people are looking for clear alternatives to the two major parties and to their likely standard bearers. <br> Douglas E.

 I don’t know about you but I have always been leery of politicians who have “grown” during their time in Washington. <br> [pullquote] <br> It should be pointed out that 64 % of all new jobs are created by small business owners and they will take it on the chin if Mr. Obama and his allies in the Senate have their way and bump the tax rate from 35% to 39.6 %. <br> There is much talk of a “Grand Bargain” by the president. From this conservative’s point of view -- any grand bargain must include no net tax increase, no decoupling of tax rates, no sequester without spending reductions, and insist on a no two step process that kicks the can down the road, and no increase to the debt limit without budget cuts and spending caps. <br> Republicans historically have been the party of low taxes. This stance on taxes has served the party well and because of Reagan and Kemp it resulted in 25 years of record economic growth for America. <br> My message to the party's leaders is this: don’t play the president’s class warfare game on taxes, and question why bloated and duplicitous government programs need more money especially when the nation has incurred a $16 trillion debt that is growing daily. <br> The public also understands if we keep on the same track that the president and allies have prescribed -- we are then well on our way to that of Greece. 
 Let’s stipulate something about the current tussle at the edge of the fiscal cliff. President Obama and the Democrats and the media--the champions of expanding the public sector at the expense of the rest of us–are going to win, and the Republicans–the last remaining defenders of the private sector–are going to lose. Taxes will go up on upper-income Americans, and spending will continue to grow–and Republicans will glumly go along with it. <br> The goal of getting Republicans to agree to raise taxes is not to raise new revenues. After all, allowing the Bush tax rates to expire for wealthier Americans will bring in perhaps $67 billion a year; Warren Buffet’s plan for a thirty percent minimum tax rate for millionaires another $5 billion. That’s spit in the ocean compared to annual deficits of $1 trillion and counting–let alone a $16 trillion national debt. <br> And contrary to reports from the media, the goal isn’t “to raise the morale of the middle class”by punishing the rich, or any such class warfare strategy. <br> What a Republican capitulation on taxes will really mean is a future of political defeats stretching out beyond the horizon, as a disheartened base either stays home or wages bitter Tea Party versus Establishment primary fights like the ones that cost them the Senate this year. <br> What Obama and the Democrats are hoping is that GOP lawmakers will publicly abandon the no-new-taxes pledge they signed as part of their campaigns for office. The media like to blame Grover Norquist for the pledge, but he was only the instrument, and his Americans for Tax Reform the vehicle, made for the purpose. The pledge was simply a solemn promise to voters that this Republican candidate at least, when he went to Washington, would not be party to stealing more from the private sector in order to grow the welfare state. <br> Honor and trust. Breaking the no-tax pledge violates both–and it’s hard to see how either ever comes back. And the Democrats know it. That’s why they’ve focused on the pledge. They don’t just want to take away Republicans’ voters; they also want to destroy their sense of honor and integrity. They know it will make Republicans more compliant for future deals, and more alienated than ever from the voters they will need if they ever get another chance to salvage what’s left of this country. 
 Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-Ky.) are now in position to end the Tea Party’s death grip on the Republican Party’s political future. <br> If the nation’s credit rating, stocks and the recovery went down the sewer because of Republicans’ refusal to raise the debt ceiling, the GOP’s chances in the midterm elections would have been severely damaged. <br> Having successfully defied the Tea Party on the debt ceiling, now it is time for Boehner and McConnell to use that momentum to pass three bills: An extension of unemployment benefits for people suffering long-term joblessness; a minimum wage hike; and, most important of all, immigration reform. <br> The Tea Party caucus in the House and the Tea Party star in the Senate – Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — are never going to love Boehner or McConnell. Both Congressional leaders have tried for years to accommodate Tea Party passions but they can never do enough. <br> By increasing the minimum wage, which is favored in polls by a majority of Republicans and Democrats, as well as extending unemployment insurance, the GOP can avoid the trap of being labeled as the party of the rich. Indifference to the people hit hardest by the recession is a major political vulnerability for the party as income inequality becomes a dominant political theme. <br> The last two months have seen small steps by Republican leaders to get the Congress back to work. First the budget deal, then the Farm Bill, and now raising the debt ceiling. With no help from the GOP, President Obama issued an executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers last week. Obama’s healthcare plan is now showing better enrollment numbers, too. <br> Boehner is ready to move on immigration. He issued a list of principles for immigration reform before a Tea Party caucus rebellion made him quit. He then tried to blame the situation on a lack of trust in Obama to “enforce our laws.” That was a weak excuse. The president has deported nearly 2 million undocumented workers since taking office, angering his own political base in the process. <br> “We’re still trying to keep the focus on legislative action,” insists Sharry, who believes there are between 50 and 60 Republicans in the House ready and willing to defy the Tea Party caucus and support a discharge petition to move immigration reform to a vote on the House floor. <br> With support from Boehner, this effort to move beyond Tea Party paralysis on immigration becomes a winner for Republicans. At the moment, all they can do is complain if Obama issues an executive order. Meanwhile, immigration activists, including Sharry, continue to press Obama to act on his own. <br> Immigration activists want the president to unilaterally end deportations of parents of citizens. Next, they want him to stop deporting people who have not committed crimes. Finally, they want him to stop deporting anyone who qualifies for citizenship under the Senate immigration bill, which the President has said he supports. <br> Unless Boehner and McConnell stand up to the Tea Party now, the GOP will forever alienate Hispanic voters and limit the party’s chances in future elections. It is time for them to end the infighting that is hurting their party and the nation. 
 On Oct. 3, I raised a question here that reflected President Obama’s strong momentum and Mitt Romney’s apparent readiness to accept defeat. <br> I have my answer. I’ve gotten it so many times in the last 17 days that I am now convinced of it. <br> And I am starting to believe he will be. <br> He was drifting, not fighting, and seemed oddly content with a race sliding away, as though the nomination was victory enough. Obama, on the other hand, gave every indication he wanted to keep the job, no matter what it took. His re-election had a growing sense of inevitability. <br> Some polls show him leading nationally by as much as 6 points, and the Electoral College map is moving in his direction. Romney still needs more states in his column and there is plenty of time for the race to swing back to Obama. <br> That’s how good he’s been. Partially, he moved the needle by putting meat on the bones of his tax-reform plan and linking it to economic growth and jobs. Obama responded by calling him a liar — not very presidential — and failed to match him with a second-term agenda that would give undecided voters a rationale for backing him. <br> The new Mitt showed up at the Al Smith dinner Thursday night. His delivery of the biting jokes, some at his own expense, was direct and his timing was shockingly good. His bearing, instead of merely business-patrician, was elegant and leader-like. You could say it was presidential. <br> The effect on the 1,600 New Yorkers jammed into the Waldorf-Astoria ballroom was powerful. The ovation he received after his 10-minute speech was far stronger than when he began. It was a killer performance before a hard-to-please crowd. <br> He still faces a long, winding road to the White House, and doing well in Monday night’s final debate is essential. But because of his newfound determination, Romney controls his own destiny. The race is his to win. 
 Told ya so. President Obama should have pulled a Joe Girardi and benched Joe Biden long ago. Hillary Rodham Clinton would have knocked last night’s debate out of the park and probably won the election for the Democrats. <br> Following his mood swings was like riding a roller coaster. He was over-amped in the beginning and somber and melancholy toward the end. Did the medication kick in, or was it wearing off? <br> Biden’s conduct was both rude and alarming. Instead of the services of liberal moderator Martha Raddatz, who was too deferential to Biden, we needed EMTs with a straitjacket. <br> As such, he passed the most important test before him. With Mitt Romney shaking up the race with his brilliant performance in the first presidential debate, Ryan hoped to compound the gains. He may have done that in some quarters, but at the very least, he did no damage. <br> He was especially good on describing the political nature of the Obama troop drawdown in Afghanistan by explaining how commanders wanted the troops there for the fighting season. Biden’s response, that politics were not involved at all is simply not believable to the many commanders who objected. <br> Those moments, where Biden controlled the time and set the agenda by repeating false charges of Romney’s tax- reform plan that Ryan was forced to rebut, showed Biden at his Washington best. Arrogantly commanding the floor and talking with a certainty that belies his erratic record, he pointed his finger and even lectured Raddatz that “facts matter” when she dared challenge him. <br> To the extent that Biden’s hyper behavior was planned, it was clearly designed to reverse the image of a downcast, low-energy Obama in the first debate. Biden succeeded in that, but his conduct reinforced my concerns about his mental state. He doesn’t seem steady. <br> If they had a record they could defend, they would. And with two more presidential debates to come, Obama still must describe what a second term would look like. 
 While House and Senate health care negotiators meet behind closed doors to put together a final reconciled package (much to the dismay of taxpayers who had been promised that they’d be privy to the negotiations) another transparency scandal has come to light. <br> Taxpayers should not be on the hook to pay for government propaganda campaigns, and Americans for Tax Reform and its Center for Fiscal Accountability have asked Jonathan Gruber to swiftly return the money he has been awarded under his contract with HHS to taxpayers.From the letter to Gruber: <br> Your engagement with the government to publicly tout a massive spending program is akin to public lobbying campaigns for which consulting firms are being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on behalf of their (private-sector) clients. The fact that in your case the client was the Administration paying you hundreds of thousands of dollars makes your actions highly unethical. Taxpayers clearly deserve better than having their tax dollars spent on political propaganda. <br> But apparently even Gruber's assertion that he provided the information regarding his affiliation with the government “when asked” seems to only be partially true. While he may have disclosed the contract to the New England Journal of Medicine, on Saturday, January 9, The New York Times printed an editors’ note stating that Gruber committed a breach of contract: <br> Needless to say, taxpayers and the journalists Gruber sat down with alike have every reason to be outraged, and taxpayers deserve a refund. <br> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/us/grover-norquist.htm#r_src=ramp" class="r_lapi">Grover Norquist is the president and founder of Americans for Tax Reform. 
 For many Americans the distance between what they believe is best for the nation and what government actually does has become an infuriating chasm that was never meant to exist in a representative government designed to reflect the will of the majority. <br> Married people pay higher rates than singles living together, income is commonly double and tripled taxed, pastors are told what they can and can’t say from the pulpit and foreign competitors enjoy significant cost advantages over American producers because of our tax system. <br> So what if both the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the congressional committee that actually writes the tax laws got their own tax returns wrong? So what if just obeying federal tax laws costs taxpayers more than $300 billion a year in compliance costs? So what if Congress’ error in failing to index the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation now threatens to define as “wealthy” those with as little as $80,000 annual income? So what if Warren Buffet’s salary-earning secretary pays a higher tax rate than her billionaire boss? <br> This is why more than a thousand people an hour have been joining a digital tax rebellion marching on Washington at www.onlinetaxrevolt.com. FairTaxers, Flat Taxers, Reagan tax reformers and many others are being pulled together to bring another Boston Tea Party to Washington, D.C. on April 15. While people may disagree on the best solution, there is widespread understanding that the American people cannot win back control of their government until the federal tax system is either repaired or ripped out by the roots and replaced. <br> Two years ago, under-funded then-presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee caught tax reform lightning in an Iowa bottle and was catapulted to a first place finish in the Iowa Caucus. Mitt Romney and John McCain were burned by the same lightning when they repeated the same old tired and now unbelievable income tax reform promises. No, the entire election did not turn on tax reform but Mike Huckabee electrified voters when he made the FairTax, a national consumption tax to replace the broken income tax system, a center plank of his campaign. That decision marked Huckabee as one of the first among our recent politicians to turn his back on what is increasingly seen as self-dealing in Washington that damages the future of the nation and the best interests of individual citizens. <br> Ken Hoagland, author of “The FairTax Solution”, is chairman of the Online Tax Revolt and theFairTax national victory campaign.

 Editor's note: FoxNews.com is pleased to present an excerpt from 'The Debt Bomb: A Bold Plan to Stop Washington from Bankrupting America' by US Senator Tom Coburn.</i> <br> America’s Ticking Debt Bomb <br> The end-of-the-year meeting was held to discuss how to handle what had become the annual holiday train wreck in Washington when important bills were put off until the last minute. Not long after Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) began to go through the agenda, the meeting turned into an intervention – with ourselves. <br> It was an important point. The Senate Finance Committee is in many ways the committee of jurisdiction in the Senate. We oversaw the largest portions of the budget – health care, entitlements, and taxes – in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. Any solutions would come through us and should begin with us. <br> “I’d like us to be senators again and do what we are supposed to be doing. Instead we keep kicking the can down the road,” Baucus agreed. <br> It seemed the committee was waking up and accepting responsibility. <br> He was right. The fact that we had not done tax reform in 25 years – since 1986 – was a pox on both houses. Neither party wanted to let go of their favorite loopholes, exemptions, and deductions, even though doing so could lower rates and spur tremendous economic growth and job creation. Each side had a schizophrenic approach to tax reform that said, “Support simplification, give me complexity.” <br> Our discussion showed that many in Congress – and the administration – understood the severity of our problem. We all knew that we could not continue to borrow more than 40 cents for every dollar we spent. Yet, few were willing to risk their political careers to solve the problem. Most politicians were content to sit in their partisan bunkers and cling to the illusion that they were holding a line, when the reality was, there were no more lines left to hold. Both parties had betrayed their core beliefs and positions. We were under siege and surrounded on all sides, not by a foreign army but by foreign creditors … <br> America today faces one of the greatest threats to its existence since our founding. The threat does not come from any foreign army or terrorist network, but from our own government and its unsustainable spending. If we don’t change course in the near future – most likely the next two years – America as we’ve known it could soon be a shell of its former self. <br> What is certain is that maintaining our present course is a mathematical impossibility. If we ignore this problem, we will condemn future generations to a lower standard of living with less freedom and less opportunity. Sooner or later, our “debt bomb” will go off. <br> If Tom Clancy could capture our moment, he might call it “Red Ink Rising.” In a very real sense, the threat from borrowing from countries like China is greater than the threat of war with China. Sooner rather than later, a major fund or government will just decide one day that buying U.S. debt is a bad bet. And with one gust of wind, the house of cards will come crashing down. <br> If current patterns hold, we’ll hear increasingly dire warnings and more earnest promises to do something, but no one will act decisively until we experience more economic pain. <br> Stage 1: Congress tries to maintain the status quo on spending and entitlements <br> Stage 3: Interest rates markedly increase, harming consumers and sending interest payments on the national debt soaring <br> In this final stage borrowing enough money to fund our military and other programs will become much more expensive. Because we will be spending more on interest payments, it will be virtually impossible to balance our budget with spending cuts and revenue increases. The hole will be too deep and the sides too steep to climb out. <br> Inflation will make government debt seem smaller by shrinking the value of the dollar. Yet, for individual Americans, inflation will be an insidious hidden tax increase that will make everything you buy more expensive, and everything you own worth less. If our government tries to inflate its way out of a debt crisis, much of your life savings will be wiped out. <br> Finally, the bottom would fall out of the middle class. Unemployment would soar, while the cost of living would increase. Real wage growth has already been stagnant in recent years, and it will be the middle class and lower-income families that pay the price for Washington’s refusal to act. <br> We Can’t Wait on a Solution <br> From my vantage point, having spent hundreds of hours with people who have a sacred responsibility to solve this problem – from the president to congressional leaders – I believe a consensus for a solution already exists in the country and in Washington. But a real solution will never fit into an election-year strategy. In Washington, the moment to do what is right is never today. It is always a mirage just beyond the horizon of the next election. It comes down to a question of political will and courage. Will we be career politicians, or will we be statesmen? 
 There's no question that Thursday's ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance starting in 2014 is a short term victory for President Obama. That's simply undeniable. <br> But there's a downside in today's news for the White House and the president's 2012 reelection campaign. <br> A new Associated Press-GfK poll found that the Affordable Care Act remains unpopular across-the-board -- and particularly among independent swing voters. Indeed, Just a third of Americans overall -- and only 21 percent of independents approve of the law, a new low in AP-GfK polling. <br> Indeed, it will mean that the legislation will now be explicitly seen in the context of higher taxes for hardworking Americans at a time of weakened economic conditions. <br> What the President needs to do is something that he has been reluctant to do -- take on the issue of entitlement policy in the context of overall fiscal and budgetary reform. <br> Moreover, he must put forth a comprehensive set of policy prescriptions to address the issues that the American people regard as fundamental, and a long-term economic agenda that emphasizes tax reform, fiscal prudence, and economic growth -- as well as the need to rein in entitlements, balance the budget, and reduce the debt and deficit. <br> For his part, Mitt Romney will almost certainly say that his first act if elected President will be repealing ObamaCare, and continue to attack the higher taxes and the impact on health care costs that will surely result. <br> But with Mitt Romney's own favorability ratings remaining low and a new round of polling showing Obama holding a consistent advantage in key swing states -- it is a strategy with limited upsides. <br> Put simply, in the absence of a clear set of core principles, and a plan to balance the budget, create jobs and a smart, reasonable, and rational discussion about health care and a health care policy that takes steps to rein in excesses in the system, his hopes for winning the White House come November -- a goal that is well within reach -- could be dashed. 
 In a little-noted comment during his press conference this month, President Obama said “one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficit reduction is to grow the economy.” <br> Unfortunately, several of the debt reduction proposals the president has offered involve tax hikes on corporations that would only hamper growth, handicap our ability to compete globally, lower tax revenues, and exacerbate the problem we’re desperately trying to solve. <br> Raising taxes on corporations during good economic times is a risky proposition, but it’s certainly ill advised at a time when the economy is struggling find its footing after a prolonged and deep recession. Higher taxes simply reduce investments and employment. It’s a simple as that. <br> Likewise, targeting the oil and gas industry for tax hikes—under the guise of eliminating “subsidies”—would do more harm than good. Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS CERA and points out: “Taxation systems don’t exist in a vacuum in an increasingly competitive world. The unintended consequences of proposed changes would likely accelerate the shrinking position of U.S. companies internationally.” <br> Like it or not, U.S. companies have choices. And if the business tax climate is too unfavorable in America, many will simply move operations elsewhere. Already, companies like Google have moved certain parts of their operation to countries such as Ireland, which boast taxes that are a mere fraction of the United States’ rate. <br> That’s just a fact of life, one we’ve seen here at home, where companies are busy moving out of high-cost states like California—a state that CEO magazine recently listed as<a href="http://chiefexecutive.net/best-worst-states-for-business" target="_blank">the worst state in which to do business—to more business-friendly ones. <br> And while raising taxes on companies—particularly oil and gas firms—might appeal on an emotional level, they only exacerbate a more fundamental problem with the way we tax businesses in the United States. <br> At the same time, we have a massively complex tax system—riddled with special interest tax loopholes—that lets companies pay less than the advertised rate, but at a cost of $40 billion a year to comply, and many billions more in economic distortions. <br> Mr. Obama himself has recognized the need for tax reform, calling on Congress in his last State of the Union address to “Get rid of the loopholes.Level the playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate.” <br> In the end, if President Obama really wants to “grow the economy,” he and the rest of Washington need to focus on policies that will boost investment and growth in domestic firms. And the best way to do that is to cut corporate taxes, not raise them. 
 President Obama is suddenly a fan of press conferences. Last week, after months of not appearing solo before the media, he faced reporters twice, most recently this past Friday. <br> Why this sudden urge to converse? Simply said, it’s working for him. <br> There was nothing new to report on Friday, no real news. But his prior jamborees with the press had done something miraculous for Mr. Obama – they had convinced the public that he was doing his job. Not only had he engaged in the debt ceiling talks, but he was taking the <i>middle road</b>. <br> Indeed, there hasn’t been a budget proposal to emerge from the Democratic side of the aisle in months. Never mind. The message was clear: but for a few loons in the House, we would not be facing a meltdown of monstrous proportions. <br> The tit-for-tat between our nation’s leaders is riveting. Mr. Obama erred when he said the public was not interested in reality-TV antics; if Eric Cantor would only take a swing at Tim Geithner the president could put his campaign on hold – he’d be reelected in a landslide. That billion dollars he’s so hopeful of raising could instead go to deflating our deficit. <br> The president, too, should ditch the rhetoric, and get the job done. If he is so very concerned about the ill effects from not raising the debt ceiling -- if this stalemate is driving us towards true financial catastrophe – why not agree to raise the debt ceiling now, in company with spending cuts that even this spendthrift White House knows are necessary? <br> Tax reform has become, of course, code for increased revenues. In April, the president said “It’s important that we look at our tax code and find a way to work together to not only simplify and make the tax system fairer, but also that we use it as a tool to help us achieve our deficit targets.” We’re talking <i>decreased tax expenditures</b>, one of the more God-awful expressions to come out of this White House, along with “kinetic military action.” <br> This was one of the excellent recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission. They advised phasing out, for instance, the mortgage interest deduction. Though an abrupt revision of this long-standing tax arrangement could further shake the shattered real estate industry, a phased-in reduction is worth considering. <br> The financial crisis built on a mountain of ill-advised investment in property; this bubble was encouraged by the tax code (as well as excessively low interest rates, wrong-headed public policy, and careless bankers and investors.) Americans understand the attraction of owning a home; the government does not need to encourage such investment. <br> Liz Peek is a FoxNews.com contributor and financial columnist who writes for The Fiscal Times.

 With a fiscal deal now in place, some might think America’s budget and debt crisis is over: they would be wrong. <br> For Republicans, hindsight has shown that the strategy of shutting down the government and risking default to force defunding of ObamaCare was doomed from the beginning. <br> President Obama will never abandon his signature issue, no matter how flawed and unworkable it might be. &nbsp; <br> The real solution here is not to bring the economy to the brink of default, but to win elections so we can implement the policy changes we all know are needed. &nbsp; <br> House Republicans should have learned last December that only by unity can we achieve our objectives -- and that you don’t achieve party unity by opposing the Speaker and the Leadership. <br> Democrats who believe they’ve achieved a “victory” should think again: nobody wins a standoff like this, as evidenced by polls that show Congressional Democrats’ ratings in the low 30s, while Obama’s has sunk to 43 percent -- one of the lowest of his presidency. <br> In the negotiations to come, Republicans can get off the mat by focusing on real, achievable solutions that promise a positive impact. <br> Two salient facts should guide Republicans’ thinking right now: first, 11 million of our fellow citizens are out of work; and second, we are now four years into the slowest economic “recovery” in our history. <br> Republicans must use the upcoming negotiations to re-establish a laser focus on job creation and economic growth, just as so many Republican Governors and state legislatures have done around the country. <br> 1. Tax reform. Everyone agrees that lowering rates and closing unproductive loopholes would result in higher levels of economic growth. &nbsp;Republicans should push for a long overdue overhaul of the Tax Code. <br> 3. Entitlement Reform. While the budget caps implemented as part of sequestration temporarily reduced the deficit relative to the Gross Domestic Product, the red ink will soon resume an upward trajectory because of entitlement costs. <br> Since even the Obama administration has endorsed the concept of entitlement reform, Republicans might consider offering Democrats changes in the sequester levels as a tradeoff for structural entitlement improvements that will have a far more profound impact in the years to come. <br> It’s not just computer software design flaws that are keeping people from signing up: Americans don’t like this law, and its complexity alone is discouraging people from enrolling. <br> Unfortunately, major changes can only be made when there is a new occupant in the White House. <br> There is a large bipartisan majority in both Houses to kill this tax, and Republicans need to advance its repeal (full disclosure: my firm represents device companies). <br> We won’t achieve every item on our agenda, but we must nonetheless do everything within our power to lessen the worst impacts of Obama’s economic malaise. 
 <i>Editor's note:</b> Fox News' Dana Perino, former White House press secretary and current co-host of The Five recently interviewed Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union chairman about this year's <a target="_blank" href="http://cpac.conservative.org/">Conservative Political Action Conference
 <i>Editor's note:</b> This article is adapted from the Spring 2013 issue of City Journal. <br> Christie’s stance countered most of the elite postelection commentary, which gleefully pronounced the Republican Party’s political irrelevance. But the governor was right. <br> Democrats boast similar power in just 12 states, with a population of 100 million. Even Republicans’ unimpressive national showing last November didn’t reverse their state-level momentum. <br> [pullquote] <br> At a time when Washington policymakers seem paralyzed by our toughest problems, these state-level revolutionaries have restrained government growth and radically reformed local tax codes. <br> Christie, whose stock has risen in New Jersey as he heads into a reelection battle this year, believes that the next national leadership of the Republican Party will emerge from the ranks of its effective governors. “I don’t think this is a core philosophical examination we have to go through,” he has observed. “What this is about is doing our jobs.” <br> Even as the country seemed to lurch leftward, however, state voters began to revolt against Democratic governors’ tax increases. <br> McGreevey boosted taxes and fees $3.6 billion between 2002 and 2004 alone, raising everything from income taxes to levies on home sales. Corzine followed in 2006 with his own $1.1 billion sales-tax hike. <br> Christie ran enormous political risks in trying to shrink that deficit. Despite discontent over the high taxes, polls showed that voters wanted higher levies on the rich, so that the state could continue a popular program of property-tax rebates for homeowners. And though the voters favored winning concessions from government workers, they also wanted the state to keep subsidizing public schools richly. <br> When homeowners complained, Christie urged them to vote against the expensive municipal and school budgets that were driving their ever-rising property taxes. Voters responded, defeating nearly 60 percent of the school budgets proposed in 2010. Christie’s reforms slashed state spending by nearly 9 percent and balanced the state budget without new taxes. <br> He also signed off on roughly $347 million in business tax cuts, though he has yet to find the revenues to make good on his pledge to lower Jersey’s income tax. Christie’s favorability rating was just 44 percent after his first budget passed, but as Jerseyans watched his strategy play out, his popularity grew. <br> “Despite the challenges that Sandy presents for our economy, I will not let New Jersey go back to our old ways of wasteful spending and rising taxes,” Christie recently announced. “We will deal with our problems, but we will continue to do so by protecting the hard-earned money of all New Jerseyans first and foremost.” <br> Perhaps the most ambitious of the 2010 crop of reform governors is Michigan’s Rick Snyder, a former venture capitalist with no previous experience in office. <br> Perhaps Snyder’s post-partisan image was what kept him off the national press’s radar for so long: he ran as a wonk who would use his business acumen to fix the state’s finances. <br> The MBT didn’t just tax businesses’ profits, as most corporate taxes do; it taxed their revenues as well, meaning that firms had to pay even when they weren’t making money. <br> Snyder’s tax-reform plan was audacious. To make up for the lost MBT revenues, he proposed a flat corporate levy; jettisoning $400 million in targeted corporate tax credits, which had tried to keep particular companies in the state; and (most controversially) taxing the pensions of all Michigan residents. <br> Snyder’s call to tax pensions understandably upset retirees and government-worker groups, who threatened to try to recall the governor. But he persisted, and the recall idea fizzled. <br> Nor was that the end of Snyder’s reform drive. Last year, he lowered Michigan’s personal income-tax rate. And now he’s seeking to eliminate the state’s so-called personal property tax, which is actually an outdated tax on business equipment. Snyder’s changes are “unshackling the state from its obsolete economic past and positioning it for new prosperity,” noted the Detroit News. <br> Republicans in the state legislature, balking at ending the popular items, passed a tax-cut package without them, lowering the state’s income-tax rate from 6.45 percent to 4.9 percent. <br> States are laboratories of democracy, in Justice Louis Brandeis’s famous formulation, and the very different experiments that their Republican and Democratic governors conduct over the next few years—especially on issues that go to the heart of economic competitiveness—will be eye-opening. 
 Every year around this time Americans come face to face with our complex tax code. Taxpayers struggle to comply with tax laws so complicated that even the IRS cannot figure them out. IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman recently stated that “I find the tax code complex so I use a preparer.” A whopping 89 percent of Americans also use a tax preparer. The Internal Revenue Code is 3.8 million words. That’s over 11,000 single-spaced typed pages. It is nearly universally agreed upon that we must make our tax code more simple and fair. <br> Let’s scrap the entire tax system and replace it with one that is simple, low and fairer. The best and most practical solution is to implement a flat tax. Unlike the other tax reform proposals, this can easily be done without repealing any constitutional amendments. While other tax reform options have merit, it will prove to be an arduous process to amend the Constitution. To repeal the 16th amendment—which established the federal income tax—we will need the support of 290 house members, 67 senators, the majority of legislatures of three-fourth of the states and the president. Introducing a reform such as the FairTax, which is a broad-based consumption tax on retail goods and services, without first repealing the 16th amendment is risky business. We could end up with both a national sales tax and a federal income tax. <br> With a Republican controlled House of Representatives, the flat tax is gaining momentum again. Rep. Burgess (R-Texas) has introduced the Freedom Flat Tax Act to implement an optional flat-rate tax system. It would phase in the flat-tax over a three-year period, with a 19-percent rate for the first two years and a 17-percent rate for the subsequent years. Unlike many other flat tax proposals, the Freedom Flat Tax Act that would allow individuals and businesses to choose if and when they opt into the system. These Americans would be able to file their taxes in just a few short minutes. A flat tax is a simple tax system that treats every American the same. It’s a huge improvement from the current tax code. <br> Russia is one of the prime examples of the success of the flat tax. In 2001, Russia replaced its progressive tax code with a single flat rate of 13 percent for all. The results have been outstanding. When people find their taxes to be low and sensible, they are willing to produce and invest more. In just the first year of implementation, Russia’s GDP grew a dramatic 5 percent. Between 2001 and 2004, The Hoover Institute found that tax revenue actually rose by 79.7 percent. Of course the flat tax is not a cure-all. Many of Russia’s problems can be blamed on other factors such as lack of property rights and excessive government intervention in the economy. <br> Matt Kibbe is president and CEO of FreedomWorks, a nation-wide grassroots organization fighting for lower taxes, less government and freedom and the author of Give Us Liberty: A Tea Party Manifesto.</i> 
 When Congress acted last month to free much-needed spectrum for mobile broadband, they did so to keep consumer phone bills low and improve broadband service. In the very same week, however, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took steps to shut the doors of a brand new start-up wireless company whose existence would provide similar benefits. <br> This debacle is the direct result of lobbying by the GPS industry and various government agencies, which complained to a cowering FCC that the new wireless network would interfere with their devices. There is natural interference between wireless frequencies, a gray area where one person’s property ends and another’s begins. However, in this instance the GPS devices are the ones causing interference by looking directly into LightSquared’s signal. <br> For example, an FCC working group found that using spectrum situated farther away from GPS frequencies would solve virtually all interference issues. But the idea was dismissed. <br> Instead, the FCC is doing more to help its friends and kowtow to other federal agencies than do its job. It makes one wonder why we don’t phase out the FCC’s top-down system of bureaucrats doling out spectrum licenses and replace it with a free-market approach built upon real property rights. <br> This is a case of anti-free market regulatory capture, where GPS companies and the federal agencies they do business with coordinated to stop LightSquared, as e-mails between Defense Department officials recently revealed. The GPS industry even teamed up with bureaucrats in the Pentagon and other departments to leak a preliminary report on interference issues solely to undermine LightSquared. <br> If the FCC backtracks on giving LightSquared the green light, file this alongside the Keystone Pipeline. The Commission should be allowing LightSquared to try all possible options, including launching a ground network or finding new spectrum. Instead, their actions have already forced the company to lay off half its employees. <br> <i>Grover Norquist
 Even though Congress and the president have yet to agree on a level of spending for fiscal 2011, the debate in Washington is starting to shift to other fiscal issues. Today's release of the House Budget Committee chairman's fiscal 2012 budget proposal is likely to spur much more substantive discussion and debate over what needs to be done to put our nation's finances in order. The upcoming debt ceiling debate also represents a chance to do something concrete in connection with the structural deficits that represent the true threat to our collective future. <br> Ryan's budget proposes 10-year spending cuts far in excess of the president’s proposal and deficit reductions that exceed those recommended by the National Fiscal Responsibility and Reform Commission. He does so by cutting spending much more aggressively and without raising taxes. <br> Finally, Ryan proposes a number of other major reforms while providing varying levels of specificity regarding how his proposed cost savings and economic gains would be achieved. These include areas like Social Security reform, tax reform, federal employment and compensation reforms, and government consolidation and restructuring reforms. <br> However, contrary to Ryan's proposal, additional defense cuts that do not compromise national security and comprehensive tax reform that raises more revenue also need to be on the table in order to help ensure bipartisan support for any comprehensive fiscal reform proposal. <br> I look forward to seeing Chairman Conrad's (D-N.D.) Fiscal 2012 budget proposal and the results of the Senate's Group of Six (G6) efforts, of which he is a member. The G6 is taking a comprehensive and bipartisan approach to addressing our fiscal challenges that could help facilitate bipartisan action. <br> The best opportunity to make progress this year may be the upcoming debt ceiling debate. The Democrats Plan A strategy is to raise the debt ceiling unconditionally. The Republicans Plan A strategy is to raise it conditioned on passing a Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment. Neither of these approaches have the votes needed for passage. Our country needs a Plan B and, for the sake of our founders and our families, I'm working to help make sure that we have one. After all, doing nothing is simply not a viable option. 
 Here we go again. Just look at this headline on the front page of paper edition of The Washington Post this morning: “Prescribing bitter debt medicine, senators take case to the public.” And here comes the kicker of a sub-head: “‘Everything is on the table’ as bipartisan Gang of Six looks beyond spending cuts.” <br> But speaking of conservatives, or at least Republicans, who are these Senators working on this possible deal? Three of the Gang of Six are Republican Senators Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, and Mike Crapo of Idaho. As Chambliss told The Post, “Everything is on the table. For a Republican to put revenues on the table is significant.” <br> Remember what happened to President George H.W. Bush after he broke his “read my lips” pledge? After raising taxes in 1990, Bush was defeated for re-election in 1992, receiving the lowest percentage of popular vote for an incumbent president since 1912. <br> Yet as Ryan Ellis of ATR observed this morning, “Chambliss doesn't consider getting rid of tax deductions and credits to be tax hikes.” Ellis points to the exact language of the pledge that Chambliss signed, which includes these words: “oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.” That is, any loophole-closing must be matched by an equal amount of tax-rate cutting. <br> Chambliss seems to be saying he wants to not plow all the savings into lower rates. If so, that's inconsistent with his Pledge. The mortgage interest deduction (to take but a large example) is not spending like HUD is spending. The former lets people keep their own money. The latter requires money to be taken in taxes, filtered through government unions in Washington, and then sent out the door as welfare. To equate the two is fundamentally dishonest. The government does not have a right to all your money, as Chambliss' tax theory seems to imply. <br> The bipartisan senatorial sextet took their roadshow to Richmond on Monday night, delivering a slide presentation to a town hall in Warner’s home state. Perhaps--just guessing here--it’s on Warner’s mind that as a Democratic Senator in a Republican state, his re-election chances will be helped if three Republican Senators come to the Old Dominion and publicly praise him. <br> Of course, the mainstream media won’t report on any of that. What the MSM will say is more like, “Brave U.S. Senators, rising above party labels, are working together to solve an urgent problem.” <br> Then, as the negotiations stall, the MSM--joined, of course, by the Beltway Establishment--will pile on Republicans for being “intransigent.” <br> Eventually, the smoke clears, and the deal is done. The Republicans get praised on “Face the Nation,” while taxes AND spending go up. We might recall, of course, that in 1990, in the wake of the Bush 41 tax-increasing “budget deal,” the deficit went up, too. <br> James P.

 President Obama is set to propose his “compromise” budget plan on Wednesday. His budget is reported to trim the deficit by $1.8 trillion over the next ten years, with nearly $600 billion in savings coming from additional revenue and $1.2 trillion coming from domestic program and entitlement cuts. <br> But new survey data, collected and financed by Douglas E. Schoen, LLC and in collaboration with the Campaign to Fix the Debt, shows a path towards a deal and how one can be reached. <br> The American people are in a profoundly pessimistic and angry mood. The Republican Party’s approval ratings stand at a 20-year low, with 66 percent judging it unfavorably compared to 33 percent favorably. The Democrats are viewed in a more favorable light, but are still not in good stead (43 percent favorable to 53 percent unfavorable). <br> Against this backdrop, Democrats and Republicans have offered up competing budget proposals—the Democrats in the Senate, the Republicans in the House—to address the nation’s mounting fiscal challenges. <br> With such stark differences, it’s no surprise that the plans have had a polarizing effect—we face, yet again, a seemingly intractable budget stalemate in Washington. Neither side wants to compromise. And Americans are enthusiastic about neither plan. <br> When we asked whether they thought that either the Democrats or Republicans had a realistic plan to reduce the deficit, just 20 percent said that the Republicans did, while 25 percent said that the Democrats did. But 49 percent believe that neither side has a realistic plan. <br> This plan would reduce our debt by $2.4 trillion. <br> The plan stood up to scrutiny. When we told respondents that it would cut their Medicare and Social Security, they still supported it, 56 percent to 24 percent. What’s more, when we said that cuts to Medicare and Social Security would only affect higher income retirees, including millionaires, the plan’s support increased, with 65 percent in favor and 20 percent opposed. <br> To date, very few surveys have examined this issue in any great detail, comparing the actual details of the Democratic, Republican, and compromise plan and gauging American attitudes. Our findings offer compelling evidence that, while there is a great divide between the two parties, what the public wants is a clear, bipartisan fix to our nation’s fiscal situation. 
 I think the current environment is more like the October 1987 equity crash, when equities closed the year higher, than the September-October 2008 crash when equities continued falling for six months. While the current problems are immense, there’s no equivalent to the disastrous Lehman bankruptcy filing which immediately paralyzed the interbank and commercial paper markets worldwide. Nor is there an equivalent to the abrupt federal takeovers of AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all critical market players that became even more disruptive when they were absorbed into the government. <br> I’m looking for 2 percent third quarter U.S. GDP growth, up from 1.3 percent in the second quarter, and then an acceleration to 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter. If so, equities will do very well but bonds and gold will do badly as the fear trade subsides. <br> Adding to the 2011 turmoil, the Fed issued a statement after its Tuesday meeting that was disastrously gold-inflating at a time when gold is already in a bubble. The Fed threatened two more years of near-zero rates and dangled QE3 in front of financial markets by saying it was considering using “the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery.” <br> My August 5 Wall Street Journal article Weak Dollar, Weak Economy explained the harm from last year’s Fed splurge into QE2 -- the more bonds the Fed bought, the weaker the dollar and the weaker the economy. In its latest move, the Fed is locking in negative real interest rates even longer, souring the investment climate. Fortunately, growth may start up any way, and that’s what financial markets will be watching. <br> David Malpass is former chief economist for Bear Stearns. 
 Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has it right. The so-called Gang of Six proposal to increase the debt ceiling is not ready for prime time.
 It is hard not to be excited by the news of the Gang of Six's resurrection. Their $3.7 trillion plan to reduce the budget deficit over 10 years coupled with lowering tax rates, eliminating loopholes, and ultimately raising $1 trillion in new revenue meets the broad outlines of the Bowles-Simpson Plan that was unveiled last December, and addresses most, if not all, the central concerns of centrist Democrats like myself. <br> Still there are concerns. <br> At the same time, with poll after poll showing the Republicans being too intransigent and voters supporting tax increases that must be a necessary part of the mix to balance the budget, it is hard for me and I suspect other centrists not to endorse the broad outlines of the deal that appears to have won at least tentative support from at least half the Senate. <br> Specifically, we need to know what spending cuts have been embraced by the Gang of Six; how the $500 billion in health care cuts will be achieved; what discretionary domestic programs will be cut; as well as what defense initiatives will be paired back; and specifically where and how revenue will be raised. <br> To that end I would be concerned if programs like Medicare part D were eliminated or cut back, and I worry that health care decisions might be turned over to an unelected board (IPAB) as was initially proposed and ratified by Bowles-Simpson. <br> The fact that we are now seeing broad based bipartisanship and a willingness to embrace both significant expenditure cuts, tax reform and entitlement reform suggests that there is still the possibility of achieving something big and important as part of the ongoing debate over raising the debt ceiling. <br> Douglas E.

 There are huge political benefits for President Obama and Republicans in the Senate and Congress from a large scale deal that would cut some $4 trillion from the federal deficit and offer a tax reform package as well that would reduce rates and eliminate many loopholes particularly for upper income tax payers. It is less clear that this would benefit Democrats in Congress, but arguably there could well be benefits to the Party as well. <br> If Democrats are able to agree to $4 trillion in cuts, with cuts to entitlements, defense, and discretionary spending, that would go a long way to winning back independent votes whose support has been literally trending away from the Party since the 2008 election. It would also address many of the concerns that have been expressed that the president is too far to the left and is not willing to embrace fiscal discipline as part of his overall economic agenda. <br> Republicans will undeniably gain a benefit as well, because such a deal would present them with a substantial victory on their top goal of cutting spending and reducing the deficit. <br> Bottom line, there is a lot for the American people in a deal. There's also a huge amount for the president and there's even a clear path to victory. Republicans could potentially even winning the Senate while holding the majority in the House. All this is possible if both sides are able to get past impediments in their own party to achieve this goal. <br> Douglas E. Schoen is a Fox News contributor.

 Last November, my brother-in-law left his steady job at the city’s Public Works Department to begin working for an energy production company whose work site is situated near George West, a small town in South Texas. Although the move would keep him about 100 miles away from the family four days out of the week, he said what mattered most at this point in time was that the job change would double his annual salary. <br> I’ve known my brother-in-law long enough to know he is not impulsive, and my sister –like many women in households across America who are the bill payers, the “penny pinchers” who manage the family economy with laser-like attentiveness– does not allow many indulgences. She also happens to be the mother of four vivacious young children that take up a lot of her time. <br> I was thinking it’s bad when the new normal means our children are being forced to adjust to a life of separation, but it was hard to argue against the reasoning behind their decision, so I didn’t. <br> Is it any wonder more and more Americans succumb to the siren song of the “The Life of Julia” (President Obama’s fictional female cartoon character who relies on the government to sustain her from cradle to grave) as opposed to undergoing the difficulty of real life hardships and make the gut wrenching decisions necessary to make ends meet, when the only answers coming from Washington politicians are to continue recklessly printing money in billion dollar stacks, racking up sinful amounts of debt and spending hard-earned taxpayer dollars in redistributive schemes? In fact, the United States has now recorded a deficit during 45 of the last 47 months. <br> The president has shown himself to be so keen on spending he told the press he will simply refuse to negotiate with Republicans on the “debt ceiling”. Republicans have repeatedly said they fully intend to leverage the debate as an opportunity to agree on much needed spending cuts. The standoff has become a high stakes game that may end in a disastrous government shutdown. <br> It seems that the $600 billion tax hike the president received at the start of the year will not quench his thirst for the spending he envisions. His position is that the size and scope of government must grow in order to sustain the spending binge that his administration has enjoyed during the past four years. <br> Similarly, President Obama’s call to run up the nation’s credit card without approving spending cuts must also be resisted if we are to rein in runaway spending and improve the take-home pay of every hard working American. <br> It is time for Washington to make the hard choices in these hard times so then, maybe soon, folks like my brother-in-law can afford to come home to be with their families. <br> Daniel Garza is president and chairman of The LIBRE Institute.

 WASHINGTON </span>It has become conventional wisdom that Republicans are suffering an internal split that President Obama is successfully exploiting to neuter the Republican House. It is not true, however, that the Republican split is philosophical and fundamental. And that a hopelessly divided GOP is therefore headed for decline, perhaps irrelevance. <br> How do we know? Simple thought experiment: Imagine that we had a Republican president. Would the party be deeply divided over policy, at war with itself in Congress? Not at all. It would be rallying around something like the Paul Ryan budget that twice passed the House with near 100 percent GOP unanimity. <br> In reality, Republicans have a broad consensus on program and policy. But they don't have the power. What divides Republicans today is a straightforward tactical question: Can you govern from one house of Congress? Should you even try? <br> Can you shrink government, restrain spending, bring a modicum of fiscal sanity to the country when the president and a blocking Senate have no intention of doing so? <br> They were willing to risk the fiscal cliff. Today they are willing to risk a breach of the debt ceiling and even a government shutdown rather than collaborate with Obama's tax-and-spend second-term agenda. <br> The party establishment is coming around to the view that if you try to govern from one house -- e.g., force spending cuts with cliffhanging brinkmanship -- you lose. You not only don't get the cuts. You get the blame for rattled markets and economic uncertainty. You get humiliated by having to cave in the end. And you get opinion polls ranking you below head lice and colonoscopies in popularity. <br> Obama's postelection arrogance and intransigence can put you in a fighting mood. I sympathize. But I'm tending toward the realist view: Don't force the issue when you don't have the power. <br> The more prudent course would be to find some offer that cannot be refused, a short-term trade-off utterly unassailable and straightforward. For example, offer to extend the debt ceiling through, say, May 1, in exchange for the Senate delivering a budget by that date -- after four years of lawlessly refusing to produce one. <br> Go small and simple. Forget about forcing tax reform or entitlement cuts or anything major. If Obama wants to recklessly expand government, well, as he says, he won the election. <br> Aren't you failing the country, say the insurgents? Answer: The country chose Obama. He gets four years. 
 “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, there’ll be hell to pay in the next election”. This should be the simple yet loud message Latino voters must send to President Obama as he prepares for a second term. We’ve heard the campaign promises before and the many excuses that followed. We heard the blame game, over and over again. But this time, no excuses will be accepted nor tolerated. <br> When you look at a precinct analysis of targeted counties in Florida, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia, you realize that not only did Obama scored historically high levels of support, but he also got the largest turnout in Latino voting history. And that turnout was sufficiently high to deliver those swing states and provide President Obama the margin he needed to win reelection. The exit polls do not show the extent of this effort. Precinct results in predominantly Puerto Rican areas in the I-4 corridor in Florida, show Obama received over 84% and the turn out increased by 15 points. Similar data exists for South Florida, Northern Virginia, Las Vegas, Denver and other predominantly Latino neighborhoods. &nbsp; <br> On the Democratic side, action on immigration legislation needs to happen within the first 100 days of the new administration. If it doesn’t happen then, it will not happen at all. If the President is serious about his commitment to this issue, then he needs to make it a legislative priority and have something submitted within the first three months. Otherwise it will become once again a partisan blame game, and once again we will be witnessing four years from now, a Democratic presidential candidate promising to deliver immigration reform. <br> Many Latino activists at the grassroots level fear that the Obama Administration will make a minor, yet well publicized effort in Congress and not achieve a bipartisan consensus. Then they will drop the ball and once again say “we tried, but the Republicans blocked us.” <br> The message should be loud and clear: No excuses. You fooled us once in 2008. If you try to fool us again in 2012, there will be hell to pay for Democratic politicians in the 2014 mid-term elections. No excuses. <br> But most importantly, the Republican Party needs to stop using insulting rhetoric. They need to craft real reforms based on free market principles and an effective communications strategy to promote them. And they need to make Latinos feel that they are truly welcomed and wanted. Not just during a campaign, but in the process of developing policy and political strategies. In other words, treat us as adults. <br> Latinos finally entered the national political stage with a big splash. The question is how they will use this new influence and power. If the average Latino voter does not see quick results after all the promises made, you will see a disillusioned community that will revert to political apathy. Let’s make sure that we hold politicians accountable to those who elected them. It’s time to get the job done. No excuses accepted nor tolerated. <br> Robert G.

 It’s over, thank God. After months – years-- of polling and sniping, calculating and conquering, Americans have chosen Barack Obama to lead them Forward! for the next four years. <br> Sour-grapes types may think the president learned just how far you can ride on personal popularity – that even though most people think the country is headed in the wrong direction, they don’t hold him accountable. That even though they dislike the president’s signature legislation, they will allow him more such “bold experimentation.” That even though they do not think he is the best candidate to nurture economic expansion, and that 59% of the electorate say that is their number one concern -- they will give him another shot. He might have learned how easy it is to blame his shortcomings on other people. <br> A sourpuss might conclude that President Obama learned this: that winning was everything. <br> With luck he heard from small business owners who are stymied by the lava flow of rules and regulations flowing from the Obama White House. Perhaps he heard the discouraged woman who said she was “exhausted at defending” the president and who wondered “Is this my new reality?” <br> Perhaps Mr. Obama will reflect on the important (possibly pivotal) support role played by former President Bill Clinton. Clinton’s enduring popularity, in spite of being only the second-ever Commander in Chief to have been impeached, can be traced to his ability to work with the opposition and pass popular legislation such as welfare reform. Clinton is viewed as a moderate – someone who moved the country in a direction approved by most voters. They like him for it. <br> Republicans also learned some lessons of importance. Mr. Obama’s campaign brilliantly sliced up the American people, and then gobbled up one portion after another. <br> Exit polling reported by the American Enterprise Institute reveal that 59% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in most circumstances. Like gay marriage, this is an issue where attitudes are moving away from the GOP; adopting an aggressively anti-abortion platform will not help win elections. <br> Hispanics were another group that shunned the GOP ticket. This is a tragedy; as many have said, hard work and aspiration are essential to Hispanics – they should be voting Republican, but have been disenfranchised by the right’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. As with abortion, sentiment is softening; exit polls revealed that 65% of voters think that illegals working in the U.S. should be offered a shot at legal status. Republicans like John McCain have led the search for a bipartisan solution to this issue; they need to get in front of the quest once again. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 When Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi launched their massive spending spree in January 2009, many Americans wondered: what are they doing? It appeared to make no sense. <br> Then they unleashed plans to spend one trillion taxing real energy and subsidizing imaginary energy. Another one, two, or three trillion on a government takeover of health care. <br> This was no a mistake. It was the plan. <br> The end game for Democrats was -- and is -- the imposition of a Value Added Tax (VAT)-- a European style national sales tax that increases the price of all goods and services by a few percent to start with. The VAT is an easy tax to raise. Citizens see prices rise and blame businesses for the costs imposed by government. Clever. European rates have risen to 20 and 25 percent. <br> But this is America and the electorate revolted in November 2010, interrupting the plan. <br> In November 2012 there are 23 Senate Democrats up for re-election -- ten of whom are vulnerable -- and ten Republicans are up for re-election -- two of which might be vulnerable. <br> Compromises occur when two competing parties are trying to do the same thing but disagree on timing or pace. <br> Someone wins and someone loses. That is why so much of the fight in Washington is posturing and angling to get the public relations advantage. <br> A return to a Democrat House, Senate and president leads back to the tax-and-spend and regulate policies of the previous two years. 
 Presidential Debate III was more like “Rocky” Round 16, an afterthought where neither boxer really lands a clean punch on the other and where the crowd has dozed off or gone to bed. Only in the land of MSNBC were sparks flying. <br> “I think they hate Obama. They want him out of the White House more than they want to destroy Al Qaeda. Their No. 1 enemy in the world right now, on the right, is their hatred, hatred for Obama. And we can go into that about the white working class in the South and looking at these numbers we're getting the last couple days about racial hatred in many cases … this isn't about being a better president, they want to get rid of this president,’ he said.” <br> [pullquote] <br> The Huffington Post, a major prObama operation, criticized the economic focus and the moderator’s inability to change that. “Schieffer seemed to be unwilling or unable to move the conversation back to international issues for some minutes,” wrote HuffPo. <br> White House senior adviser and 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe backed off that almost immediately after the debate. “No one thinks it should happen,” Politico reported him saying. <br> As CNN’s now-much-more-famous Candy Crowley put it, “the president came to rough up Mitt Romney.” GOP candidate Romney, on the other hand, “approached this like a physician: ‘first do no harm’” <br> Two NBC staffers noted a key difference between the candidats. “Meet The Press” host David Gregory agreed with Crowley. “Romney seemed more interested in coming across as a sober and careful commander in chief than a bellicose alt to President,” he commented on Twitter. <br> Supporters on the right and the left saw what they wanted to see. Lefty MSNBC analyst Jonathan Alter naturally felt even a peace-supporting Romney was bad. “By reversing his views on war and peace, Romney has raised a character issue about his ability to be trusted as a steadfast defender of U.S.,” he argued. <br> Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, credited the job Schieffer did. “Whatever his biases, and he has biases, Bob Schieffer didn't show them tonight. Unlike Candy Crowley and Martha Raddatz, Schieffer managed to moderate this debate without revealing his own positions. Well done.” <br> The debate was not without its Schieffer-isms. To end a discussion of education, Schieffer added: “I think we all love teachers.” And, of course, he began the first debate question with a reference to liberal icon John F. Kennedy. <br> And yes, Obama once again had more time than Romney, though only 35 extra seconds. That made the Democrats 4-for-4 in debates, garnering an extra 9 minutes and 27 seconds. <br> This article is part of our ongoing series of bias alerts which focuses on calling out bias in the media. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/search-results/opinion/bias-alert.htm">For additional bias alerts click here
 When the House failed to pass Rep. Lamar Smith’s STEM Jobs Act Thursday night, I cried for America. The bill would have reallocated 55,000 green cards to foreign-born graduates with advanced degrees in science, tech, engineering, and math (STEM). By deciding we don't want to keep the world's best and brightest, we squandered an easy, no-cost and long-term boost to our economy. Our political leaders decided to push our nation from world class to average. <br> Yet, when these bright foreign students receive their masters and Ph.D.s from our top universities, we force them to the back of the visa line. Many leave reluctantly, but once back in their native countries they do what we don’t let them do here: innovate, create jobs and build businesses which then compete with U.S. companies. <br> Yet, in this case, actions and words don't match. For more than three years, President Obama and the Democrats have said they will only change the law as part of overall immigration reform. Republican leaders decided for the good of the country to cast off their anti-immigration extremists and push a simple fix. This was more difficult for Republicans than you would think. Just last year, I debated a far right Republican congressman who said he would rather have American B students than foreign A students. I responded that America is an A country. <br> Despite the president’s overtures, for the floor vote the White House went quiet. The word is the administration sent notice to its congressional allies to kill the bill. Democratic House members told reporters they liked letting bright STEM graduates stay here but opposed the Republican legislation because it required a corresponding drop in the number of lottery immigrants - those we allow in from other countries through random lottery. <br> I have no problem with unskilled legal immigrants. I descend from them. Many if not most are hard working and take tough entry-level jobs. <br> All but 30 Democrats voted against this legislation last Thursday. God bless these 30 Democrats for bucking the White House and for putting our nation ahead of party loyalty. <br> I cry for America because it’s clear we aren’t willing to make even the easy choices. I fear I may soon mourn for her greatness as we fail to save ourselves. 
 With the economy sputtering, President Obama would like voters to believe he faces tougher challenges than any president since Franklin Roosevelt and needs two terms to turn things around. Sadly, the president’s problems are so daunting only because his policies are not up to the task. <br> In 1980, Americans were bearing double-digit interest rates and inflation, growing trade deficits on oil and with export juggernauts Japan and newly industrializing economies in Asia, and stuck in a malaise of self-doubt quite similar to today. <br> [pullquote] <br> He removed Carter-era policies that discouraged domestic oil production, and aggressively sought to right-size regulation—not slash and burn, but retaining what was needed to keep business honest and foster competition, and jettisoning the rest. <br> When President Reagan faced voters in 1984, the economy was growing at 6.3 percent and unemployment was down to 7.3 percent—it ultimately fell to 5 percent, as Old Dutch engineered a 92 month economic expansion. <br> Similarly, Mr. Obama inherited an economy crippled by gaping trade deficits—this time with China and again on oil, and too much financial chicanery on Wall Street. <br> President Obama has limited offshore drilling in the Gulf, the North Slope of Alaska and Atlantic and Pacific Coasts—no surprise the petroleum trade deficit is up nearly 70 percent since the recovery began. <br> All this is exacerbated by Dodd-Frank financial reforms, whose bureaucratic burdens are forcing small banks to sell out to their larger brethren on Wall Street, where the deal making, sharp practices and gambling continue seemingly unabated. <br> As President Obama faces the voters, the economy is growing at a 2.2 percent pace. Unemployment has fallen to 8.3 percent but only because so many adults have quit looking for work altogether. If the adult labor force participation rate was the same today as when he took office, the jobless rate would be 11 percent, and most economists see little room for improvement on that sad record. <br> Encouraging individual initiative and entrepreneurs, an understandable tax system, producing more American oil, getting a fair deal for American workers competing with China, lowering health care costs, and smarter regulation of Wall Street—it all makes sense. 
 While the individual mandate tax gets most of the attention, the ObamaCare law actually contains 20 new or higher taxes on the American people. These taxes are gradually phased in over the years 2010 (with its 10 percent “tanning tax”) to 2018 (when the tax on comprehensive health insurance plans kicks in.) <br> 1. The ObamaCare Medical Device Manufacturing Tax <br> These are often small, scrappy companies with less than 20 employees who pioneer the next generation of life-prolonging devices. In addition to raising the cost of health care, this $20 billion tax over the next ten years will not help the country’s jobs outlook, as the industry employs nearly 400,000 Americans. Several companies have already responded to the looming tax by cutting research and development budgets and laying off workers. <br> This onerous tax provision will hit Americans facing the highest out-of-pocket medical bills. Currently, Americans are allowed to deduct medical expenses on their 1040 form to the extent the costs exceed 7.5 percent of one’s adjusted gross income. <br> 3. The ObamaCare Flexible Spending Account Cap</b> <br> The cap will also affect families with special-needs children, whose tuition can be covered using FSA funds. Special-needs tuition can cost up to $14,000 per child per year. This cruel tax provision will limit the options available to such families, all so that the federal government can squeeze an additional $13 billion out of taxpayer pockets over the next ten years. <br> For further proof, note the ObamaCare “medicine cabinet tax” which since 2011 has barred the 13.5 million Americans with Health Savings Accounts from purchasing over-the-counter medicines with pre-tax funds. <br> Under current law, the capital gains tax rate for all Americans rises from 15 to 20 percent in 2013, while the top dividend rate rises from 15 to 39.6 percent. The new ObamaCare surtax takes the top capital gains rate to 23.8 percent and top dividend rate to 43.4 percent. The tax will take a minimum of $123 billion out of taxpayer pockets over the next ten years. <br> 5. The ObamaCare Medicare Payroll Tax increase <br> As you can understand, there is a reason why the authors of ObamaCare wrote the law in such a way that the most brutal tax increases take effect conveniently after the 2012 election. It’s the same reason President Obama, congressional Democrats, and the mainstream media conveniently neglect to mention these taxes and prefer that you simply “move on” after the Supreme Court ruling. 
 Taxpayers will sadly discover that this year will be one month shorter than last year. Why? Bailouts, big budgets, cap and trade energy costs and government medicine move Cost of Government Day one month later than last year. <br> With Cost of Government Day falling on Aug. 12 this year, American workers had to work 224 days out of the year to meet the cost imposed on them by government. In other words, for 2009 the cost of government consumes a whopping 61.34 percent of national income. <br> The dates for the states' Cost of Government Days vary greatly. Alaska comes earliest at 192 days (July 11) and Connecticut, as in previous years does not arrive until much later, forcing workers in the Nutmeg State to work until Sept. 7 -- a full 250 days. <br> The largest component of the total cost of government, according to the report, is federal spending, which consumes 30.36 percent of national income this year and forces the average American worker to work 111 days out of the year just to pay for this component of COGD. <br> In conjunction with the fiscal year 2010 budget, the financial market bailout packet that brought us TARP and the disgraceful trillion dollar spending and debt package Congress passed under theguise of economic stimulus have set taxpayers up for a year in which federal spending has reached a record 28.5 percent of GDP. <br> In light of the ongoing assault on the part of tax-and-spend politicians who are at it with reckless abandon, the scope of this year's Cost of Government Day Report has been expended to include a number of additional case studies the purpose of which is to explore the effects the implementation of certain policies has had or would have on the 2009 COGD. <br> How do we get to an earlier Cost of Government Day? <br> The first order of business should be: When you're in a hole, stop digging. Government needs to get out of the business of being the insurer of last resort. Consequently, the TARP program should be ended immediately and all un-appropriated stimulus funds should be rescinded, as proposed by the Republican Study Committee's REBOUND Act. <br> President Obama and his tax-and-spend posse may try to have you believe otherwise, but the nascent <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/politics/tea-party.htm#r_src=ramp" class="r_lapi">Tea Party Movement, and the reaction of taxpayers at town halls all over the country are a clear sign that Washington's tax and spend policies are not in line with what America wants. Moving Moving toward an earlier Cost of Government Day may be an uphill battle, but it is one worth waging. 
 Like the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, oil spill victims are about to get kicked by the IRS while they are down. <br> After Katrina, many New Orleans residents found that the shortage of carpenters made rebuilding their homes within arbitrary IRS time deadlines impossible. To wait meant that insurance company payments would count as taxable income and a lot of people chose to rebuild in other cities where carpenters and homebuilders were not in such short supply. It hurt New Orleans and hurt our citizens. <br> The economies of our Gulf Coast states will be hard hit enough because of the ripple effect of lost incomes and damage to fishing, oil production and tourism. The IRS should not compound this damage with tax bills on those who are hardest hit. <br> Both the White House and Congress have the power to help by immediately ordering the IRS to forgo tax bills on emergency relief payments to oil spill victims. Common sense and simple compassion require us to take this step. The question is: can common sense trump the usual rigidity of tax policy and the self-interests of those who think that revenue to the federal government is always more important than the pursuit of happiness—or even survival—by our citizens. <br> Individually, we may not be able to do a lot now about damage that has already been done to our waters and shorelines, but we sure can do something about further damage by the IRS to those who now face a hard road in recovering from that damage. Our Online Tax Revolt marchers will immediately begin a journey to New Orleans and will stay there, digitally, until this tax relief has been achieved. <br> Ken Hoagland is chairman of the FairTax National Victory Campaign and the Online Tax Revolt.

 Wed, 29 Apr 2009 05:00:49 +0000 </span><em>By Patrick ColabellaCertified Public Accountant, Ed.D <br> Is it proper for a democracy to have a tax law people just don't understand? We have evolved so far in every aspect of technology except for taxation. The income tax is an industrial revolution concept that has long since passed its functionality and sadly, mandatory education does not include taxation in its curriculum, so most of us are tax illiterates. Why that is so is not the issue. More important is how politicians abuse the complexity to socially engineer us and punish some, something King George tried to do in 1773. The income tax is the subtle master lever behind what is now becoming Socialist America. With the use of the earned income credit, the income tax is now shockingly a routinely used entry-level welfare entitlement. Interestingly, by the treasury's own calculations, abuse of the earned income credit costs the government over $6.5 billion in fraud annually. <br> Briefly, the Withdrawals Tax is based on a single rate of tax that funds all levels of government, federal and local, collected by EFT on withdrawals from taxpayers' bank accounts, like an ATM usage charge or Easy Pass. The estimated tax rate is 5% but may be higher based on government budget needs; the rate would be adjusted by act of Congress. The lower tax rate is achieved by expanding the tax base but higher rates may be needed as budget needs arise. The tax is progressive and levied against individuals and businesses alike. This means there are a threshold and a graduated amount of withdrawal before you begin and as you pay the tax. Your paycheck will get deposited without income tax withholding. You can use all types of debt, tax-free. The loan repayments are taxed instead. <br> No tax returns need to be filed and the collection of revenue will be the same as the tax it replaces. Government can more effectively use this model to manage fiscal policy but not to socially engineer you. Also, if it were efficient for some states, this model can effectively eliminate cumbersome sales tax and estate taxes. In the end there would be enormous tax compliance savings but moreover we would realize a real human capital dividend by eliminating the endless painful effort and ongoing conflict between the government and its citizens in figuring and collecting taxes. 
 Who is the Forgotten Man today? Is it the coal miner whose employer was shuttered by the EPA? The construction worker hoping to build the Keystone Pipeline? Maybe it’s the salesclerk who was laid off because her boss feared having more than 50 people on the payroll as ObamaCare kicks in. <br> Our jobs shortage has disappeared as an issue – buried by a news community anxious to reelect President Obama. The White House has scuttled all discussions of employment and even of the economy. <br> In his second inaugural address, the president waxed enthusiastic about gay rights and the sanctity of our entitlements programs, and also proclaimed that America’s prosperity must “rest on the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.” How that class is supposed to rise when people can’t find jobs is a mystery – one that President Obama has yet to reveal. <br> Mr. Obama only in passing mentioned that “an economic recovery has begun.” Well, it certainly didn’t get very far in the fourth quarter. In fact, output took a nosedive in the final three months of the year, contracting by 0.1% as businesses pared inventories, exports tumbled and government spending took a hit. Doubtless activity will return to modest growth in the current quarter, but the economic news reminds us: something is not quite right in this recovery. <br> How can that be? There are two reasonable explanations. The first stems from a hard look at where corporate profit gains are coming from. After the financial crash, businesses slimmed down, cut staffs and readied for the drop in demand. In time, as business picked up, companies discovered they didn’t need to replace laid-off workers; they could manage with less. And they did so—quite profitably. <br> Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve handed out an unexpected bonus – lower interest rates. A chart contained in a recent presentation by Societe Generale (and published by The Economist) shows corporate net income recovering more robustly in 2010-12 than earnings before tax and interest. Lower interest rates boosted results – a factor that is unlikely to repeat. Earnings per share have been further bolstered by share buy-backs, financed by those same extra-low interest rates. <br> That’s where President Obama’s leadership becomes a factor. After 9/11, President George W. Bush exhorted Americans to go on with their lives despite their fears, asking “continued participation and confidence in the American economy.” (Contrary to many erroneous re-tellings, including by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Time magazine and others, Mr. Bush never urged us to go shopping.) <br> It sounds almost hokey today, but the country was shaken; no one knew what to expect, and it would not have taken much to plunge the nation into an economic crisis. Indeed, the economy was already softening, and unemployment rising, when Bush took office. Instead, people rallied, they went out to dinner and – yes -- they went shopping. <br> By comparison, consumer confidence in the U.S. most recently plunged to 59 in January, after falling for three months. This – in the face of a booming stock market. In the past five years, it hasn’t been able to top 73.1. <br> Instead of cheerleading from President Obama, we get browbeating. Every time the nation’s economy has begun to get traction, Mr. Obama has engaged in a fight with Congress – over health care, the debt ceiling, appointments to the NLRB, environmental regulations – over one issue after another that keeps the country on edge. <br> Is it any wonder that one measure of confidence among the wealthy --Pam Danziger’s Luxury Consumption Index – scored its second biggest loss in January since the start of 2008? <br> Unfortunately, President Obama seems to relish the political brawling and appears unable to rise above campaign mode. That is bad news for the country, and bad news for all those forgotten people who can’t find jobs. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 Former House Speaker (and Fox News contributor) Newt Gingrich went to New Orleans the other day and, in a speech to Republican activists and leaders called President Barack Obama was “the most radical president in U.S. history.” <br> You might think that a president who comes out of America’s leftist traditions and organizations, who successfully maneuvered a national health care bill through Congress, who has called for the global elimination of nuclear weapons and has an agenda to dramatically expand both the size and scope of the federal government, would be pleased to be seen as such. Based on the reaction to Gingrich’s observation, this is not the case. <br> This, of course, could have disastrous consequences for Obama in the 2012 elections – as it already promises to curtail severely the Democratic majorities in Congress. Having campaigned as a centrist he must govern as one, or at least have the American people believe that is what he is doing. <br> For example, the White House wants people to believe that the recent dip in the national unemployment rate is a vindication of Obama’s economic policies. Rather, he suggests, people would do well to remember that the White House’s own projections said that, if approved, the stimulus package would keep the unemployment rate from rising above 8 percent and that they do not have a convincing explanation for why they were so far off the mark. <br> It is deceptive to argue that Obama is a centrist. Rather, as Gingrich suggests, he sits atop a secular, socialist machine that seeks to enlarge the power of the American government in order to remake American society and reshape its values. To deny this is to deny the American people the opportunity to have a meaningful discussion about the country’s future and to make informed choices come the next election. <br> <b>Fox Forum is on Twitter.

 During his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Obama pushed for higher tax rates on what he called “the wealthiest Americans.” <br> “Fairness” was the codeword of the State of the Union address, not the chronic problem of lingering high unemployment, something the president never even mentioned. <br> Unfortunately, some Republicans come across as confused about capital gains taxes. Romney pushes a weak defense of himself rather than an explanation for why capital gains should be taxed at a lower rate than other income. <br> Still worse, Romney seems content to take other Republicans down with him. Romney attacked Newt Gingrich's tax proposal on Monday, which Romney warned would let him get away with paying even less taxes: <br> GINGRICH: Zero. ROMNEY: Well, under that -- under that plan, I`d have paid no taxes in the last two years. <br> The explanation is actually pretty simple. For every dollar that a company makes, state and federal taxes take on average 40 cents. Who bears the burden of those taxes? The owners of the companies, the shareholders, of course. Not some abstract corporation. <br> How much money in taxes is Obama really proposing that American investors pay? Imposing another 30 percent federal tax comes on top of the 40 percent corporate rate that shareholders are already paying. Obama’s proposed 30 percent tax rate may sound “fair,” but he is completely ignoring the corporate income tax. <br> But where is the fairness in imposing such a much higher high tax rate on those who invest in American businesses? <br> If the president really wants to do something about fairness, he can try not giving out huge government favors to politically favored Democratic billionaires. <br> Much of the oil that would have been shipped by the pipeline will still get shipped by Mr. Buffett’s much more expensive railroad. <br> Or the list of other companies owned by other wealthy politically-connected Democratic billionaires such as Tesla Motors, NRG Energy, and Abound Solar Manufacturing that are receiving billions in government money? <br> <i>John R. Lott, Jr.
 One year ago, President Obama addressed a joint session of Congress and restated his central campaign promise: “If your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one single dime.”<br />But on Monday, the White House unveiled a health care plan with a net tax hike of at least $700 billion over the next ten years. Not only does the plan increase taxes more than the House and Senate bills already roundly rejected by the public, several of the tax hikes in the plan violate Obama’s tax pledge. Let’s look at a few examples:<br />Individual mandate excise tax: The White House gets creative with its terminology here, preferring to call this tax a “payment” or an “assessment.” This provision would require all Americans to purchase health insurance – as a condition of lawful existence – or pay an excise tax.<br />This tax was also a pillar of the House and Senate health bills, both endorsed by the White House. In a famous exchange with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos last September, Obama refused to admit that the tax was actually a tax, forcing Stephanopoulos to read aloud the dictionary definition of the word “tax” to the President.<br />Employer mandate tax: If an employer does not offer health coverage, and at least one employee qualifies for a health tax credit, the employer must pay an additional non-deductible tax for all full-time employees. This would apply to all employers with 50 or more employees. Small business owners pay their taxes on their owners’ 1040 forms, and there is no exemption for employers making less than $250,000.<br />Special needs kids tax: This provision caps pre-tax Flexible Spending Account (FSA) contributions at $2,500 per year – currently, these accounts are unlimited. There are 30 million American families using FSAs for everything from deductibles to eyeglasses, but hardest hit would be families with special needs children. These families often rely on their FSA for special needs education, which can cost thousands of dollars per year.<br />“Haircut” for medical itemized deductions: Currently, those facing high medical expenses are allowed a deduction if the total cost of the expenses reduces the filer’s income by 7.5 percent. The new White House provision would raise that threshold to 10 percent.<br />Excise tax on indoor tanning services: Leaving no stone unturned in its hunt for revenue, the White House adopted the Senate’s “tanning bed tax”. Those using indoor tanning services will be hit with a 10 percent excise tax.<br />None of the provisions above include exemptions for families making less than $250,000.<br />Take a look at the plan yourself at the White House Web site, then click over to Obama’s Change.gov site. Under the “Taxes” category, it still reads as follows: “no family making less than $250,000 will see their taxes increase.”<br />Somebody has some explaining to do.<i>John Kartch is director of communications for Americans for Tax Reform and a Fox Forum contributor. 
 The 2012 election did not provide a clear mandate for either party, and certainly not for President Obama. The election itself reflected the polarization of the last four years and offered little in the way of direction about what the American people would like to see done. Rather, this election was more about tactics and campaign techniques than it was about messaging or any sort of vision for the future. <br> The just completed survey shows that over three quarters of the American people would support a compromise that lowers tax rates, reduces deductions as well as promoting pro-growth fiscal policies – all the while reigning in spending and entitlements. In short, the electorate has clearly agreed on a path forward. If only the politicians would listen. <br> A mere 2 days after both sides pledged to work together to reduce the debt and deficit, Republican and Democratic leaders were back to their original position with President Obama saying it is essential to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and House Speaker John Boehner, just as adamant over the weekend in his rejection of any tax increases. <br> Both parties are now viewed extremely negatively – 58 percent view the Republicans in Congress unfavorably and 56 percent say the same about the Democrats. And both parties receive almost equal blame for the country’s economic deterioration – a testament to the deep dissatisfaction the electorate feels towards politicians from both side of the aisle. <br> The results of my survey of 600 randomly selected Americans suggests that the American people are far more aware of the gravity of the fiscal situation than either party has acknowledged. <br> The Bowles-Simpson framework is a clear starting point for negotiation. After receiving widespread public support from the business community just before the election, it is my belief that Bowles-Simpson can, and arguably should, form the basis for both a short term and long term approach to our fiscal challenges. <br> Indeed, there is widespread skepticism that either party has an approach that can save us from the worst ravages of the fiscal crisis. <br> Fortunately, the path forward is clear. Tax reform that reduces rates and limits deductions will, in the electorate’s mind, stimulate the economy and job growth as well as providing a way to address both President Obama’s desire for greater revenue from the wealthy and Speaker Boehner’s desire to lower tax rates. To be sure, tough decisions would have to be made about which deductions to limit, but the idea of means testing the home mortgage deduction and charitable deductions is an immediate possibility for consideration. <br> Politicians of both parties have to change. There must be recognition that the implementation of an economic framework that grows a stagnant economy, stimulates growth and begins the process of reforming entitlements and reducing spending is a necessity. It is what the American people are now demanding and there is little time to waste. 
 As parents across the country scurry to finish Christmas shopping for their families, Congress is quickly trying to deal with a number of tax provisions that expire at the end of the calendar year. <br> But putting aside the question of whether Congress should extend this cut, the rhetoric used within the debate highlights three current problems Washington has: <br> Republicans are not much better. Many in the GOP are insisting the extension be “paid for” (because it will reduce Social Security funds, and is the responsible thing to do) but it is a position they didn’t take last year during the payroll tax debate. Some claim this amounts to a Republican “identity crisis.” Perhaps, but it certainly indicates the type of disingenuousness that makes Americans fed up. <br> This lack of finality to the debates breeds uncertainty. And when you are dealing with things like unsustainable spending and debt, and taxes, that breeds anxiety in the economy.In addition to that, close deadlines allow lawmakers to use issues like the payroll tax cut as political stunts. <br> We’ve touched on it a bit, but the third problem is one of temporariness. Washington doesn’t like to commit to fiscal measures for too long -- because it doesn’t want a full accounting of the expense -- so the U.S. has become a nation living in a temporary fiscal state. <br> When the nation began the holiday season last year, Washington was having the exact same debate – but about different tax measures. Mark your calendars for December 2012 -- that’s when Congress will have to decide whether or not to extend -- again -- the provisions in the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. <br> It’s time for Congress get off the hamster wheel, it's time for lawmakers to stop using political rhetoric to make up for their missed deadlines and temporary policymaking. It’s time to stop the dysfunction -- and that means making a long-term commitment to real spending and tax reform. 
 With the usual Beltway fanfare, President Obama released his FY 2011 budget this morning. What does it say about where the country is going under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid leadership? What’s going to happen with taxes? Has the president learned any lessons from his party’s electoral defeats in November and January? <br> ometimes, these numbers jumped around (higher spending under Carter, higher taxes under Clinton, etc.), but this has been the gravitational pull that we seem to keep coming back to.Under the Obama budget, taxes are scheduled to rise from 14.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 19.6 percent of GDP in 2020 (higher than the historical average of 18 percent). Spending is scheduled to fall slightly from 24.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 23.7 percent in 2020 (much, much higher than the historical average of 21 percent of GDP). The national debt will hit over 77 percent of our economy in 2020, which would be the highest level since 1950, when we were paying off World War II. <br> President Obama hasn’t gotten that message, or at least, if he has, it doesn’t show up in the budget. Rather than enacting meaningful spending program reforms that would bring federal expenditures back to their late-Clinton levels, he puts forward minor spending restraint gimmicks. His spending cuts section comes out to less than one-tenth of one percent of federal spending per year. Even worse, many of his spending reductions are actually tax increases on oil and gas companies. <br> Now attention shifts to the Congress. It’s ultimately going to be up to them. Our lawmakers will ultimately decide which tax hikes will go through at the end of the year. They decide which new taxes are going to become law to pay for unionized ditch-digging and other “stimulative” activities. They appropriate the money. Congress—not the president—will have to answer to the American people in the fall. If they give the same big government pitch that Creigh Deeds, Jon Corzine, and Martha Coakley did, there may be a very different budget atmosphere in Washington next year. 
 What a difference a year makes. The 2010 Senate landscape has been rocked by North Dakota Democrat Senator Byron Dorgan’s stunning announcement Tuesday that he would not seek reelection come November. Retirement announcements from Connecticut Democrat Senator Chris Dodd and Colorado Democrat Governor Bill Ritter came soon after, the latest indicators of a worrisome electoral outlook for Democrats. <br> Dorgan has been getting away with this act for years, so why jump ship now? Putting aside any personal reasons, with Democrats misreading their mandate and overreaching in their control of the House, Senate, and presidency, it became more difficult for Dorgan to disguise his true nature. Dorgan went against the will of his constituents by voting for the Senate health care bill: a recent Rasmussen poll showed 64 percent of North Dakotans oppose the bill. Like former South Dakota Senator Tom Daschle in 2004, Dorgan became exposed for who he is. <br> North Dakota has had an all-Democratic congressional delegation since 1987, something of a paradox in this solidly red state: The last time a Democrat won the popular vote was Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 landslide; the governorship has been in Republican hands since 1993; and the GOP not only enjoys broad majorities in the state House and Senate but controls every statewide office save one. <br> Meanwhile, the state’s other Senator, Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, may think he can sit back and weather the storm until he’s up for reelection in 2012. But if Hoeven eventually wins Dorgan’s seat, trouble lies ahead for Conrad. Just as the high visibility of health care forced North Dakotans to say to themselves, “Dorgan is to the left of me,” a Republican like Hoeven casting opposite votes will leave Conrad exposed and force him to defend his record, day after day, for nearly two years. Naked to the wind, and no longer able to band together with Dorgan, Conrad will have trouble pretending his positions are “moderate” or “reasonable.” 
 I like and respect Grover Norquist. Despite the many matters on which I disagree with him, I respect his consistent, deeply held belief in limited government, which leads him to oppose higher taxes as an enforcement mechanism.<br />Norquist genuinely believes that government is a barrier to helping the poor and improving society. That doesn’t make him anti-poor. He simply believes that the best way to uplift lower-income people is by allowing the private market to create jobs and economic opportunity. <br> Norquist proudly keeps the pledge card, co-signed by two-witnesses, in a vault in his office. His theory or strategy behind the pledge is this: Starve the government of new money (higher taxes), and it must shrink. As he colorfully put it, in one of his most famous quotes:<br />“I don’t want to abolish government … I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.”<br />I recently heard a liberal host of an evening cable TV show describe Norquist as evil. I don’t get that. Politicians willingly sign the pledge, either because they believe in it or are fearful of voter reaction if they don’t. So whom do you blame — Norquist, the politicians who agree to sign the pledge, or the voters themselves?<br />As a liberal, I have the same problem with Norquist’s anti-government philosophy as Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a classmate of Norquist’s at Harvard.<br />In an op-ed piece, Patrick questioned the logic of Norquist’s view that “we could live independently of each other, making our own decisions in our own self-interest. But then who puts out the fires? Who answers the calls to 911? Who educates poor children? Who helps people with disabilities?”<br />Norquist would say, I think, well, government, of course. But much less government, supported by much lower taxes.<br />What he has never answered, to my satisfaction at least, is how we can afford to take care of our poor and our elderly and our hungry children without increasing taxes on the wealthier in our society without increasing our unsustainable $14 trillion debt.<br />Recently Norquist took me to task for describing Herbert Hoover as an anti-tax, anti-regulation conservative in one of my recent columns. His e-mail read: “Herbert-Hoover liked: fewer regulations and lower taxes? I am going to have to throw out a great number of history books. Who knew?”<br />Then his assistant sent me the facts: During his one term, Hoover, to my surprise, raised the top income tax rate from 25 percent to 63 (those earning above $100,000/year); raised corporate tax rates; supported increased tariffs in the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Act; and increased spending from 3.4 percent of the GDP in 1929 to 8 percent in 1933, before FDR took office.<br />To use Norquist’s expression: Who knew?<br />Despite his well-known conservatism, Norquist surprises me. He is often willing to defy conservative orthodoxy, especially on issues of tolerance and open-mindedness. <br> Lanny Davis is a Fox News contributor.

 As I launch a two-week book tour around the USA promoting “This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House,” it’s a perfect time to reflect upon my campaign for president – and thank God for the opportunities I’ve been given in this great nation. <br> Deeply disturbed at what I saw coming out of the White House under President Obama – from forcing ObamaCare on an unwilling public, to weakening our military, to bowing down to foreign leaders, to his dreadful handling of the economy and soft-on-terrorism policies, it was impossible for me to remain on the sidelines. <br> My message for Barack Obama is this: Hope and Change just ain’t working! <br> Growing up in the segregated South with little money -- my family was rich in faith, love and a belief in the American dream. I learned from my parents, Lenora and Luther Cain, Jr., that <b>empowerment</i> – not entitlement, was the key to achieving success in life. You have to work hard – and given the right national policies for less government and lower taxes – the sky is the limit. <br> It’s true that I’m not a politician. Some say that means I can’t understand the government. Washington is full of politicians – how’s that working out for us? <br> Fortunately, more have started to take note – last week’s Wall St. Journal Opinion piece, “Taking Cain Seriously” was a refreshing sign that my message is resonating with Americans. <br> Looking at the Florida results, shouldn’t the question really be if I think Gov. Romney and Gov. Perry will support me when I win the nomination? <br> Admittedly, a major challenge has been name recognition – building over the year from 21% in April to 51% now. But then again, I haven’t been running for president for 5 years or govern a large state – we’ve had to start from scratch. <br> And although my campaign doesn’t have the resources of some others, the Florida results show that it’s about the message – not the money. It will be Americans who elect the next president – not the media. <br> My vision for economic recovery – the 9-9-9 Plan – gains a stronger following nationwide every day. <br> It’s also time for a strong leader – one who knows the difference between our friends and our enemies - and stops giving money to our enemies. One who doesn’t take his cues from the UN – but rather leads with America’s interests at heart. <br> Lastly, thanks to everyone who has jumped aboard the Cain Train – together we will take this country back to common sense solutions! 
 President Obama is rolling the dice. By pushing the Supreme Court to decide on the legality of his controversial Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare), the president risks having his “legacy” legislation declared unconstitutional. That would be a sizeable body blow for Mr. Obama, who has long expected that voters would cheer on not only the health care overhaul, but also his reelection bid. <br> Most important, the debate will remind voters that Mr. Obama spent a year and a half pushing health care “reform” instead of focusing on job creation. <br> The program’s estimated cost continues to soar while insurance fees are skyrocketing, as insurers offset the bill’s requirements that they cover dependent children and persons with “preexisting conditions.” <br> In 2014, as well, Medicaid rolls will swell, driving up the costs of healthcare across the board. All in all, it is not a pretty picture, and it will not help the president. This was anticipated; the legislation was carefully crafted so that its darker aspects would emerge only after Mr. Obama’s presumed reelection. <br> How could this politically canny administration have gone so wrong? <br> Sadly, the parallels exist. <br> ObamaCare is surely the worst manifestation of this power-grab. One lawyer arguing against ObamaCare before the court describes it as “a massive collection of sweeping changes that impose substantial new federal obligations on every corner of society and compel financial action from nearly every citizen of the United States.” That sounds about right. <br> Most important, Mr. Obama spent his political capital, of which each president has but a limited supply. What could he have accomplished instead? <br> He might have proposed a public/private infrastructure works campaign that would have required only modest funding from the government and yet created jobs. <br> He might have embraced an all-out development of our energy resources – not investing in solar companies that go bankrupt -- but opening new territories to oil and gas drilling, and created jobs. <br> Paul Krugman denies that the administration’s insouciant meddling with industries – autos, banks, insurers, oil companies, drug producers, mining, aerospace, credit card outfits, homebuilders and so on – the list lengthens every week- has anything to do with the failed recovery. He is wrong. <br> Once viewed as the savviest apparatchiks on the planet, the president and his team now seem clueless, consistently misjudging the moment and the message. <br> Unhappily for the country, President Obama has indeed channeled FDR, whose policies subdued our economy for the better part of a decade. Let us hope voters today are smarter than those of the 1930s, and that they judge Mr. Obama on his accomplishments, not on his promises. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 Reality television is nothing less than captivating. That’s the brutal truth. Only in America could there be entire shows devoted to someone buying clothes for someone else. (In most houses, the personal shopper is called Mom.) But should there ever be an Academy Award for “Best Caricature of a Real Life” on cable television, surely the Kardashians would win for 2011.<br />In a breathtaking display of marketing genius, the Kardashians are reportedly ready to turn their humble family wedding (a mere $20 million affair) into a cash cow, ready for prime time viewing on E.<br />Media buzz is that much of America will tune in into watch coverage this week of the nuptials as people have learned to love Kim through her struggles – with beauty, fame, fortune, and nary a wardrobe malfunction in sight. Truly she represents the common man, Hollywood style, growing up the well-heeled child of Kris Jenner, with lovely sisters and sidekicks whose sing-song support of each other is lampooned regularly – but with a gentle smile – on “Saturday Night Live.”<br />While spending a small fortune, Kim and her crew will reportedly make money off of the wedding production, sale of photos and even from purchases of her limited edition perfume, Love. It would seem the Beatles were wrong; in honor of Kim’s wedding, you CAN buy me Love.<br />But as Kim prepares to wed NBA player Kris Humphries, sporting her 20.5-carat diamond engagement ring, consider the possibility that not only will the Kardashians singlehandedly make the idea of the profitable wedding every father’s dream, they may do more for the economy of the faltering state of California than all of Barack Obama’s so-called stimulus dollars.<br />And that’s a good thing, because, as every woeful business analyst can attest, the American economy is in a coma.<br />President Obama spent roughly $800 billion to hold down unemployment and stimulate the economy into something resembling, say, China. Now he’s trying to hold on to his job, like a lot of other Americans.<br />Bloomberg business news recently reported, “Confidence among U.S. consumers plunged in August to the lowest level since May 1980, adding to concern that weak employment gains and volatility in the stock market will prompt households to retrench.”Retrench – that’s economist code for, “I ain’t buyin’ nothin.’” Meanwhile, all the smart politicians in the Obama administration – without any real world business experience – concur with each other that the way to get people to spend more money is to take their money and give it to Washington, D.C. to spend for them … because that’s worked so well in the past.<br />And those bureaucrats can run up a tab. Americans for Tax Reform reported recently that Americans work a full 224 days a year to pay for local, state and federal government spending and regulations.<br />But let’s get real. In this consumer-driven economy, the Kardashian extravaganza may do more for real people in California than the pitiful fizzy-lifting-drink of Wonka magic that passed for a failed economic boost out of Washington, D.C.<br />Sure, Kim may have to make do with a $20,000 wedding cake styled like England’s royal newlyweds, a Vera Wang wedding dress, and wedding invitations that cost $250 each. <br> Under the Kardashian stimulus plan, at the end of the day, real hair dresses, waiters, bakers, caterers, car rental companies, florists, jewelers, television networks and home shopping denizens among many others will receive a check for a job well done.<br />And as Kim and Kris’ guests throw gold dust, rather than rice, over the departing newlyweds, one can only hope that this real-world stimulus plan is the start of good things for the happy couple – and the great state of California.<br />If the Obama administration would take the bulls-eye off the wallets of Americans with jobs and resources, perhaps then the much maligned “millionaires and billionaires” of Hollywood could get back to the business of creating jobs and circulating resources in the economy. But not just yet. This weekend...they’ll be busy at Kim’s wedding.<br />Kristi Stone Hamrick is a media consultant, future mother of the bride and served as a bridesmaid 19 times.</i> <br> Kristi Stone Hamrick is a media consultant and active cupcake baker for all school functions.

 First, do no harm. That is a useful injunction for doctors, lawyers, and, it turns out, U.S. presidents. <br> The speech did at least temporary harm. As soon as he finished speaking, the already jittery financial markets plunged. <br> They didn’t want him to repeat his basic talking points: the need to marshal the “political will” to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance benefits, or create an infrastructure bank. <br> Americans wanted to hear what President Obama was planning to do to create jobs and stop our economy from slipping over an economic abyss into a double-dip recession. <br> One must sympathize with the president. Last week was his worst week ever in the job. <br> Then he became the first president to have a downgrading of America’s credit worthiness on his watch – an action taken by Standard Poor’s, a company that made a two trillion dollar mistake in its own budget calculations and which gave the highest credit rating to Lehman Brothers on the verge of bankruptcy and to the mortgage-backed securities that helped cause the 2008 financial crisis. How do you spell “chutzpah” on Wall Street? <br> Then markets plunged. <br> Now, the left of his party, too, is in full rebellion. On Sunday, Drew Westen, a professor of psychology at Emory, articulated the fury of liberal Democrats in a New York Times Sunday Review essay. <br> How can one explain this lack of leadership? Westen offered several harsh theories. Perhaps Obama is, as conservatives have alleged, too inexperienced and hence, incompetent. Obama, he wrote, “had accomplished very little before he ran for president, having never run a business or a state.” He had a “singularly unremarkable career as a law professor, publishing nothing in 12 years at the University of Chicago other than an autobiography.” Finally, before joining the Senate, he had voted present rather than yea or nay 130 times, “sometimes dodging difficult issues.” <br> Ouch. No wonder Mr. Obama looked so very shaken during a speech that was intended to boost the nation’s confidence. 
 How can community activist President Obama continually underestimate the Tea Party? Mr. Obama celebrated his ability to clean up asbestos from public housing as a young organizer; why is he blind to the growing power of Tea Party activists who are trying to clean up our country’s balance sheet? <br> One thing is clear: the Tea Party won the debt ceiling skirmish and changed the nation’s discourse. The movement shifted the country’s focus to cutting spending and restoring our country’s fiscal health – a stunning volte face for our indulgent body politic. You have to wonder, when will Mr. Obama take the Tea Party seriously? <br> Fast forward to those midterm elections, when the GOP picked up 6 senate seats, 63 House seats and 5 governorships. It was, by any definition, a landslide – and a massive repudiation of President Obama’s first *two* years in office. It was also heavily influenced by the Tea Party. <br> In all of 2009, as the Tea Party spawned thousands of gatherings across the country protesting ballooning government outlays and ObamaCare, network TV ran just 19 stories or segments about the new group, according to a study by the Media Research Center. Imagine. A new political movement gains stride, and steals a Massachusetts senate seat, and is virtually ignored by network TV. <br> President Obama adopted this narrative, perhaps blinding himself to the political threat the movement contained. In April 2009, asked about the thousands of protests taking place on tax day around the nation, White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said “I don’t know if the president is aware of the events.” Soon thereafter, White House advisor David Axelrod explained the demonstrations saying “I think any time you have severe economic conditions there is always an element of disaffection that can mutate into something that’s unhealthy.” <br> It was finally (and surprisingly) the New York Times that ventured forth to record who was actually turning up at Tea Party rallies. They were shocked (and no doubt dismayed) to find the protesters “wealthier and more educated” than the general public, laying to rest the myth that the movement was spawned by skinheads and wing-nuts. <br> The 2008 presidential campaign showcased the power of the multitude and upended many assumptions about the importance of traditional party outlets. The 2012 campaign may be equally stunning; this time, however, the Tea Party may be in the driver’s seat. The GOP should hope that President Obama remains oblivious to their challenge. <br> Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

 Now that the national debt ceiling deal is done – and liberals like me are unhappy and conservatives deservedly have more to cheer about – Thanksgiving 2011 will be more than about good turkeys. This is the deadline for the so-called “super” congressional committee of six Democrats and six Republicans from the House and Senate to cut at least $1.2 trillion in the projected budget deficit for the next 10 years. <br> But if you are an anti-tax conservative who sincerely believes that you have to cut spending and not “feed the beast” with more revenues, then one approach on spending cuts for the super committee to consider is the simple and creative “Penny Plan” introduced by Rep. Connie Mack (R.-Fla.). <br> There is an automatic spending cut “trigger” under Mr. Mack’s plan – one he came up with well before the trigger used in the recently passed national debt ceiling bill. If congress failed to enact a budget implementing the one-percent-actual-spending cut required under Mr. Mack’s measure, then there would be automatic, across-the-board actual cuts in all federal programs to meet the one percent reduction, and that means all: in defense, Social Security, Medicare, Food Stamps, defense and national security spending, everything. <br> We had $1 trillion in surplus – money in the bank – when Bill Clinton left office on January 20, 2001, just eight years after he began his presidency inheriting a $300 billion deficit. Now we are heading towards a $15 trillion debt. How did this happen? <br> I am a liberal Democrat who believes that the national debt and annual deficits are the country’s greatest moral issues. We cannot continue to use credit cards to pay for wars, corporate jet write-offs, and Social Security and Medicare – and leave it to our children, grand-children, and probably great grand-children to pay our bills. <br> But since the “balanced” solution of both increased revenues and spending cuts entitlement reform is supported in virtually ever poll by substantial majorities of all voters, including large numbers of Republicans, Democrats need to find a spending cut formula that they can live with. The Mack Penny Plan seems a good place to start -- it is simple, it makes common sense, and with some adjustments protecting the poor and the unemployed, it could be seen as fair even to many of the most liberal Democrats. <br> In this time of crisis – and I believe our national debt is a genuine and historic crisis – we need members like Mr. Mack who know how to reach across the aisle, as I have seen him do many times, to find common solutions. The Mack Penny Plan deserves serious consideration – as serious as the man who proposed it. <br> He is the principal in the Washington, D.C. law firm of Lanny J. Davis Associates, which specializes in strategic crisis management. He served as President Clinton’s Special Counsel in 1996-98 and as a member of President Bush’s Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board in 2006-07.

 The House Democrats released their long-awaited draft health care reform bill today, and every rumor about what tax hikes would be included was true--and then some. My friend Ryan Ellis over at Americans for Tax Reform posted the details. <br> Combined with President Obama's plan to repeal the Bush tax cuts on schedule in 2011, this would mean hiking the top marginal capital gains tax rate from 15 percent to 25.4 percent--much higher than Obama promised on the campaign trail, and near the 28 percent rate from before the 1997 Bill Clinton tax cuts. Such a tax hike would slam the brakes on capital formation and wallop capital markets with another gut punch just as they are finally beginning to recover from the financial crisis. It would also dramatically inhibit badly needed business investment. <br> Such punitive income tax rates would be a huge impediment to business activity throughout the economy, especially for the small and medium-sized business that create nearly all of the new employment that we need to lead us out of the recession. <br> There would also be a new tax on individuals who don't have health insurance, flying in the face of President Obama's key primary campaign promise not to require people to be insured. That tax would be another 2.5 percent of AGI. <br> The tax hikes in this bill represent the last piece of the puzzle--along with loose monetary policy and high government spending--to repeat the key economic blunders of the 1970s, with all the misery that came with them. 
 The same Republicans who vote for tax cuts for the rich have tried to choke off long-term unemployment benefits. <br> After the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans led by newly minted Speaker John Boehner (R- Ohio) made it clear that their No. 1 legislative priority was to extend those tax cuts. The GOP said ending the tax cuts posed a danger to the economic recovery. President Obama, still reeling from the “shellacking ” his party took in the election, agreed to the GOP’s demand and signed an extension of the very tax cuts he had long opposed. <br> If raising the tax rate on the richest Americans is the work of a socialist, what are we to make of the Republican icon, former President Ronald Reagan? At the end of Reagan’s first term, the rate was at 50 percent. Under Richard Nixon’s administration, it was at 70 percent. And under Dwight Eisenhower, it was a staggering 91 percent. <br> Obama’s push for tax hikes as part of his deficit-cutting efforts is modest when compared to Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan — and comes at a time of crisis over the debt and with the nation engaged in two costly long-term wars. But somehow Boehner feels it is politically smart to announce that any deficit reduction plan that includes tax increases is “unacceptable and a non-starter.” <br> Somehow, no Republicans felt compelled to rally around Coburn and denounce Norquist. <br> The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, chaired by former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), reached essentially the same conclusion last year. <br> Almost one out of every 10 Americans are out of work. Yet the same Republicans who vote for tax cuts for the rich have tried to choke off long-term unemployment benefits and deny aid to tornado victims. <br> Now House Republicans are resurrecting President Bush’s failed scheme to privatize Social Security. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, introduced the “Savings Account For Every American Act,” which would allow people to immediately opt out of Social Security in favor of a private “S.A.F.E.” account. <br> What has happened to the once Grand Old Party? 
 If the 2012 election is about too much spending in Washington D.C., President Obama is in real trouble.<br />Obama, Reid and Pelosi began their reign in 2009 when they launched a spending spree that included stimulus spending, bank bailouts, union bailouts, a trillion dollar hike in domestic discretionary spending and then trillions more coming in the form of health care spending and corporate bailouts galore.<br />Obama's 2012 budget continues and increases this spending. (His first two years have been one long Seinfeld episode--no learning has taken place.) The president's budget raises taxes by $1.5 trillion in higher income taxes over the next decade.<br />Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan's budget, now passed by the Republican Congress drops Obama's spending by $6 trillion dollars. He stops the government take over of health care. He ends the bailouts. The Democrats' tax hike plans are stopped.<br />If nothing changes, this stark difference between Democrats and Republicans will lead to a repeat of the 2010 crushing defeat for Democrats.<br />That is why Obama set up a deficit commission, sometimes called the Simpson/Bowles Commission to focus, not on the country's spending problem, but rather on the resulting deficits. Too much spending can only be remedied by spending less. <br> When he was warned about the massive tax increases in the Obama Commission report, he and two other Republican Senators in the Gang of Six, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Saxby Chambliss of Geogia, wrote a public letter promising that the only increases in tax revenue they would support would flow from higher economic growth--not tax hikes. <br> If and when there is a legislative proposal to be presented to Congress and the American people, we look forward to again working with you and all interested parties to support a proposal where any increase in revenue generation will be the result of the pro-growth effects of lower individual and corporate taxrates for all Americans. 
 Wed, 15 Apr 2009 16:45:28 +0000 </span>Today, April 15, as millions of anti-tax/pro-limited government activists are peacefully gathering at tea parties to protest the Nanny State--will Big Brother be watching? <br> But it not the only such report. A similar such report was released in Missouri, from a state-government-run Fusion Center, a law-enforcement consortium which targeted Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and Chuck Baldwin, among many other law-abiding conservatives and libertarians. <br> Fusion Center, of course, is simply a fuzzy-sounding name for state-funded surveillance. And it's state-funded surveillance, of course, with a distinctly liberal politically-correct tilt--aimed at smearing right-of-center politicking as being first cousins to violence and terrorism. It's a bad rap, of course, but it's a popular rap among liberals who wish to push conservative dissent off to the fringe. <br> So that's some progress in Missouri. But it is not enough for Governor Nixon to simply say that the document has been recalled. The state of Missouri should, in fairness to all its citizens, should terminate those who had anything to do with the creation and distribution of this document. <br> Because if nobody is really punished--if the retraction (if there is one) is simply a mumble-mouthed pro-forma (with a wink), then nothing will be achieved, and the taxpayers will once again be subsidizing their own surveillance and the further loss of their freedom. <br> Oh, and by the way, if the federal government, or state governments, are worried about thuggish, and perhaps criminal, behavior by political activists, they should be investigating the University of North Carolina, where extremists drove former Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Co.) off campus before he could finish speaking. 
 Washington is known for political posturing rather than positive progress, with the most recent House repeal of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 serving as another example of Washington's symbolism over substance. <br> Our country is at a critical crossroads. We face a range of key sustainability challenges that threaten our future position in the world and standard of living at home. The largest of these is our nation's fiscal challenge. It is a much greater threat to our future than the Chinese, Al Qaeda or others. The cold but hard truth is that we have met the enemy and it is us. Washington has been fiscally irresponsible and violating its fiduciary duty and stewardship responsibility for far too long. <br> President Obama should use his State of the Union speech to state the facts and speak the truth to the American people about the true financial and fiscal state of our nation. He must help the American people understand the difference between our short-term deficits which are driven largely by temporary factors and the structural ones that represent the true threat to our nation's future. <br> The president must also tell the American people what he plans to do with his Fiscal Responsibility and Reform Commission's recommendations and how they will be reflected in his fiscal 2012 budget and broader legislative agenda. <br> He should propose a path for reforming social insurance programs, cutting defense and other spending, and engaging in comprehensive tax reform that will generate more revenues. In doing so, he must recognize the need for more meaningful citizen education and engagement and set realistic expectations regarding what can and can not be achieved within certain time frames. <br> He should also support re-imposing meaningful statutory budget controls beginning in 2013. These controls must be tougher than the ones that helped us restore fiscal sanity in the 1990s. They should include PAYGO rules that do not include trillions of dollars in loopholes, tough but realistic total discretionary spending caps, and specific annual public debt/GDP targets that would begin in 2013 or 2014. <br> It's time for truth, transparency and tough choices. President Obama will have the bully pulpit during his State of the Union address. He must use it to state the facts, speak the truth, and lay out a vision for how he believes we should proceed. He must call for progress over partisanship and civility over conflict. <br> David M. Walker, is founder and CEO of The Comeback America Initiative, and former Comptroller General of the United States. 
 Repeal and replace – but also reinvigorate. <br> Last Thursday, Congressional Republicans revealed a new “Pledge to America,” including a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare with commonsense, fiscally sustainable health care reforms that will improve health care and expand access to affordable health insurance. <br> But Republicans should also promote a bipartisan agenda that will strengthen America’s global leadership in the field of biomedical innovation. By creating a better climate for medical innovation today, policymakers will reap huge dividends from more high paying biotech jobs, new cures for life-threatening diseases, and new treatments that will help Americans remain healthier and more productive as they age -- reducing the strain on government programs like Social Security and Medicare. <br> A true innovation agenda would start with tax reform. The U.S. corporate tax rate (the world’s highest, at nearly 40 percent) is a job-killer, encouraging companies to outsource jobs and manufacturing capacity to lower-tax countries. Reducing this rate so that it’s closer to (or even better yet, lower than) the OECD average of 26 percent would be a powerful incentive for more companies to invest in biotechnology jobs and facilities in the United States. <br> Finally, we need to modernize the FDA and overcome the gap between the rapid advances in basic science and the dearth of innovative new drugs actually coming to market. Part of the problem, as the FDA’s own leadership and science board has acknowledged, is that the agency is using 20th century regulatory tools to evaluate 21st century medicines. The result is a cumbersome and expensive process that can take a decade and cost hundreds of millions (or billions) of dollars to generate a single FDA-approved drug. <br> Congress should also follow Europe’s lead and fund a joint venture that can help revolutionize how we test and develop new medicines. Budget costs from increased funding for biomedical innovation can be offset in ways that also improve health – for instance, reducing obesity by slashing the billions in annual agricultural subsidies for corn byproducts that flood our grocery stores with cheap junk food. <br> Paul Howard is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the director of its Center for Medical Progress.

 Between now and the November 2 election there are several dangers that stand between conservatives and the overwhelming victory that present polls predict. <br> <b>The second threat is that of distraction by “shiny things.” </i>Many issues pop up and politicians and talk show hosts are intrigued and tempted to spend precious minutes talking about new and exciting issues rather than focus on the spending that threatens our future. <br> Why trade a tried and true issue that Democrats cannot escape for new issues that may or not actually move votes—as opposed to flap tongues? And new issues give Democrats an opportunity to separate themselves from the unpopular Obama, Reid and Pelosi. <br> The mosque in Manhattan presented the same danger. Harry Reid of Nevada has voted lockstep with Obama. But when Newt Gingrich announced that a mosque in Manhattan was a central issue for this election...voila….Harry Reid received a “get out of jail free” card where he could posture as a conservative battling Obama. Never mind that a Senator from Nevada cannot undo the First Amendment or stop anyone from building a church, synagogue, temple or mosque anywhere. <br> When you are losing—you want distractions.<br />When you are winning—you do not want distractions. <br> As soon as the dust begins to settle on the November 2 election the movement must be prepared for two projects. <br> In 1995, the Contract with America was the exoskeleton that held the Republicans together in the House and Senate for two years. <br> This must not happen again. The movement and Republican congressmen should create a contract with America for 2012 and invite would-be presidential contenders to sign on. No more “going with the flow” or whoever becomes the GOP’s nominee. He or she gets to be president. <br> And lastly, the moment the November 2 election is settled, grown up Republicans and conservatives should immediately focus on 2012 and 2014 to plan the path to a 60-vote majority in the Senate. A House majority is a good start. A Senate majority is nice. But only a House majority and 60 plus votes in the Senate ensure control of the agenda in Washington, D.C. <br> <b>Fox News Opinion is on Twitter. Follow us @fxnopinion.</span> 
 In 2001 and 2003, President Bush and the Republican Congress cut taxes for everyone. Like the Reagan tax cuts and the Kennedy tax cuts before them, the Bush tax cuts are historical events that help define today’s tax reality. <br> The current federal income tax system is a heavy burden on work, saving, investment and entrepreneurial risk taking, and therefore it is a positive hindrance to reviving the U.S. economy and creating new jobs. It should be scrapped. <br> Of course, any serious discussion of taxes cannot take place in isolation from a larger debate over public spending; the reason government levies taxes to begin with. How much of the nation’s income should government confiscate for public spending? What programs should be cut and what programs, if any, should be expanded? <br> As a general proposition, history informs us that once marginal tax rates rise above 30 percent, they become demonstrably counterproductive. John Maynard Keynes thought any tax rate over 25 percent was counterproductive. Adding additional layers of taxation on top -- as we do currently with the corporate income tax (soon to have the highest corporate tax rate in the world), taxes on dividends and capital gains makes a bad situation economically intolerable. People work, save and invest less, and they take fewer entrepreneurial risks. <br> When tax rates are lowered, the share of taxes paid by upper-income individuals and businesses rises as they bring their money back into productive activity, which benefits everyone. <br> In the 1960s, after the Kennedy tax rate reductions cut the top marginal tax rate from 91 percent to 70 percent, the share of taxes paid by those earning more than $50,000 rose from 11.6 to 15.1 percent. <br> By contrast, today’s top rate remains 35 percent. It is time to cut tax rates across the board once again. As Jack Kemp used to say, “If you want to ‘soak the rich,’ cut their tax rates.” <br> “It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now … Cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.” <br> Such action to revive economic growth would set the stage for a grand national debate in 2012 where serious long-term reforms could be put on the table, including entitlement reform, which would lower long-term spending and permanently eliminate deficits. <br> Lawrence A.

 In his Tuesday address to the nation, President Obama used the Gulf of Mexico tragedy to twist the facts, bend the truth, and attempt to capitalize on a national disaster to push job-killing energy tax legislation. Here are six mistruths presented by the president. <br> However, the president has not taken the first and easiest step to allow other countries to assist in the clean-up efforts by waving the Jones Act. Based on the 1920 Merchant Marine Act all goods shipped between U.S. ports must be transported in U.S.-built, U.S.-owned and U.S. -manned ships – yet another gift to Big Labor. President George W. Bush waived the Jones Act to allow assistance from foreign countries during the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita almost immediately. <br> He continued by saying, “I have issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling. I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs.” Apparently, the potential loss of 120,000 jobs and as many as 46,200 supporting jobs becoming idled by the moratorium, during the worst recession our country has experienced, is just a mere “difficulty” for the men and women whom these rigs employ. Glad to see the president has his priorities in line. <br> Yet he must have forgotten that 80 percent of the first $1 billion spent on grants to wind energy companies in the Recovery Act went to foreign firms and jobs to build turbines overseas. In the second round of government grants, 79 percent of the $2.1 billion in grants went to companies based overseas; of this money, $2.9 billion went to wind facilities. <br> For example, in Florida, the DeSoto Solar Center was supposed to be the “largest solar power plant in the United States,” according to President Obama. The center received $150 million from the Recovery Act. After using 400 construction workers to build the site, the Solar Center now employs only two people. These jobs are simply not sustainable. <br> The Inspector General found the jobs impact “has not materialized” and the Government Accountability Office found the application of costly Davis-Bacon wage requirements equates to over $57,000 per home nationwide. How this helps the economy is yet to be proven. <br> The real effects the president refers to are <i>not</b> something our economy can afford. If his vision is passed into law, gasoline prices will rise 58 percent (or $1.38), natural gas prices will rise 55 percent, heating oil prices will rise 56 percent, electricity prices will rise 90 percent and a family of four can expect their per-year energy costs to rise by $1,241. <br> Rather than using this tragedy for political gain, the president should support an “all of the above” energy approach that incorporates a diverse variety of energy sources without mandates, subsidies, or taxes that artificially skew the market in favor of one form of energy over another. <br> Brian Johnson is federal affairs manager at Americans for Tax Reform. 
 The “tax extenders” package is up again this week in the U.S. House of Representatives. The extenders package’s basic purpose is to prevent tax deductions and credits from expiring for businesses and families. But in Speaker Pelosi’s Washington, stopping these tax increases for another year means imposing other, permanent tax hikes somewhere else. By way of this strategy, Congressional Democrats have set up an annual, permanent, new set of tax hikes on legislation that “must pass.” This time, the concurrent tax offsets will take the form of marginal income tax rate hikes. <br> All tax hikes are bad for the economy, but some are downright catastrophic. The latter is on display in this year’s extenders package as the “pay-fors.” According to published reports, there are two main tax hikes in the bill: taxing “carried interest” capital gains more like ordinary income, and imposing the Medicare payroll tax on service-sector Subchapter S-corporation profits. <br> Democrats argue that the “carried interest” the manager has earned is simply wages in disguise. This is factually inaccurate. In fact, this money is the result of investment appreciation of an asset like a stock or a building—in other words, it is plainly a capital gain. When the investment manager realizes this gain, he rightfully pays taxes at the capital gains tax rate under current law. <br> Not being ignorant cattle unwittingly led to the slaughter, investment fund managers won’t simply “eat” this tax hike. The most likely scenario is that the rest of the partners—limited parties such as defined benefit pension plans, university endowments, and charitable trusts—will see their share of the profits shrink. The true incidence of this tax hike will come in the form of underfunded pensions, endowments, and charities. <br> This tax hike will have one major impact—S-corporation owners will draw more capital out of their companies in order to pay Uncle Sam. The owners themselves won’t be hurt at all—it will be the business which suffers through a capital drain. <br> In both cases—the carried interest tax hike and the S-corporation tax hike—there’s an interesting phenomenon of unintended consequences. In seeking to hike taxes on “greedy” investment partnership managers, Congress actually reduces the value of stocks owned by Americans’ pension plans and the endowments of our universities and charitable foundations. In seeking to hike taxes on those who dare to start profitable and job-creating small businesses, Congress will in fact only impoverish the capital reserves of those businesses, depressing productivity-enhancing investments, killing jobs, and lowering wages for those still lucky enough to have a job. <br> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/us/grover-norquist.htm#r_src=ramp" class="r_lapi">Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform.</i> 
 In an interview with CNBC’s John Harwood on Wednesday, President Obama refused to rule out the imposition of a value added tax (VAT) on Americans. <br> In fact, the White House has <i>never</b> ruled out the possibility of a VAT, which may explain why the president is now attempting to alter the terms of his central campaign promise. <br> “And one thing we have not done is raise <i>income taxes </b>on families making less than $250,000. That’s another promise we’ve kept.” <br> “And one thing we haven’t done is raise income taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year -- another promise that we kept.” <br> Pulling the wool over our eyes with an altered tax pledge and a complacent media would allow the Obama administration two significant -- albeit deceptive -- achievements. First, it would retroactively absolve Obama from his previous violations of the pledge. In the health care bill Obama signed into law, there were at minimum seven tax hikes that unquestionably hit families making less than $250,000 – from the individual mandate tax to the excise tax on indoor tanning sessions. And let’s not forget the pledge-breaking tax increase signed into law sixteen days into his presidency: a 156 percent hike in the federal excise tax on tobacco. Courtesy of his new claim that his campaign pledge applied only to income taxes, Obama could pretend he is in full compliance (But even with the goal posts moved, he would still be in violation due to Obamacare’s restrictions on medical itemized deductions). The ruse has certainly worked since its debut on April 10, with Obama escaping any specific scrutiny focused on the altered terms of his pledge. <br> Because the president made the “any form of tax increase” promise to the American people, he has a responsibility to stand up and renounce all of the VAT flirtations of his advisors and appointees. During his Wednesday interview with CNBC, he had the ideal opportunity to bring the matter to a close once and for all. Obama was asked point blank by Harwood if Americans should think of his middle class tax promise “as lasting for the entirety of your presidency – you would never accept tax increases for that group? Or is it something for the initial phase of your presidency -- now you take account again of where the deficit is and make a different decision?”Instead of slamming the door shut on the very notion of a tax hike, Obama pivoted and concluded that he would “wait for the fiscal commission to provide me what their best recommendations are.” <br> There should remain no mystery as to why the president is attempting to rewrite the terms of his tax pledge. Whether he gets away with it is another story. <br> <span style=" color: #ED1C24;">Fox Forum is on Twitter. Follow us @fxnopinion.</b> 
 Today, April 9, is Tax Freedom Day. <br> In theory, everything we earn for the rest of the year is ours to keep. <br> Tax Freedom Day measures the average American’s percentage of the year’s income that he or she has to fork over in taxes. There are some Americans who pay little or no tax or bureaucrats who actually get paid by our tax dollars. You, taxpaying American, are shouldering their load as well as your own, so you are not off the hook today. <br> Last year Americans worked 42 days to pay for the cost of federal regulations. Federal regulations cost us more than 10 percent of our incomes. Those costs are embedded by law in products and services and the wily politicians hope that we will direct our anger at the companies forced by regulations to include features we as consumers didn’t ask for, couldn’t say no to and might not want at all. <br> There are two ways to limit the cost of government. The first is to change the Congress and the White House and elect a government that will actually focus on the size of government. The second is to move from a high spending state to a low spending state. Connecticut citizens work 250 days to pay for government—total government spending plus the regulatory burden. New Yorkers, 243. New Jerseyans, 249. These taxpayers can save a month of one’s income each year by moving. South Dakotans work 201 days a year. Texans, 213. Nevadan’s, 216. <br> The goal of the left in America is to trick Americans to focus on the deficit. Here the left has a solution: higher taxes, specifically a Value Added Tax. We must keep our focus on total government spending and the solution to the problem is then clear. Spend less. <br> <i>Fox Forum is on Twitter. Follow us @fxnopinion.</i> 
 While nationally, all eyes are on the government takeover of the health care industry, a proposal to ban the use of salt in restaurant cooking has New York’s chefs and restaurateurs up in arms. <br> They have found an ally in the White House in President Obama, who is going much further than joining his wife in advocating healthy food choices from the White House garden. The president’s idea of taxing soda and sugar-sweetened beverages as part of the health care overhaul quickly fizzled, however this hasn’t stopped the advancement of the nanny staters’ agenda. <br> So far, two rounds of related grants have been announced - a first round of $120 million went to states and territories in early February, and a second round of $372 million has just been awarded to 44 local communities last week. So what are you getting out of it? <br> While descriptions for some of the latest projects funded under the program sound almost laughable -- what exactly do you think they mean when they talk about “increasing point-of-decision health prompts at stairwells and elevators in public venues”? -- it becomes abundantly clear that this is a concerted effort to advance government control over our consumption decisions when reviewing the CDC’s guideline document for grantees. <br> The code words for pushing for tax increases in the grantee guidelines are “evidence-based pricing strategies to discourage tobacco use” and “changing relative prices of healthy vs. unhealthy items.” Of course that only becomes clear after reviewing the references used in CDC’s supporting documentation, but then again, why would they want to advertise that they’re planning to spend our money to raise our taxes to expand control over our personal lives? <br> I’ll leave the answer up to you.

 It comes as no surprise that President Obama received a sizeable bump in public opinion after the announcement of the death of Usama bin Laden on May 1. A New York Times/CBS News poll shows an 11-point jump in approval to 57 percent (up from 46 percent last month). And the Washington Post/Pew Research Center found similar gains, with 56 percent approving of President Obama, up from 47 percent. <br> A poll by the Economist magazine conducted April 9-12 found that 91 percent of adults consider the budget deficit a somewhat or very important issue. Still, the same poll revealed that Americans remain reluctant to make the serious cuts in government programs that are necessary to restore the nation’s fiscal solvency – only 27 percent would support a decrease in spending. And when respondents were asked if they would be willing to accept cuts to spending that “benefits people like you,” only 20 percent of Americans said “definitely” yes. <br> A more honest explanation, however, is that Americans’ confusion about the budget and the economy is a function of a decades-long leadership deficit. Politicians and others in the “opinion class” have been playing make-believe about the nation’s financial situation for years. It is unrealistic to expect that taxpayers will fully accept and understand the nature of the significant changes that must be made to get the deficit and debt under control when lawmakers in Washington are not being forthcoming about what has to be done. <br> On one hand, Team Obama admits there's a problem and concedes that spending needs to be restrained, but their solution is simply higher taxes and more spending. And by calling for taxes on “the rich,” the president is not only reneging on the agreement he made in December to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, he is also misleading the American people into thinking that repeal would be enough to eliminate the deficit. <br> Education will eventually mean that more Americans will support spending cuts; still, it does not mean the confusion will be easy to dispel. After all, Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) was speaking out about earmarks for 20 years before the public groundswell against them was strong enough to spark action by Congress. <br> Rep. Ryan is not alone. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has turned a spotlight on the dishonesty of the budget debate; many of the supposedly “radical” cuts in the last budget deal were, as he wrote in The American Spectator earlier this month, “actually a rescission of spending authority for projects and programs that the government wasn’t going to need anyway.” In other words, they weren’t cuts at all. <br> On April 19,The Washington Post editorial board pointedly criticized the president and Democrats who are fighting for a “clean” debt ceiling bill free from any spending cuts, explaining that the vote, “offers an opportunity to accomplish some real deficit reduction.” <br> While Americans are applauding the president for his action in Pakistan last week, their support does not easily translate into other policy areas. Unless the president can show clear, consistent leadership on the economy, his bump in approval ratings will be just another flash in the pan. 
 Sixty days ago President Obama submitted a fiscal year 2012 budget to Congress. <br> Obama’s FY 2012 budget called for $2 trillion in higher spending by the end of this decade. It increased taxes by about $1 trillion dollars. There were no real reforms in entitlements or rollbacks of the one trillion dollar increase over the decade in increased domestic discretionary spending enacted in 2009. Its goal was to lock in the vast spending increase of 2009 and 2010 that brought federal spending up from the traditional 20% of GDP to 25% of GDP. He hoped to be a moderate because after the spending binge he would stabilize the spending at his “new normal. “ <br> But if he means to enact his original budget and mesh it with the Simpson-Bowles Commission proposals, it results in the following: <br> -- Net taxes will be raised by $1 - $3 trillion over the next decade. (According to Simpson-Bowles itself, their proposal is a net tax hike of $1 trillion. Paul Ryan believed the actual tax hike was closer to $2 trillion. The Heritage Foundation said $3 trillion.) <br> -- The rate at which two-thirds of small business profits face taxation will rise from 35% to 39.6%. You can’t raise the tax rate on households making more than $250,000 per year without also raising the tax rate at which most small business profits face taxation. <br> -- The death tax rate will rise from 35% to 45%, and the exemption will be cut from $10 million to $3.5 million. This is the result of Obama’s budget, and would certainly be needed to raise taxes by as much as he would like to. <br> What else did we learn from the speech? <br> Second, the President’s advisors are scared of the Paul Ryan budget proposal that will be voted through the House of Representatives this Friday. Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has actually gone to the work of writing down a budget. The President’s speech today was an endorsement of sorts of a series of essays written by retired politicians Simpson and Bowles. The White House had told itself for months that the Republicans would come up with a budget that would be a political liability for all Republicans in 2012. The Democrats hoped that Ryan would rush to balance the budget by cutting and slashing programs. Instead Ryan put forward a well thought out series of reforms that slash nothing in the short run, but instead reform spending programs to slow growth and reduce overall spending over time. <br> If Obama hoped to attack Republicans for reforming Medicare, they are on thin ice. Obama’s own health care legislation slashed $500 billion from Medicare. Ryan’s reforms will not affect anyone over the age of 55. Those near or at retirement will see no change….except the threat of Obama’s budget slash without reforms. How can the Democrats scare older voters when there is no real “threat”? <br> Tax increases then become “spending cuts”. <br> So now when you read an Obama speech you never know if he intends to raise your taxes or actually cut the federal budget when he promises to “reduce spending.” But you have a pretty good idea he intends to eliminate a tax credit or deduction—the largest four being 1.charitable deductions, 2. the deductibility of your home mortgage interest, 3. the deductibility of state and local taxes you pay and 4. the deductibility of your employer-provided health insurance. <br> Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform.

 Wed, 27 May 2009 21:15:14 +0000 </span><em>By Phil KerpenPolicy Director, Americans for Prosperity</strong> <br> --------------- <br> What is the VAT? It's a type of national sales tax that is collected in pieces throughout the production chain, instead of being collected all at once at the cash register like a retail sales tax. In theory, sales taxes like the VAT are pretty good taxes because they are broad-based, difficult to evade, and minimize economic distortions. In practice, they are the ATM machine for runaway government growth, because they are largely invisible to the public and they can raise huge amounts of money in very small chunks, thus minimizing the effective political opposition that generally keeps taxes in check. <br> The U.S. tax system is clearly a mess, and badly in need of meaningful tax reform. That reform, however, needs to in the direction of simplicity and lower rates. Many conservatives believe, with good reason, that we should abolish the IRS, end income taxation, and adopt a national sales tax of some kind--most would prefer a national <strong>retail </em>sales tax, which is the heart of the Fair Tax proposal. Some, perhaps, would be happy with a VAT, which functions much like a sales tax. Such a proposal is not without its virtues, but the enormous risk associated with it is that we end up with a national sales tax on top of our existing income tax system. <br> Trillions of dollars of bailouts, stimulus, spending, unfunded entitlement obligations, and an appetite for a Washington takeover of health care have us on a collision course for a national bankruptcy unless we adopt a huge new tax (cap-and-trade is another one, by-the-way, although the VAT could be even more expensive) or finally start to get a handle on runaway spending. The current tax system simply will not bear enough revenue to pay for these trillions of dollars of obligations. If we don't want to accept a European-style nanny state and the lower standards of living that come with it, we need to cut all this spending and forget about a Washington takeover of health care. And we need to shoot this VAT trial balloon down, quickly.

Instead, they received net payments from the tax system equal to 3.8% of total income taxes. In other words, the bottom 40% paid negative 3.8% of total federal income taxes. <br> These relative tax burdens were actually the result of Reagan Republican supply side economics that began with Reagan and Jack Kemp in the 1970s and 1980s, continued through Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America, and further played out with the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. <em>Reagan and his Republicans in fact had already abolished income taxes on Obama's working people or working class when Obama came into office, and had almost abolished them for the actual middle class. </strong> <br> It was, in fact, Ronald Reagan who first proposed in the 1970s the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) that has done so much to reduce income tax liabilities for lower income people. As president, he cut federal income tax rates across the board for all taxpayers by 25%. He also indexed the tax brackets for all taxpayers to prevent inflation from pushing workers into higher tax brackets. <br> Newt Gingrich's Contract with America adopted a child tax credit of $500 per child that reduced the tax liabilities of lower income people by a higher percentage than for higher income people. President Bush doubled that credit to $1,000 per child, and made it refundable so that low-income people who do not even pay $1,000 in federal income taxes could still get the full credit. Bush also adopted a new lower tax bracket for the lowest income workers of 10%, reducing their federal income tax rate by 33%. He cut the top rate for the highest income workers by just 11.6%, from 39.6% to 35%. <br> What Obama has added to the mix, his tax cut for 95% of Americans, turned out to be a miserable $400 per worker tax credit, less than $8 per week. That tax credit actually will not reduce taxes at all for the bottom 40% of income earners who were already not paying federal income taxes, because you cannot cut taxes for someone who is not paying taxes. <br> Obama also said yesterday that his $400 per worker tax credit will save or create over half a million jobs. But it will actually save or create exactly zero jobs. That is because borrowing $400 from the private sector to give someone else $400 does not add anything to the economy on net. Moreover, the tax credit does nothing to change the incentives that govern the economy. To change the incentives to save, invest, start businesses, expand businesses, create jobs, and produce, you have to reduce tax rates, not send workers $400 checks. That is what Reagan did, and that is why his economic program created a 25 year economic boom.

Anti-inflation monetary policy to restrain money supply growth. <br> The results were spectacular. These four components produced a 25-year economic boom from 1982 to 2007. In their new book, The End of Prosperity, Art Laffer and Steve Moore call the these years the greatest period of wealth creation in the history of the planet. They note that -- adjusted for inflation-- more wealth and income was created during this Reagan boom than in any other prior period in U.S. history. That's right, than any other entire period dating from President George Washington all the way up to Ronald Reagan. <br> --He is still promising tax rate increases, at least by letting the Bush tax cuts expire. <br> --He is promising massive increases in regulatory burdens, including global warming cap and trade regulation that would cost the economy another trillion dollars a year. <br> Even the Obama tax cuts do not follow the Reagan economic recovery plan because they are not reductions in tax <em>rates</strong>, which is what drives the incentives that govern the economy. <br> At AmericanSolutions.com, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has proposed an updated version of the Reagan economic recovery program for today. It includes, among other items, a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to the 12.5% rate that over the past 20 years has lifted the standard of living in Ireland from the bottom of the EU to the top. It would eliminate the capital gains tax to match rates in China, Singapore, and other international competitors -- a move that would entice capital investment from the world over to America. It would provide middle class tax relief by reducing the 25% income tax bracket to 15%, establishing a flat rate tax of 15% for close to 90% of American workers. Gingrich also proposes that a cut in the payroll tax by 50% for 2 years. He also proposes that our government work to control government spending to balance the budget, something Gingrich himself achieved when he was Speaker of the House. Under his plan, the United States would also adopt a real, comprehensive energy program that would allow production of domestic U.S. oil and natural gas, as well as nuclear power, clean coal, ethanol, and renewable fuels.

 <span style=" font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">Last fall Barack Obama campaigned promising change.Many Americans wanted change.

We have, Obama pointed out, a government run post office and privately run UPS and FedEx. Therefore you have choice. Sort of. The federal government taxes UPS and FedEx. The government-run post office does not pay federal or state corporate income taxes or local property taxes. FedEx and UPS do.

Well, president Obama has already given us the answer.The post office, his model for a public health care system, is losing money (Interesting question how a monopoly loses money). What is the post office response to losing money? Becoming more efficient? No. They will ration post office care by closing on Saturdays. Years ago they rationed by ending twice daily delivery of the mail. Now when you get sick, the government may be closed on Saturdays.

 The Deficit Commission is a dud. We always suspected it, now we know it. Co-chairs Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson attempted a grand compromise on solving the deficit, and got nothing for their efforts--nothing, that is, but scorn. <br> Let’s consider some of the elements of the plan: Raising the retirement age? Tell that to a blue collar worker who has been lifting boxes all his life. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction? Tell that to someone whose house is already “under water.” Eliminating the employer deduction for health insurance? Tell that to an employer who is already on the edge of dropping health coverage for employees. <br> In this world, there are two kinds of fiscal compromises. The first kind is the “artful work” compromise, which acknowledges differences and yet still manages to synthesize them into something useful. A classic example is the 1983 compromise on Social Security, in which Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill hammered out a deal on Social Security--a slight rise in payroll taxes in exchange for a slight reduction in future benefits. As a Republican Congressman who worked on the deal, Barber Conable, said at the time, “This was not a work of art, but it was artful work.” <br> Darman convinced Bush that it would be possible to achieve those “tax revenue increases” by various non-tax-increasing means, such as a rate-cut in the capital gains tax. But for their part, the Democrats, smelling Republican blood, would have none of that. Darman’s proffered compromise was thus a “dead cat.” It went nowhere, as Democrats ignored it and Republicans reviled it, knowing that the Bush administration was headed toward tax-increase city. <br> In five months of haggling over exactly what kind of tax increase to enact, Bush lost the battle for any spending cuts, even as the economy began sinking into recession. In the end, the 41st president signed a big tax increase, and lost not only the trust of the American people, but also his political base; in his 1992 re-election campaign, in a three-way race against Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, he suffered a humiliating defeat. <br> So back to Bowles and Simpson. It’s actually a very strange document that they released. Bowles and Simpson are the co-chairs of an 18-member commission, due to put out its final report on December 1. So why did just the two of them release their own rogue version of a final report three weeks early? Who, really, do they think they are? Simpson, a former senator from Wyoming, last won an election in 1990, and Bowles, a former chief of staff to Bill Clinton, ran twice for the US Senate in North Carolina and lost both times. <br> That’s the way things work these days: The president, by the stroke of a pen, can create a commission, hire staff, even put up a spiffy website. <br> In the future, if we want to reduce the deficit, we will have to change the frame of the debate. We will have to widen the discussion from the deficit to the overall economy. We will have to shift from a bean-counting focus on cuts to a larger consideration of what the federal government does and how it goes about doing it. And we will have to shift, also, into a larger consideration of new and better ideas for our future. <br> Or let’s take another issue: health care. Sure, Medicare is eating up the budget, but the elderly are sick. <br> Meanwhile, the regulators and the litigators have neutralized most of the private capital available for Alzheimer’s research, as well as for drug development in general. If we could cure Alzheimer’s, we could raise the retirement age. And, by the way, create a whole new job-creating industry built around that cure. <br> Unfortunately for all of us, those sorts of creative ideas--economic growth, medical cures, and energy development--are not mentioned in the Bowles-Simpson report. Nor did we get any innovative suggestions, for say, restructuring the federal government’s operating model. <br> James P.

 Every so often, we get a reminder about what’s <b>really</i> important. We get nudged as to what we should be thinking about--and worried about. That is, not just what we find interesting, or what we’re getting paid to work on, but what’s vital, not only to ourselves and our family and friends--but to our whole country. Newt Gingrich delivered such a message Tuesday morning. The topic was America’s survival as a free country, and we all should pay attention. <br> But on Wednesday morning, the headlines in the MSM were almost giddy, in the wake of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit” in Washington, D.C: “46 nations join U.S. in nuclear pact,” blared The Washington Post. “Obama Vows Fresh Proliferation Push as Summit Ends,” bannered The New York Times. And The Post added a glowing sidebar story, headlined, “On world stage, Obama at ease as seminar leader.” Indeed, it all sounds great, that all those nations are committing to eliminate loose nuclear material--until one reads the fine print. Even The Post conceded, “The commitments are voluntary… reaching the goal will be difficult.” <br> No, said Gingrich. It’s fine to seek to corral nuclear material wherever possible, to thwart proliferation and keep bombs out of the hands of terrorists, but it’s dangerous to extend treaty-making to unverifiable arms control, to say nothing of arms elimination. That would put America at grave risk. So when Obama and his aides talk about eliminating nuclear weapons altogether, they are practicing “self-delusion,” declared the former Speaker of the House. The Obamans are acting, Gingrich continued, as if they believe that treaties can take the place of strong defense, that words can replace reality. But in fact, the administration is engaged in an “absurd charade,” putting America at risk. As the Georgia Republican reminded us, nearly eight decades ago, in 1933, the world’s diplomats were meeting in Geneva, working on arms control, even as Adolf Hitler was taking power in Germany. It was a “fantasy,” Gingrich declared, that someone such as Hitler would abide by any sort of arms control treaty. <br> As Gingrich reminded us, the most pie-in-the-sky of all the treaties of that era was signed in 1928, when the leading powers of the world came together to ink the Kellogg-Briand http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg–Brian_dPact treaty, which outlawed war. Yup, the world came together to sign a treaty declaring that war was a no-no. The US and 54 other countries were signatories; the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty 85:1. And yet, strangely enough, war was not ended. Indeed, the Kellogg-Briand treaty has never been repealed; Uncle Sam, along with just about every other country in the world, has simply ignored the treaty in innumerable conflicts since. The point here is not to mock good intentions, but rather to remind all of us that common sense matters more than lofty sentiments. If Hitler is on the loose, other countries need military defense, not scraps of paper. <br> And yet the Germans, the Soviets, the Japanese, and all the other aggressor nations had perfectly happy to come to meetings and sign treaties ofr peace and arms control, including the Kellogg-Briand pact, illegalizing war. <br> As Gingrich also reminded us, even more dangerous countries, such as North Korea and Iran--rogue states that even the Obamans don’t think we can trust--were not a part of the negotiations. And neither, of course, was Al Qaeda. So even in the best possible scenario, if every country at the Nuclear Security Summit decided to follow the Golden Rule, the worst nations, and the worst terrorists, would be all the more tempted to acquire nukes, because then the pariahs would become the great powers. <br> Just last week, Obama signed a different deal, in Prague, agreeing with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev to limit the two countries’ nuclear weapons. That’s nice in theory, but does anybody seriously think that the Russians will abide by the terms of any nuclear deal? Indeed, even as Obama was smiling it up with Medvedev, pro-Russian forces were overthrowing a pro-American government in Kyrgyzstan. What-stan? Kyrgyzstan is a former piece of the Soviet empire in Central Asia, which means that it is strategically located near not only Russia, but also China, India, and Iran. Moreover, America has a military base there, used to supply our troops in Afghanistan. Yet now there’s a good chance that the Russians, having reasserted much of their old Soviet power in Kyrgyzstan, will seek to expel the U.S., just as they did a few years ago in nearby Uzbekistan. A different American president might have thought that Kyrgyzstan was important, and suggested that, at minimum, things would not be right between the U.S. and Russia until the situation was resolved. <br> Yes, it’s a dangerous world, full of evil dictators and clever terrorists, as well as countries that just don’t like us. Unfortunately, as Gingrich observed, citing the history of poor American predictions about nuclear programs in Pakistan and India, the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies “are as likely to be wrong as they are likely to be right.” So a prudent president must look to common sense, guided by historical perspective, even more than to briefing books and rosy scenarios. Because while it’s bad that other nations are trying to trick us, it’s far worse when we trick ourselves. <br> So it’s not just America’s fate that is at stake. If the current president seems to prefer pleasant illusion over stark reality, we are all at risk, everywhere. That’s a prospect worth paying attention to, even at the price of a little upset. Better worry now than mourn later. <br> James P. Pinkerton is a Fox News contributor and the founder/editor of the Serious Medicine Strategy blog. 
 At Sunday night’s Oscars, True Grit shot blanks in all 10 of its nomination categories. Although Hollywood understandably shunned this morally-certain tale of a willful young woman demanding justice, we can still hope House Republicans will take some cues from the film before its DVD slots at Wal-Mart need re-stocking. <br> It’s an apt metaphor for the Tea Party movement and House Speaker John Boehner’s Republicans: Outraged by the near-criminal negligence of over-spending pols charging 40 cents per dollar of Washington’s spending to the U.S. credit card – and onto the backs of future generations – Tea Partiers and the U.S. electorate “hired” a House GOP majority last November to hunt down and hang the economy-killing excesses of Presidents Obama, Bush and a bipartisan gang of thieves on Capitol Hill.<br />Early in True Grit, it’s uncertain whether drunken, one-eyed Rooster Cogburn (played perfectly by Jeff Bridges in the 2010 version and by John Wayne, 1969’s Best Actor, a generation ago) actually does have the grit to get the job done. Similarly, House GOP leaders have been approaching the monumental issue of the debt ceiling as if one-eyed drunks, dozing through the greatest opportunity to cut Washington down to size and do right by the American people since the west was won.<br />Nearly all of the 87 freshmen who made Boehner Speaker campaigned against raising the limit on the USA’s public debt, capped for now at a staggering $14.3 trillion. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner calculates that our national credit card will max-out near June. Yet Boehner has already muffed his lines, blurting intent to boost the borrowing limit on Obama’s Mastercard.<br />The Speaker and his budget chief Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could take a lesson in negotiations from Mattie Ross. Certain of herself and of right and wrong, Mattie shows canny (and literal) horse-trading instincts at the film’s start -- instincts which, so far, seem to elude Boehner. We are eyewitnesses to the troubling fact that Geithner has beguiled some leaders with the patently false notion that House resolve against further borrowing equals default to U.S. bondholders. This, in turn, argues to Boehner that it would be reckless not to raise the ceiling ahead of max-out.<br />Yet, as Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) and Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) contend via clarifying legislation, non-borrowed tax revenues are more than ample to cover debt service – just not enough to pay for every nice, silly or evil thing to which Washington has become accustomed. Reps. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), Ron Paul (R-Texas), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Mike Pence (R-Ind.), plus Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) and Rand Paul (R-Tenn.), are talking tough against higher debt. Buy, like the bear-clad, corpse-toting medicine man who offers dubious aid in the film, Beltway RINO’s and erstwhile conservatives alike are selling the snake oil that higher federal borrowing – GOP surrender on the debt limit – is good political science. It’s not.<br />The House tourniquet tied to Obama’s “checkbook authority” which expires on March 4 – or a couple weeks later by extension – isn’t nearly tight enough to staunch the USA’s bleeding deficit, salved by new debt of about $125 billion per month; concurrence required from bandage-loosening Senate Democrats and Obama ensures the government will keep hemorrhaging red ink. The March theatrics – perhaps involving a government shutdown akin to the 1995-96 duel between President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich (in which tenderfoot Gingrich blinked) – are merely the B-movie warm-up in a double feature; Tea Party America neither fears nor craves a brief, meaningless closure of the Washington Monument due to a gap in the administration’s spending authority.<br />Instead, the epic, blockbuster feature presentation in the nation’s political theater should be all about House GOP shutdown of the president’s credit card – the outlaw means by which official Washington has confessed to robbing unborn generations of Americans: In 2006, an audacious newcomer told his Senate colleagues that “raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure…. Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.” Playing the centrist, of course, he became president in 2008.<br />Can Obama’s House rival perform as well in the role of crisis leader? Can emotive John Boehner – who summons tears with the ease of an Oscar winner – fill the gritty boots of John Wayne and Jeff Bridges in a hard-charging Rooster Cogburn reprise on the Mall? The film climaxes with courageous Cogburn, reins in his teeth and two blazing six-shooters in hand, riding furiously headlong into four well-armed robbers on horseback; brave young Mattie, meanwhile, faces her father’s killer. In the states, meanwhile, confrontational “Cogburn governors” like Scott Walker (R-Wis.) and Chris Christie (R-N.J.) are showing Boehner the way.<br />The House packs heat far more powerful, however, than a couple of Colt pistols – something closer, in fact, to the Death Star of the space western Star Wars: Strategic inaction on the debt ceiling, plus bold messaging with the certitude of a Mattie Ross, represents a GOP WMD (weapon of mass discipline) that can incinerate every obstacle to the bipartisan reforms so desperately needed in our dysfunctional U.S. government. Wielding this awesome weapon without cooperation from the Senate or the president, House Republicans can rescue the American Republic from Washington’s outlaws – and they can do so in about the same time it takes a film like True Grit to get from theater to DVD. Here’s how:<br />Pursuant to a national summit gathering over the weekend in Phoenix, today throngs of Tea Party Patriots, the largest umbrella for local tea party groups nationwide, are imploring all House Members to absolutely, positively refuse to vote for -- nor even seriously discuss -- allowing the U.S. debt to grow beyond the current $14.3 trillion cap prior to enactment of: <br> 2) bipartisan tax reform (revenue-negative or neutral) to make the U.S. tax code flatter, simpler, less intrusive and more conducive to economic growth; and <br> The president’s deficit commission and pundits left and right recognize that entitlements will devour us all without a fix. Most grasp that our byzantine tax code drives health care inflation, distorts efficient resource allocation, and impairs economic growth. Few Americans, moreover, favor borrowing 40 cents on the dollar for mortgage bailouts, TARP, SBA, NASA, NPR, CPB, NEA, EPA regulation of CO2 (human exhale, livestock flatulence), Americorps, Fannie, Freddie, HUD, Commerce, Energy, Education (which Reagan pledged to abolish), tobacco and ethanol and mohair subsidies, Planned Parenthood, corporate welfare windmills from GE, UNRWA subsidies (for jihad and anti-semitism in the West Bank), pork projects and other forms of credit-financed intergenerational looting.<br />Mattie Ross says at the film’s start, “You must pay for everything in this world in one way or another, except for the grace of God.” Strategic inaction on the debt ceiling by the House faithful will exact a price from Washington as it downsizes – and it’s the closest they will ever get to taming outlaws or miming the Founding Fathers. The people’s House has a once-in-a-century opportunity to bring conservative principles to Washington which could make the recently-feted Reagan Revolution pale by comparison.<br />Many differences exist now from the eras of Reagan (a grittier leader than leading actor) and that of the Clinton vs. Gingrich showdown: Fox News, conservative talk radio, and the right-wing blogosphere were smaller or non-existent. The debt at the end of Clinton’s presidency was under $6 trillion; it was below $3 trillion at the end of Reagan’s. During the Bush-Obama years, on the other hand, it has soared past $14 trillion – not counting unfunded liabilities for entitlements, including ObamaCare. Yet, while ObamaCare foes have bet their chips on constitutional challenges and de-funding strategies, the House GOP has yet to unholster its biggest weapon for outright repeal: Hiding Obama’s credit card.<br />The people are ready: A February 9 poll by Investor’s Business Daily shows that 70 percent of Americans (86 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Democrats) oppose any hike in the U.S. debt limit. Among the Tea Party Patriots, it’s 94 percent. If the House hides the administration’s plastic right now, the president and his allies will demagogue like movie villains, yet Obama will have no responsible choice but to pay U.S. bondholders, Social Security recipients, soldiers and veterans timely after max-out. He’ll juggle cash by laying-off U.S. employees (welcome to the recession!) and by curtailing federal payouts not core to security.<br />Sunday’s top Oscar plaudits went to a film about a stammering leader who eventually found his voice. Similarly, Boehner and his House GOP must soon say, “Mr. President, don’t default on U.S. interest payments, scare the elderly or harm those in uniform, but use your best judgment on other cash priorities until you’re ready to join us in a grand, bipartisan deal to cut discretionaries, fix entitlements and the tax code, and send the states a balanced budget amendment.”<br />If Boehner chomps down now on the reins and gallops straight at the president and his gang, the House GOP’s big gun of strategic inaction on the debt cap can cut D.C. down to size. With sheer guts, Boehner’s Republicans can saddle Obama with that which, by means of his deficit-ridden, DOA 2012 budget, he has tried to shirk onto Congress: The burden of tough choices and bipartisan leadership. White House budget spokesman Kenneth Baer told The Wall Street Journal Tuesday that every federal agency and department has a contingency plan for the event of a spending cut-off; it’s high time to implement them as the USA goes cold turkey on its addiction to borrowing. If House yellow-bellies turn tail to raise the debt ceiling, on the other hand, local Tea Party posses will surely hunt them down in 2012.<br />Spoiler alert: Brave Mattie and Rooster defeat their enemies and – albeit badly wounded – survive their wild ride. Boehner and his House GOP -- in power now because of the Tea Party -- can more than survive 2012 if they declare, right now, that they’ll hang tough on the debt limit -- rather than hang later in primaries. If House Republicans simply play their part, they’ll shine like heroes in the roles of a lifetime. The red carpet will be bloody, but Tea Party fans across the continent will rise in applause. We, and most Americans, are looking for some true grit.<br />Jenny Beth Martin and Mark Meckler are co-founders of the Tea Party Patriots, the largest umbrella entity for local tea party groups.

 Rick Wartzman, director of the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University, is author of “The End of Loyalty: The Rise and Fall of Good Jobs in America.” William Lazonick is an economics professor at UMass Lowell and president of the Academic-Industry Research Network. <br> Egged on by the White House, corporate America has spent the past few weeks touting how it is sharing its big Trump tax cut with employees in the form of bonuses and pay increases — an apparent validation of the trickle-down approach to economics espoused by the president and his Republican allies. <br> But when we look at the numbers, we see the opposite: The nation’s workers are getting woefully little, at least relatively speaking. Peeking beyond the PR, our analysis finds that major corporations are planning to spend more than 30 times what they are putting in the wallets of employees on buying back their own stock — a practice solely meant to lift the fortunes of shareholders. <br> Not that we’re surprised. Favoring stockholders over workers continues a decades-long trend that has contributed to wage stagnation, exacerbated income inequality and slowed economic growth across the country. <br> To get a sense of how the pie is being divided, we collaborated with Emre Gome c of the Academic-Industry Research Network to tally the sums of commitments from the 44 companies in the SP 500 stock index that, according to Americans for Tax Reform, are giving their employees a bonus or a raise because of the new law. When you add it all up, you get about $5.2 billion — $3.7 billion in one-time bonuses and an estimated $1.5 billion in annual wage increases. <br> But that total pales in comparison with the $157.6 billion in stock buybacks announced by 34 SP 500 companies since early December, when the tax bill passed the Senate. Companies typically purchase their own shares in a bid to bump up the price — a move that tends to please Wall Street and swells the compensation of chief executives, who are paid largely in stock. <br> Admittedly, our calculations aren’t perfect. Not every company has spelled out how many employees will see wages rise or by exactly how much. In such cases, we’ve assumed that the increase is at the most generous end of the spectrum and will affect the most employees. In other words, if we’ve erred, we’ve erred on the side of inflating the amount being given to workers. <br> To be clear, most of the companies that have said they’ll be distributing some of their tax savings to their employees have not also announced a new stock buyback. But a few have. For example, Bank of America will provide a $1,000 bonus to its 145,000 employees “in the spirit of shared success.” That will cost the company $145 million. In December, the bank also added $5 billion to its buyback plans, bringing its projected total to $17 billion by June 2018. <br> It is only fair to acknowledge that we haven’t counted other gains to employees and communities that some companies have reportedly pledged because of the tax law, including additional contributions to 401(k) plans and philanthropic donations. Apple said last month that it would have a $350 billion impact on the U.S. economy over the next five years as it creates 20,000 jobs, builds a corporate campus and makes other investments — though it appears that much of this activity would have happened without the new tax law. <br> Still, even if you take all this into account, there’s no way you’d match what is being channeled to stockholders. Not even close. <br> It wasn’t always like this. Forty years ago, big companies usually paid out about half their profits to stockholders. The other half was reinvested in research and development, worker training, higher employee compensation and so on. Figures compiled by researchers at the Academic-Industry Research Network show, however, that 94 percent of profits over the past decade have gone to benefit shareholders directly through buybacks and dividends. <br> What changed? Beginning in the mid-1970s, a movement to “maximize shareholder value” above all other considerations gained currency. And in 1982, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that allows executives to massively buy back the company’s stock without fear of being charged with manipulating the share price — even though that is precisely what they are doing. <br> Soon, top corporate executives were being paid more and more in stock — making it in their personal interest to drive their company’s share price upward in the short term. In this environment, corporations have come to view workers as an avoidable expense, not as an asset to invest in. <br> Some will argue that almost everyone benefits when stock prices climb. This is false. Research shows that the top 10 percent of wealthy U.S. households control 84 percent of the value of all shares. <br> Don’t get us wrong. We applaud those companies that are making sure their employees get a piece of the Trump pie. But context is crucial. In the scheme of things, the American worker is still being handed crumbs. <br> Read more: <br> Jennifer Rubin: The phony bonus ploy <br> Helaine Olen: Don’t get spun by Trump’s boasts about ‘big bonuses’ and the ‘tax cut bill’ <br> Ed Rogers: Democrats are coming unhinged over the Trump economy <br> Helaine Olen: Don’t get snowed by Trump’s tax-plan victory dance <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The Jan. 26 Metro article “Md. proposal would permit deductions on state returns” brought attention to the plight of Maryland taxpayers. But the article understated the disarray. The article was mainly about upper-middle-class families that may no longer be able itemize deductions in Maryland. This mainly affects wealthy families. But more important is that Congress scrubbed the federal tax code of personal exemptions, worth about $4,000 per person. Congress offset this by raising the federal standard deduction and by decreasing federal tax rates. <br> In eliminating exemptions, Congress stranded the Maryland personal exemption, recently worth $3,200 per person. The impact is mainly to middle-income families because Maryland law already excludes exemptions for incomes of more than $200,000. A loss of the exemption will hit hardest on middle-income families, who will see an increase in state and local income taxes of about $500 to $1,500. <br> The legislature has about two months to fix this problem. One fix is House Bill 365, which was just introduced. If the legislature doesn’t fix the problem, it will have pulled off the amazing trick of significantly raising our state and local taxes without passing any new law. <br> The legislative clock is ticking. Time will be up on April 9. <br> Bernard Bloom, Silver Spring 
 American exceptionalism has meant many things over the years, often referring to our spirit and commitment to individual liberty. <br> Today it could refer to our exceptional fiscal recklessness. <br> In its newly released April 2018 Fiscal Monitor, the International Monetary Fund projected that the United States is the only — yes, only — advanced economy in the world expected to have its debt burden get worse over the next five years. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> The Dec. 10 front-page article “Trump’s tax vow taking a U-turn” quoted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as saying, “When you’re cutting taxes across the board, it’s very hard not to give tax cuts to the wealthy with tax cuts to the middle class.” This is true under either one or both of two conditions: you are seeking to benefit lobbyists and campaign contributors or you are a political and economics ignoramus. <br> Dividends are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income: 20 percent vs. 39.6 percent for the wealthy. Simply make dividends taxable at the same rate as other income. Because the returns of individuals in the top 10 percent of adjustable gross income receive upward of 70 percent of all dividends, this adjustment alone would do the job nicely. And, because these top 10 percent of taxpayers can avoid the tax altogether by investing in corporations that retain their earnings, induce corporations to distribute their earnings as dividends. <br> But how do we reduce the tax burden on corporations? The Republican caucus should consider eliminating the corporate income tax for those corporations distributing all of their net income as dividends as a massive tax cut for every American served by these corporations: customers, owners, employees and communities. Come on, Mr. Mnuchin: It’s not as hard as you think. <br> Bruce Herbert, McLean <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 When will the media cease praising House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s (R-Wis.) great accomplishment of “tax reform” without acknowledging that two critical parts of his plan — the border adjustment tax and, more important, revenue neutrality — were shamelessly sacrificed on the altar of President Trump? <br> Kevin McCormally, Washington <br> </strong> <br> Regarding the April 12 editorial “Mr. Ryan surrenders”: <br> When the going gets tough, the chickens fly the coop. When the nation needs a powerful voice of truth to speak to abuse of power, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has chosen to remain silent and not seek reelection. Thanks to Mr. Ryan for bailing when his nation needed him most. <br> Bill Marriott, Springfield <br> Regarding Karen Tumulty’s April 12 Thursday Opinion essay, “The fall of the House of Ryan”: <br> I’ve never had anything but contempt for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), a shallow acolyte of Ayn Rand, which I assume him still to be. Rather than “wonky conservatism,” I would call his views “mindless reaction” with no relation to true conservatism at all. <br> Ironically, if his welcome resignation plays a significant role in the probable rout of the Republicans this November (although I doubt it will add much), that will have been the most positive contribution of a career otherwise fundamentally detrimental to the public interest. <br> Ron Thompson, Fairfax 
 Martin Neil Baily, Jason Furman, Alan B. Krueger, Laura D’Andrea Tyson and Janet L. Yellen are all former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. <br> The U.S. unemployment rate is down to 4.1 percent, and economic growth could well increase in 2018. Consumer and business confidence is high. What could go wrong? <br> A group of distinguished economists from the Hoover Institution, a public-policy think tank at Stanford University, identifies a serious problem. The federal budget deficit is on track to exceed $1 trillion next year and get worse over time. Eventually, ever-rising debt and deficits will cause interest rates to rise, and the portion of tax revenue needed to service the growing debt will take an increasing toll on the ability of government to provide for its citizens and to respond to recessions and emergencies. <br> None of that is in dispute. But the Hoover economists then go wrong by arguing that entitlements are the sole cause of the problem, while the budget-busting tax bill that was passed last year is described as a “good first step.” <br> Entitlement programs support older Americans and those with low incomes or disabilities. Program costs are growing largely because of the aging of the population. This demographic problem is faced by almost all advanced economies and cannot be solved by a vague call to cut “entitlements” — terminology that dehumanizes the value of these programs to millions of Americans. <br> The deficit, of course, reflects the gap between spending and revenue. It is dishonest to single out entitlements for blame. The federal budget was in surplus from 1998 through 2001, but large tax cuts and unfunded wars have been huge contributors to our current deficit problem. The primary reason the deficit in coming years will now be higher than had been expected is the reduction in tax revenue from last year’s tax cuts, not an increase in spending. This year, revenue is expected to fall below 17 percent of gross domestic product — the lowest it has been in the past 50 years with the exception of the aftermath of the past two recessions. <br> All of us have supported corporate tax reform. The statutory tax rate was too high, much higher than in other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economies. However, because of deductions and breaks in the tax code, the effective marginal tax rate was similar to the average among competitor economies. The right way to do reform was to follow the model of the bipartisan tax reform of 1986, when rates were lowered while deductions were eliminated. <br> Instead, the tax cuts passed last year actually added an amount to America’s long-run fiscal challenge that is roughly the same size as the preexisting shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare. The tax cuts are reducing revenue by an average of 1.1 percent of GDP over the next four years. The Hoover authors minimized the cost of the tax cuts by noting that if major provisions are allowed to expire on schedule — certainly an open question, given political realities — they would amount to “only” 0.4 percent of GDP. Even this magnitude exceeds the Medicare Trustees’ projections of a 0.3 percent of GDP shortfall in Medicare hospital insurance over the next 75 years. <br> Just as entitlements are not the primary cause of the recent jump in the deficit, they also should not be the sole solution. It is important to use the right wording: The main entitlement programs are Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and Medicaid. These widely popular programs are indeed large and projected to grow as a share of the economy, not because of increased generosity of benefits but because of the aging of the population and the increase in economywide health costs. <br> There is some room for additional spending reductions in these programs, but not to an extent large enough to solve the long-run debt problem. The Social Security program needs only modest reforms to restore its 75-year solvency, and these should include adjustments in both spending and revenue. Additional revenue is critical because Social Security has become even more vital as fewer and fewer people have defined-benefit pensions. Medicare has been a leader in bending the health-care cost curve. Reforms to payments and reformed benefit structures in Medicare could do more to hold down its future costs. <br> As we focus on the long-run fiscal situation, our goal should be to put the debt on a declining path as a share of the economy. That will require running smaller deficits in strong economic periods — such as the present — to offset the larger deficits that are needed in recessions to restore demand and avoid deeper crises. Last year’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act turned that economic logic on its head. The economy was already at or close to full employment and did not need a boost. This year’s bipartisan spending agreement contributed further to the ill-timed stimulus. The Federal Reserve will have to act to make sure the economy does not overheat. <br> Several years ago, there was broad agreement that responding to the looming fiscal challenge required a balanced approach that combined increased revenue with reduced spending. Two bipartisan commissions, Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin, proposed such approaches that called for tax reform to raise revenue as a percent of GDP and judicious spending cuts. Without necessarily agreeing with these specific plans, we believe a balanced approach is the correct one. Start with spending goals based on the priorities of the American people and then set tax policy to realize adequate revenue. The Hoover economists’ advocacy of paying for large tax cuts with entitlement reductions would take the United States in the wrong direction.  <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Robert J.

 There are lots of pressing issues Congress could be focusing on right now. <br> Lawmakers could work on reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which expired Sept. 30 , leaving the 9 million kids who depend on it in limbo. <br> Or maybe they could find a solution for so-called “dreamers,” the undocumented immigrants brought here as children, who will lose their protected status soon unless Congress acts. <br> Or, hey, they could try to prevent the U.S. government from setting off a worldwide financial crisis. That’s something that might happen in less than two weeks, when we hit the debt ceiling. <br> Instead, Republican senators have a different priority: jamming through their plutocratic, sloppy tax overhaul as quickly as possible. By “as quickly as possible,” I mean as soon as this week, which would be a mere month after the first draft of the GOP tax bill was introduced in the House. <br> For comparison, the last time such a major overhaul happened — during the Reagan administration — the process took more than two years . And it included dozens of hearings and consultations with voters, tax practitioners and experts. <br> That’s nothing like the full-steam-ahead approach we’ve seen this time around. <br> Why the haste? <br> Republicans are of course desperate to notch a legislative win before the year ends, especially given their failed promise to repeal Obamacare. <br> But perhaps more important, Republican lawmakers need to pass this terrible bill before voters — and indeed lawmakers themselves — have a chance to learn what's in it. <br> “It’s an ostrich approach to tax policy,” says Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. <br> Republicans don’t want to learn what their own bill will cost, for instance. <br> For years, Republicans promised that their tax cuts would pay for themselves, once you accounted for all the economic growth they’d unleash. They even mandated that Congress’s own nonpartisan internal scorekeepers take into account this “macroeconomic feedback” when evaluating the budgetary effect of major bills such as this one. <br> But now the Senate is racing to vote before those scorekeepers have a chance to evaluate their claim about the bill’s cost (or lack thereof, supposedly). <br> This is surely no accident. Outside groups, including one favorable to the tax overhaul, have already done their own analyses. So far none has found that the bill generates enough growth to pay for itself. <br> There’s also that little inconvenient truth about whom the bill benefits. <br> Republican leaders keep claiming the bill focuses on helping the middle class. But voters are already catching on to the fact that the biggest tax cuts go to the wealthiest. Lately the public has learned that the Senate bill will actually raise taxes for households making less than $75,000 by 2027, relative to current law. Yes you read that right. And it’s true even if you don’t count the bill’s changes to Obamacare. <br> The more time that passes, the angrier these voters will get, and the more pressure they’ll presumably place on elected officials to either change or oppose the legislation. <br> Which is yet another reason to vote on the bill ASAP: Familiarity will breed (even more) contempt. <br> Unfortunately, rushing this bill through means that in addition to all the deliberate goodies and giveaways to the rich, there will be lots of unintended goodies and giveaways. That’s because, given the haste with which this bill was drafted, the plan remains full of glitches. <br> One apparent hiccup in the bill, for example, offers an even bigger giveaway than Republicans had intended to multinational corporations enjoying the repatriation tax holiday. <br> Or consider the so-called “guardrails” intended to prevent workers from self-incorporating and taking advantage of the new preferential rate on pass-through income. Those remain extremely easy to game. <br> Meanwhile, some pass-through businesses will (oops) face marginal tax rates of 70 percent. Under normal circumstances, a tax rate this high would send Republican policymakers running for the hills. <br> There are other foreseeable problems, too. <br> The bill may violate World Trade Organization rules, for example. And the shift to a territorial taxation system would also likely encourage companies to shift more, not less, of their operations abroad. <br> The interaction of some other provisions would encourage taxpayers to make investments that they know would lose money, as New York University School of Law professor Daniel Shaviro has pointed out. <br> Those are just some of the problems that tax experts have identified so far. Surely more will come out in the weeks and months ahead, as clever accountants and tax attorneys identify new ways to take advantage of slapdash legislative language. <br> If Republicans were smart, they’d give themselves sufficient time to properly vet and craft this legislation. Apparently, they’d prefer to keep their heads in the sand. <br> Read more here: <br> E.J.

 Michael Steel served as press secretary for former House speaker John A. Boehner from 2008 to 2015. <br> Any Republican trying to find the bright side in House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s decision to not seek another term calls to mind Kevin Bacon’s plaintive calls of, “remain calm, all is well” at the conclusion of the film “Animal House.” But there are some possible advantages to the GOP going into November without Ryan as their standard-bearer.  <br> When Ryan (R-Wis.) became speaker, no one believed the wonkish family man could match the prodigious fundraising prowess of his predecessor, the deeply tanned golf enthusiast John Boehner. Instead, Ryan surpassed Boehner, raising nearly $90 million in political contributions in 2016 and more than $44 million in 2017 — both records for a House leader. <br> As the former GOP vice presidential nominee, Ryan benefitted from his personal popularity with the party rank-and-file and a national profile, as well as strong ties to the fundraising machine built by former Massachussetts governor Mitt Romney during his two runs for the White House. But that fundraising machine is humming along nicely, and will continue to serve the rest of the House leadership team. As Ryan surpassed Boehner, so, no doubt, will the next GOP leader exceed him. In fact, if there is even a whiff of a contested race to succeed Ryan, I expect the competition to help the GOP team will be a big part of that fight — with positive benefits in terms of fundraising and other campaign efforts for every House GOP candidate.  <br> That is, in large part, because the party’s base and donors continue to fear the consequences of a Democratic takeover of the House. Washington Democrats are promising to roll back the tax reform that was signed into law last year. They want to restore job-killing Obama-era regulations. They are edging closer toward supporting a European-style single-payer health-care system. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) remains a uniquely polarizing figure in our country, and — in a year when anger at Washington insiders and “the swamp” continues to define our public life — no one is more closely identified with the dysfunction of the capital city.  <br> Worse, a Democratic majority in the House would open the floodgates for investigations and inquisitions (fair or not) into the Trump administration. It is hard to see how such a majority could long resist the temptation to vote on articles of impeachment against the president.  <br> While Ryan forged an effective working relationship with President Trump — a partnership that was crucial to enacting the first comprehensive reform of America’s tax laws in 36 years — there always seemed to be a level of discomfort between the sober family man from Janesville, Wis., and the bombastic and braggadocious commander in chief. With Ryan headed for the locker room, the GOP team will be unified in support of Trump going into the midterm elections, a fact that should help improve enthusiasm and turnout in the GOP base.  <br> All things considered, I would prefer if Ryan continued to lead the House Republican team. He has a record of genuine accomplishments, despite presiding over an increasingly fractious GOP conference. He is an effective, admirable and appealing national figure. <br> But our political system does not include a national referendum on who will be speaker of the House. We will have 435 individual elections in individual congressional districts, and the GOP will field experienced, battle-tested and well-funded incumbents and exciting new candidates in as many of them as possible. In each of those districts is where the battle for the House majority will be won or lost. Ryan’s departure is a loss for the GOP, but it does not clearly augur a GOP loss in November. <br> Read more here: <br> Jennifer Rubin: Abandoning the ship before it sinks <br> Richard Cohen: Go, Paul, go <br> Stephen Stromberg: Ryan’s failed speakership <br> Dana Houle: Nancy Pelosi is incredibly underrated <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Bruce D. Brown is executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. <br> Imagine if Congress put a special tax on the advertising revenue of the largest newspapers. Lawmakers denounced them for conducting a “vicious campaign” against their political patron, a populist strongman. “A tax on lying,” they called it. <br> Congress has never passed such a law, but in 1934, Huey Long’s Louisiana did. The Supreme Court struck it down two years later as a violation of the First Amendment in Grosjean v. American Press Co. <br> Today, Grosjean is the starting point for any clash between the taxing power and free speech. And such a collision looks a lot more likely given the new excise tax on select private university endowments written into last year’s tax bill. The provision is much more than a slap at wealthy colleges or a way to help pay for corporate tax cuts, as it has so far been portrayed. <br> The entire nonprofit sector is now on notice that the long-standing bargain between them and the federal government — they can pursue their public-interest missions, free of taxation, as long as they stay out of electioneering — is potentially gone. And this financial threat could not be hovering over nonprofits at a worse time. <br> Nonprofits make up a big part of what we call civil society. This universe extends well beyond college quads to think tanks, advocacy organizations, arts institutions, scientific bodies and a growing number of news organizations, including such influential outlets as ProPublica. <br> With civil society confronting the enormous task of defending democratic norms in the Trump years, the nonprofit world is more important than ever. Although Grosjean involved a tax on newspapers, not universities, the Supreme Court has recognized that academic freedom, like freedom of the press, is a “special concern” of the First Amendment. The tax on college endowments is a dangerous development for all nonprofits. <br> Conservatives have aspired for some time to take a torch to what they perceive as the elitist, left-leaning wall that rings academia. But even in the absence of a censorial motive, a second tax case, also involving the press, provides strong ammunition to challenge the new law. <br> In the early 1970s, Minnesota enacted a special tax on the cost of the paper and ink used to print newspapers. The law exempted the first $100,000, which effectively limited the tax to the state’s dozen or so largest papers. <br> Unlike in Grosjean, no intent to punish viewpoint through taxation was evident. But the U.S. Supreme Court found that two key aspects of the Minnesota tax violated the First Amendment: The state had targeted the press among all industries and tailored the law to affect only certain newspapers. <br> “Recognizing a power in the State not only to single out the press but also to tailor the tax so that it singles out a few members of the press presents such a potential for abuse that no interest . . . can justify the scheme,” wrote Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in Minneapolis Star v. Minnesota Commissioner. <br> With the new 1.4 percent excise tax on endowment earnings, Congress has gone down a similarly dubious path. It set its sights on higher education among all nonprofits. It then focused on a subset of about 30 institutions — only those that enroll at least 500 students and have an endowment of at least $500,000 per student. <br> And then it made good on the “potential for abuse” by carving out a single institution, Berea College of Kentucky, home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), by creating an exemption so the tax would reach only schools that charge tuition; Berea’s students attend free. <br> This kind of pork politics might play in general economic regulation, where we expect the sausage-making to be messy. But when universities are targeted with special taxes, unevenly applied, it’s hard for lawmakers to claim that their actions are entirely unrelated to limiting academic freedom — and thus suppressing the crucial role it plays in our democracy. As O’Connor put it, the threat of taxation “can operate as effectively as a censor to check critical comment.” <br> The backers of the excise tax say that they are simply trying to encourage the richest schools to use more of their endowments to reduce tuition or provide scholarships. But among the singled-out schools are those that hand out the most financial aid, thanks to the endowments now being taxed. And Congress is not exactly taking the new revenue and plowing it back into tuition assistance. Even a fan of the tax, conservative columnist Ross Douthat, admitted that it is “more of a targeted culture-war jab.” <br> Special taxes on universities — or on any part of the noisy nonprofit public square — are highly suspect: The urge for elected officials to use them to squeeze First Amendment-protected activity is just too great. The new excise tax has a long heritage and deserves a short life. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump is bent on destroying one of our winningest exports <br> George F.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> REPUBLICANS PROMISED Americans a smart, careful tax reform that would simplify the code without adding a penny to the debt. The bill that House Republicans released Thursday betrays that promise. It also betrays the nation’s children, and their children, who would eventually have to pay for this big, unpaid-for tax cut that the country does not need. <br> Republicans began their tax reform effort months ago with a plausible argument. They could lower tax rates, particularly on corporations, if they ended tax breaks at the same time, one balancing the other. The result would be a leaner, clearer, more efficient code that raised just as much revenue. <br> The bill that House Republicans released Thursday actually tracks this concept in part. Braving blowback from interest groups, GOP lawmakers proposed limits on tax breaks such as the mortgage-interest deduction and the state and local tax deduction. But the plan has a fatal flaw: It would cut far more by lowering tax rates than it would raise by closing loopholes. It is far out of balance. <br> How far? The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s Maya MacGuineas warned Thursday that the House plan would cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years, and, because of the way it is written, the price could end up being even higher. “No credible model shows that tax cuts will create enough growth to fill the funding gap,” she concluded, echoing the views of most independent experts. <br> If the nation were in the midst of a recession, Republicans would have an argument for a deficit-financed stimulus. But the economy is growing and does not need a short-term boost. In fact, with the economy expanding, this should be the time to reduce the nation’s already alarmingly large debt. That is a principle Republicans passionately embraced — when they were in the minority. <br> The plan’s high price tag is even more egregious in light of the taxes Republicans intend to cut. The proposal would phase out the estate tax at the cost of $172 billion, which would almost exclusively help the wealthy. For $696 billion, it would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which Congress created to ensure that loophole-savvy rich people pay at least some federal tax. The alternative minimum tax compelled President Trump, for example, to pay $31 million more in taxes in 2005 than he otherwise would have, which makes one wonder how he would personally benefit from this unnecessary shift in the tax code. Because he has refused to release his tax returns, unlike every other modern president, we can’t know for sure. But the GOP plan also would slash rates on “pass-through” businesses, costing the treasury $448 billion over 10 years. The Trump Organization is one such business. <br> The plan’s core provision, a $1.5 trillion cut in corporate taxes, slashing the rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, could be defensible — if it were paid for. Alas, it is not. The nation needs tax reform, but it would be better off with no change than with this. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> George F.

 Paul Ryan’s white whale is almost in sight. <br>  On Wednesday, after years of wishin’ and hopin’ and thinkin’ and prayin’ (and lately, nose-holdin’), the Republican House speaker and his party will finally drop the text of their long-sought tax bill. <br> Then, thanks to clever manipulation of Senate rules, the bill will secure swift passage, requiring only a simple majority of senators (meaning Democrats cannot obstruct) and a gold-Sharpied presidential signature for delivery, at long last, to a cheering Republican base. Right? <br> Even with President Trump in Asia (and if Ryan is lucky, too busy to trash his own tax plan), the GOP bill faces enormous challenges. <br> The first of these is voters, including Republican ones. <br> Despite all that trickle-down propaganda, about three-quarters of Americans — and more than half of Republicans — believe that wealthy households and big corporations pay too little in taxes, according to a September Associated Press-NORC poll . Maybe they won’t storm town halls the way they did over threats to Obamacare, but they’re unlikely to be supportive. <br> Especially since the Trump administration has already broken many of its promises, such as not cutting taxes on the rich, or raising them on the middle class. <br> That said, Republicans’ main problem isn’t what the little people think. It’s what the lobbyists want and, more significantly, what complicated budget rules allow. <br> The first obstacle is the cost of their plan. <br> Based on the vague contours we have, the Republicans’ tax plan is expected to cost about $2.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to a preliminary analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Unfortunately for Republicans, their final bill is allowed to cost “only” $1.5 trillion over the next decade, at least to pass with a simple majority vote in the Senate. That’s the maximum deficit increase allowed under the Senate budget resolution approved last week. <br> Fitting a $2.4 trillion peg into a $1.5 trillion hole will be tricky. Proposals to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent and repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax alone cost $2 trillion, according to the Tax Policy Center. Republicans will have to find more offsets, or make the cuts less generous, or both. <br> If anything, however, Republicans seem inclined to increase the cost of their bill, not decrease it. That’s because they’re losing their nerve on the few major revenue raisers they’ve included, such as ending the state and local tax deduction. <br> If they attempt to close other deductions and loopholes, more interest groups and lobbyists will descend on Gucci Gulch and demand that those pet provisions be protected, too. <br> As a result, Republican lawmakers are even more likely than usual to deploy budgetary gimmicks, such as ludicrous-speed economic growth or pretending that a corporate tax break will expire in five years when everyone knows it will be renewed. <br> There’s potentially an even bigger problem for getting this tax cut through. It has to do with a relatively obscure law, called “statutory PAYGO,” that hasn’t gotten much attention. <br> This legislation has been on and off the books (it’s been on since 2010) since 1990. It says that if all of the bills passed by the end of the current calendar year have the net effect of increasing deficits, then automatic, immediate, offsetting cuts to certain non-discretionary spending programs — including (yikes) Medicare — go into effect. <br> Here’s how it would work. <br> If Congress successfully passes a $1.5 trillion tax cut before going home for Christmas, $28 billion would get automatically slashed from Medicare between January and September of next year. And that’s just in Medicare. Other popular programs, such as mandatory spending on student loan administration and farm subsidies, would be wiped out entirely, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. <br> And such cuts would continue for a decade. Not exactly a people-pleaser. <br> The point of this law is (in theory) to stop Congress from doing fiscally irresponsible things. As with most of its hand-tying exercises, Congress can always override this automatic sequester, as they did when passing the Bush tax cuts in 2001. <br> But here’s the key: A bill to override these cuts would require 60 votes. Meaning at least a handful of Democrats would be needed to pave the way for tax cuts after all. <br> Republicans seem to believe they can get the votes by threatening to cast Democrats as killing Medicare. But what’s to stop smart Democrats from pointing out that Republicans put Medicare at risk in the first place? <br> Read more here: <br> Robert J.

 When Republicans brought their budget to the Senate floor last week, they were bracing for what is known on Capitol Hill as a “vote-a-rama,” in which Democrats would keep the Senate in session until the wee hours, forcing Republicans to cast dozens of politically toxic votes on everything from gun control to legalizing the immigration status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients. <br> But the “vote-a-rama” never materialized. Democrats simply stood down. <br> Why? Because they knew that what was toxic for Republicans would be even more toxic for vulnerable Senate Democrats running for reelection in states President Trump won by double digits. Democrats are deeply worried about the fates of Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia (which Trump won by 42 points), Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota (which Trump won by 36), Jon Tester of Montana (20), Claire McCaskill of Missouri (19) and Joe Donnelly of Indiana (19). If Trump can pick off some or all of these seats, then he could finally have what he needs to pass key legislation with GOP votes alone. And the Democrats’ chances of taking control of the Senate two years later in 2020 could slip away. <br> This is good news for Republicans, but especially for Trump’s efforts to pass tax reform. If Democrats are running scared in red states, then Trump can turn the screws on them to vote with him or pay a price in November. <br> For a while, it appeared Trump was actively courting these Democrats. In September, he hosted Heitkamp, Manchin and Donnelly for dinner at the White House to discuss tax reform. That same month, he invited Heitkamp to travel with him on Air Force One to a tax rally in North Dakota, where he declared her a “good woman” and said his supporters are “for you, 100 percent.” A few weeks later, he did it again, this time inviting Donnelly aboard Air Force One for a speech in Indiana unveiling the framework of his tax plan. There he took a sharper edge, warning “If Sen. Donnelly doesn’t approve it . . . we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe,” adding “I think we’ll have numerous Democrats come across because it’s the right thing to do.” All good. <br> But after this initial burst of activity, it looks as if Trump may be giving up. “It’ll be hard getting the Democrats because they are obstructionists and they vote in blocs,” he told the Heritage Foundation last week, “but if we get the Republicans we need, which is virtually every single one of them . . . you will see things happen like have never happened before.” <br> Giving up would be a mistake. With Obamacare, Republicans preemptively announced that they planned to pass the repeal-and-replace bill with only Republican votes. That let red-state Democrats off the hook, and they paid no price for voting against Trump. He should not let them get away with failing to cooperate this time. Instead, he should turn up the heat. His national approval rating is in the high 30s, but in West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, Missouri and Indiana, it ranges from 49 to 60 percent, which means Trump will be a formidable opponent if these senators cross him. He should be a constant presence in their home states for the next two months, rallying voters behind his tax-reform plan and warning that its success or failure depends on how their Democratic senator votes. <br> If he turns up the pressure, he wins, no matter what. If the Democrats capitulate, tax reform will almost certainly pass — giving Trump the major legislative victory that has so far eluded him. If they vote against him in spite of such a campaign, then Trump has teed up the GOP for big gains in the Senate. <br> The only bad option is giving them a free pass again, so Democrats can claim that they would have happily supported the president if he had continued trying to work with them. If Trump fails to put the squeeze on them and does not pass tax reform, the odds of losing the Senate will grow. If Democrats win the Senate, the Trump presidency would effectively be over. No more judges, no more nominees. Democrats would control the Senate’s investigative committees, handing them unbridled subpoena power. And, should they win the House as well, Democrats could have the votes to bring impeachment proceedings against Trump if they so choose. <br> In other words, the way forward for Trump is clear: Make Democrats vote for tax reform or pay a political price. Don’t let them off the hook. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 Miraculous Mr. Shakespeare is at his subtle best, methinks, when he has Polonius, the old blowhard, pour out the sum of his wisdom to Laertes, his departing son, in “Hamlet.” The speech captures one of the essential facts of a father’s life: that the distillate of one’s life experiences makes rather weak tea when we try to put it into words. We can picture the son’s eyes darting impatiently toward his waiting ship as his father prattles on about friendship, money management, proper attire and so on, until he finally finishes, 26 lines later, with the famous flourish: “To thine own self be true / And it must follow, as the night the day, / Thou canst not then be false to any man.” <br> T.S. Eliot, writing at roughly the age of young Laertes, described this urgent yet somehow vapid dad as “full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse.” Twenty years into fatherhood, I find Polonius to be a very relatable character. <br> Which brings me to another well-known line of Polonian advice: “Neither a borrower nor a lender be.” It is a maxim I try to live by — even though I know it’s fundamentally very wrong. Polonius offers a simple rule for a very complicated subject. Debt, the ruin of millions and cause of great misery, is also the engine of growth, prosperity and progress. <br> America wouldn’t be a nation of homeowners were it not for mortgage lenders. We wouldn’t be a land of highways, airports and indoor plumbing were it not for government bonds. We wouldn’t be an engine of small business innovation were it not for fractional-reserve banking, nor would our colleges and universities be the envy of the world were it not for student loans. <br> But give the old man his due: America doesn’t need any encouragement to borrow. If anything, we have become too much in love with debt. Consider a few data points. <br> The Congressional Budget Office updated its 10-year forecast this week. Despite a sunny outlook for economic growth, the nonpartisan analysts predicted the swift return of trillion-dollar annual deficits. These relentless waves of red ink will push total federal indebtedness to nearly 100 percent of our gross domestic product by 2028 — the highest level since World War II. <br> If anything, the CBO forecast paints a rosy picture because even lip service in support of fiscal discipline has disappeared across the political spectrum. With the self-proclaimed “king of debt” 
 The March 28 op-ed “The debt crisis is at our doorstep” may have been correct that the recently enacted corporate tax reform was helpful, but the changes to the tax rates for individuals were woefully misguided and add to the debt without any compensatory benefit. <br> Reducing the rate for top earners was exactly the wrong thing to do if we’re concerned about the national debt. As for the need to reform entitlement programs, the obvious first step is to raise or eliminate the cap on Social Security taxes. The cap is essentially yet another tax break for people who don’t need one. A second step could be to make the Social Security tax rate graduated, again because top earners can afford to contribute more toward keeping the program solvent. <br> David Meyers, Amesbury, Mass. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> DEMOCRACY IS necessary because the status quo is not perfect and the people must have a voice in changing it. But the status quo isn’t all bad, either, which is why, in a democracy, conservatism is necessary. The United States needs a decent, pragmatic, conservative party that emphasizes what traditions and institutions are worth preserving amid change. <br> The lesson of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s (R-Wis.) retirement announcement Wednesday, after less than three years in the position and at the relatively young age of 48, is that no such party exists. Today’s Republican Party is in thrall to President Trump and the 40 percent of the electorate that supports him — and for whose favor candidates in Republican primaries are now competing. That is to say, Republicans are decreasingly conservative and increasingly reactionary. <br> Slow to take the Trump phenomenon seriously, and then unwilling or unable to confront it effectively, Mr. Ryan now exits, a diminished figure. <br> At the best moments of his almost two decades in Congress, Mr. Ryan did stand for a decent conservatism, as he saw it. Like his mentor, Jack Kemp, Mr. Ryan spoke of making capitalism not only grow the economy but also work for the poor, and he mastered the details of policy. He favored robust immigration and free trade. He was upbeat and civil; during the 2016 presidential campaign, he sometimes pushed back against Mr. Trump’s demagoguery: “Instead of playing to your anxieties, we can appeal to your aspirations. Instead of playing the identity politics of ‘our base’ and ‘their base,’ we unite people around ideas and principles,” he said in a March 2016 speech on Capitol Hill. <br> At his worst — that is, over the past 18 months — Mr. Ryan proved unwilling to take risks for his proclaimed values. Even those lofty 2016 remarks left out the guilty party’s name: “Donald Trump.” That tactical omission, not later comments in which, say, Mr. Ryan called out the GOP candidate as a racist for impugning a judge’s fairness based on the judge’s Mexican heritage, proved indicative of how Mr. Ryan would act when a Trump presidency, with all its lies, instability and divisiveness, occurred. Since January 2017, he has mostly enabled the president — most disgracefully by allowing Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to turn the House Intelligence Committee’s review of Russian interference in the 2016 election into a partisan farce. <br> Mr. Ryan, like other top Republicans, thought he could somehow bend Mr. Trump to his policy purposes. It was a deal with the devil, and he considered it to have paid off when Congress passed a tax-reform law that did make the code somewhat more growth-friendly — while showering benefits on upper-income Americans and reducing federal revenue to unsustainably low levels. <br> Questionable as policy, the tax bill victory may prove Pyrrhic politically. Democrats are energized and seemingly on track to retake the House in November. Even if Republicans do hold the chamber, it will not be as the party of growth and opportunity but the party of tariffs and the Wall. <br> Some say Mr. Ryan is abandoning ship, but the real story is that the ship had already abandoned him. <br> Read more: <br> Stephen Stromberg: Paul Ryan’s failed speakership <br> Richard Cohen: Go, Paul, go <br> Paul Waldman: A scam of a party says goodbye to its top fraud <br> Jennifer Rubin: Paul Ryan is abandoning the ship before it sinks <br> Megan McArdle: Without Paul Ryan in Congress, will things get better or worse? <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Looks like another week of debacles for the nation’s amateur president and the GOP leaders whose bus he hijacked last year. <br> Bid No. 3 to repeal and replace Obamacare has gone gurgling down the Senate drain. Alabama Republicans are headed to the polls apparently intent on choosing a notorious scofflaw over President Trump’s preferred candidate for a U.S. Senate seat. Trump’s incendiary attack on the free-speech rights of professional athletes has Americans in an uproar, while his reckless tweets about North Korea might be speeding us toward war. And in a pointless bit of cruelty, the bankruptcy-prone businessman delivered a scolding to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico — where entire towns are running out of food and water and the power may be out until 2018 — concerning the importance of repaying its debts. <br> Yet the stock market sails on. <br> The animal spirits of Wall Street are gliding through the craziness as blithe as Percy Shelley’s skylark. And the wind beneath the market’s wings is simply this: the promise of tax reform. Investors believe that America’s comparatively high corporate tax rate is a drag on economic growth, and they trust Congress and the president to deliver an invigorating cut. <br> But time is running out. At a recent meeting at the White House, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) lived up to his name by telling Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that tough decisions must be made right away. Details of a tax bill are naturally contentious, and they can only afford so many battles. “You need to quickly choose which of these fights you can win within 75 days,” he counseled. <br> Blunt is worth heeding on nuts-and-bolts matters such as this, because he is among the best vote counters ever to ride into Washington. The former history teacher served as majority whip in the House before his election to the Senate in 2010. Now, as vice chairman of the Republican conference, he continues to be a sensitive barometer of the ever-shifting political climate on Capitol Hill. <br> As he told the president, Blunt believes tax reform is a must-do before the December break. Failure to get it done by then would send the GOP into an election year with little to show for the luxury of one-party rule. To meet that rapidly dwindling timetable, the tax bill can’t be all things to all people. <br> Blunt’s own idea of a doable deal homes in on two targeted cuts. The first would land in the pockets of working people, while the other would deliver the GOP’s long-promised corporate relief. “Not everyone in my party understands this, but working people pay a lot of taxes even if they’re not paying income tax,” Blunt told me. A refundable credit for working-class parents could give millions of people the first real boost to their wallets in years, he said. <br> “If you’ve been in a stagnant income situation for the past 10 years, to suddenly have an additional $800 or $1,000 is meaningful. It might not sound like much money in Washington, but for a lot of people it can be a chance to do something fun as a family for a change, or maybe to eat out once a month at Applebee’s.” <br> Perhaps a working-class tax cut would help win popular support for a bill that also delivers for corporations. But that is hardly certain. A recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll found only 16 percent in support of lower corporate rates. Of course, that number might rise if more people understood that the sky-high stock market is counting on that cut, and that a disappointed market could derail the economy at just the moment when wage growth may be flickering back to life. <br> Before the Republicans can think about selling a tax bill to the voters, they need to settle on one among themselves. And so far, that isn’t happening. Quite the opposite: Lawmakers are squabbling like grade-school siblings sharing a back seat. Some senators, obsessed with the white whale of health care, want to tie their doomed quest to the hunt for a tax deal. Others are determined to reduce the top rate for high earners. Still others in the GOP caucus demand spending cuts to offset each tax cut, and everyone knows how difficult it is to cut spending. <br> In an ideal world, such important policies would not be decided on a party-line vote. But these are parlous times for bipartisanship. Democrats have shown by their solid stand on health care that they won’t do for Republicans what the GOP can’t do for itself. At best, a few endangered Senate Democrats might vote for a tax bill — but only after they see that Republicans have the votes for passage without them. <br> “Winning here is pretty important,” Blunt summed up, “for the party and for the economy.” And how, Mr. President, does tweeting about football players help achieve that victory? <br> Read more from David Von Drehle’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: So much for the party of fiscal responsibility <br> Jennifer Rubin: Trump’s promises on taxes are never to be believed <br> Michael Gerson: GOP leaders made a huge wager — and they’re losing <br> Jennifer Rubin: Three GOP Trumpcare errors will doom tax reform <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Should the government guarantee everyone a job at a living wage? The idea is gaining momentum among progressives. By 2020, it may join Medicare for All, debt-free college, a $15 minimum wage, antitrust revival and Social Security expansion as part of a bold reform agenda that Democratic presidential aspirants will have to embrace or debate. <br> A Good Jobs Guarantee would be a federally funded, locally administered program. Municipalities and towns, linked with nonprofits, would create community job banks that would organize real jobs with good pay and benefits. By addressing needs largely ignored by private markets, the program would avoid competition with private business. By paying a living wage — most plans call for a minimum of $11 to $15 an hour with benefits — the jobs guarantee would lift the floor under workers, insuring that no one works full-time and remains in poverty. <br> Calls for a job guarantee have deep roots in the Democratic Party. In 1944, coming out of the Great Depression and still entrenched in World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for an Economic Bill of Rights , with the right to a job and living wage the first two principles. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. picked up that charge, understanding that economic justice was an essential challenge of the civil rights movement. After King’s assassination, his widow, Coretta Scott King helped build the public pressure that culminated in 1978 with the passage of the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, a bill that was diluted in its final passage to make full employment a goal rather than a guarantee. <br> The guarantee is needed today because this economy doesn’t work for working people. Wages of the middle 60 percent of workers have essentially stagnated through this century. The Economic Policy Institute reported that more than one in four workers labors at poverty-level wages. What is worse, entrenched discrimination condemns African Americans to nearly twice the unemployment levels as whites. <br> Wage stagnation and unemployment have worsened spreading epidemics of despair — opioid and other drug addiction, spousal and child abuse, physical and mental illness, suicide, divorce — that have produced a decline in American life expectancy. Trump may boast about top-line unemployment being near record lows, but nothing in his agenda will redress this harsh reality. <br> A central cause is that the United States has an explicit policy that condemns a percentage of the population to unemployment as a way to manage the business cycle. Currently, the Federal Reserve, concerned about the possibility of inflation not yet apparent, is raising interest rates to slow the economy and keep more people out of work. This is combined with the imbalance in power between workers and employers, as corporations use globalization, monopoly power and assaults on labor unions to roll back wages and benefits. <br> A good job guarantee stabilizes the business cycle not with a pool of unemployed workers, but with a pool of workers publicly employed at a living wage. The number expands when the private economy goes into recession, countering the downturn. It will decrease when the private economy grows, while preserving a floor for wages and conditions. They can be flexible to meet local needs. They can be supplemented with training programs to provide useful skills. <br> Finding good work won’t be a problem. Rebuilding crumbling roads, bridges and other parts of our infrastructure tops the list. Cities could use the program to clean up abandoned lots, rebuild parks, plant trees, arrest soil erosion and more. Essential care for the most vulnerable — elder care, after-school programs, support for new mothers and veterans and at-risk children — could finally be addressed. <br> A study released by the Levy Institute suggests that initially, the Good Jobs Guarantee would need to employ anywhere between 11 million and 16 million workers. That might cost in total about 1.3 percent to 2.4 percent of GDP. Much of the cost would be paid by savings from the costs of unemployment — unemployment insurance, food stamps, mass incarceration, opioid and drug treatment and policing and more. More would be covered by the increased growth and productivity that would be a direct result of lifting the floor under workers. And with inequality reaching new heights, reversal of the Republican tax cuts on corporations and the rich, plus a sensible estate tax to address the threat of oligarchic dynasties would more than pay the tab. <br> The discussion of a guarantee has just begun. In addition to the Levy Institute, other think tanks like the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and the Center for American Progress have also outlined different versions of a jobs guarantee. Policy analysts are now beginning to publish more comprehensive views. Polls reveal the concept already has remarkable popular support. The Congressional Progressive Caucus is likely to put together model legislation and basic principles. The progressive energy coming out of the 2016 election will push town meetings, study groups, and city council resolutions. Don’t be surprised if by 2020, a Good Job Guarantee is a centerpiece of one or more Democratic Party presidential hopefuls. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> The Post’s View: Big companies are hiking up wages.

 Having failed in their attempt to strip millions of health insurance by repealing Obamacare, President Trump and the Republican Congress are moving to their biggest priority: tax cuts for corporations and the rich. The plan is still being written, but Trump has already begun his push for it. And every part of the administration’s tax pitch is divorced from reality (a gentle way of saying it is a lie and a fraud). <br> The stated rationale for cutting corporate taxes, for example, is laughable. Republicans rail about our corporations paying the highest tax rates in the world. If the corporations have more cash, they assert, they will invest and create jobs. Trump adds his twist that lower taxes will get corporations to stop moving jobs abroad and start building things in the United States. <br> This is nonsense. U.S. corporations don’t pay the highest rates in the world. While the nominal top rate is 35 percent, the Government Accountability Office found that profitable large corporations paid on average an effective tax rate of 14 percent from 2008 to 2012. The tax code is rigged to ensure that result. Revenue from corporate taxes have plummeted from about 3.7 percent of gross domestic product in the late 1960s to an average of 1.5 percent in recent years. <br> Corporations aren’t short of cash, nor will they use the tax breaks for new investments. Corporate profits hit new highs last year, and the SP 500 corporations are devoting a record percentage of their earnings to buy back stocks, pay dividends and buy up competitors. They are boosting stock prices — and chief executives’ bonuses — not long-term growth or job creation. <br> Nor, contrary to Trump, are corporations shipping jobs abroad because of U.S. tax burden. They are moving abroad to take advantage of cheap labor and weak environmental and consumer protections that make production cheaper. Many use transfer pricing and a range of accounting tricks to dodge taxes by reporting profits abroad. Trump argues we should allow them to bring the money home at a very low rate, but the money is already available for investments at home. If the companies get the low rate, their tax scam will have worked. They’ll use the money — as they did the last time the government tried to allow repatriation — primarily to buy back stock and boost dividends, pumping up executive bonuses. And then even more will rush to repeat the scam in the future. <br> To test the Republican argument that lower tax rates will create jobs, the Institute for Policy Studies looked at the job record of profitable companies that paid a tax rate of 20 percent or less from 2008 through 2015. Those businesses actually were net losers of jobs. <br> Even Trump’s stated goal — tax reform that is revenue neutral — is a put-on. Republicans are interested in lowering tax rates on corporations and the rich; they are far less interested in tax reforms that will close loopholes to pay for the lower rates. This isn’t a strategy for tax reform; it’s a full-employment program for corporate lobbyists. Every loophole has a special interest mobilizing to defend it. Every tax dodge has a deep pocket to hire lawyers to justify it. Republican candidates may benefit from the bidding war that ensues, but the public surely will not. <br> Even the Republican bill-making process is perverse. Trump says he wants Democratic support, but there are no discussions with Democrats toward drafting a bipartisan bill. Democrats will be invited to sign on or shut up. The plan is to pass the bill as part of a budget reconciliation process that needs only Republican votes to pass. <br> This is the epitome of modern conservative governance. A perverse goal. A perilous process. Trump and Republicans want to slash government spending and reduce government capacity. By wasting weeks in trying to achieve something that will do nothing to address the real challenges we face, they will contribute to their real goal — to discredit government as an instrument of national purpose. Except this country is no longer so strong nor the middle class so robust as to afford this self-laceration. <br> There are sensible tax reforms that could be passed. Raise rates on the rich and use the money to fund a massive rebuilding of America’s infrastructure, starting with accelerating the move to renewable energy. That would create jobs, reduce inequality, invest in research and new technology, help capture a lead in growing global markets and begin to address climate change. Tax income from investments at the same rate as income from work. Require global corporations to pay taxes at the same rates as domestic companies by ending deferral. Tax financial speculation to raise revenue and at least slow the destabilizing financial casino. <br> These and other common-sense ideas would raise revenue and support badly needed public investments that would create real jobs and growth while not fueling greater inequality. It won’t surprise you that none of them are on the table in the back room where Republicans are struggling to come up with a tax plan. <br> To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, there may be no words in the English language more scary than “a Republican president and Congress announce it is time for tax reform.” <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: How Republicans may break their promise that their tax plan won’t raise the debt <br> Robert J.

 President Trump doubled down last week on his repulsive charge that immigrants from south of our border are “rapists.” It was another sign of what an appalling man he is but also an indication of how much political trouble he faces. <br> Trump is a demagogue who relies on the angry energy of his supporters. But he finds himself in an untenable position: No matter how many hot buttons he pushes, he cannot arouse the passion he needs on his own side to counter the determination and engagement of those who loathe him. <br> The upshot is a vicious cycle that could be disastrous for the Republican Party this fall. So far, Trump has failed to stir his base, but he has become, unintentionally, one of the most effective organizers of progressive activism and commitment in the country’s history. <br> Revulsion at Trump is now the driving force in American politics, and this petrifies the traditional GOP. Responding to the outcome of last week’s election in Wisconsin — a candidate backed by Democrats won an open state Supreme Court seat for the first time since 1995 — the normally loyal Republicans at the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page took off their gloves. <br> “If Mr. Trump is the main issue on Election Day in November,” the paper wrote, “all the evidence now points to an electoral wipeout like [President Barack] Obama’s in 2010 — this time against Republicans.” <br> Trump’s latest rape comments illustrated his obsession with pushing issues that appeal to Fox News and conservative talk radio fans at the expense of building his standing with the broader electorate. His outburst came last Thursday at a West Virginia event where he was supposed to be touting the tax cut that Republicans in Congress hope to run on. <br> But after calling his planned speech “boring” and tossing the pages of his text into the air, he proceeded to praise himself for his 2015 announcement speech in which he declared that Mexican immigrants were “rapists.” <br> Without offering any proof, he said that women coming to the United States in the so-called caravans he has been ranting about incessantly “are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before.” <br> Then came the effort to create an enemy. “They don’t want to mention that,” Trump said. But he is discovering that trashing a vaguely defined “they” is not as effective as deriding and abusing flesh-and-blood foes. <br> If there is a rational explanation for his seemingly erratic and often outrageous behavior in recent days, it involves a calculation that the coalition he built in 2016 lacks both a clear sense of who the adversary is and a set of causes around which it can rally. <br> While there is some conflict in the polling about Trump, a consistent finding is that those who strongly oppose him far outnumber those who are enthusiastically for him. A Morning Consult poll last week, for example, found that overall, 54 percent of registered voters disapproved of Trump’s performance while 41 approved. More important is the fact that 41 percent strongly disapproved of him while only 19 percent strongly approved. <br> Seen another way, the poll showed that three-quarters of those who disapprove of Trump hold intense feelings against him; less than half of those who approve are comparably fervent in their embrace. Trump’s opponents are deeply motivated to put a check on his presidency. His supporters are discouraged and demobilized. <br> A fifth of the country can provide an ample audience for a cable network and a lot of radio hosts. It is not enough to win an election. In the nominally nonpartisan Wisconsin judge’s race, as Michael Tomasky noted in the Daily Beast, several counties that had moved from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 swung back to Rebecca Dallet, the choice strongly endorsed by Democrats. And this came in a low-turnout race. In the Obama years, small turnouts benefited Republicans. The energy gap means that this pattern is now reversed. <br> A Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Friday brought home additional concrete results of this imbalance. It found an astonishing 1 in 5 Americans reporting that they had joined protests and rallies since the beginning of 2016 — and that 70 percent of them disapproved of Trump. <br> The dilemma for Republican politicians tempted to cut and run from Trump is that doing so might only further dispirit the party’s core and diminish Trump’s already parlous popularity. For his part, Trump knows only the politics of outrage. It is looking like a strategy with a very short shelf life. <br> Read more from E.J.

 The Aug. 13 editorial “A key to the tax debate” noted that tax reform is one way to improve productivity, but it questioned whether “Republicans can actually be trusted to deliver a fiscally responsible rewrite of business taxation, as opposed to deficit-financed tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals.” <br> If the recent Obamacare repeal-and-replace debacle is any indication, the answer most assuredly is no. In health-care reform, all that seemed to matter was a “win,” a check in the box. Republicans were hard-pressed to show how any of their “replacement” bills would make the system more stable or significantly less costly. <br> As the editorial intimated, tax reform should be done in a directed way that enhances growth without adding to the debt. But since any proposal to eliminate deductions will be contentious, it’s sounding more and more as though Republicans will abandon “revenue-neutral” reform and instead settle for deficit-increasing tax cuts. The question that they need to answer is: With the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent and inflation under 2 percent, why do we need another stimulus package that adds to our $20 trillion debt? <br> David Berry, Annandale 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> THERE WAS more lackluster news about productivity from the Labor Department on Wednesday, which means that a key engine of overall economic growth remains stalled. Specifically, output per private-sector worker rose at an annual rate of roughly 1 percent in the second three months of the year, better than last year’s, but still well below the postwar average and too slow to support any significant improvement in the economy’s 2 percent annual growth rate. What to do about this may be the most important economic challenge facing the United States. As Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer noted recently, living standards can double once every generation with 2 percent productivity growth; at 1 percent, that same improvement takes two generations. <br> Expect improving productivity to be one of the key talking points when Republicans in the executive and legislative branches resume their campaign for tax reform after Congress’s August recess. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) touted corporate tax reform as a solution for slow productivity in his “Better Way” policy agenda last year. And it’s true — corporate tax reform could encourage businesses to invest in productivity-enhancing capital, and to enhance the efficiency of investment decisions, assuming lower rates are applied to a tax base purged of special-interest loopholes. Whether Republicans can actually be trusted to deliver a fiscally responsible rewrite of business taxation, as opposed to deficit-financed tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals, is another matter. <br> In truth, federal taxes are only one factor affecting productivity — and not necessarily the most important. Many productivity-enhancing measures might require more government investment, and taxpayer resources to pay for them: health care to keep workers functioning at their best; education to enhance workers’ skills; basic research to spawn new technology; infrastructure to speed movement of people, goods and information. Deregulation, another Republican panacea for productivity, has its place, too. But much of the needed reform involves not health and safety rules at the national level but trimming excessive professional licensing requirements at the local level. An underappreciated source of low productivity may be obstacles to worker mobility created by local land-use rules, which have the effect of making it harder for people to find affordable housing near their jobs, according to a 2015 study by President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. <br> When it comes to improving productivity, then, the coming push for tax reform has the potential to do some good — but also mischief. Even good-faith policy prescriptions suffer from the same flaw, which is that productivity remains one of the least understood and, indeed, least precisely measured concepts in all of economics. Improving worker efficiency probably depends as much on maintaining broadly supportive economic and social conditions as it does on this or that specific line in the tax code or Federal Register. And while achieving those conditions sometimes requires less government intervention, sometimes it requires more. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Robert J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> AFTER MONTHS of talking about tax reform, the Trump administration and Republican leaders of Congress have emerged with a statement of what they have in mind — or, more precisely, what they do not have in mind. The GOP has abandoned what was once its most innovative concept for tax reform, to pay for sharply reduced marginal rates on business through what would have essentially been a tax on the huge U.S. trade deficit, yielding an estimated $1 trillion over a decade. While this would have encouraged companies to invest and produce in the United States, that positive result could have been outweighed by negatives — disruptions to international financial markets, a challenge at the World Trade Organization, short-term spikes in consumer prices. In short, it’s just as well that Republicans have abandoned the idea, which was always more popular in the House than in the Senate and the White House and had little chance of passage. <br> Alas, that leaves lawmakers again searching for a way to pay for the rate-cutting they remain determined to achieve. According to the “Joint Statement on Tax Reform” they issued Thursday, Republicans still intend to provide “tax relief for American families” and to make corporate taxation more competitive in international terms. Unless and until they come up with a replacement for the $1 trillion in revenue they have just disavowed, the would-be reformers have only two choices: scale back their tax-cutting plans or greatly increase the federal deficit. <br> We hope they would opt for the former course; though President Trump has called for a new corporate rate as low as 15 percent, down from the current 35 percent, it would only take a smaller reduction, to 25 percent or so, to put the United States back on par with its peers in the advanced industrial world. However, we fear that Republicans will do what they have done too many times in the past — shower new tax breaks on companies and the well-to-do and stick future generations with the tab. <br> A new wrinkle has emerged in the form of a proposal for a 44 percent top marginal rate on individual income greater than $5 million a year, up from the current 39.6 percent maximum, which has been floated within GOP circles by Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Ever the populist, Mr. Bannon is sensitive to the bad political optics of a “reform” plan that amounts to yet another deficit-financed bonanza for the rich. Mr. Bannon’s notion alone could probably not raise anywhere near enough revenue to fill the holes Republicans seem intent on opening elsewhere in the tax code. It’s significant, and positive, that it has even become part of the policy discussion. Even better, however, would be a GOP plan that paid more than lip service to progressivity and fiscal responsibility. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: The Republican tax-reform plan isn’t reform at all <br> The Post’s View: A tax-reform plan is waiting on the shelf.

 Regarding the March 17 news article “Democrats balk at making technical fix to tax law”: <br> When tax reform became an issue last year, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives and its members — businesses owned and controlled by farmers — pressed Congress to retain the domestic production activities deduction (DPAD). For more than a decade, DPAD proved successful in keeping money in rural America and spurring economic activity in local communities. Eliminating DPAD without a replacement would have raised taxes on the million farmers who are member-owners of co-ops. <br> Much to NCFC’s disappointment, Congress ultimately chose not to retain DPAD, replacing it with a 20 percent deduction on gross income from cooperatives. When noncooperative grain companies, all of whom are enjoying a 40 percent reduction in their corporate tax rates, began to assert without proof that the new law affected the competitive marketplace, farmer co-ops entered into discussions to develop a solution that did not involve raising taxes on farmers. By re-creating the old DPAD to the extent possible, this proposal would do that. It also re- creates the marketplace that existed before Jan. 1. We hope Congress moves this proposal forward in a timely manner to help provide certainty to farmers. <br> Chuck Conner, Washington <br> The writer is president and chief executive of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> THE PURPOSE OF tax reform is to raise revenue more efficiently — with fewer loopholes and special breaks that distort economic incentives and necessitate higher marginal rates. In discussing tax reform since President Trump’s election, Republicans have promised to do just that: pass a bill with lower rates for both individuals and businesses, applied to an income “base” broadened by the elimination of deductions and credits. <br> If you listen very closely to what GOP leaders have been saying lately, however, especially in remarks last week by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Vice President Pence, what you’ll hear is the carefully chosen words of people planning something that’s not real tax reform at all. <br> Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers Tuesday, Mr. Ryan pledged to take on “defenders of the status quo” — and then proceeded to defend many of the status quo’s worst aspects. He pledged to get rid of “special-interest carve-outs” except for those that “make the most sense” — such as the deduction for mortgage interest. Actually, this distortion of the real estate market is one of the tax code’s least sensible features, but it is politically sacrosanct due to the power of the real estate lobby. The only major individual tax break Mr. Ryan seemed to leave on the chopping block was the deduction for state and local taxes, which disproportionately favors states that send Democrats to Congress. Any GOP tax plan would eliminate the estate tax, Mr. Ryan insisted — thus entrenching the concentration of wealth in the United States. <br> Somewhat more plausibly, Mr. Ryan advocated a new corporate tax system, with a lower top rate, so as to discourage shifting production abroad. However, he gave few specifics and seemed to soft-pedal the means of paying for the plan he and his House colleagues had previously offered — a so-called “border adjustment” that would raise tens of billions of dollars per year, essentially by taxing the U.S. trade deficit. He referred to a “new, lower tax, specifically for small businesses,” which could translate into a costly new benefit for “pass-through” entities, such as sole proprietorships and S corporations. <br> Meanwhile, Mr. Pence repeated the Trump administration’s promise that the end result of any tax rewrite will be “tax cuts,” implicitly endorsing the dubious notion that the U.S. economy lags due to an excessive tax burden. And not just any tax cut, Mr. Pence said, but “the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan,” meaning even bigger than those enacted by President George W. Bush. So much for the idea that tax reform ought to be revenue-neutral. Given that Mr. Trump and Congress cannot — and should not — cut spending enough to offset such large revenue losses, what may be in the offing is “tax reform” that ratchets up federal debt. <br> Mr. Ryan, too, alluded to the need for “tax cuts.” That made the week’s GOP messaging unanimous and reinforced suspicions that, for all their talk of reform, slashing taxes, mainly for the wealthy and corporations, is the one policy that Republicans agree on and therefore the only policy they are actually going to enact. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jeffrey H.

 Charles Koch is chairman of the board and chief executive of Koch Industries. <br> By many measures, America’s economy is strong. Unemployment is down, the stock market is up and consumer confidence is rising. Although far too many barriers still keep a large portion of our population from fully participating in these benefits, we are making real progress. <br> Several recent policies have contributed to this improvement. They include federal tax reform (which is far from perfect, but is a step in the right direction), the administration’s regulatory reforms and many improvements by state governments. To ensure that this prosperity is shared by everyone, even more policy improvements are necessary. <br> Widespread and lasting progress requires the free exchange of ideas, goods and services. It is no coincidence that our quality of life has improved over the years as the average U.S. tariff on imported goods has fallen — from nearly 20 percent in 1932 to less than 4 percent in 2016. <br> A society that embraces free and open exchange not only provides the greatest abundance, it enables the growth of knowledge and life-enhancing innovations that uplift everyone. Just as the United States benefits from the ideas and skills that opportunity-seeking immigrants bring with them, free trade has been essential to our society’s prosperity and to people improving their lives. <br> The same has been true throughout history. Countries with the freest trade have tended to not only be the wealthiest but also the most tolerant. Conversely, the restriction of trade — whether through tariffs, quotas or other means — has hurt the economy and pitted people against each other. Tariffs increase prices, limit choices, reduce competition and inhibit innovation. Equally troubling, research shows that they fail to increase the number of jobs overall. Consider the devastation of cities such as Detroit, where trade barriers to aid the auto industry did nothing to halt its decline. <br> The administration’s recent decision to impose major steel and aluminum tariffs — on top of higher tariffs on washing machines and solar panels — will have the same harmful effect. Without a doubt, those who can least afford it will be harmed the most. Having just helped consumers keep more of their money by passing tax reform, it makes little sense to take it away via higher costs. <br> One might assume that, as the head of Koch Industries — a large company involved in many industries, including steel — I would applaud such import tariffs because they would be to our immediate and financial benefit. But corporate leaders must reject this type of short-term thinking, and we have. If we are to have a system in which businesses can succeed long term, policies must benefit everyone, not just the few. <br> Unfortunately, tariffs are not the only problem. Our entire economy is rife with cronyism, resulting in regulations and subsidies that are destroying competition, opportunity and innovation. Koch Industries benefits from many of these, as do many established companies, but we consistently work to eliminate them. We only support policies that are based on equality under the law and that help people improve their lives. This is why we successfully lobbied to end direct ethanol subsidies, despite being one of the largest ethanol producers in the United States. It is why we fought against the inclusion of a border adjustment tax in the tax-reform package, even though it would have greatly increased our profits by increasing costs to consumers. <br> History is filled with examples of administrations that have implemented trade restrictions with devastating results. At the dawn of the Great Depression, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act raised U.S. tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods, which accelerated our decline instead of correcting it. More recently, President George W. Bush’s 30 percent steel tariff led to increased consumer costs and higher unemployment. And President Barack Obama’s 2009 decision to raise tariffs on Chinese tires ultimately burdened consumers with $1.1 billion in higher prices. The cost per job saved was nearly $1 million , not considering all the lost jobs that went unmeasured. <br> Tariffs will not add thousands of American jobs. Instead, the research shows that, while they preserve some jobs that would otherwise disappear, they reduce many other higher productivity jobs. The net effect will be not more jobs, but lower overall productivity. They also reduce choice, competition, innovation and opportunity. Predictably, after the announcement of the tariff on washing-machine imports, South Korean manufacturer LG Electronics told retailers that it would increase its prices. Tariffs will only perpetuate the rigged system that threatens the very core of our society. When large companies can pressure politicians to force everyday Americans to fork over unearned millions, we should all question the fairness of the system. <br> Given all of this, it is easy to see why a recent Gallup survey found that nearly two out of three Americans don’t trust our institutions. It’s hard to blame them. To include millions more of our people in true economic progress, our lawmakers must act on behalf of all Americans — not just the privileged few. If they do, I am confident we can regain our citizens’ trust and ensure that America’s best days are yet to come. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Dana Milbank: Republicans finally reveal their red line for Trump <br> Robert J.

 The writers are senior fellows and economists at the Hoover Institution. <br> We live in a time of extraordinary promise. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 3D manufacturing, medical science and other areas have the potential to dramatically raise living standards in coming decades. But a major obstacle stands squarely in the way of this promise: high and sharply rising government debt. <br> President Trump’s recently released budget is a wake-up call. It projects that this year, a year of relatively strong economic growth, low unemployment and continued historically low interest rates, the deficit will reach $870 billion, 30 percent greater than last year. <br> For years, economists have warned of major increases in future public debt burdens. That future is on our doorstep. From this point forward, even if economic growth continues uninterrupted, current tax and spending patterns imply that annual deficits will steadily increase, approaching the $1 trillion mark in two years and steadily rising thereafter as far as the eye can see. <br> Unless Congress acts to reduce federal budget deficits, the outstanding public debt will reach $20 trillion a scant five years from now, up from its current level of $15 trillion. That amounts to almost a quarter of million dollars for a family of four, more than twice the median household wealth. <br> This string of perpetually rising trillion-dollar-plus deficits is unprecedented in U.S. history. <br> In recent months, we have seen an inevitable rise in interest rates from their low levels of recent years. Rising interest rates and increasing deficits threaten to build upon each other to send public debt spiraling upward even faster. When treasury debt holders start to doubt our government’s ability to repay, or to attract future lenders, they will demand higher interest rates to compensate for the risk. If current spending and tax policy continue unaltered, higher interest costs will have to be financed by even more debt. More borrowing puts more upward pressure on interest rates, and the spiral continues. <br> If, for example, interest rates were to rise to 5 percent, instead of the Trump administration’s prediction of just under 3.5 percent, the interest cost alone on the projected $20 trillion of public debt would total $1 trillion per year. More than half of all personal income taxes would be needed to pay bondholders. Such high interest payments would crowd out financing of needed expenditures to restore our depleted national defense budget, our domestic infrastructure and other critical government activities. <br> Unchecked, such a debt spiral raises the specter of a crisis. Some may think that such concerns are overblown, as there is no current evidence in financial futures markets that a crisis is on the horizon. But a debt crisis does not come slowly and visibly like a rising tide. It comes without warning, like an earthquake, as short-term bondholders attempt to escape fiscal carnage. Only in hindsight are we able to see the stresses building and bemoan that we did not act. While some insulation flows from the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency, that is neither sufficient nor immutable, and relies on faith in the United States’ eventual fiscal probity. <br> As is well-known, our deficit and debt problems stem from sharply rising entitlement spending. Without congressional action, the combination of the automatic spending increase per beneficiary provisions of these programs and the growth in entitlement program recipients as the population ages will cause entitlement spending to continue to rise far faster than U.S. national income and tax revenue. <br> To address the debt problem, Congress must reform and restrain the growth of entitlement programs and adopt further pro-growth tax and regulatory policies. The recently enacted corporate-tax-reform plan is a good first step, as it sharply increases the incentive to invest and grow businesses, which will increase incomes. The revenue loss, which amounts to about 0.4 percent of gross-domestic product in 2025, is not by itself a budget buster, considering both the offsetting revenue reflow from higher incomes and the far larger long-run entitlement explosion. Moreover, over the next decade, the tax plan maintains or increases the federal tax claim on GDP compared with recent levels. <br> Taxes alone cannot solve our budget problem. Funding programs as they are currently structured will require high taxes for all income levels, taxes that would sharply reduce economic opportunity and growth, which in turn will make funding entitlements that much harder. <br> If Congress acts now, it can avoid a fiscal collapse while continuing to provide help to people who need it. If Congress waits for a crisis — which may come when the United States needs suddenly to borrow significantly to address a financial meltdown, recession or war — the result will be fiscal and economic chaos, as well as painfully sharp cuts to programs that people rely on. <br> It is time for action. Fixing our fiscal problems is far easier now than it will be in the heart of a crisis. And if we cannot fix our problems now, in a time of peace and prosperity, just when can we do so? <br> Read more here: <br> Fred Hiatt: Don’t celebrate the budget agreement.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> NEXT TIME you see a fancy new electric car, ask the owner for a ride. After all, you helped pay for it. The federal government provides a $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing electric vehicles, which means that it transfers that much money from everyone else to the relative handful of Americans who have so far purchased a plug-in vehicle. Cost before tax credit: $74,500 in the case of a Tesla Model S, or $37,495 for a smaller, less capable Chevrolet Bolt. This is a Robin-Hood-in-reverse policy. Electric-car purchasers tend to be upper-income, and the credit is non-refundable — meaning its value increases as your income tax liability increases (up to the $7,500 maximum). It’s worth nothing to lower-income folks who don’t owe federal tax. And even if it were fully refundable, lower-income people would rarely qualify because the cars would still be too expensive for them. Some 90 percent of the credit’s benefits accrue to the top 20 percent of taxpayers, according to a 2015 study by Severin Borenstein and Lucas Davis, economists at the University of California at Berkeley. <br> Republicans briefly considered axing the electric-car credit in their tax reform bill, then decided to leave it in — with all the bill’s other benefits for the rich — at the urging of the auto industry. Carmakers insist now that the break should be not only retained but also, as General Motors CEO Mary Barra said March 7, “expanded, so our customers continue to receive the benefit going forward.” Current law says that the credit applies only to the first 200,000 plug-ins any manufacturer sells, and phases out over the year after the company hits that benchmark. GM has already sold about 160,000, as has Tesla, billionaire Elon Musk’s company. Ms. Barra therefore wants Congress to raise the 200,000-car limit or eliminate it altogether, according to the Wall Street Journal. <br> The automakers have a point: If Washington is going to require them to produce the vehicles, which have been slow to catch on with consumers in part due to their relatively high cost, the least it can do is help subsidize their sales. Maintaining the ceiling ironically punishes Tesla and GM for entering the market first, since they are about to exhaust their 200,000-car quotas just as European competitors are about to start on theirs. <br> Then again, Washington could just level the playing field by eliminating the tax break for everyone. At a minimum, Congress should allow the existing rule to phase out as planned. This issue poses a trade-off between two public policy goals — environmental quality and economic fairness. Tax subsidies to buy cars are far more efficient at worsening the latter than improving the former, in part because much of the electricity that fuels plug-in vehicles still derives from fossil fuel sources such as coal and natural gas. If electric vehicles are the wave of the future, they’ll have to survive on their own economically sooner or later. It should be sooner. Car corporations, billionaire entrepreneurs and their well-heeled customers have received enough assistance from the rest of us already. <br> Read more: <br> George F.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> THE CONGRESSIONAL Budget Office is nonpartisan and analytical, a rare honest broker of policy-related information in Washington. As such, the CBO played a major role in the otherwise intensely partisan debate over the House Republicans’ abortive plan to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. The budget office’s forecast that it would reduce future insurance coverage to the tune of 24 million people proved politically deadly. <br> Now come new CBO numbers that ought to have a similar reality-inducing impact on the impending debate over tax reform, to which the Trump administration and GOP Congress are now pivoting in search of a legislative “win.” The CBO’s latest annual projection of the federal fiscal balance, published on March 30, was, as usual, couched in neutral language. But it unmistakably conveyed a dual message: The United States could benefit from tax reform, but it would be utterly reckless to enact reform that slashes federal revenues by hundreds of billions of dollars, as some versions floated by President Trump would do. <br> The CBO’s bottom line on the fiscal future was this: If current law remains in place, “federal debt would reach an unprecedented share of GDP [in 30 years], intensifying pressures on the federal budget, dampening economic growth, limiting the nation’s ability to respond to unforeseen events and increasing the likelihood of a fiscal crisis.” Today’s debt amounts to 77 percent of gross domestic product, the highest since the years immediately following World War II. That ratio would nearly double to a completely unprecedented 150 percent by 2047. This represents a five-percentage-point worsening of CBO debt-to-GDP projections since last year, due in large part to a gloomier view of economic growth. That assessment, in turn, reflects structural factors such as an aging population and stagnating productivity growth. Mounting debt itself would also “crowd out” private investment, the CBO notes. <br> By refining incentives to work, invest and produce, tax reform — especially corporate reform aimed at improving global competitiveness — could help remove structural barriers to growth. Yet reform should be deficit-neutral, lest short-run benefits be swamped by long-run crowding-out of investment by government borrowing, as the CBO suggests. The federal government probably needs more revenue to meet the commitments it has already undertaken. In fact, merely stabilizing the long-run debt at the current elevated level, 77 percent of GDP, would require a combination of tax increases or spending cuts equal to nearly 2 percent of GDP per year, as compared with what’s called for in current law, starting in 2018. In dollar terms, the CBO notes, that would be a fiscal adjustment of $380 billion next year — a huge political challenge and impossible without trims to the middle-class entitlement programs Mr. Trump has promised not to touch. Mr. Trump’s budget blueprint, meanwhile, cuts domestic programs in favor of adding to military spending, but produces no net deficit reduction. <br> Like many populists before him, the president seems inclined to lavish tax breaks and government resources on favored constituencies without regard to long-term fiscal responsibility. The CBO, the voice of realism and reason, explains that that just won’t work. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Alice M. Rivlin: Don’t undermine the Congressional Budget Office.

 Jeffrey H. Birnbaum is president of BGR Public Relations, a former Post reporter and a consultant to the Coalition for Fair Effective Tax Rates. He co-wrote the book “Showdown at Gucci Gulch” about the 1986 tax reform. <br> The impossible happened three decades ago. Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan signed into law the first and only rewrite of the federal income tax. This year, Republican leaders want to repeat the feat. <br> If history is an indication, the road to full-scale reform will be tortuous and lengthy. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was debated in concept long before taking two years to wend its way through Congress. It died several times before public opinion and extraordinary political leadership revived it. Few veterans of ’86 believe Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s prediction that tax reform will be completed by this fall. <br> Tax reform is complicated, painful and personal by design. Popular breaks must be eliminated or diminished to pay for lower rates. The deeper the rate cuts, the more benefits need to be removed. Alternatively, an entirely new tax would have to be imposed or else deficits would have to be increased. No matter what, some will win while others lose. The losers will complain — a lot. Every person, business and organization will be impacted. <br> What follows are five lessons that the last tax reform can teach policymakers this time around. <br> Partisanship is the least of tax reform’s worries. The biggest fights in 1986 were between interests, not political parties. Dust-ups developed between high- and low-tax states; between manufacturers and service providers; and between companies that paid large amounts in taxes and those that paid little. The bill was dubbed the “Lobbyists’ Relief Act of 1986” because every organized group clamored for narrow relief. <br> To prevent this atomization, reform advocates highlighted notable supporters among businesses executives and focused on the plan’s overall fairness and contributions to economic growth. This split and weakened its many vocal opponents. They also asked taxpayers to overlook reform’s many tax hikes and concentrate on the bottom line — the effective tax rate, which is the amount actually paid in taxes after rates are reduced and preferences removed. Similar broad thinking is needed for reform to succeed again. <br> Cooperation and leadership are essential. Tax reform was launched in 1985 with a scene that’s almost unimaginable today: a televised speech by Reagan, a Republican, followed by a Democratic response by Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, endorsing the president’s initiative. Rostenkowski even asked citizens to “Write Rosty” to support the idea. Seventy-five thousand letters and postcards soon arrived. <br> This bipartisanship wasn’t just for show. Reagan’s personal intervention was essential to saving reform from a Republican revolt in the House. Then as now, the congressional majorities were too small to permit one party to pass so contentious a measure alone. Cooperation was and is a mathematical necessity. <br> At the same time, competition between the parties can be good for reform. In the 1980s, the Republican administration offered two proposals, all but daring the Democratic House to come up with its own. The House rose to the challenge and managed to send a bill to the Republican-controlled Senate. Republicans there believed they couldn’t be perceived as falling short of the Democrats. So they pushed through their own version with Democratic help. A bill became law because neither party wanted to be blamed for allowing reform to die. <br> In other words, public opinion must strongly favor tax reform for so difficult a measure to pass. In the mid-1980s, polls showed that most citizens believed that “special interests” had infected the income tax, and they demanded that Congress cure the disease. Candidates amplified horror stories about the rich not paying taxes. The president and senior lawmakers made reform a top priority, turbocharging the effort. <br> The tax code is facing similar outrage in 2017. A recent Fox News poll found that 55 percent of voters think their taxes are too high and nearly three-quarters believe the tax system should be reformed this year. The problem is that somebody will pay more taxes so that others can pay less. When President Trump calls for a tax cut, he may be signaling that he wants something less than comprehensive reform. <br> The fate of tax reform will rest on policymakers’ ability to find acceptable revenue raisers. In 1985 and 1986, multiple tax hikes were touted, defeated and ultimately replaced. The Ways and Means Committee had to jettison a plan to end the deduction for state and local tax payments before the legislation could advance. In the end, lawmakers chose to boost corporate taxes by $120 billion over five years and to transfer those savings to individuals. That was the tough-love trade-off arrived at through the harsh crucible of the legislative process. <br> Some GOP leaders today appear to believe that their plans don’t need to be tested in that way. Some don’t want to pay for rate cuts at all, though it’s hard to see how that could find enough votes to pass. <br> History tells us that policymakers should expect setbacks and need to learn from them. Nothing about this will be easy. <br> Read more on this: <br> The Post’s View: Hardly reform at all <br> Lawrence Summers: Take a page from Reagan <br> Robert J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IN THE wake of the failure by Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House to get an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill off the ground, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sounded an optimistic note about President Trump’s next big project, tax reform. Overhauling the nation’s convoluted, inefficient internal revenue code, he said Friday, would be “a lot simpler” than overhauling its sprawling health-care system. At which much of Washington rolled its eyes. After all, the same interplay of interest-group conflict, policy complexity and partisan ideology that undid GOP health-care efforts would seem to apply to tax reform. The intra-Republican battle over the House’s main new idea — a de facto tax on imports to pay for corporate tax relief — is a case in point. <br> Still, in one sense Mr. Mnuchin may be right. Unlike health care, the subject of a comprehensive bill under Mr. Trump’s predecessor which only recently took full effect, the tax code was last given a top-to-bottom fix in 1986. It’s overdue. Moreover, in the past decade or so, problems, such as internationally uncompetitive corporate taxation, have become more salient. And numerous detailed plans for fixing them have emerged from experts on Capitol Hill in both parties. <br> In short, the legislative shelf is full of policy options from which to choose, if Mr. Mnuchin would rather avoid the time-consuming exercise of making his own from scratch. That’s certainly what we would do in his position. For example, in 2014, then-House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) drafted a bill that would have reduced the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and replaced the seven marginal rates for individuals with three: 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. The lower rates would have been paid for by eliminating or reducing certain long-standing tax breaks, such as the mortgage-interest and charitable deductions. <br> Accordingly, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation scored Mr. Camp’s plan as revenue-neutral; that is, it neither increased nor decreased the budget deficit. Mr. Camp (now retired) included sweeteners for Democrats, with whom he consulted extensively: His plan targeted the notorious special treatment of “carried interest” for hedge-fund managers (something Mr. Mnuchin also favors), as well as a break for corporate jets, which was a pet issue of President Barack Obama. <br> There were objectionable aspects to Mr. Camp’s plan. It retained favorable treatment of investment income for top earners, a major source of the growing rich-poor gap. Yet even some top Democrats considered it “a credible effort,” as then-representative, now senator, Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. Republican leaders basically nixed it, not because of any policy objection, but because there was more to be gained, politically, in that election year by raining negativity on Mr. Obama. <br> Now, though, the GOP is the governing party, and it’s in a major policy and political jam, which can be escaped by offering plausible plans with at least potential bipartisan appeal. We wonder how many Republicans remember that their erstwhile top tax-law writer bequeathed them a proposal that fits that description. It is right there on the shelf, waiting. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: A smart corporate tax reform plan worth Trump’s attention <br> Catherine Rampell: Think tax reform will be easy for Trump?

 You thought tax reform would be an easy win for Republicans? <br> Oh, it feels good to laugh again. <br> After the Obamacare-repeal disaster, President Trump has decided to move on to tax reform. He’s hoping to quickly restore public faith in his leadership, which has so far been stymied by federal judges, the House Freedom Caucus and basic math. <br> But many of the issues that brought down repeal-and-replace will dog his tax plan, too. <br> Some of these are procedural, and relate to arcane Senate rules governing the ﬁlibuster. Some concern the fact that every change to the tax code — as with every change to health care — involves painful trade-offs and angry interest groups that will work to obstruct said change. <br> The biggest hurdle, however, is not about technicalities or political transactions. It’s about substance. As with health care, the Trump administration has made too many contradictory, sometimes mutually exclusive promises that will be impossible to keep. <br> In particular, Trump’s many scattershot promises about what’s going to happen to wealthy people’s taxes. <br> “The rich will pay their fair share,” Trump the populist promised his supporters during the campaign, when he often railed against upper-class greed and special-interest tax breaks. <br>  Since then, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly pledged that the administration would offer life-changing, economy-transforming tax cuts for the working class. Any tax-rate cuts for the wealthy, on the other hand, would be fully canceled out by closing deductions, credits and other loopholes. On net, the wealthy would pay the same amount they are now — hey, maybe more! <br> “There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,” Mnuchin promised. <br> This guarantee — that unlike all other Republicans, Trump did not plan to cut taxes on the rich — was so bold and unusual that it even earned a nickname. At Mnuchin’s confirmation hearings, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) dubbed it the “Mnuchin rule.” In a CNBC interview, Mnuchin expressed pride at being the namesake of an official “rule,” blithely remarking that this put him in the company of Paul Volcker and Warren Buffett. <br> Of course, if you actually look at Trump’s tax plan, you’ll see that this “rule” was made to be broken. <br> The Trump tax plan released last fall, which Mnuchin helped to author, includes enormous “absolute” tax cuts for the rich, even after accounting for the elimination of deductions and credits. In fact, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Trump’s plan would give rich people the biggest tax cuts of any income group. <br> That’s true however you slice it. The top 1 percent of taxpayers get the biggest cut in raw dollar terms, as a percentage of their incomes and as a percentage of total tax cuts. They’d receive nearly half the total tax cuts under Trump’s plan (and three-quarters of all the cuts under the House GOP plan). <br> The one and only concrete example Trump has offered of how he would force rich people — or at least, a tiny subset of rich people — to pay their “fair share” is his proposal to close the so-called “carried interest” loophole. <br> But even that’s a lie. <br> “Carried interest” refers to the cut of client profits collected by managers at certain kinds of investment funds (such as private equity and venture capital funds). It’s basically a performance fee. Under current law, that fee gets taxed at long-term capital gains rates (20 percent) rather than at ordinary wage income rates (top rate of 39.6 percent). <br> Trump has pledged to close this loophole by treating “carried interest” as ordinary income. Which is great, and much fairer than the current state of affairs. At least it would be if Trump didn’t offer these same taxpayers a much, much more valuable tax cut. <br> Buried in Trump’s plan is a provision allowing owners of pass-through businesses (which include sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-corporations) to be taxed at a flat rate of 15 percent rather than the regular individual income-tax rates. The investment fund partnerships that currently benefit from preferential rates on “carried interest” would qualify for this special pass-through rate.  <br> Trump claims he’ll soak Wall Street, but he’s really just allowing investment fund managers to swap one preferential tax rate for another, even lower one. He’s cutting their taxes, not raising them. <br> All of which is to say: Just as all of Trump’s health-care promises proved impossible to square, so too will his tax populism collide with the plutocratic reality of his true priorities. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP’s top priority is in trouble <br> The Post’s View: A smart corporate tax reform plan worth Trump’s attention <br> Lawrence Summers: Trump and Ryan are right to tackle corporate taxes.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> CORPORATE TAX reform continues to be a work in progress for the Trump administration and the Republican Congress, where a controversial House plan to slash the top business rate and pay for it, or most of it, with what amounts to a tax on imports remains the leading proposal. The latest development was a remark Friday by President Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, that “we are working on a bunch of really interesting ideas” to produce revenue-neutral reform — i.e., one that does not increase the budget deficit — over a 10-year period. <br> The revenue-neutral part sounds good; a welcome reassurance, in fact, compared with previous administration waffling about fiscal responsibility. As for “really interesting ideas,” we hope Mr. Cohn is at least considering the innovative corporate-tax-reform plan by Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute and Eric Toder of the Urban Institute, which would substantially cut the corporate tax rate, offset by higher taxes on dividends and capital gains for individuals. <br> Specifically, the top corporate rate would fall from 35 percent to 15 percent, while shareholders in public companies would pay the same rate on dividends and capital gains as they pay on their ordinary income, as opposed to the current system’s preferential rate. Crucially, individuals would be taxed not just when they sold stocks, but on any annual increase in the market value of their holdings. Meanwhile, nonprofits and retirement plans would pay a new 15 percent tax on interest earned, to offset the bump in stock value they’d get due to the lower 15 percent corporate rate. Owners of firms that do not issue publicly traded stock — partnerships and the like — would pay the ordinary income rate on their share of profits. <br> The Viard-Toder plan overcomes the biggest problem of the current corporate taxation system: It encourages companies to move overseas, either in actuality or in the sense of locating profits abroad. A low 15 percent rate would not only encourage American firms to stay home, but induce non-American companies to relocate. The plan also takes advantage of the paradox that individuals are easier to tax than even the biggest corporate entity since, unlike the latter, they can’t relocate on paper to Ireland. Subjecting more of the wealth and income that individuals realize from corporate ownership to taxation, at the same rate as wage income, is thus efficient and, in a real sense, fair, since the current preferential rate for capital gains is a major reason that billionaires can get away with paying lower tax rates than their secretaries. <br> Operationally, the biggest difficulty would be quantifying and taxing the annual fluctuations in investors’ stock holdings. That will be a heavy lift politically, too; nonprofits as well can be expected to howl at the tax on their interest earnings. It’s important to note, however, that the total burden of taxation on corporate income would remain roughly the same; it would simply be levied directly on the company’s owners rather than on the (elusive) legal entity itself.

 When the Republican-controlled Congress first approved its tax bill in December, most Democrats believed it would be a political loser for the GOP. Indeed, a New York Times poll found that just 37 percent of Americans approved of the plan. “To pass a bill of tax cuts and have it be so unpopular with the American people is an amazing achievement for the Republicans — it’s never been done before,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) crowed. <br> He’s not crowing any more. In January support had risen to 46 percent, and this week it reached a 51 percent majority. Meanwhile, disapproval has dropped from 57 percent in December to 45 percent today. That is a swing of 26 points. <br> Why the change? Because taxes are personal. The tax bill is extremely complicated, and when it was passed, many Americans were confused about how it would affect them. A December poll found that only 17 percent believed they would pay less in taxes, while 32 percent thought they would pay more. In fact, about 80 percent of taxpayers will receive a tax cut this year averaging about $2,100, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. For the middle class, an even larger share benefit: More than 90 percent of taxpayers in the middle income quintile will receive a tax cut. <br> It is taking time for voters to figure this out. In 2001, when President George W. Bush passed his across-the-board tax cuts, his message was simple: Every American who pays taxes will get a tax cut. But in 2017, Republicans overhauled more of the entire tax code. They cut tax rates and doubled the standard deduction but also eliminated many traditional deductions for those who itemize. As a result, a lot of taxpayers didn’t know whether they would end up winners or losers. <br> Now, more Americans are starting to discover that they are winners. Millions are starting to receive their Trump tax cuts as employers lower their tax withholdings, leaving more money in their paychecks. And the bill will become more popular as more people learn the good news. Even now, only one-third of Americans think they will see an income tax cut. Many voters are going to be pleasantly surprised when they discover their taxes are being reduced thanks to President Trump and Republican lawmakers. And that does not take into account the bonuses and raises that many Americans are receiving from their employers because of the corporate tax cuts — or the wage increases they will get from the economic growth that tax reform unleashes in the months and years ahead. <br> When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dismissed these tax saving as “crumbs,” she came off as an elitist. A couple of thousand dollars a year may be crumbs to a San Francisco multimillionaire, but to most hard-working Americans that is real money. Indeed, Pelosi is getting slammed by her fellow Democrats for her out-of-touch response. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) warned that “language is important” and “we cannot be seen as patricians,” while Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), a member of the House Democratic leadership, said, “I think for people making $40,000 a year, any increase in their take-home is significant for them.” <br> Democrats are in a bind because they voted against that increase in take-home pay. The growing public support for tax reform is especially a problem for the five vulnerable Senate Democrats running for reelection in states that Trump won by double digits. All of them will have a hard time explaining why they sided with the “resistance” and opposed giving their constituents a tax cut. <br> The success is already bolstering GOP candidates. In North Dakota, a state Trump won by 36 points, the success of the tax bill has drawn Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D) a strong challenger in Rep. Kevin Cramer (R). Just last month, Cramer had announced that he was not going to run. Why did he change his mind? The Post reports that one reason was Cramer’s belief that Heitkamp’s vote against the tax bill was “fatal” for her. <br> Expect to see a lot of other GOP challengers — and purple-state voters — come to the same conclusion. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> George F.

 Lance Fritz is chairman, president and chief executive of Union Pacific. <br> As the chief executive officer of the United States’ largest publicly traded railroad, I have a comprehensive view of the nation’s economy. Freight railroads are the bloodstream of U.S. business, supporting the livelihoods of employees in nearly every sector of the economy. Increases in demand for autos, grain, plastic, beer and thousands of other products often register in Union Pacific car-loadings long before they are reflected in broader economic statistics. <br> From my vantage point, it is clear that the recently adopted tax-reform law will provide meaningful stimulus for the U.S. economy. I hear positive news from our customers every week — from a steel company that plans to build a new plant in America’s heartland, to tens of billions of dollars being invested in the chemicals industry on the Gulf Coast, to foreign manufacturers choosing the United States for their next major investment. <br> At our company, we just announced a $550 million rail-yard construction project in Texas, the largest capital investment in a single facility in Union Pacific’s 155-year history. While this rail yard was under consideration for some time, we expect the project to benefit from growth enabled by tax reform. <br> Clearly, our economy is on the rise, and tax reform will help generate even more momentum. But America’s potential exit from the North American Free Trade Agreement threatens to undo much of that progress. <br> Exiting NAFTA would mean increasing tariffs, which would increase costs for consumers and businesses. About 60 percent of U.S. imports are intermediate goods for U.S. production, so raising costs through what will be functionally higher taxes on production would make U.S. businesses less competitive — thwarting tax reform’s goal of allowing people and businesses to invest their money as they see fit. <br> Many of the same executives who are excited about the economic benefits of the tax cuts are facing equal, if not greater, economic losses if NAFTA is eliminated. Their companies compete where the demand is, and 95 percent of the world’s population lives outside of the United States. <br> In the future, booming middle classes, particularly in emerging markets, will be increasingly important consumers of U.S. exports, including agricultural products, services and manufactured goods. Many crops, including wheat and almonds, see more than half their volumes sold abroad. Other exports, such as plastics, commercial aircraft, industrial equipment and resins, are goods that the United States produces in greater volumes than we consume. <br> At Union Pacific, we see this trend firsthand, as nearly 40 percent of our shipments now have an international component — coming from or headed to Canada, Mexico, Asia, Europe and beyond. The business leaders I’ve spoken with understand that global trade will continue with or without the United States, and they are concerned that America could fall behind as other countries strike trade agreements of their own. In October, Mexico reached an agreement to import wheat from Argentina. To the extent Mexican consumers shift their consumption to Argentina, the price of wheat in America’s breadbasket will go down. <br> More recently, the remaining 11 nations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership announced that they had decided to press ahead, despite the U.S. decision to withdraw from the deal, by formally agreeing to a new pact. <br> In this increasingly competitive environment, it will be critical for the United States to strengthen its most important trade partnerships, not abandon them. While NAFTA does require modernization, the United States should back away from pushing positions that are functionally “poison pills” that would kill it. To take one example, the United States is seeking a “sunset” clause that would automatically terminate NAFTA after five years unless all three countries agreed to continue. This would cause significant uncertainty for long-term business planning and investment. A more straightforward alternative would be to replace the sunset clause with a negotiation clause, under which any of the three countries could choose to prompt a negotiation of specific NAFTA issues after a reasonable period. <br> The United States has also taken aim at NAFTA’s dispute-settlement process, which allows investors of one NAFTA country to bring claims directly against a government in the pact before an international arbitration tribunal. But scrapping or otherwise undermining the process would raise questions globally about America’s commitment to due-process principles. Instead, we should focus on mending, not ending, the dispute-settlement process so investors in the United States, Canada and Mexico have a clear path to protecting their investments. <br> The U.S. economy is humming, and the recent tax legislation is clearly a strong tail wind for future growth and expansion. Let’s not ruin the momentum by abandoning NAFTA. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Don’t end NAFTA. Mend it. <br> Robert J.

 Tax “reform,” starting with taxes on business, seems to be on everyone’s agenda, and it may be a place where the incoming Trump administration and its Democratic critics find common ground. But it’s still going to be a slog, and one reason is so-called pass-through businesses whose taxes are levied at personal income tax rates. <br> When we think of business, the image that usually pops to mind is of the giant corporation: Google, General Motors, Procter Gamble and their ilk. To be sure, these massive enterprises (known as “C” corporations) seem to dominate the business landscape and have their own tax rules, with a top federal rate of 35 percent. <br> But behind the gigantic companies lie millions of smaller firms that aren’t C corporations. Their profits are “passed through” to the owners’ personal tax forms, where their business income is taxed at personal tax rates. The top federal rate is 43.4 percent, but the inclusion of state taxes can push that above 50 percent. <br> Given the popularity of pass-through firms, they will likely play a big role in the tax debate. It also seems likely that they’ll push for lower taxes. This could be a major stumbling block, because (of course) tax cuts for pass-through firms will require spending cuts, tax increases on big C corporations or larger budget deficits. <br> How many pass-through firms are there, and what’s their economic effect? You can be excused if you underestimate their impact. I certainly did. But a new report from the Tax Foundation, a think tank, dispels any notion that pass-through firms play a minor role in the economy. <br> Here are some findings from the report: <br> ● More than 90 percent of businesses in America are pass-through enterprises. In 2014, that was 28.3 million out of 30.8 million business establishments. <br> ● Pass-through firms account for more than half of U.S. private-sector employment. In 2014, the number of workers at these firms totaled 73 million, compared with 54 million at C corporations. <br> ●The total profits of pass-through firms have surpassed the profits of C corporations. In 2012, the net income was $1.6 trillion for pass-through firms and $1.1 trillion for C corporations. <br> Pass-through businesses come in three varieties: sole proprietorships (firms with one owner); partnerships; and “S” corporations, which are corporations receiving pass-through tax treatment. <br> Their number has grown rapidly. In 1980, the Tax Foundation reports, there were more C corporation tax returns filed than the combined total of sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations. By 2012, the number of pass-through returns was more than four times greater than the returns from C corporations. <br> It’s not entirely clear what explains this surge. One cause was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered the top personal rate to 28 percent from 50 percent; that created a powerful incentive for firms to adopt pass-through status, especially with a higher top tax rate for C corporations. <br> But as personal tax rates have been raised, this incentive weakened. The top personal and business rates are now near or above 50 percent, including state taxes. (The top federal corporate rate is 35 percent; but there are also taxes on dividends and capital gains, with a top tax rate of 23.8 percent.) <br> Another explanation for the popularity of pass-through status is the spread of limited-liability company laws in states, which allow firms to curtail damages in case they’re sued, says the Tax Foundation’s Scott Greenberg. Rather than facing two types of taxation — corporate and personal — business owners may simplify by choosing personal tax rates. <br> Whatever the explanation, the many pass-through taxpayers loom over the impending tax reform debate. Interestingly, the Tax Foundation suggests that the pass-through treatment should remain because it doesn’t discriminate against labor income. It is “difficult to justify why income from pass-through businesses should be subject to lower tax rates than income from wages and salaries,” the report says. <br> No way will this be easy — and it’s not clear that overhauling business and personal taxes separately will make it any easier. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s proposed tax ‘reform’ is hardly reform at all <br> The Post’s View: The GOP’s radical tax plan <br> Lawrence Summers: Trump and Ryan are right to tackle corporate taxes.

 My family just saw evidence of the Republicans’ recent tax reform in the reduction of my 2018 federal withholding. I immediately called our grandchildren to thank them for their sacrifice. <br> Frank DeGrace, Bowie 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IN THE early days of the Trump administration, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway ran afoul of ethics rules when she urged the president’s supporters to buy products under his daughter’s brand. The White House said she was being provided with additional ethics training and recurrence was “highly unlikely.” Some thought stronger disciplinary action should have been taken, but at least there was some acknowledgment of wrongdoing and an implied promise to do better. <br> Unfortunately, it’s not clear the training did much good, as the Office of Special Counsel made clear recently in finding Ms. Conway in violation of federal law barring the mixing of partisan politics with official government business. More troubling than the latest violation was the White House’s refusal to do anything about it or even acknowledge it. <br> In a letter to President Trump, Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner reported that Ms. Conway twice violated the Hatch Act in the lead-up to Alabama’s 2017 special Senate election. Federal employees are prohibited from using their official authority or influence to affect the outcome of an election; partisan remarks are permitted only when federal employees are speaking in their personal capacity. <br> At issue were two television interviews in which Ms. Conway appeared in her official capacity and expressed political views about Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore. “Folks, don’t be fooled,” she said on Fox News of Mr. Jones. “He’ll be a vote against tax cuts. He’s weak on crime, weak on borders. He’s strong on raising your taxes. He’s terrible for property owners.” Somehow — and with a straight face — the White House tried to argue that such language (on CNN, she said Mr. Jones was “against national security,” “against life” and “out of step for Alabama voters”) was not advocating for or against the election of any particular candidate. <br> Keep in mind that her unprompted harangue on Fox News about Mr. Jones, who subsequently won the election, came in response to a question about tax reform and Democratic opposition. Also keep in mind that she had received regular and repeated Hatch Act training and guidance. Contrast her case with those of two officials in the Obama administration — former Cabinet secretaries Kathleen Sebelius and Julian Castro — who were found to have violated the Hatch Act. Both cooperated with the special counsel, explained they didn’t intend to break the law but admitted their errors and promised to be more careful in the future (which they were). <br> Once again we need to remind ourselves: Thumbing your nose at the rule of law is not normal, and it is not okay. <br> Read more: <br> Walter Shaub: Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act.

 Lawrence Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. <br> Just as Ronald Reagan’s landmark 1986 bipartisan tax reform increased simplicity, fairness and economic efficiency by broadening the tax base and reducing rates, today tax reform has the potential to help American families and the economy. Properly designed, revenue-neutral reforms could help to offset the dramatic increases in inequality that have taken place over a generation, repair a business tax system that globalization has rendered dysfunctional, reduce uncertainty and promote growth.  <br> Unfortunately, what we know regarding the intentions of the president-elect and congressional leadership suggest that they are at risk of pushing through the most misguided set of tax changes in U.S. history. The proposals from the presidential campaign, reiterated last week by President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for treasury secretary, will massively favor the top 1 percent of income earners, threaten explosive growth in federal debt, complicate the tax code and do little if anything to spur growth.  <br> A core principle agreed to by all in 1986 was that tax reform would not reduce the tax burden on high-income taxpayers. Reagan achieved this objective while reducing top marginal rates because he raised capital-gains rates, scaled back investment incentives, increased corporate tax collections, curtailed shelters, and left estate and gift taxes alone. Unfortunately, neither the Trump plan, nor the one put forward by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), provides for nearly enough base-broadening to finance all the high-end tax-cutting they include.   <br> Treasury secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin asserts there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class because deductions would be scaled back. The rub is that totally eliminating all deductions (including charity, which has not been proposed and would be politically infeasible) for those with incomes over $1 million would not even raise enough revenue to cover reducing their marginal tax rates from 39 percent to 33 percent, let alone offset huge rate reductions on business and corporate income, revocation of the Affordable Care Act’s Medicare surtax and the elimination of estate and gift taxes.  <br> That is why estimates of the Trump plan suggest that it will raise the average after-tax income of the 0.9 percent of the population with incomes greater than $1 million by 14 percent, or more than $215,000. This contrasts with proposed tax cuts for those in the middle of the income distribution of $1,000, or about 2 percent.  <br> The repeal of estate and gift taxes is especially problematic because it would provide a window for the very rich to use gift and trust structures to ensure that their wealth passes without tax not just to their children but to their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, no matter what is done in subsequent legislation.  <br> The Reagan tax reform simplified the code by eliminating the need for rules distinguishing ordinary and capital-gains income, because these were taxed at the same rate, and by doing away with industry-specific shelter provisions. In contrast, the Trump proposal creates sheltering opportunities by reducing to 15 percent the tax rate on any income that can be characterized as coming from an incorporated entity. Rather than reducing targeted subsidies, it would establish a highly dubious 82 percent credit — the highest in the world — for financial equity investments in infrastructure.   <br> This all would mean not only disproportionate tax reductions for the upper-income group that has seen its incomes rise most rapidly over the past generation. It would also mean grave damage to federal budget projections. The Trump tax cut as currently envisioned is about the same size relative to the economy as the 1981 Reagan tax cut. It’s worth remembering that Reagan, hardly a fan of reversing course or raising taxes, found it necessary to propose significant tax increases in 1982 and 1984 (the equivalent in today’s economy of $3.5 trillion over a decade) because of concerns about federal debt.  <br> Today’s budget situation is much more worrisome than the one Reagan faced. The baseline involves much higher levels of debt and deficits. The economy was suffering from a deep recession then but approaches full employment now. If extreme tax cuts are legislated in the next months, uncertainty both about the federal budget and about further tax adjustments is likely to rise.  <br> Finally, I can find no basis in either economic history or logic for Mnuchin’s claim that the proposed reforms would increase the economy’s growth rate from its current 2 percent rate to the historical 3 to 4 percent norm. Adult population growth has slowed by nearly a percentage point, the gains generated by more women entering the workforce have been exhausted, and it’s far from clear why tax reform will hugely spur productivity growth.   <br> Indeed, because the Trump proposal would redistribute after-tax income toward those most likely to save it, push up long-term interest rates because of debt pressures, increase uncertainty and, in many circumstances, increase the advantages of overseas production, it is as likely to retard growth as to accelerate it.  <br> In the 1980s, Treasury Secretary Don Regan said the first Reagan reform proposal was written on a word processor to signal the administration’s openness to negotiation and radical alteration. We should all hope the Trump administration follows Reagan’s approach on both tax policy principles and a commitment to bipartisan negotiation. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s proposed tax ‘reform’ is hardly reform at all <br> Fareed Zakaria: How Trump exposed the corruption in the U.S. tax code <br> Robert J.

 THE PRINCIPLES of tax reform, individual or corporate, are clear: Congress should improve efficiency by levying lower rates on a broader base of income; that is, with a minimum of incentive-distorting loopholes and deductions. Reform should encourage economic growth but mitigate income and wealth inequality. The resulting revenue should enable the federal government to meet public needs without adding to the national debt. <br> The last time the political stars aligned to produce such legislation was 1986. The tax code has accumulated new inefficiencies and irrationalities since, notwithstanding many reform proposals by Republicans, Democrats and even some bipartisan coalitions over the years. Now the GOP sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress may set the stage for the most extensive rewrite of taxation since then — one that, unlike the 30-years-ago version, which was bipartisan, the Republican Party will dominate. <br> President-elect Donald Trump and his team are sending mixed signals. During the campaign, he put forward an irresponsible plan to slash revenue by an estimated $620 billion per year (roughly 19 percent of fiscal 2015 receipts) over 10 years, with no credible offset in the form of spending cuts. Meanwhile, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would experience an average tax cut of nearly $1.1 million, while households in the middle fifth of the income distribution would receive an average tax cut of $1,010, according to the Tax Policy Center . On Wednesday, however, Mr. Trump’s choice for secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, spoke reassuringly, but cryptically, of middle-class relief with “no absolute tax cut for the upper class.” Rate cuts for the rich could be offset by eliminating itemized deductions, such as the break for mortgage interest or state and local taxes, Mr. Mnuchin said, though most experts say that won’t actually work for the rates Mr. Trump proposed. <br> Possibly the Trump camp is moving toward the somewhat more plausible blueprint laid out by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) in June. It would reduce federal revenue by a mere $3.1 trillion over 10 years, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. This is better than Mr. Trump’s plan, but still hardly fiscally responsible absent big spending cuts to federal programs — which the GOP also proposes, but which are notoriously harder to pass than tax cuts. Meanwhile, most of the House GOP plan’s benefits would accrue to the well-to-do, in part because the plan eliminates what’s left of the estate tax, one of federal law’s few modest restraints on wealth inequality. <br> Recently, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), said he wants reform to be revenue neutral, albeit as measured by “dynamic scoring,” i.e., accounting for revenue due to projected economic growth. That, too, was a welcome note of relative moderation — but even under fairly robust dynamic scoring, the House GOP plan still costs the government $2.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center. <br> Come 2017, a Republican president and Congress could use their powers to rewrite the tax code in accordance with the standard set in 1986. For now, they seem bent on cutting taxes massively for those who least need the help — at the risk of greater debt, cuts in vital services or both. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Rachel Greszler: Social Security needs to return to its anti-poverty roots <br> The Post’s View: Europe’s cash grab from Apple makes corporate tax reform more urgent <br> Maya MacGuineas: The first step towards solving the debt crisis: Stop digging <br> George F.

 Lawrence H. Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Barack Obama from 2009 through 2010. <br> One of the many surprising aspects of financial market performance since the start of 2017 has been the weak performance of the dollar, which has fallen by close to 10 percent on a trade-weighted basis and by about 17 percent against the euro. <br> This has occurred despite a variety of factors that might have been expected to push the dollar up. These include upward revisions in economic forecasts, expectation of monetary tightening, rising real and nominal long-term interest rates, fiscal stimulus on a huge scale in a full-employment economy, rising protectionism that should choke off import flows and tax reform directed at reducing capital outflows and increasing capital inflows. <br> It is instructive to consider what the combination of interest rates and current exchange rates says about market expectations of future currency values. U.S. 10-year interest rates are about 220 basis points above German rates and about 280 basis points above Japanese rates. This implies that markets expect depreciation of the dollar by more than 25 percent against its major competitors over the next decade. If dollar depreciation of this magnitude were not expected, investors would prefer dollar assets to foreign assets, given the interest-rate differentials. <br> Some, but probably less than half, of the dollar’s weakness can be explained by higher-than-expected inflation in the United States. Real interest rates imply an expectation of continuing real depreciation. <br> Given the movements in interest rates over the past year, along with the dollar’s fall, it is reasonable to estimate that 10-year expectations of exchange rates of the dollar against the euro have fallen by perhaps 15 percent. Information on real yields suggests that much of this move reflects expected declines in real exchange rates. <br> Exchange rates are relative prices, and to understand dollar fluctuations one has to look at what has happened in the United States as well as in other countries. It is true that improvements in the U.S. economic outlook have been smaller than those in Europe and a number of other countries. To the extent that dollar weakness reflects disproportionate improvement abroad, it undercuts claims that U.S. policy is the reason for recent strong performance, given that Donald Trump is not president of the whole world. <br> But this is only a partial explanation. If it were the dominant story, one would expect to see rates in other countries rise more than in the United States as they experienced larger increases in demand for investment funds. This has not happened for the most part. For example, both U.S. real and nominal rates have risen relative to European rates. Put differently, expected future exchange rates have declined more than current rates. The dollar’s weakness has also been pervasive against Canada and Mexico, which have not had growth surprises. <br> The pattern of higher interest rates and a weakening currency suggests that on multiple dimensions, U.S. assets have to be put on sale at bargain prices to persuade foreigners to hold them or to induce Americans not to diversify into overseas assets. This pattern is relatively uncommon in the United States, though it happened during the Carter administration before Paul Volcker’s appointment as chair of the Federal Reserve and during the Clinton administration before Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin’s invocation of the “strong dollar” policy. It is fairly ubiquitous in emerging markets, where it reflects anxiety over a country’s policy framework. <br> I fear such anxiety may be emerging in the United States. President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin show their ambivalence about a strong currency. Washington consciously pushes budget deficits way up in a full-employment economy. Questions have arisen with respect to the Fed’s independence, the United States’ traditional receptivity to foreign investment and its willingness to lash out at holders of dollar assets. <br> These concerns are greatly magnified by the decision last week to impose across-the-board tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The decision to invoke national security trade protections over the objection of the defense secretary raises questions about the coherence of policy processes. The fact that declines in the aggregate U.S. stock markets were about 100 times as much as the gains for steel and aluminum companies illustrates that because the steel-using sector dwarfs the steel-producing sector, the net effect of the tariff policy is to reduce U.S. competitiveness even before considering foreign retaliation. And then there is the risk that a president who likes trade wars will have more of them. <br> The confidence of global markets is much easier to maintain than to regain. Currency markets are sending a signal that the United States is not on a healthy path. Its time for the United States to strengthen the strong fundamentals on which a strong dollar and healthy economy depend. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Robert J.

 David Saperstein, director emeritus of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, is an ordained rabbi who served as U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom from 2015 to 2017. Amanda Tyler is the executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. <br> At the National Prayer Breakfast a little more than a year ago, President Trump vowed to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment, a federal law prohibiting houses of worship, charitable nonprofits and private foundations from endorsing, opposing or financially supporting political candidates and parties. Fortunately for religious congregations — and the entire charitable sector — he has not yet fulfilled his promise. <br> Trump’s failure to eliminate the Johnson Amendment is not for lack of will. Members of Congress pursued similar goals to the president, attempting to include language that would weaken the law as part of the tax reform bill, but that effort ultimately failed. And at one point, Trump described his goal of eliminating the prohibition on election activity as potentially his “greatest contribution to Christianity — and other religions.” <br> We, along with thousands of other religious leaders and more than 100 religious denominations and organizations, vehemently disagree. Considering the Pew Research Center tells us that roughly three-fourths of the world’s population lives in nations with serious restrictions on religious freedom, we are confident the president can find far more effective ways to enhance our nation’s religious-freedom efforts. <br> Clergy and congregants worry that changing the law would have a divisive impact on their faith communities. Our houses of worship are among the few places that people of different cultural, political and ethnic backgrounds can find the sense of unity and comity so desperately needed in our nation today. There are enough differences over theology, music, liturgy and clergy without importing America’s partisan electoral divides into our pews. These concerns cut across all religious groups and political persuasions, as public surveys have shown, with overwhelming opposition to changing the law to allow taxpayer-subsidized political ads from the pulpit. <br> We both come from traditions with a long history of prophetic witnesses speaking truth to power. Religious leaders have been able to speak with moral authority on the great issues of their day precisely because they have operated independently from government and its officials. <br> We don’t believe the claims that changing the law is required by free-speech or religious-liberty principles. We have devoted our careers to defending religious freedom for all and see this debate as one of tax policy, not First Amendment rights. Under current rules, clergy can speak on political and moral issues as they see fit, even during election season. In a personal capacity, without the use of church dollars, clergy have the same rights as anyone else to endorse or oppose candidates or parties — and even to run and hold public office. What they cannot do is engage in partisan election activity using a government subsidy in the form of tax exemptions and tax-deductible contributions for their houses of worship. <br> Allowing partisan political activity by tax-exempt houses of worship goes far beyond a single sermon. Imagine that in every sermon for the six months leading up to the election, a pastor endorsed various candidates and reiterated those endorsements. Suppose in every regular bulletin or email over those six months, the pastor or church leaders focused on endorsements. Nothing would stop a church, synagogue or mosque from using its volunteers to phone-bank or canvass for an endorsed candidate or pass the plate for political contributions at the same time it accepted tithes and offerings. <br> These scenarios are not hyperbolic hypotheticals. Abolishing the Johnson Amendment, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimate of the recent tax bill, would result in billions of dollars in nontransparent, anonymous political campaign spending redirected to 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of worship, to take advantage of the tax-deductibility of such donations and the exemption for houses of worship from reporting their donors. <br> There is tragic irony in Johnson Amendment opponents’ claims to want to limit the power of the Internal Revenue Service to interfere with the religious affairs of houses of worship. With the current total prohibition in place, the IRS has rarely acted against a church for electioneering. But a new permissive standard, specifically the language that lawmakers attempted to add to the tax bill, would have given the IRS a mandate to interpret undefined terms such as “ordinary course,” “de minimis” and “incremental.” If the law is changed and the IRS has the resources and the will to enforce the law, we could see troubling entanglement of the IRS in a church’s religious and financial affairs. <br> It’s easy to see why politicians think they will win by accumulating additional endorsements and contributions, particularly from religious institutions held in high regard by communities. But houses of worship and those who rely on them know they have too much to lose to throw their good name behind a particular party or candidate and allow their coffers to become political slush funds. <br> Trump will return to the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, and he may take the opportunity to double down on his fight against the Johnson Amendment. He should instead reverse course and stop politicizing religion. <br> Read more: <br> The Post’s View: Trump is wrong. Pulpit freedom already exists. <br> Richard W.

 APPLE DID not remove the headphone jack from its new iPhone 7 as a protest against the European Commission’s decision ordering Ireland to charge the U.S. tech company $14.5 billion in back taxes. Still, Apple is mighty aggrieved at the E.C., and it has a point. <br> No doubt the Irish government “ruling” that let Apple pay almost no corporate tax on billions of dollars in worldwide profits assigned to its relatively small Irish subsidiary enhanced Apple’s incentive to book those proceeds outside the United States. However, it was perfectly legal under prevailing European doctrine governing such matters. As the U.S. Treasury Department pointed out in a white paper shortly before the Aug. 30 decision, Europe’s authorities are trying to grab Apple’s money — and shut down Ireland’s tax haven — by inappropriately invoking a different set of rules designed to control anti-competitive government subsidies. <br> That said, the E.C. may have done Apple and the United States a favor by demonstrating that the industrialized world’s patchwork of corporate taxation is getting unsustainable — and that the United States and U.S. companies may have the most to lose from procrastinating reform. Apple is but one of several U.S.-based global tech and pharmaceutical companies that beat the highest-in-the-world U.S. corporate rate of 35 percent by assigning intellectual property rights or profits to lower-rate jurisdictions overseas. (Full disclosure: Amazon, controlled by Post owner Jeffrey P. Bezos, is facing an E.C. investigation similar to the one against Apple.) The firms pay no U.S. tax on foreign profits until they’re repatriated, at which point the firms get a tax credit for what they paid abroad. <br> Indeed, if Apple does have to pay Ireland as the E.C. demands, Apple’s future obligations to the U.S. treasury may be reduced accordingly, a significant revenue loss that helps explain why the Treasury Department has taken the company’s side in the dispute. This byzantine situation undermines not only U.S. tax efficiency but also U.S. tax fairness: American companies whose business models do not create opportunities to play the overseas taxation game get stuck with a disproportionate share of the tab for government services that benefit the corporate sector as a whole. And that’s not to mention hard-pressed individual taxpayers. <br> Corporate tax reform in the United States is essential not only to U.S. prosperity, but also to the smooth functioning of the global economy. It’s worthy of far more detailed and sophisticated discussion than it has gotten in Campaign 2016 so far. Donald Trump would lower the top corporate rate to 15 percent, eliminating incentives to stash money abroad — at the cost of irresponsibly gutting U.S. revenue, offset only by a 10 percent, one-time tax on money companies would bring back. For her part, Hillary Clinton has said she would beef up current Obama administration rules against corporate “inversions,” a different but related tax dodge, and use an unspecified one-time tax on repatriated profits to help fund infrastructure. Meanwhile, Europe is laying claim to the money. <br> Read more: <br> Charles Krauthammer: Lower corporate tax rates.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> HATE THE Internal Revenue Service? Worried that you won’t be able to fill out your returns correctly under the new tax law? Do not take it out on the poor IRS employee who could not answer your tax question, even after you spent a half-hour on hold. Blame the GOP-led Congress, which, in its anti-IRS fervor, has driven the agency into the ground. <br> It has become one of the most reliable traditions in contemporary Washington: Every year, the national taxpayer advocate explains that under-funding the IRS makes the tax filing process unnecessarily miserable for those who follow the law, while rewarding those who flout it. And every year, the Republican-led Congress decides to keep the tax system unnecessarily miserable for the law-abiding and easier on the lawbreakers. <br> “Funding cuts have rendered the IRS unable to provide acceptable levels of taxpayer service, unable to upgrade its technology to improve its efficiency and effectiveness, and unable to maintain compliance programs,” national taxpayer advocate Nina E. Olson wrote in her annual report to lawmakers. “It cannot answer the phone calls it currently receives, much less the phone calls it can expect to receive in light of tax reform, without adequate funding.” <br> Indeed, the new tax law could prompt a wave of confusion that the IRS is ill-prepared to handle. The agency estimates it needs about $500 million just to change computer programs, update forms, write new regulations and answer questions stemming from the bill. After the 1986 tax reform, agency call volume spiked, and the number of returns that required corrections also ticked up, and it is fair to expect the same now. <br> Though the IRS has tried to improve its phone service recently, even before the tax law passed it anticipated that fewer than half of callers would obtain help from a live person this year. Given the complexity of the new law, many people will have questions that are more than basic. “Taxpayers who want to learn about how the tax law affects them are left searching about 140,000 web pages on IRS.gov or turning to paid professionals,” Ms. Olson wrote. <br> While the taxpayer advocate argued that the IRS could do more with less, there is no doubt that underfunding is a key driver of the dysfunction. Congress has cut the agency’s budget by some $300 million since 2009, a bit under 3 percent. During that time, lawmakers have saddled the IRS with responsibility to oversee the phase-in of a new health-care law and, now, a major tax overhaul. <br> Can’t the IRS — and the Americans it is supposed to serve — just cope? “On the surface, it appears ‘customers’ (taxpayers) don’t have a choice about seeking another tax agency to work with — there are no competitors to which they can move their ‘business,’ ” Ms. Olson wrote. “In fact, however, there is a competitor, and it is the lure of noncompliance. If the IRS isn’t going to provide you the assistance you need in the manner you need it, then why bother complying with the tax laws?” <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Trump plans to reward tax cheats <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump’s gift to Americans: Making it easier to cheat on their taxes <br> Helaine Olen: Trump and the GOP are rigging our tax system for the rich.

 Mollie Ziegler Hemingway is a senior editor at the Federalist. <br> This may seem like an odd moment for saying so, but a year into the presidency of Donald Trump, I’m elated. <br> Trump was not my first or even second choice for president, but a full two years ago I predicted he would win. I also predicted he’d be a progressive president, which explained why I was not among his supporters and why I am so pleased now. <br> Expecting Progressive Trump was a reasonable assumption. Trump supported the 2009 stimulus, the auto bailouts and the bank bailouts. He’d recently left the Democratic Party and had raised a ton of money for the Clintons, Nancy Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer. He’d supported single-payer health coverage, tax increases and even Planned Parenthood. <br> He was a New York liberal who had conquered the Republican Party in part by promising a good Supreme Court nomination. That was the most I allowed myself to hope for when he won. <br> The nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch to fill the vacancy of Antonin Scalia more than fulfilled that promise. Gorsuch isn’t a John Roberts, David Souter or Anthony Kennedy, to name three disappointing justices appointed by the three previous Republican presidents, but a brilliant legal mind with tremendous writing ability and persuasive powers. <br> Trump critics, particularly those on the right, like to mock Trump voters with the phrase “But Gorsuch!” It’s their way of saying that Gorsuch is the only good thing Trump has done and that a Trump presidency is not worth the rest. Except Gorsuch is not even close to the only good thing Trump has done. <br> He has appointed 12 outstanding federal appellate judges — a record number for a president in his first year. By comparison, President Barack Obama had only three in his first year. <br> In early June, Trump announced the U.S. departure from the Paris climate accord, an agreement that would have had virtually no impact on future temperatures but would have come at a large cost in the growth of government and control over the economy. Since Obama never ran the treaty through the Senate, it was nonbinding, but the federal bureaucracy was working to implement it with new regulations on U.S. businesses. Critics on the right say Trump just does what other Republican candidates would have done. Yet the previous Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, lobbied Trump to stay in the global agreement. <br> The Clean Power Plan, which gave the Environmental Protection Agency unprecedented authority over states and businesses and was on track to be the most expensive regulation in history, is under review. For the 2017 fiscal year, Trump revoked 22 regulations for each new regulation that was issued. His chief regulatory officer, Neomi Rao, said the administration would continue the pace of deregulation through 2018, announcing 448 deregulatory actions and 131 regulatory actions. <br> It took a while for Capitol Hill to get used to working with Trump, but by the end of the year, lawmakers had passed the largest corporate tax reform in U.S. history and secured tax cuts for the vast majority of Americans. <br> Businesses are responding to the deregulation and historic corporate tax reform by loosening purse strings and investing in plants, equipment and factories. Pepco, a power utility that serves the Mid-Atlantic region, just announced it’s lowering everyone’s electric bills as a result of the savings from corporate tax reform. <br> Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is restoring due process to college campuses by rescinding Obama-era guidelines that made the mistake of encouraging college administrators to adjudicate serious crimes such as sexual assaults. <br> Trump’s foreign policy could be more restrained, but it’s far less interventionist than that of any of his recent predecessors, focused on national interest over nation-building or other less pressing and more expensive concerns. By trusting his military leaders to make quick decisions on the battlefield, in contrast to Obama’s desire to placate Iran and micromanage trivial moves such as helicopter deployments, Trump is crushing the Islamic State. Sanctions and other nonmilitary efforts are being used to keep North Korea at bay after the failure of denuclearization as practiced by presidents since Bill Clinton. <br> Trump is not normal, his critics keep saying. Sometimes that’s a plus. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel more than two decades after the Senate passed legislation requiring it, and after two decades of presidents signing waivers every six months to avoid it. More recently, he froze funding for Pakistan until it stops harboring terrorists. <br> Like most people, I don’t particularly like Trump’s rhetorical style, juvenile insults and intemperate disposition — on full display in recent days. At the same time, having followed his career for decades, I am not surprised that he wakes up each morning as Donald Trump. <br> And that boorish attitude has come in handy after decades of media bullying of conservatives. Ironically, the very lack of conservative bona fides that worried me two years ago means he’s less beholden to a conservative establishment that had grown alienated from the people it is supposed to serve and from the principles it ostensibly exists to promote. His surprising conservatism might also be the result of the absolutism and extremism of his critics, whether among the media, traditional Democratic activists or the anti-Trump right. If Trump were ever inclined to indulge his liberal tendencies after winning the election, the stridency and spite of his opponents have provided him with no incentives to do so. <br> My expectations were low — so low that he could have met them by simply not being President Hillary Clinton. But a year into this presidency, he’s exceeded those expectations by quite a bit. I’m thrilled. <br> Read more: <br> Marc A.

 The Feb. 21 editorial on the Commerce Department’s Section 232 investigation into steel and aluminum imports, “A cure way worse than the disease,” was largely spot on. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s recommendations will almost certainly do more harm than good, particularly to the small businesses and consumers the president has thus far supported. <br> Imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would increase costs for all U.S. industries using these metals, and those higher costs would hit workers and consumers. Most of the businesses that would suffer under these actions are small and midsize manufacturing firms. Consider that among U.S. manufacturers, 74.6 percent have fewer than 20 employees, 93.5 percent fewer than 100, and 98.5 percent fewer than 500. Ironically, the proposed tariffs and quotas would also weaken these same businesses’ relative position in the global economy, directly contradicting the president’s own rationale for imposing them. <br> A recent CNBC survey showed that confidence among small-business owners is reaching new highs in the wake of this administration’s business tax- reform efforts. President Trump should reject these proposed tariffs and quotas that would undermine the progress he has made toward creating a pro-investment and pro-growth environment in the United States.   <br> Raymond J. Keating, Vienna <br> The writer is chief economist of the Small Business Entrepreneurship Council. 
 At the 100-day mark of President Trump’s administration, Republicans and conservatives hoping for a successful tenure could point to a new Supreme Court justice, a rollback of the last sprint of Team Obama’s regulatory zeal, a fusillade of cruise missiles sending a message to Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and the beginnings of repeal of anti-free-market rules at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. <br> The more die-hard #NeverTrumpers delighted in tweeting a picture of a green street sign standing barely above cresting floodwaters, reading “Gorsuch.” It was a joke that never got old for those who had gotten famous hating Trump. <br> The more serious conservatives who have been at it in and out of government for decades but were not part of Team Trump resolved to wait it out, call balls and strikes, and hope for the best while discouraging the worst. Now as Day 400 approaches, the picture is much better than at Day 100. <br> “2017 was the best year for conservatives in the 30 years that I’ve been here,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said recently. “The best year,” he continued, “on all fronts.” McConnell can be forgiven for forgetting that 1989 saw the collapse of the Berlin Wall, but that year aside, he’s right. To review: <br> Business and consumer confidence is peaking at home, boosted by the massive tax cut and long-overdue tax reform that included significant simplification. The real results of this bill are appearing in paychecks and pay and benefit increases across the country. <br> Sen. Tom Cotton’s (R-Ark.) addition to the tax bill repealed the worst part of Obamacare, the individual mandate. Now the bipartisan spending bill has shuttered the Independent Payment Advisory Board while postponing or repealing some of Obamacare’s most destructive tax features. The old law is effectively gutted. <br> The United States is out of the one-sided Paris accord while open to steps toward genuine protection of the climate. The EPA is refining its rulemaking process in ways that rule-of-law conservatives hope will conform the agency’s new rules to the designs and ends Congress intended for them, reversing the warped power grabs of the administrative state they had become. <br> More than a dozen superb originalist conservatives have been confirmed to lifetime appointments on the federal courts of appeals. Religious liberty is being defended before the Supreme Court and in regulations across the government. The absurd “blue slip” rule, which let senators hold up qualified nominees to federal appeals courts without reason, has been effectively done away with. <br> Pentagon funding has returned to a sane-if-still-too-slow trajectory upward, with the sequester broken as well as the absurd dollar-for-dollar rule on spending hikes for the military matched equally on spending hikes for domestic programs. In the field, Trump has let the U.S. military change the rules of engagement with the Islamic State. All but a tiny slice of the physical caliphate has been destroyed. <br> The United States has recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and has abandoned “strategic patience” with the vast prison camp otherwise known as North Korea. A new National Security Strategy, a new National Defense Strategy and a new Nuclear Posture Review have been completed and will combine into a coherent framework for the nation’s defense that includes respect for allies and notice to Iran that the Islamic republic is out of compliance with the nuclear “framework.” <br> The president’s speeches last year in Riyadh and Warsaw and this year at Davos clearly and succinctly laid out America’s demands on the world and its commitments to freedom. This trio of speeches matters as much as any three given abroad since President Ronald Reagan’s challenges to Europe and the Soviet Union. <br> So the president, McConnell, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and their teams are smiling about their legislative achievements even as they confront the opioid epidemic and yet another school massacre. They should be. November will offer a clear choice of growth, freedom, clarity and security or a return to the Obama-Pelosi-Reid years. With some luck there might even be a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people in the country illegally and more border security if bipartisanship wins out after the failed first effort. But regardless, if one is fair, one cannot ignore the president’s accomplishments. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 President Trump raised eyebrows when he invited Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp to fly with him aboard Air Force One for a tax-reform rally in her home state of North Dakota earlier this year. For a vulnerable Democrat running for reelection in a deep-red state that Trump won by 36 points, appearing with the president was a political gift. Trump called Heitkamp up on stage, shook her hand and heaped praise on her, describing her as a “good woman” — the perfect visuals for campaign ads portraying her as a moderate willing to defy the “Resistance” and work with the president. <br> The move puzzled Republicans, who wondered why Trump was giving a boost to one of their principal targets in the 2018 midterm elections. But then came the moment that Heitkamp must now regret. As he made his case for the tax bill, Trump turned to her and said, “Are you listening, Heidi?” And then he added this blunt message: “Do your job to deliver for America or find a new job.” <br> Heitkamp did not deliver, nor did the four other Senate Democrats running for reelection in states Trump won by double digits: Joe Manchin III of West Virginia (a state Trump won by 42 points), Jon Tester of Montana (by 20), Claire McCaskill of Missouri (by 19) and Joe Donnelly of Indiana (by 19). Now it’s time for Trump to make good on that threat. <br> With Trump’s national approval rating averaging at just 38.5 percent — among the worst of any president in the first year after his election — some might suggest that he is in no position to impose political costs on his opponents. But his approval rating is between 50 and 60 percent in the five states where these vulnerable Democrats are running (except in Indiana, where it is 41 percent), making him a formidable adversary. <br> Trump should spend the coming weeks and months holding nonstop rallies in every one of these states to promote his tax reforms and how they will benefit ordinary Americans. He should tour companies that are using their savings from the corporate tax cuts to hire more workers, and businesses who are investing in new plants and equipment because the tax bill now allows them to write off those investments. He should visit small businesses who will benefit from the lower pass-through tax rate, so they can explain what it will mean to their workers. And he should hold town halls with middle-income families who will benefit from the individual rate cuts in the bill, so they can share what an extra thousand dollars in their pockets every year will mean to their families. <br> In each case, he should demand to know why their senator voted against the bill that made these things possible. <br> Heitkamp explained in a statement that she voted against the tax bill because, among other complaints, “middle income families lose out in the long-term because the relatively modest tax cuts they initially receive will expire after 2025.” This is patently dishonest. Everyone knows the tax cuts for middle-income families won’t ever expire. Even if Democrats are in power eight years from now, there is no way they won’t extend the Trump tax cuts for middle-class Americans, just as Barack Obama extended all the George W. Bush tax cuts except for those at the very top. <br> According to the Tax Policy Center, 91.3 percent of Americans making between $48,000 and $86,100 will get an average tax cut of $1,090 next year. By the time the tax cuts require an extension, most will have saved nearly $9,000 cumulatively on their tax bills. That’s real money. For those in the next income bracket — households making $86,100 to $149,400 — 92.5 percent will receive an average tax cut of $2,070. That’s more than $16,500 in tax savings before the cuts are set to expire. Are Democrats really going to take that money away? <br> It was a big mistake for these vulnerable Democrats to vote against tax reform. They had an opportunity to work with the president and make the effort bipartisan — but to do so they had to go against their party. Instead, they cast their lots with the anti-Trump Resistance. Before the tax vote, Manchin dismissed from the pressure his constituents to support the president. “I just don’t give a s---,” he said, “Don’t care if I get elected, don’t care if I get defeated, how about that?” If he does not care whether he returns to Washington, then come next year the 68 percent of West Virginia voters who supported Trump may give him his wish. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Eliminating the charitable deduction from income taxes, as Robert J. Samuelson advocated in his otherwise excellent April 18 op-ed, “Why tax reform is doomed,” would distinguish between two economically equivalent situations. Consider someone who gives a fifth of their pay to a soup kitchen and someone who works four days a week and spends the fifth volunteering at that same soup kitchen. Unless we want a tax system that discourages the division of labor, these individuals should pay the same amount in taxes. But unless charitable donations are deductible, they will not. <br> Peter F. Brown, Washington <br> Robert J. Samuelson advocated eliminating most tax preferences, referring to them as “loopholes” or “subsidies,” from the tax code and included the charitable deduction. He expressed skepticism this would happen because “churches and colleges would protest.” Millions of human service, veterans, disability, social justice, family, environmental, education, health and arts charities throughout the country would join that protest. <br> Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking minority-party member of the Finance Committee, understand that tax reform and preserving the charitable deduction are not mutually exclusive. In the Charity Act, introduced April 6, they led by writing that “encouraging charitable giving should be a goal of tax reform; and Congress should ensure that the value and scope of the deduction for charitable contributions is not diminished during a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code.” <br> The charitable deduction is neither a subsidy nor a loophole for the wealthy. It is a lifeline for all Americans who value and depend on charitable services. <br> Joanne Florino, Washington <br> The writer is senior vice president for public policy at the Philanthropy Roundtable. <br> I agree with Robert J. Samuelson that tax reform is probably doomed; there is an advocate for every deduction. But two of the eliminations he proposed don’t make sense. The first is the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes. To state the obvious, ours is a federal system of government with multiple levels. As such, to be taxed on the money earned that goes to pay taxes to another level of government seems like double taxation. Second is eliminating the exemption for part of Social Security benefits. We paid taxes — or at least some of us did — on the portion paid into the Social Security trust fund from our earnings. The amounts contributed from employee wages and one-half the amount for those who are self-employed are equivalent to a return of capital and should be excluded from taxable income.  <br> Ron Tollefson, Alexandria <br> <br> Robert J. Samuelson’s list of tax loopholes left out a huge area of tax avoidance: private foundations and trusts. These tax-avoidance schemes began when New York approved the first Rockefeller family request early in the last century. In 1930, there were 200 foundations; today there are tens of thousands of foundations and trusts holding enormous assets. Their tax-advantaged status requires only 5 percent of profits be given to charity. <br> My friends and I are mostly in the 25 percent tax bracket. Our savings and interest earned are taxed at that rate. Should we all form our own foundations or trusts to make sure we keep economic control in the hands of family? <br> Foundations and trusts abuse the term “charity” by giving large sums of money to non-charity activities and groups that have nothing to do with charity but are sympathetic to the economic interests of the top 1 percent. The IRS has been beaten up by representatives in Congress for identifying these very abuses by foundations. <br> Americans could balance the national budget merely by abolishing foundation and trust loopholes. <br> Ken Thrasher, Alexandria <br> Robert J. Samuelson commended the 1986 Tax Reform Act, passed during the Reagan administration, for lowering tax rates and broadening the base. He said it might have transformed the tax code if followed by similar laws, but it wasn’t. Mr. Samuelson wrote, “Instead, President Clinton sabotaged it by raising the top rate and peddling new tax breaks.” This news would come as a great shock to Congress, members of which labor under the notion that only they can raise tax rates or enact tax breaks and, given enough votes, don’t even need the president’s acquiescence.  <br> It might also be noted that after those rates were raised, we had a run of several of the best economic years of the past half-century: The economy blossomed, employment was high, markets boomed, and (mirabile dictu!) we even balanced the budget for a few years. <br> Tax simplification is a great idea — on that Mr. Samuelson and most Americans surely agree — and to whatever extent it is achievable, is certainly worth the effort. But let’s not kid ourselves. As Mr. Samuelson pointed out, the effort never lasts. 
 Almost everyone agrees that America’s income tax is too complex. Considering this, you might expect that simplifying the income tax would be a slam dunk. Sure enough, the various presidential candidates have proposed sweeping overhauls. But any agreement is mostly rhetorical. The odds that the next president — whoever it is — will engineer genuine tax simplification are negligible. In the wake of another Tax Day, it’s worth pondering why. <br> Make no mistake: I think we’d be better off with a simpler system. By this, I mean a system with a broader tax base and lower rates. I’d eliminate most tax preferences and cut the top personal rate (now 43.4 percent) to 30 percent. There would be no preferential rate on dividends, interest and capital gains (profits on the sale of stocks, bonds and other assets) — income enjoyed mostly by the upper middle class and the wealthy. They’d pay as much or more in taxes as today. <br> Here are some tax preferences (a.k.a. “loopholes” or subsidies) I’d repeal along with government estimates of how much tax revenues would rise in 2016: <br> ● The exclusion from taxable income of employer-paid health insurance ($211 billion). <br> ● The deductibility of state and local taxes ($84 billion). <br> ● The deductibility of mortgage interest ($62 billion). <br> ● The deduction for charitable contributions ($54 billion). <br> ● The partial tax-free status of Social Security ($40 billion). <br> In total, the income tax would raise as much revenue as it does now, but top rates would be lower and preferences fewer. If more money were needed to close budget deficits (as is likely), I’d slowly introduce a carbon tax. Still, I would keep two big tax preferences, because they advance crucial national goals. <br> The first is the earned-income tax credit (EITC), which is a federal wage subsidy for low-income workers. It’s a better way than the minimum wage of rewarding people for connecting to the labor market. The second exception would be tax-favored retirement accounts: IRAs and 401(k)s. By the time people reach their 40s or 50s, most realize they should have been saving for retirement. Tax-favored accounts give a nudge to people in their 20s and 30s. <br> The resulting tax system would be a vast improvement over today’s. It would be simpler, fairer and more efficient. It won’t happen. <br> Glance at my list of targeted tax preferences, and you can understand why. If proposed, comprehensive tax simplification would trigger a firestorm of complaints. Workers would have to pay taxes on employer-provided health insurance; they’d scream. Home builders and homeowners would denounce the loss of the mortgage-interest-rate deduction. Real estate values would be affected. Churches and colleges would protest ending the charitable deduction. Retirees would object to making all Social Security income taxable. <br> The truth is that these tax preferences have woven themselves into the nation’s social and economic fabric. Removing them would be disruptive and unpopular. Even if Congress accepted that, there would probably be complex “transition” rules. For a while, the tax code might become more complicated. But of course, Congress wouldn’t end most tax preferences, because the benefits of doing so are diffuse and obscure. <br> I believe that lower marginal tax rates should promote faster economic growth by encouraging greater work effort and investment. But as White House economist Jason Furman has noted, the effect is hard to measure and could be quite small — not large enough, he argues, to justify the dislocations of purging the tax code of most preferences. My view is that simplification is worth doing even if the effect on economic growth is zero. It would get the White House and Congress out of the business of using the tax code to reward and punish various behaviors and causes. People and firms would act based more on underlying motives, not tax benefits. <br> The trouble with my view is that the White House and Congress want to use the tax code to reward and punish. This enhances their power; relinquishing it reduces their power. We know this from history. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 followed the dictum of lowering rates by broadening the tax base. It was a commendable achievement, a rare example of bipartisanship. President Resagan supported it, as did many Democratic and Republican congressional leaders. It might have, if followed by similar laws, transformed the tax code. <br> But it wasn’t. Instead, President Clinton sabotaged it by raising the top rate and peddling new tax breaks. This spirit is alive and well among Democrats. By contrast, Republicans are hypocrites. They’d rather attack the Internal Revenue Service than undertake the hard political work of making the IRS’s job easier. <br> Accountants’ and tax lawyers’ jobs are safe. Our hideously complex tax code has staying power. It survives not because it serves the nation’s best interest, but because it placates so many groups that make up the nation. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: A chance for tax reform? <br> George F.

 Alan Simpson is a former Republican senator from Wyoming. Erskine Bowles served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 1998. They co-chaired the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. <br> Seven years and almost $7 trillion in new debt ago, we released a bipartisan package of tax and spending reforms as co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. At the time, we declared that the era of deficit denial was over. Sadly, the debate on tax reform in the House and Senate suggests deficit denial is not only back but also stronger than ever. Yet the fundamental fiscal challenges we identified in 2010 remain. <br> We said then and believe now that Congress and the president should come together on a balanced plan that reduces deficits and promotes growth. We called for fundamental tax reform that would cut tax breaks to reduce tax rates and — rather than add to the debt — generate new revenue. <br> We called for a more internationally competitive corporate tax code but also pressed for continued investment in education, infrastructure and high-value-added research so that the United States can compete effectively in the knowledge-based global economy. We also said tax reform should raise $1 trillion in revenue for debt reduction and be paired with spending cuts and reforms of entitlement programs to bring spending growth under control. <br> Unfortunately, the tax plan under discussion in Congress ignores nearly all the hard choices we proposed — incorporating only the “goodies.” It reads as if it were developed for a country whose debt problems have been solved, when in reality debt is the highest it has ever been other than around World War II. <br> When this tax reform discussion started, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called for revenue-neutral tax reform. While ultimately more revenue is needed, deficit neutrality is likely the best that can be expected in the current political environment. <br> Yet Congress abandoned even this minimum standard of fiscal responsibility and decided to proceed with a $1.5 trillion tax cut instead. With debt already twice as high as its historical average, financing tax cuts with even more borrowing is reckless. <br> And the actual bills in the House and Senate are even worse than the $1.5 trillion sticker price — because both include about a half-trillion dollars in phony savings from artificial “sunsets” and other gimmicks. With interest, that means these tax cuts could add $2.2 trillion to the debt. <br> When we released our fiscal commission report, we were worried about keeping deficits below $500 billion per year and debt below 70 percent of gross domestic product. But if the tax cuts in the current bill are adopted, deficits would exceed $1 trillion by 2020 and debt would exceed 99 percent of GDP by 2027. <br> Economic growth isn’t going to wash away this debt. Real tax reform can provide a boost to the economy, but higher debt works in the opposite direction. According to the dynamic models from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the House and Senate tax bills will increase the growth rate by only 0.03 to 0.09 percentage points per year — and that growth will cut their costs by only one-eighth or less. <br> This country cannot afford another debt-busting tax cut. Luckily, there is another way. The current tax code will give away roughly $18 trillion of tax breaks over the next decade. Our commission called for repealing most of them to pay for lower rates and reduce deficits, adding back only the most-needed ones and only in the most efficient way. By comparison, the latest Senate bill cuts only $3.7 trillion of tax breaks. Most of the largest tax expenditures — including the tax-free treatment of employer-sponsored health care, the mortgage-interest deduction and tax-free bonds — are virtually untouched. <br> This country critically needs tax reform to improve economic growth. But higher levels of debt will crowd out productive investment, slow wage growth and ultimately undo any gains from reform. <br> Bringing our debt under control will require reforming and slowing the growth of health and retirement entitlements. Enacting debt-financed tax cuts will make that harder, both substantively and politically. Substantively, because by worsening the debt situation, it will entail more painful changes; politically, because Democrats will be less likely to agree to entitlement reforms if Republicans won’t allow for sufficient revenue. <br> Many members of Congress have privately told us they would be willing to make the tough votes for ambitious tax and spending reforms as part of a substantive fiscal plan but only if members on the other side jump in the canoe at the same time. <br> This is the moment of truth for lawmakers who share our concern about our nation’s fiscal future. They can return to the era of deficit denial, or they can stand up for future generations. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: So much for the party of fiscal responsibility <br> E.J.

 WOOSTER, Ohio <br> The split in American politics we may be missing is not left vs. right or pro-Trump vs. anti-Trump but normality vs. the Trump-inspired Washington circus. <br> If the doings in the nation’s capital seem strange when you are there, they look positively lunatic at any distance from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. <br> First, the entire White House is seized by vicious infighting over its inability to tell the truth about what it knew when concerning allegations of domestic violence against a top aide. It’s remarkable how sealed off from reality this self-involved snake pit has become. President Trump has ratified the maxim that a leader gets the staff he deserves. <br> Combine this with the astounding disconnect between what Trump’s own intelligence officials told us on Tuesday about the threat of Russian meddling in our midterm elections and Trump’s denials and inactivity. The signal is that Trump doesn’t care what happens to the nation he leads. He is only concerned that Russian meddling taints the triumph he loves to boast about and that further investigations of it could get him into real trouble. <br> Oh, yes, and there was also that payoff to the porn star. <br> Last are his fiscal policies. They achieve something rather astounding by contradicting both his promises of budgetary prudence and his pledges to be a pro-worker populist. What we have instead are policies that tilt toward the wealthiest, punish the least advantaged and throw the nation’s finances into chaos — an impressively perverse trifecta. And his infrastructure program is not a big bang of new construction but a whimper that effectively relies on everyone but the federal government to do the new building. <br> Trump’s foes reached their conclusion about his contradictions and misadventures long ago. They have responded by surging to the polls in just about every election held since 2016. The latest example was the Democrats’ pickup of a seat in the Florida House of Representatives in a special election on Tuesday. In a district that favored Trump by about five points, Democrat Margaret Good prevailed thanks to a roughly 12-point swing toward her party. It was the 36th Democratic state legislative gain since Trump’s election. <br> These victories are also the product of a demobilization of Trump’s own constituency. The hardest of the hardcore Trump loyalists are still likely to cast ballots this year. But he also drew support from loyal Republicans and white working-class swing voters. Many of them were not enthralled by him but couldn’t abide Hillary Clinton — or were just plain angry. It’s hard to imagine they’re overjoyed with the past 13 months. <br> Some members of this dispirited group overlap with a third key constituency that is underanalyzed because its ranks are not exceptionally partisan or ideological. They are citizens who ask for a basic minimum from those in charge of their government: some dignity and decorum, a focus on problem-solving, and orderliness rather than chaos. Trump and the conservatives sustaining him are completely out of line with this behavioral conservatism built on self-restraint and temperamental evenness. <br> It is not to romanticize the heartland to say that anyone who spends time in the Midwest runs into such solid citizens all the time. They are horrified by spousal abuse. They include small-business owners who prefer low taxes but care about schools, roads, libraries and parks. They may be critical of government, but they also expect it to do useful things. They don’t much like bragging and find an obsession with enemies unhealthy. <br> They are churchgoers who don’t watch TV preachers, may have doubts about this or that doctrine, and don’t tell others how religious they are. But they take from their faith and scripture that they have obligations to their communities and a duty to try as best they can to live by the standards they uphold. <br> They like to look up to their leaders with respect, and they feel betrayed when the powers that be give them every reason not to. <br> The obvious political calculation is that this fall’s elections will be decided by which side mobilizes its most ardent supporters. But here is a bet that there is also a quiet revolution of conscience in the country among those who are sick to death of the chaos they see every day on the news, a White House whose energy is devoted to stabbing internal foes in the back and a president who can’t stop thinking about himself. In the face of this, demanding simple decency is a radical and subversive act. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Michael Chertoff was secretary of homeland security from 2005 to 2009. Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform. <br> The nation’s top intelligence officers warned Congress this week that Russia is continuing its efforts to target the 2018 elections. <br> This should come as no surprise: A few months ago, the Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states that hackers had targeted their election systems in 2016. Yet Congress still has not passed legislation to meaningfully address election cybersecurity. <br> Time is running out. Lawmakers need to act immediately if we are to protect the 2018 and 2020 elections. <br> There’s no evidence that vote totals were hacked in 2016. But it’s obvious that hackers have been testing the waters. Our attention has focused on Russia, but future threats could also come from North Korea, China, hacking groups such as Anonymous or any other adversary — foreign or domestic. <br> It should also be no surprise that hackers have U.S. voting systems in their sights. They’re a relatively easy target. Researchers have studied a range of electronic voting infrastructure — including touch screens, optical scanner systems and registration databases — and found serious vulnerabilities that could allow even moderately sophisticated attackers to pose threats to voting integrity. This year, about 40 states are set to use electronic voting or tabulation systems that are more than a decade old — many of which run on software that’s too old to be serviced with vendor security patches. A survey of nearly 300 election officials in 28 states found that a clear majority report needing new voting systems. <br> We believe there is a framework to secure our elections that can win bipartisan support, minimize costs to taxpayers and respect the constitutional balance between state and federal authorities in managing elections. In September, Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, introduced legislation that would help solve the problem with an elegantly simple fix: paper ballots. Meadows’s Paper Act would authorize cost-sharing with states for the replacement of insecure electronic systems with those that produce a voter-verified physical record. The bill also lays the groundwork for states to regularly implement risk-limiting audits — procedures that check a small random sample of paper records to quickly and affordably provide high assurance that an election outcome was correct. <br> President Trump has already endorsed this framework, declaring: “There’s something really nice about the old paper ballot system. . . . You don’t worry about hacking.” And in the Senate, a bipartisan group of six lawmakers recently introduced the Secure Elections Act, which presents a sweeping set of security fixes including federal grants to install systems that use voter-verified paper ballots. The best estimates show that we can replace all paperless voting machines in the United States for about the cost of a single F-22 fighter jet — and in fact, the Senate bill would not add to the deficit because it offsets any new spending. <br> Both the House and Senate bills rightly defend the constitutional principle that states and localities should have primary responsibility over election administration. But they also acknowledge that federal authorities have a role in elections to “provide for the common defense.” Rather than creating new federal mandates, the reform proposals look to identify the best thinking on election security and create guidelines for the use of federal funds. <br> It’s not practical to expect local election administrators in rural Missouri or small-town Maine to go toe-to-toe with the premier government-backed cyber-mercenaries of China or North Korea. Just as federal agencies prudently provide support for state law enforcement in dealing with terrorism, federal officials should give guidance and support in dealing with the election cybersecurity threat. <br> If there’s one takeaway from the past year’s endless parade of high-profile cyberattacks, it’s that everyone — from consumers to small businesses to global firms — is at risk. With recent revelations of sophisticated cyberattacks against voting systems in the United States and abroad, it’s clear that anyone running for public office is at risk, too. Members of Congress should recognize that election cybersecurity reforms are in their own personal interest — and in the interest of the United States’ national security. <br> Read more: <br> Marco Rubio and Chris Van Hollen: Our elections are in danger.

 The phones of House and Senate leaders are ringing off the hook right now, as CEOs and wealthy donors lobby them furiously to lower the top income tax rate and insert costly carve-outs into the GOP tax bill to protect their business tax preferences. Too bad regular taxpayers don’t have a direct line to the conferees hammering out the final bill to plead their cases. Because it seems as though they have been forgotten. <br> Case in point: At the last minute, Senate Republicans changed their version of the tax bill to keep the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) — a pernicious parallel tax code which they had promised to scrap that requires corporations and millions of individuals to calculate their taxes twice and pay whichever rate is higher. On hearing the news, corporate lobbyists swung into action, pressing GOP leaders to get rid of the corporate AMT in the final bill. And their efforts seem to be paying off. The corporate AMT “has to be eliminated,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on Monday. <br> But what about individuals? Who is championing AMT repeal for them? <br> Enter Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is fighting to get the individual AMT removed from the final tax reform bill as well. “Repeal of the individual AMT has been a fundamental element of Republican tax reform campaign promises for years,” he told me. “By leaving the individual AMT in place, we would be punishing hardworking Americans and doing virtually nothing to simplify the tax code.” <br> Burr is right. Congress created the AMT in 1969 after the Treasury Department reported that 155 high-income filers were using tax breaks to avoid paying any income taxes. In 1970, it affected only 20,000 very high-income taxpayers. But today, the number of people impacted has ballooned to 5.2 million. Most of those who currently pay the AMT are not from the highest-income households for which the tax was intended, but the middle and upper-middle class — folks who have enough money to be a ripe target of revenue raisers, but not enough to have influence on Capitol Hill. They are mostly two-earner households with mortgages to pay, who give to charity and have children. The AMT also hits the families of our fallen warriors. According to Burr, children who receive an annuity from the Uniformed Services Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) can see the AMT eat up as much as 26 percent of their benefit. No Republican tax bill should punish individuals like these — especially not to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest among us. <br> Members of the Trump administration know that the AMT is a horrible tax. In 2006, Kevin Hassett — now chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers — called the AMT “an economic abomination” and urged Congress to “erase it from the tax code completely.” Yet instead of erasing it, Republicans are retaining it. <br> Keeping the individual AMT means many Americans will see no tax cut under the GOP bill, Burr says. It defeats the entire purpose of tax reform. GOP leaders promised to make the tax code simpler and fairer. But the AMT increases tax complexity and raises compliance costs for 10 million American taxpayers, who must calculate their taxes using two separate systems every year — and then pay whichever rate is the highest. That is not simple or fair. It is obscene. <br> GOP leaders are focused on passing corporate tax cuts to fuel economic growth, which is a good thing. But they seem to have lost sight of the fact that reducing taxes for individuals is important, too. According to the Tax Policy Center, even before the AMT retention, 1 in 4 Americans will not get any tax cut under the Senate bill, and 14 percent of middle-class Americans will get a tax increase of $1,170. That is a problem for the GOP. If Americans see the GOP borrowing $1.5 trillion to pay for tax cuts, and they end up getting either no tax cut or paying more next year, they will punish Republicans at the polls. Instead of more carve-outs for corporations and fat-cat donors, Republicans should give tax relief to more individuals, especially the middle class. <br> Will Burr vote no on final passage if the individual AMT is not repealed? He hopes it won’t come to that. “I am confident the House and Senate conferees will fix the individual AMT in the final tax reform bill,” he says. Let’s hope he’s right. If Republicans get rid of the AMT for corporations, but not for individuals, that will send a clear message to American voters about where the GOP’s interests lie. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The tax bill the GOP is trying to foist on the country is not only an unfair and deficit-bloating hodgepodge written on the fly. It is also deeply corrupt. Every Republican who votes for this bill will be joining a festival of venality. <br> Corruption is not a word to be used lightly, so let’s be disciplined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary’s definitions: “dishonest or illegal behavior especially by powerful people” and “inducement to wrong by improper or unlawful means.” <br> We can stipulate that the tax bill is not illegal. But it is a dishonest power and money grab by — and on behalf of — the already powerful. As for “inducements,” well, there are those long-term investments of tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions (enabled by the collapse of all the guardrails around political money) from wealthy individuals and regiments of interest groups. They will have a merry holiday season if the bill passes as expected. <br> This legislation proves that Washington is, indeed, the “swamp” that President Trump described during the campaign. But instead of draining it, he and his partisan allies have jumped right in. Actually, they have polluted it further. <br> A prime example of this subtle corruption is how the “compromise” bill deals with the radical scaling back of the deduction for state and local taxes. Gutting what is known as the SALT tax break sets back the common good because doing so penalizes states that (a) have progressive income taxes and (b) have somewhat larger governments and thus tend to invest more in education, infrastructure and programs for the needy. While California, New York and New Jersey would be hit hard, many other states would hurt, too. <br> But instead of restoring all or most of the lost deduction, Republicans offered a fig-leaf compromise. Originally, the Senate bill reduced the amount that could be deducted to $10,000 and restricted it to property taxes. The new version keeps the cap while allowing the deduction to be used for sales and income taxes as well. <br> For most taxpayers who use the existing deduction, this won’t solve their problem. One estimate from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that 1.89 million Californians would still see their taxes rise under the new provision, only a modest drop from the 2.36 million who would have had a tax increase under the version confined to property taxes. Any California representative who votes for this is voting against the interests of the state. <br> Ah, but the Republicans did want to respond to rich New Yorkers and Californians who were howling to their usual GOP benefactors, including Trump, about their lost SALT deductions. <br> So rather than offer general relief, the Republicans sliced the top income tax rate — for couples earning $600,000 or more — from the current 39.6 percent to 37 percent. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, could not really explain why only the best-off got real help, arguing lamely that middle-income people got other benefits from the bill. <br> The shamelessness of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s description of the bill on CNN Sunday as “a very large tax cut for working families” is quite staggering. Consider that this confection of loopholes gives lawyers at big firms many paths to lower taxes but not much to the people who clean their offices. Soon, all Americans will demand the right to transform themselves into “pass-through” legal entities. <br> The bill’s champions claim that the big corporate tax cut will lead to massive new investment. But, as former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg (no enemy of business) pointed out, corporations are already “sitting on a record amount of cash reserves: nearly $2.3 trillion.” Bloomberg added: “It’s pure fantasy to think that the tax bill will lead to significantly higher wages and growth.” <br> And imagine: The “Make America Great Again” crowd appears to have designed a corporate tax system that creates new incentives to “shift profits and operations overseas,” as former Obama administration economic adviser Gene B. Sperling argued in a careful analysis. Trump probably doesn’t even know this. <br> The key to corruption is operating in the dark. This bill is a mess of opaque provisions that almost no one outside the ranks of tax lobbyists understands — because many of these giveaways were written or inspired by lobbyists themselves. <br> Needlessly rushing a massive special-interest tax bill through Congress is the antithesis of good government. This doesn’t seem to matter anymore, even to Republicans who built reputations as champions of moderation, openness and rectitude. <br> Read more from E.J.

 That we celebrate the bipartisan budget agreement approved last week shows how far we have slipped as a democracy since President Barack Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner tried to tackle our fiscal problem. <br> It’s a decline that imperils our ability to keep America great. <br> It is true that government did not shut down last week (well, not for long) and that the United States will keep paying its debts (at least for now). The alternatives, entirely imaginable in today’s Washington, would have been worse. <br> But think back to the Obama-Boehner negotiations in 2012 and 2013. Then, you might recall, the dispute was over how to balance two difficult things: tax hikes and entitlement cuts. Neither was popular, but Democrats understood we needed one, Republicans knew we needed the other. Together, politicians were — almost — ready to put the nation on sounder financial footing. <br> Now we cheer because Democrats and Republicans agree to let each other increase domestic and military spending, respectively. <br> We have gone from arguing over portions of spinach and broccoli, in other words, to congratulating ourselves for letting each other eat as much of two different kinds of ice cream as we want. <br> Look, the Democrats crow, we got $131 billion of mint chocolate chip! We win! <br> No, say the Republicans, we got $165 billion of butter pecan! We win! <br> As to difficult things — those are for suckers. If the other party won’t go there, why should we? <br> Politically, it seems to make sense. The only victims are: The next generations, who will have to pay the debt. Any remaining faith in politicians, whose hypocrisy once again is laid bare. And, maybe most destructive, the government’s wherewithal to help prepare the nation for the challenges of the coming century. <br> First responsibility of course lies with the cynic in chief. Has anyone ever frothed and foamed more, while caring less, about the deficit? <br> “Our deficit spending is China’s gain,” Donald Trump tweeted in 2011. “@BarackObama is bankrupting our country.” <br> The next year: “Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.” <br> The next: “Obama is the most profligate deficit debt spender in our nation’s history.” <br> And the next, and the next, and the next. It was, of course, all a game. It took Trump 13 months to surpass Obama in breathtaking irresponsibility, with his massive tax cut last year, unpaid for, and massive spending bill last week, mostly unpaid for. <br> But even a president of gargantuan duplicity can’t accomplish this alone. It required the dishonesty of the entire Republican leadership, pretending that tax cuts pay for themselves and deciding to pass a “tax reform” with no input from the Democratic Party. <br> That almost guaranteed that Democrats would forswear fiscal responsibility, not that most of them needed much convincing. Why restrain spending, they would say — just to pay for tax cuts for the rich? <br> The last pretenders were the conservative Republicans who supported the tax cut, opposed the spending bill and claimed the mantle of fiscal rectitude — but for the most part are no readier than anyone else in Washington to support a government of the size that their tax bill will pay for. Yes, they’re happy to cut food stamps and force Medicaid recipients to work; but when it comes to scaling back the big middle-class entitlements that increasingly gobble up the budget, do not count on their votes. <br> “This is no way to run a country,” said Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), one of the few with the courage to oppose the bill for the right reasons last week. “Instead of scratching each other’s backs in Washington, we should be working to find a balanced way to fund our priorities while ensuring that we do not strangle the next generation of Americans in debt they did not incur.” <br> The key verb in that statement is not “strangle” but “fund” — because the saddest consequence of this failure of leadership is the lost opportunity to shape American greatness for the next generation. <br> Honest leaders would be saying that we need, yes, to reform entitlement programs, but also to levy sufficient taxes to care for our old and poor and simultaneously take advantage of the opportunities that science and technology are presenting: educate young people, retrain workers, invest in research, build the infrastructure that a 21st-century economy needs. <br> That would be one kind of leadership, the kind that did make America great and keep it that way for decades after World War II. <br> Or you can whoop and holler because you got two scoops and the other kid got only one. <br> Read more from Fred Hiatt’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jennifer Rubin: McConnell and Schumer jam the House: Six things that just happened <br> The Post’s View: McConnell and Schumer celebrate a budget deal that denies reality <br> Joe Scarborough: Republicans are repeating a reckless cycle <br> Max Boot: Republicans are making a mockery of their reputations <br> The Post’s View: These Republicans used to pretend to care about debt.

 President Trump has promised to “give the American people a huge tax cut for Christmas — hopefully that will be a great, big, beautiful Christmas present.” Unfortunately for millions of Americans, what they will be getting instead is a lump of coal in the form of a tax increase — courtesy of the GOP. <br> When George W. Bush campaigned for his 2001 tax cuts, he was able to truthfully say that “everybody who pays taxes is going to get tax relief.” Republicans can’t say that today, because it isn’t true. <br> According to Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), almost 1 in 10 Americans would see their tax bills go up under the Senate version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Policy Center comes to a similar conclusion. In 2019, about 9 percent of all taxpayers would see an average tax increase of about $2,700, including about 11 percent of middle-income taxpayers, who would see their tax bills rise by nearly $1,000. In 2025, 12 percent of taxpayers would see an average increase of $2,750, with 14 percent of middle-income taxpayers seeing their tax bills rise by $1,170. In all, just 76 percent of Americans would see their taxes go down under the Senate bill, while a quarter of all taxpayers would either see no benefit or see their tax bills go up — in many cases substantially. <br> This should never happen under unified Republican government. There are four words that no American should ever be able to utter: “Republicans raised my taxes.” To be clear, Democrats err when they claim that half the country will see a tax increase when the individual tax cuts expire in 2025 under the Senate bill, because everyone knows that they won’t all be allowed to expire — just like the Bush tax cuts were not allowed to expire under President Barack Obama except for those at the very top. But there are millions of Americans, including individuals and families at every income level, who would see their taxes hiked under the GOP plan. <br> At the American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday, I asked House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) about this. “I dispute those analyses,” he said, because they “describe an America that doesn’t exist, an America where the economy never grows, and paychecks never increase.” He pointed to a recent analysis in the Wall Street Journal by conservative economists who say tax reform would boost GDP by 3 to 4 percent long term, and said that as a result, “You’re going to see increases in paychecks. That matters for families as well. So, there’s more than just the rates in this tax reform.” In other words, even those who see their tax bills go up will be better off under the GOP plan. <br> That is a hard sell to voters. A new poll shows that while 73 percent of Americans believe in principle that Congress should cut taxes on individuals and small businesses and simplify the tax code, a 54 percent majority oppose the current Republican tax reform plans working their way through Capitol Hill. Why? Because 54 percent of Americans believe Republicans are going to raise their taxes. Many are wrong, but some are not. This should not even be a question in voters’ minds. <br> Americans see Republicans spending $1.5 trillion to fund a massive corporate tax rate reduction from 35 to 20 percent. The multinationals are taken care of, as is the donor class. The middle class? Not so much. They are losing many of their cherished tax deductions in exchange for a doubling of the standard deduction, an increase in the child tax credit and a tiny reduction in their tax rates. They are left on their own to figure out whether they are winners or losers under the GOP plan. <br> When Republicans reform the tax code, there should be no losers, especially not the middle class. For years, Republicans have been telling Americans: It’s not the government’s money, it’s your money, and we want to let you keep more of it to spend, save or invest as you see fit. If they raise taxes on millions, congressional Republicans will be violating that fundamental principle. <br> Fortunately, Brady says the bill could still change. “At every step we’ve worked to improve this,” he told me. “I would say, at the end of the day, wait till the final bill.” There are lots of middle-class taxpayers — and Republican voters — who hope he’s right. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Paul Waldman: Republicans will be raising taxes on some Americans.

 Last week, President Trump delivered a State of the Union address that won the approval of 75 percent of viewers, including 43 percent of Democrats. Normally, presidents try to ride the wave from a successful State of the Union as long as they can. <br> Not Trump. What have we been talking about for the past week? Russia. <br> Why? Because within days, Trump changed the topic when he released a declassified memo prepared by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee alleging abuses of the FISA process by the FBI. The media and Democrats could not believe their luck. They were more than happy to stop talking about Trump’s speech and go with wall-to-wall coverage of the memo. Soon Trump’s powerful address, and the agenda he laid out, were a distant memory — supplanted by a fierce debate over the GOP’s “partisan” attack on the FBI and whether Trump would fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. <br> What was Trump thinking? He tweeted that the GOP memo “totally vindicates” him. No, it doesn’t. Even Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the only member of the committee to review the intelligence behind the memo, said that it had nothing to do with the Russia probe. The memo demonstrated potential FBI malfeasance in using a dossier partially funded by Democrats to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to spy on a marginal former Trump campaign adviser. If true, that is serious. But it’s not proof that there was no collusion. <br> So why would Trump release that information right after his State of the Union and thus bring the momentum he had gained to a grinding halt? He should know better. Recall that in 2017, after Trump delivered his first, also highly praised, address to Congress, the subject changed to Russia within 24 hours when The Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had not disclosed in his confirmation hearing that he met twice with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. It was a well-timed leak designed to step on Trump’s story. <br> The attack on Sessions was malicious and not Trump’s fault. This time, however, Trump intentionally changed the subject from his speech to Russia. This is a self-inflicted wound. <br> Then, to add to the PR disaster, Trump declared at what was supposed to be an event highlighting his tax reform success that Democrats who refused to stand and applaud during his State of the Union were “un-American” and “treasonous.” He was joking, of course, but it was a really bad joke — and gave the media the excuse to gin up the outrage machine over Trump’s comment. Again, Democrats quietly celebrated. Until that moment, they had been widely criticized for their disrespectful performance on the House floor, which had alienated millions of Americans watching the president. Even my liberal Post colleague Dana Milbank called the Democrats’ behavior “embarrassing.” Now, with a single misbegotten turn of phrase, Trump had turned them from petulant protesters into principled defenders of the First Amendment. <br> These mistakes were tragic, because Trump’s address seemed to reach and win the approval of many Americans who like his first year’s accomplishments but don’t approve of him, including millions of independents and Democrats. With his speech, he got them to give him a second look. In the days that followed, he needed to stay on message and keep winning them over with smart speeches putting detail onto the policies he laid out in his State of the Union. He could have hit the hustings to talk about his very generous immigration plan to give 1.8 million “dreamers” a path to citizenship and challenged reluctant Democrats to come to the table. He could have given speeches about his proposals for education, tackling the opioid crisis, and “right to try” legislation he endorsed to give dying Americans a chance to save their lives using experimental treatments. He could have won over independents, and even some Democrats, and expanded his base of support. Instead, he changed the topic to Russia and made a cringe-inducing joke about “treason,” and millions thought to themselves: There he goes again. <br> The Trump presidency is like a “Peanuts” cartoon, with Trump as Lucy with the football. Every time you think this time will be different — this time he’ll stay on message, this time he’ll show some discipline, this time he’ll realize how much more powerful it is to be presidential — he pulls the football away. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Marc A.

 The Nov. 24 news article “In GOP tax debate, popular $250 deduction for teachers now a sticking point” highlighted the unequal treatment given to the working class, including educators, in the tax bills. I calculated the impact of the Republican Senate and House tax “reform” bills based on my 2016 income tax return and found that my wife’s and my tax liability would rise by 26 percent for 2017 over last year based on the elimination of the personal exemption and the state and local income tax deduction. Eliminating these deductions would increase our taxable income by $20,000. Our tax liability would rise by $5,300. We are in the 25 percent tax bracket. Paying one’s taxes is a cost of living, just as corporate taxes are part of the cost of doing business. With the personal-income-tax increase, our cost of living would rise, so we would adjust our life budget to compensate for the increased expense. <br> The lie the Republicans are repeatedly circulating is that their version of tax reform will trickle down and stimulate the economy. Most middle-class Americans, when they learn of the adverse impact on their operating budgets, will have a different perspective and act accordingly. <br> Damon Greer, Bethesda 
 I am a payroll supervisor. My concern about the tax-reform bill is the late-year timing, as well as how the legislation would completely alter the structure of the tax-withholding system, which is based on the number of exemptions. The proposed bill means reprogramming payroll software that looks at exemptions and revision of the W-4 form and tax tables. That represents a herculean task for employers and the Internal Revenue Service. <br> It is much more complicated than just the normal revision of tax brackets. It’s not prudent to change the structure of the tax-withholding system after the start of a tax year, but this revision cannot be done by Jan. 1. <br> Normally the IRS would have already issued the 2018 Circular E, which provides employers the updated tax tables for the next tax year. But it cannot because of the uncertainty about the bill. Thus, we will be starting a tax year with one withholding system and changing midyear. <br> It also seems Republicans’ goals could have been realized via some method other than removing exemptions from our tax structure. At the least, it’s unfortunate this bill was not proposed and passed earlier in the year, allowing for proper planning and Jan. 1 implementation by the IRS and payroll professionals. <br> Kim K. Seifert, Harrisonburg, Va. 
 John Hamilton, a Democrat, is the mayor of Bloomington, Ind. <br> As the mayor of a small, Midwestern city, I’m watching federal tax reform play out in the nosebleed seats, far from the debate about deductions, sunsets, trade deficits, health-care impacts and dollar effects. But I work every day for people who will be affected directly. <br> Much in the tax proposals distresses me and threatens my residents greatly, such as its shocking transfer of wealth away from salt-of-the-earth working families to corporations and very wealthy families. Not to mention its $1.4 trillion in new deficit spending over the next 10 years, which would mean borrowing nearly $5,000 for every woman, man and child in the United States. <br> To get a sense of scale, I imagine borrowing the same per person in my own community of 85,000 people: $400 million. That’s a big number. It would more than triple our local debt. <br> Maybe it’s for a good cause? We usually borrow money to build sewers or roads, new parks or buildings or trails — things that last and generate shared, long-term community wealth. For example, my city recently borrowed about $30 million to build a major park over an old railroad switchyard to serve our community for decades. <br> I imagine telling my community that I want to sell $400 million in bonds — to be paid off by everyone in town over the next generation — to give six-figure tax breaks to our wealthiest families and big tax cuts to local corporations. I’d be run out of town. <br> If I asked the city council to approve tripling our local debt to give hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to a few hundred of our most prosperous residents, they would ask me what I was smoking. Preposterous, they would say. <br> What is it about Washington? Why is it not obviously preposterous at a federal level to do the same thing? <br> Some may say: Well, hold on, cities (or states) do similar things by other names. But we do no such things. We occasionally offer specific tax abatements or incentives to particular companies or entities doing useful things — such as expand employment or create affordable housing. For example, this year we offered tax abatements to produce permanently affordable homes for 50 percent of a new housing development. But these actions are focused on and scaled to specific outcomes we want — particular new jobs or affordable homes or investments — and the benefits are clawed back if promises aren’t kept. <br> Perhaps local tax cuts similar to the federal proposals could win support from a city council if they were tied to performance: tax reductions for corporations if they actually delivered higher wages or increased domestic investments. Perhaps I could make a case for such massive borrowing if we were investing in quality day care or better health care for poor children so they could have more success in life, strengthening our whole community. Or maybe if we were investing in new energy sources or digital connections so our overall economy could thrive. <br> But I simply cannot imagine a city council in America passing — or any mayor proposing — a tax cut structured like the federal proposals: giving massive tax reductions to the wealthiest families and all local corporations, with no particular promise of anything in return. <br> I’m watching a bill being steamrolled through Congress with no hearings or public debate, whose provisions I believe would never survive a local city council discussion.

 When I started as a reporter many moons ago, I learned of a particularly deadly corner of the journalism business known as the DBI: stories that are dull-but-important. Reconciliation of the House and Senate tax bills is classic DBI. <br> But this particular dull topic is very important indeed. In hashing out the final bill, Republican leaders can improve a law that will touch every American — or make it a whole lot worse. <br> The key is clear thinking about the purpose of this law. Not the political purpose, which is obvious to everyone. Republicans control the entire federal government and want desperately to notch an accomplishment (something! anything!). You could stamp TAX REFORM on the owner’s manual of a 2003 Subaru, and Congress would pass it on a party-line vote. Followed by President Trump tweeting a picture of himself on Mount Rushmore. <br> We need clarity on the economic purpose of the law. <br> Those who say tax cuts are necessary to spur growth and create jobs have it wrong. That might have been true in 2010, when tea party tax-cutters roared onto the scene. However, between the George W. Bush administration, the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve, government has pumped more than $6 trillion of stimulus into an economy flattened by the Great Recession. Coupled with the hard work of millions of Americans and similar efforts by leading economies around the world, that ocean of money has finally lifted us to the economic high ground of solid growth, near-full employment, abundant capital and surging consumer confidence. <br> A healthy society, at this point in the economic cycle, would pay down public debt and marshal resources for the next rough patch. Instead, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, our leaders are preparing to take us $1.4 trillion deeper into the red over 10 years. It’s even worse if you factor in congressional accounting gimmicks. <br> We don’t need more debt-fueled stimulus. We need a simpler, more globally competitive tax regime. If Congress focuses squarely on those purposes, the goals can be achieved for a lot less than $1.4 trillion. <br> There is still time for Republican leaders to sober up. First, they should seize Trump’s offer to bend on his 20 percent corporate tax target. The president mentioned a 22 percent rate, and I bet he would settle for 23 percent or even 24. Any of these would represent a historic reduction from today’s 35 percent nominal rate and would make doing business in the United States attractive compared with our competitors. <br> Each percentage point represents about $100 billion over 10 years. And you know what they say: $100 billion here, $100 billion there, pretty soon you’re talking about real money. <br> Congress should use that money to further reduce the overall price tag of the bill, not as an excuse to dish out pork like it’s the Iowa State Fair. With the tax reform bandwagon pulling away from the station, every grifting special interest in Washington will be trying to hop aboard. Don’t let them. <br> Forget about cutting the top personal income tax rate. As a class, America’s one-percenters are creative, generous and public-spirited, but they get a pretty sweet deal out of living here — driving on our highways, breathing our clean air and building businesses protected by the rule of law and Uncle Sam’s armed forces. <br> Today’s top rate for individual earners is just under 40 percent — neither high nor low in historic terms. Running deeper deficits to cut that number by a point (as the Senate would do) is useless symbolism, while sharply raising the income level at which the top rate kicks in (as both bills propose) is more than we can afford. After all, nearly everyone who pays the top rate will benefit from the corporate cut, as companies distribute their windfall to shareholders. Indeed, wealthy Americans have already banked strong returns from a rocketing stock market fueled, in large measure, by the prospect of the corporate tax cut. <br> Forget, too, about killing the estate tax, as the House proposes to do in 2024. I understand the philosophical argument: Much of the wealth accumulated over a lifetime or over generations has already been taxed as income or capital gains and shouldn’t be taxed again. But Congress is running a country, not a philosophy seminar, and the country has doubled its sovereign debt in just a decade. <br> Keep the good stuff, like doubling the standard deduction to simplify the tax returns of millions of working Americans. And choose the Senate approach to the child tax credit, which puts more money in the pockets of people who need it most. <br> Republicans are going to get the tax reform they seek. But it doesn’t have to be a law to be ashamed of. <br> Read more from David Von Drehle’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> E.J.

 Regarding the Dec. 28 front-page article “IRS upends the rush to prepay taxes”: <br> It will be interesting — and frankly sad for anyone who believes taxation is an important aspect of civic life — to watch the resource-deprived Internal Revenue Service enforcement arm try to suss out each property-taxing jurisdiction in the country to figure out which ones meet the standard of “assessing” 2018 property taxes, and then — wait for it — auditing or otherwise disallowing deductions for the probably millions of taxpayers who have already assumed that the new tax law condones property-tax prepayment. After all, the speedily handwritten statute says nothing about prohibiting prepayment of property taxes, while expressly prohibiting it in the case of state and local income taxes. The courts may have to weigh in on this, and good luck to them. <br> The whole chaotic year-end stress of decision-making on this foolishness should do wonders in November for GOP voter support from anyone who pays property taxes and itemizes deductions, which would be sweet justice for the powers that be. Thanks, congressional Republicans — and enjoy the consequences. <br> Robert Engelman, Takoma Park <br> Regarding the Dec. 24 front-page article “Tax law could crunch charities”: <br> In President Trump’s parlance, it was par for the course to read about the unintended consequences of the GOP tax bill such that middle-class Americans will now find it more difficult to donate to social-service charities and religious organizations. <br> As tax experts have determined, a lot of middle-class families will experience a tax increase, not a tax cut, in the first year of the law, because the personal exemption was rescinded and a cap of $10,000 set on the deduction of state and local taxes. Families who used to itemize will now fall under the standard-deduction umbrella. And the tax-rate reduction will not offset the aforementioned increases in taxable income. So money that might have gone to charities will now be used to pay Uncle Sam. <br> In this country, about 40 million people live in poverty (with annual incomes of approximately $12,000 for an individual, $24,000 for a family of four), including nearly 1 of every 6 children. But the GOP would prefer to make it more difficult for these individuals to receive donations and other forms of financial assistance to ensure that the 1 percent of the wealthiest people in this country receive substantial tax cuts. <br> Joel Papier, Olney 
 Students often leave term papers to the last minute, but even college freshmen would never submit as finished work an essay with changes illegibly scrawled along the side. <br> Republican senators hold themselves to a much lower standard. They voted in the early-morning hours on Saturday to reorder large parts of the American economy on the basis of a bill that those freshmen would be ashamed of. It was a thrown-together, reactionary mess forced through with little forethought and virtually no debate. Key, supposedly moderate Republican senators endorsed the massive piece of legislation even before they knew what was in it, and voted down a motion to put off a vote at least long enough so they might actually understand what they were doing. Legislating has routinely been compared to sausage-making, but this time, Republican leaders wanted to keep citizens from knowing what poisons they were injecting into this particular sausage. <br> When Congress did truly big things in the past — the Affordable Care Act, the major tax cuts of the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush eras, the tax increases under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama — there was serious discussion over an extended time. <br> Debate and careful negotiation over trade-offs in a genuinely bipartisan context were at the heart of the success of the last comprehensive tax reform in 1986. By contrast, the GOP’s extravaganza this year is entirely partisan, full of breaks for favored interests and punishments for those the party regards as its political enemies. To call it “reform” is an affront to generations of good-government advocates in both parties. <br> Moreover, this tax monstrosity is so filled with gimmicks, carve-outs and penalties for various sectors of our economy that its impact will be far greater than the Republican tax cuts of the 1980s and early 2000s. Those voting for it gave little thought to how it will affect many sectors of American life. This is exactly what its sponsors wanted. Scrutiny was this bill’s greatest foe. <br> Besides pumping up already dangerous levels of economic inequality, the bill will add at least $1 trillion (and probably much more) to the debt at a moment when adding to deficits serves no useful economic purpose. This, in turn, could lead to interest-rate increases that will dampen whatever positive effects the tax cuts in the bill will have on growth. Oh yes, and Republicans will soon be using the new red ink they manufactured on behalf of the privileged to justify sharp cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and programs for the needy. <br> The bill will undermine our system of higher education, which is one of the great prides of our country. What sense does it make to provide relief to heirs who did nothing to earn their inheritances other than be born — while increasing taxes on graduate students, whose incomes are already modest? Isn’t there a near-universal consensus that investing in the skills of our people and in research is the way to foster growth and future well-being? <br> By tearing away the deductibility of state income and sales taxes, this legislative concoction could plunge some of our largest states — California, New York and New Jersey among them — into fiscal crises or force them to slash the help they give their lower-income citizens. Does anyone of right mind believe this will be good for our economy, let alone for social justice? <br> Ah, but these states are Democratic, so Republicans are happy to abuse their power to take a shot at their partisan opponents. <br> And isn’t it funny, as former Federal Reserve vice chairman Alan Blinder pointed out in The Wall Street Journal, that so many of the provisions — keeping intact “egregious loopholes for real estate developers,” generously treating “pass-through” income, killing the alternative minimum tax and being kind to heirs — just happen to be particularly good for a certain president of the United States who claimed he was fighting for the little guy and his family? <br> Between now and Election Day 2018, not only Democrats but anyone who claims to believe in responsible and responsive government must hold up this scandalous abuse of power for all Americans to see. Republicans imposed an artificial deadline on their work and used craven, unconscionable and anti-democratic tactics solely to escape accountability. They did not want citizens to know how they were transferring piles of money to the wealthiest and the best-connected. <br> All senators who voted for this bill should be regularly reminded that they are now part of a government for the few imposed by the reckless. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Unable to produce an actual analysis of its tax plan, the Trump administration has resorted to cooking the books. <br> White House officials and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly claimed that their tax plan will unleash such tremendous growth that the bill will pay for itself.  <br> Of course, no one remotely credible backs this up. Not the Tax Policy Center, not the Tax Foundation (which uses relatively rosy assumptions about growth), not the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, not Goldman Sachs, not the usual gang of Republican economists. <br> Not even the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s nonpartisan internal scorekeepers on such matters, has found that the bill would be self-financing. Its most recently available analyses determined that even after accounting for economic effects, both the Senate and House bills would still cost about $1 trillion over the coming decade. <br> And that’s assuming many of the tax cuts actually expire after a few years, as the bills are currently written. If you take out the budget gimmicks and instead assume these tax cuts will be extended by future Congresses — as Trump officials and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have promised — the price would be closer to $2 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. <br> Faced with such dismal assessments of their party’s signature policy proposal, Trump officials have scrambled to find counterevidence. <br> In November, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed that the administration had already published a study proving that the bill paid for itself, though Treasury could not actually point to any such study. If anything, the department had removed research from its website that proved inconvenient for its claims about trickle-down economics. <br> But finally, on Monday, Treasury produced a report that purported to support the administration’s conclusions. <br> Well, “report” is a strong word. It was, in fact, a one-page news release containing no actual analysis or data, just fairy dust. <br> Rather than calculating the growth rate produced by the Senate tax plan, or any tax plan at all, the release merely . . . assumed a big growth rate. Then it said that if that growth rate happened to materialize, the plan would produce a whole lotta revenue. Enough to plug a big budget hole, even! <br> Which is a pretty big if. <br> “If I can assume I could serve at 150 mph, I could derive the conclusion that I could compete with Roger Federer,” Harvard economist and former Obama administration official Lawrence H. Summers cracked on Twitter. <br> Treasury assumes the economy would grow at 2.9 percent, which is much higher than what officials at the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office expect under current law. (Both project closer to 1.8 percent.) In other words, the Treasury one-pager suggests an enormous boost from the Trump agenda. <br> This 2.9 percent figure is pretty specific, though, giving it a veneer of precision. How exactly did the Treasury Department choose that number from all the possible numbers in the world, you ask? <br> It lifted it from a forecast in the President’s Fiscal 2018 Budget, a sloppy, error-riddled document that came out in May. <br> There are, oh, a few problems with this sourcing. <br> First, that budget was released  before a tax bill was ever even written. The president’s budget did vaguely describe a tax-reform proposal, but it departed in critical ways from the ones the Senate and the House passed. <br> Second, the 2.9 percent figure in the president’s budget was supposed to reflect the effects of the president’s entire policy agenda, including infrastructure development, welfare reform and deregulation. In other words, it includes the economic effects of policy proposals that are not only unrelated to taxes but also don’t even yet exist. <br> Despite months of teases, the Trump administration has released neither an infrastructure plan nor a comprehensive welfare-reform package. Deregulation has, of course, begun, though you’d be hard-pressed to find a deregulatory action so far that — whatever its effects on the public’s well-being — is likely to have major effects on national economic growth. (Does anyone believe that allowing airlines to continue hiding baggage fees, or even rescinding the Clean Power Plan, will trigger an economic renaissance?) <br> And third, even those comprehensive economic growth effects may be plucked from thin air. <br> As I wrote in February, in putting together estimates for the budget, Trump transition officials directed staffers to assume growth rates of about 3 percent, and then backfill the other numbers in their models to get the final numbers to add up. <br> To be clear, none of this is how policy projections usually work. <br> Sure, previous administrations have selectively cited studies or assumptions that favor their pet projects. But this kind of stuff? It’s fan fiction, not economics. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The Trump White House is already cooking the books <br> Robert E.

 The financial doomsday clock is ticking, and, thanks to the massive tax cuts passed by Congress in December, the ticks just sped up. <br> Unless Congress gets its act together, the federal government will default on its debt in a few short weeks. This event would set off a constitutional crisis and a global financial crisis. And it would be not some inevitable catastrophe but wholly man-made, created by an inept White House and a Congress too distracted, disorganized or greedy to act in the nation’s best interest. <br> For the past century, Congress has imposed a statutory limit on how much the United States can borrow. In theory, this limit is supposed to impose fiscal discipline upon spendthrift politicians. <br> In practice, it does no such thing. <br> The debt ceiling doesn’t actually restrict how much Congress can spend. It merely restricts the Treasury Department’s ability to pay bills Congress has already incurred. Year after year, Congress has passed budgets that authorize spending well beyond expected revenue, then raised the debt ceiling so that Treasury can borrow to make up the shortfall. <br> As a result, the main role of the debt ceiling in recent years has been as political hostage. Every year or so, when it comes time to raise the debt limit, attention-seeking politicians demand concessions in exchange for their precious votes. <br> This strategy is attractive because everyone (well, almost everyone) knows that defaulting on our debt would be disastrous. <br> It would make the United States a deadbeat, jeopardizing our ability to continue paying basic obligations such as Social Security checks, military salaries and interest payments. <br> Not to mention that it would violate the Constitution, which says, “The validity of the public debt of the United States . . . shall not be questioned.” <br> It would also send the global financial system into a tailspin. <br> U.S. debt is considered the safest of safe assets, which is why lots of other financial products are benchmarked to U.S. Treasury yields. If our creditors doubt they’ll receive full and timely payments, Treasury yields will rise, setting off a chain reaction of chaos and panic in markets throughout the world. <br> Now, technically, we already reached our borrowing limit in early December. Since then, Treasury has been resorting to “extraordinary measures” to prevent default. This essentially means moving money around so we can meet our obligations without issuing new debt. <br> At some point, though, those measures will get exhausted. And that some point is coming sooner than previously expected. <br> In November, the Congressional Budget Office projected that Treasury would run through those extraordinary measures around late March or early April. But then Republicans passed their ginormous tax bill. <br> The new law cuts taxes for most Americans this year, which means that withholding from employee paychecks will drop starting no later than mid-February. Individual income tax revenue will therefore be about $10 billion to $15 billion less per month than the CBO previously estimated. <br> Thus, the CBO  says that Treasury will probably run out of money in the first half of March, possibly sooner. In a letter this week to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin understandably pleaded with Congress to “protect the full faith and credit of the United States by acting to increase the statutory debt limit as soon as possible.” <br> Not raising the debt ceiling once seemed totally unthinkable. These days, less so. <br> We came dangerously close to default in 2011, prompting Standard Poor’s to downgrade the country’s creditworthiness. Since then, the nation’s political leadership has only deteriorated. <br> During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump made distressingly cavalier comments about defaulting on our debt. Then, when he assumed office, he appointed as his top budget honcho Mick Mulvaney. Mulvaney had been one of the ringleaders of the 2011 debt-ceiling showdown, voted against raising the limit four times and publicly questioned whether it would be so bad if we stopped paying all our bills. <br> Congress, meanwhile, has a lot of other time-sensitive issues on its plate right now, including passing a budget and negotiating an immigration deal that will (hopefully) protect “dreamers.” <br> Ryan has also not exactly proven adept at herding all the cats in his party. Republican lawmakers have lately been rewarded for grandstanding and going rogue, which hardly suggests they’ll fall in line when a delectable hostage such as the debt limit is there for the taking. <br> The best thing Congress could do at this point would be to eliminate the debt ceiling once and for all. But barring that, resetting the doomsday clock for another year — swiftly, well before markets begin to panic — would still be better than nothing.  <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jonathan Capehart: ‘The budget from hell’ and raising the debt ceiling: Republicans are not ready for this <br> Catherine Rampell: The emergencies the GOP is ignoring <br> The Post’s View: It’s time to get realistic about the debt ceiling <br> Letters to the Editor: It’s time to get rid of the debt limit <br> Maya MacGuineas: Don’t get rid of the debt ceiling.

 As we approach the end of President Trump’s first year in office, the list of extraordinary things he has done — for both good and ill — is nothing short of remarkable. Trump inspires such deep emotions in his critics and supporters that many have struggled to objectively assess his presidency. Some are so blinded by their hatred of Trump that they refuse to acknowledge the good he has done, while others are so blinded by devotion that they overlook almost any transgression. <br> In my columns, I’ve tried to give Trump the credit he deserves when he does the right thing, while calling him out when he does the wrong thing. So, here is my list of the 10 best things Trump has done in his first 11 months. (On Friday, I will give you my list of the 10 worst.) (Update: Here it is.) <br> 10. He enforced President Barack Obama’s red line against Syria’s use of chemical weapons. When the regime of Bashar al-Assad used a toxic nerve agent on innocent men, women and children, Trump didn’t wring his hands. He acted quickly and decisively, restoring America’s credibility on the world stage that Obama had squandered. <br> 9. He has taken a surprisingly tough line with Russia. Trump approved a $47 million arms package for Ukraine, sent troops to Poland’s border with Russia and imposed new sanctions on Moscow for violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. <br> 8. He recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Four American presidents promised to do it, but only one actually did. This is why the American people elected Trump. He does what he promises to do, for better or for worse — in this case, definitely for the better. Even Jeb Bush tweeted his approval. <br> 7. He withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. After George W. Bush pulled out of the disastrous Kyoto treaty, U.S. emissions went down faster than much of Europe. The same will be true for Trump’s departure from the Paris accord. Combined with his approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, and opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploration, Trump is helping usher in a new age of American energy development. <br> 6. He got NATO allies to kick in $12 billion more toward our collective security. Decades of pleading by the Bush and Obama administrations failed to get NATO allies to meet their financial commitments to the alliance, but Trump’s tough talk and reticence to affirm America’s Article V commitment did the trick. NATO is stronger as a result. <br> 5. He has virtually eliminated the Islamic State’s physical caliphate. Trump removed the constraints Obama placed on our military and let it drive the terrorists from their strongholds. <br> 4. He admitted he was wrong on Afghanistan and reversed Obama’s disastrous withdrawal. In a rare admission, Trump declared: “My original instinct was to pull out . . . But all my life, I’ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office. . . . A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for terrorists.” <br> 3. He enacted historic tax and regulatory reform that has unleashed economic growth. Trump signed the first comprehensive tax reform in three decades and removed the wet blanket of Obama-era regulations smothering our economy. We are now heading into our third consecutive quarter of above 3 percent growth. <br> 2. He is installing conservative judges who will preside for decades. With his appointment of Neil M. Gorsuch, Trump secured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, and he is moving at record pace to fill the federal appeals courts with young conservative judges. <br> 1. He, not Hillary Clinton, was inaugurated as president. Trump delivered the coup de grace that ended the corrupt, dishonest Clinton political machine. <br> There are many other significant achievements that did not make the top 10. Trump has taken a clear, strong stand against the narco-dictatorship in Venezuela, and he renamed the “Asia-Pacific” the “Indo-Pacific” to include India in the larger task of preventing Chinese hegemony in Asia. Trump has made clear that he is willing to use force to stop North Korea from deploying nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of destroying U.S. cities — which has prompted China to finally put real pressure on Pyongyang. We’ll see if it works. <br> The record of achievement suggests that, despite the noxious tweets and self-inflicted wounds emanating from the White House, Trump has the potential to become one of the most consequential conservative presidents in modern American history. The question is: Does all this good outweigh the bad? We’ll review the 10 worst things Trump has done in Friday’s column. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> Eugene Robinson: Trump’s first year was even worse than feared <br> Marc A.

 Gladriel Shobe is a tax professor at Brigham Young University Law School. <br> The House Republican tax plan proposes repealing much of the state and local tax deduction, allowing individuals to deduct up to $10,000 of local property taxes but eliminating the rest of the deduction. This gets sound tax policy precisely backward. Smart tax reform would allow taxpayers to deduct what they pay to states — and would end the deduction for local taxes. <br> The treatment of the state and local tax deduction is one of the central points of contention in the tax-reform debate. President Trump and most Republicans want to repeal or modify the deduction, which could raise more than $1 trillion over the next decade. Republican and Democratic members of Congress from high-tax states are protesting any repeal because it would disproportionately harm their constituents. <br> But the reality of the distribution of benefits and costs of the state and local tax deduction is more complicated than high-tax (mostly blue) states vs. low-tax (mostly red) states. As the House Republican tax plan implicitly acknowledges, the state and local tax deduction in fact combines two very different deductions: a state deduction for state income taxes (or, much more infrequently, sales taxes) and a local deduction for property taxes. When looked at this way, the issue is both a high-tax state vs. low-tax state issue and a rich-locality vs. poor-locality issue, with the federal government providing a disproportionate subsidy to high-tax states and high-tax localities. <br> Understanding that the state and local deduction is in fact two deductions is important because states and localities fund very different things. Local taxes typically benefit those within relatively homogeneous localities in a way that is similar to a purchase of private goods. When residents pay local taxes, those taxes fund local schools, parks and recreation, police and fire agencies, and so on, that provide a relatively direct benefit to those paying the taxes. Wealthy individuals benefit from their local taxes in much the same way they benefit from purchasing a membership to a private club. No one seriously argues that a membership to a private club should be deductible, yet in effect that is what the deduction for local taxes allows. <br> State taxes, on the other hand, are less like private purchases because states spend a significantly higher percentage of their revenue on redistributive programs, such as state welfare programs, funding for poor school districts and health care for low-income residents. When wealthy individuals, who gain the most benefit from deductibility because they pay higher marginal tax rates, pay state taxes, that cost looks more like a charitable contribution than a membership in a private club, and so a deduction is more justified. <br> Therefore, smart tax policy would allow taxpayers to deduct the cost of state income taxes while eliminating the deduction for local property taxes. As it happens, because local taxes account for approximately half the overall deduction, this change would raise approximately $500 billion over the next decade. <br> Instead, House Republicans propose doing just the opposite. By retaining deductibility for local property taxes, their approach would continue to disproportionately subsidize wealthy, country-club-like localities, albeit to a smaller degree for the wealthiest towns and cities because of the $10,000 cap. And by eliminating deductibility for state taxes, the tax plan would end the federal government’s subsidy for state governments, which spend a significant percentage of their revenue on redistributive programs. <br> This may placate the powerful real estate lobby and taxpayers from wealthy localities, but it is bad tax policy. The types of goods and services provided by localities are not bad, but they are unlikely to need a federal subsidy, because taxpayers see a direct benefit from the local taxes they pay. By contrast, the federal government should want to incentivize the types of goods and services provided by states because they disproportionately benefit the less wealthy and are therefore likely to be undersupplied. <br> A smarter tax policy would be to repeal deductibility for local taxes altogether and retain deductibility for relatively redistributive state taxes. This could be structured to raise the same amount of revenue as the Republicans’ current proposal but in a way that would provide a federal subsidy for things that are worthy of being subsidized. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: Who wins biggest in the GOP tax plan?

 Virginia also has an “accidental tax increase,” as reported in the Jan. 26 editorial “Maryland’s accidental tax increase.” If a couple takes the standard deduction on the federal form, Virginia tax Form 760 requires the couple to also take the Virginia standard deduction, which is just $6,000. Therefore, you cannot itemize deductions, which will result in an appreciable increase for many Virginia taxpayers who itemized deductions in the past. <br> I applaud Maryland for dealing with the issue, and I hope Virginia does not impose a state tax increase because of the federal tax law change.  <br> Andrew Cosgarea Jr., Falls Church 
 Before any tax bill passes, new sources of revenue will have to be found. Senate deficit hawks must be satisfied, and crucial interest groups opposed to the House bill because of its assault on homeownership preferences — real estate agents and home builders — need to be converted from enemies to allies. Passage will require retaining the code’s existing treatment of homeownership, as well as seriousness about the country’s ocean of red ink. And that means more revenue from somewhere. <br> There are three potential sources of that revenue. All should appear in the Senate’s version of tax reform. <br> First, dump Obamacare’s individual mandate. As proposed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) last week and seconded by President Trump and a growing number of legislators, this would save the government between $300 billion and $400 billion over the next decade and also set the stage for significant health-care reform next year. <br> Only Republicans who fear Democratic demagoguery on the issue will hesitate. They shouldn’t. The mandate is a massive intrusion on individual freedom that should come, if ever, from states in control of their own health-care systems, not from the federal government. Republicans have been arguing against a federal mandate since the first day of the Obamacare debate. They can kill off the mandate and advance tax reform at the same time. <br> Second, raise the gas tax. The obvious connection between the gas tax and its uses makes this the most palatable of old revenue sources to increase, especially as the prospect of new infrastructure spending looms. Serious students of federalism know the GOP has always been in favor of “internal improvements,” as infrastructure was known in Lincoln’s time. Finding the money should begin with a significant hike in the fees charged motorists using the most ubiquitous of infrastructure: the roads. <br> The third, new available source of revenue is very similar to the gas tax, in that it would be more fee than tax: a surcharge on every residential delivery of purchased goods as the vibrant new economy disrupts the old retail sector and booms across the planet. <br> A 5 percent delivery fee, collected by the merchant making the sale, would not be nearly as regressive as a broad sales tax (and may even be progressive). It would certainly tap into a volcano of revenue flowing into new-economy companies that have used the existing infrastructure of roads, rails and airports to build vast fortunes. <br> Such a delivery fee would be similar to fees assessed on airline and train tickets. It would actually be a “new economy user fee.” That’s got to have bipartisan appeal, while brick-and-mortar establishments would cheer any small tax-code recognition that the sales taxes their customers have paid for decades provided much of the infrastructure now being used to disrupt, if not completely destroy, them. <br> There’s also a case to be made for a new income-tax bracket for the very, very wealthy and a tax on very, very large estates, in this Citizens United era where billionaire self-funding is becoming a new political force on both left and right, one unanticipated by the Founding Fathers. Starting that discussion makes sense, but figuring out the correct rates and thresholds cannot be jammed into the time available. <br> Tax reform is widely understood to be urgently necessary to keep the United States competitive in the global economy, and the first draft of the bill has 90-plus percent support in the GOP House Caucus. A similar bill will have similar levels of support in the GOP Senate Caucus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told me on MSNBC on Saturday, his “guess is once we’ve demonstrated we have 50 votes and could pass it without them, that we might get a few Democrats.” <br> A successful tax bill would be a huge win for the overall economy, as well as for companies that want to remain headquartered in the United States and their employees, for the Republican Party generally and for Trump, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and McConnell specifically. All that stands in the way are a handful of Republican senators, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders. States with high income taxes have lost their battle for subsidies from low-tax states. But penalizing homeownership across all states is a galvanizing issue for the opposition. <br> So raise revenue to pay for preserving homeowning incentives and to rebuild and expand the infrastructure of the new economy — roads, bridges, ports, rails and airports — being hard-pressed by millions of new deliveries, and to address the demands of deficit hawks. Get it done and then move on to the repeal of sequestration on the Pentagon, immigration reform, infrastructure spending and Round Two of health care. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: A Trump tax idea that might actually do some good <br> Lawrence H.

 Needing a victory to validate their majorities, congressional Republicans have chosen not to emulate Shakespeare’s Henry V before Agincourt. He advocated stiffening the sinews, summoning up the blood and lending the eye a terrible aspect. The Republicans would rather define victory down. <br> What began with a bang of promises of comprehensive tax reform will end with a whimper: The only large change will be to the national debt. Consider a small proposal — repeal of the estate tax. It will be paid by an estimated 5,500 people dying this year, raising about $20 billion — a pittance in the $3.88 trillion budget. Repeal’s significance would be philosophic rather than economic. <br> In 1975, Phillies pitcher Tug McGraw explained what he would do with his $75,000 salary: “Ninety percent I’ll spend on good times, women and Irish whiskey. The other 10 percent I’ll probably waste.” If you work hard, make a pile, then choose to squander it on dissipations, go ahead, it’s a free country. But try to pass the pile to progeny and grasping government will intervene. Ending the estate tax would extinguish the government’s delusion that it has the duty and skill to prevent the intergenerational transmission of family advantages (of which money matters much less than transfers of social capital — habits and aptitudes, which government cannot redistribute). <br> Desperate to propitiate impatient constituents, Republicans say this is no time (actually, there never is a time) to fret about the national debt, which was $9 trillion a decade ago and passed $20 trillion two months ago, having increased 22 percentage points under the Republican president who preceded the present one. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) says do not worry, “we finally have a president who is willing to actually even balance the budget.” Ryan underestimates the president, who has promised to eliminate not just the budget deficit but also the national debt in just eight years, without touching entitlements. <br> Beneath the froth of political discord, America’s granite-like harmony persists. The comparatively superficial discord distracts attention from this bipartisan consensus: We shall have a generous entitlement state and not pay for it. Instead, we shall offload onto future generations a substantial portion of the costs of our current consumption of government. As Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute naughtily reminds us, during half a century of Republican rhetoric of frugality, 1960 to 2010, entitlement spending grew 8 percent faster under Republican presidents than under Democratic ones. <br> In the ninth year of an unusually long expansion, and with the economy near full employment (ignore the dismal workforce participation rate), the budget deficit for the past fiscal year was $666 billion, up $80 billion from the previous year. To partially recoup revenue lost from reduced rates, Republicans reportedly flinched (Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz says his fellow Republicans were “asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have a chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read”) from a “border adjustment tax” on imports ($1 trillion in a decade) and now have gone wobbly about completely ending the deductibility of state and local taxes ($1.3 trillion). Republicans might still be contemplating steep reductions in the amounts that individuals can put into tax-deferred 401(k) retirement accounts. This will displease the approximately 32 percent of workers who have 401(k)s and worsen the inadequate savings rate of a nation where defined-benefit pension plans are now mostly luxuries for government workers and where almost a majority of people approaching retirement have nothing saved for it. The current median Social Security payment is about $16,000 a year. <br> When the president said tax reform is “going to be so easy,” he overlooked this fact: The tax code’s baroque complexity that demands radical reform makes the code almost impervious to such reform. Every provision was put there to placate a muscular faction or to create a grateful faction. <br> Republicans should have heeded Dwight Eisenhower’s axiom: “If a problem cannot be solved, enlarge it.” They should have made the case for large reforms that annoy democratically — almost everyone, simultaneously — but for a large purpose. The aim should have been a revenue system that stops subordinating economic efficiency to social engineering and rent-seeking, thereby maximizing the probability of economic growth sufficient to fund the entitlement state. Such a bold aim requires a commensurately bold argument — for a consumption tax or a carbon tax or a zero corporate tax rate or anything for which public-spirited people might stiffen their sinews and summon up their blood. <br> Read more from George F.

 As Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles reminded us in their Nov. 30 op-ed, “A national moment of truth,” the GOP members of Congress are again engaged in deficit denial. This encore performance has three acts. First, tax reform is enacted that disproportionately benefits the rich and creates an ever-larger deficit. In the second act, the same actors decry the increased deficit that legislation favoring the needy would create. By once again “starving the beast” of the federal government, the third act results in less government, giving corporations and the wealthy an ever-freer hand and depriving the common man of protection against unbridled capitalism and of needed government programs. It is past time to close this theater of the absurd at the next election. <br> Norman A. Wulf, Fairfax <br> Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles claimed that “bringing our debt under control will require reforming and slowing the growth of health and retirement entitlements.” <br> Neither of these programs is an entitlement. Both are government-sponsored insurance programs into which citizens pay premiums and receive benefits. As for the health-care program, the benefits paid out far exceed the premiums paid in, and that is a problem. But it is not Medicare that needs reform, it is the U.S. health-care system and the way it’s paid for. <br> On the other hand, the “retirement entitlement” (a slur against Social Security) has always been a self-sustaining program entirely paid by premiums taken from earned wages, the revenues of which have been invested in U.S. Treasury securities. The treasury owes the Social Security trust fund $2.8 trillion. <br> Social Security is one of the best-run programs in our government, and while adjustments in premiums and benefits are occasionally needed to balance revenues and benefits, the program needs no reform, and to promote such is outrageous. <br> Wayne R. Knight, McLean <br> Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles thoroughly identified the size and implications of the country’s fiscal problem. But along with other people and groups sounding the alarm, they have been unable to convince the general public. <br> A year before the release of the Simpson-Bowles report in 2010, I began raising concerns about the then-$12 trillion national debt. One of the biggest challenges was — and still is — conveying the enormity of a trillion. A time analogy helps make the point: A million seconds elapse in 12 days; a trillion pass after more than 30,000 years. <br> Another major challenge was and is communicating how the debt translates into personal consequences. The oft-used threat of every American being responsible for about $60,000 of debt is meaningless unless people believe the Internal Revenue Service will be knocking on their doors with an invoice. <br> Until we raise awareness of the enormity of the problem and its personal consequences, including a Greece-style debt spiral spurred and exacerbated by rising interest rates, there will be no public willingness to support hard political choices. <br> Richard Berman, Orlando <br> I read that Senate Republicans were looking for revenue because of the $1 trillion deficit score from the Congressional Budget Office [“Senate tax bill moves, with divisions,” news, Nov. 30]. How about keeping the estate tax rules as they are and keeping the alternative minimum tax? I believe that would be several hundred billion dollars in revenue and it wouldn’t hurt corporations or the middle class. <br> Paul Lyons, Williamsburg, Va. <br> It shouldn’t take a nonpartisan panel of experts to know that the big tax cut bill will not, as predicted by the administration and its advocates in Congress, pay for itself. Yes, in rare instances, a cut in a very high rate — e.g., the elimination of the 90 percent rate on high incomes in the Kennedy era — under the supply-side Laffer principle can pay off in stimulated growth. But in recent decades, tax cuts have produced only negative results for both the federal deficit and the economy. <br> The economy did gradually recover from the deep downturn of the early Reagan years, but the deficit did not. And President George W. Bush, having inherited a balanced budget and a thriving economy from his predecessor, managed, with the help of a major tax cut, not only to balloon the deficit but also to produce the deepest recession since the 1930s. Case closed. <br> Jodie T. Allen, Washington 
 Dec. 1, 2017, will be remembered as the day when the vast majority of Americans fully grasped the consequences of the 2016 elections. They installed a man in the White House “likely to be under investigation for criminality for a very, very long time to come.” And they gave power to a Republican Party whose only purpose is to comfort the already extremely comfortable. <br> The quotation above, from Donald Trump’s campaign rhetoric against Hillary Clinton, is now a better fit than ever for his own circumstances. The day after Michael Flynn’s guilty plea on Friday, Trump compounded his legal jeopardy with a tweet suggesting that (contrary to what he had said before) he knew Flynn, his onetime national security adviser, had lied to the FBI. <br> Trump’s lawyers will keep trying to explain his tweet away, but his overall vulnerability on obstructing justice has increased exponentially. <br> But it’s almost as important that Friday was also the day Senate Republican leaders brought forth a tax bill heralding the death of anything resembling a populist form of conservatism within the Republican Party. Plutocracy will now be the GOP’s calling card. Facing one of the most scandalous special-interest tax bills in a long history of such measures, even supposedly moderate members of the party caved in before the power of big money when the votes were counted early Saturday morning. <br> Republicans proved one other thing: What they say when they are out of power should never be believed again. Their progressive opponents, in turn, should never feel constrained in the future to limit their own ambitions out of deference to empty slogans about the superiority of bipartisanship. <br> When President Barack Obama was in office, conservatives waxed hysterical about the horrors of deficits by way of limiting government’s ability to help the needy or expand health insurance coverage. They spoke over and over about how terrible it was to pass bills on a partisan basis and how their foes should govern from “the center.” <br> Now that the GOP has the votes, all those statements are inoperative. The party is running roughshod over democratic accountability and falling short of even minimal expectations of congressional decorum. <br> The leaders of “the world’s greatest deliberative body,” as the Senate pretentiously calls itself, no longer feel any obligation even to provide legible copies of complex legislation. The chicken scratches scribbled on the margins of their tax giveaway signed away any legitimacy these politicians can claim for their political project. <br> And deficits? Ah, deficits. They matter not a whit when there is money to pass out to corporations, rich heirs, private jet owners and the beer lobby represented by the son of one of our fine senators. But deficits will matter again soon, when Republicans will insist that they have no choice but to slash programs for the elderly, the sick and the poor. <br> One salutary outcome of this episode is that Trump showed how nonsensical were the widely repeated assertions that he was outside the Republican mainstream. We now know he is just a flamboyantly clownish and unconscionably mean version of an old-fashioned corporate conservative. <br> There is not an authentically populist bone in this billionaire’s body. He regularly demonstrates his utter contempt for working people by treating them as rubes. He seems to think that racist gestures and malicious comments about immigrants and Muslims will distract working-class voters from how far he is tilting government away from their interests and toward those of his family and his rich friends. <br> Trump and his party will learn how many of the Americans they are taking for granted are much smarter than this and know when someone is selling them out — because, sadly, it’s something they are familiar with. <br> This is why the coincidence of the tax bill’s passage and Flynn’s decision to cooperate with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is so dangerous to Trump: The president’s populist mask is slipping at the very moment when he most needs to rally the troops. Flynn, who cherished the phrase “lock her up,” came face to face with the slammer himself and decided that loyalty to this most unfaithful of leaders was not worth the price. About this, at least, Flynn is right. <br> But don’t count on Republican politicians abandoning Trump quickly now that their tax victory is in sight. They and the president have a lot more in common than either side wants to admit. The primary loyalty they share is not to God or country or republican virtue. It is to the private accumulation of money, and this is a bond not easily broken. <br> Read more from E.J.

 If a tax falls in a forest and no one notices, does it make a sound? <br> That’s no idle existential musing. The answer may determine whether President Trump’s tax plan ever becomes non-toxic to the Republican Party. <br> Right now the public hates, hates, hates the tax bill. It’s less popular than any major piece of legislation of the past several decades, less popular even than tax hikes passed under Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. Only about a third of Americans view it favorably, based on an average of nine polls this month. <br> Republicans are hoping that once the public sees their plan in action, though, everyone will be pleasantly surprised. <br> After all, most Americans don’t believe they personally will benefit from the law. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that only 17 percent expect their taxes to go down. <br> And while it’s true that by 2027, a majority of households will see their tax liabilities increase relative to current law, most people’s taxes will indeed fall in the near term. About 80 percent of households will get a tax cut in 2018, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center. <br> Many will start receiving those tax cuts as early as February, when lower paycheck withholding kicks in. Just in time for the 2018 midterms! <br> “Whatever the polling data is that’s out there today doesn’t recognize just how powerful this bill is going to be to put more money in the pockets of hard-working families,” House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said. <br> There are good reasons to be skeptical of this narrative. <br> The first is that the tax cuts may be too modest and doled out too incrementally for most Americans to notice their existence. <br> Consider previous tax reductions. <br> The 2009 Recovery Act — the economic stimulus passed under President Barack Obama, in response to the Great Recession — cut taxes for 96 percent of households, according the Tax Policy Center. Incidentally, it also gave bigger benefits to families in the middle (and also bottom) of the income distribution than the Trump tax law will next year. <br> And yet, despite the magnitude and near-universality of those Recovery Act tax cuts, virtually no one noticed them. <br> A year later, just 12 percent of Americans knew that Obama had cut taxes for most people. <br> The 2001 and 2003 George W. Bush tax cuts tell a similar story. These cuts benefited about three-quarters  of households, and also gave a bigger bump in after-tax income to those in the middle quintile than the Trump tax plan will next year. <br> And yet in 2004, just 19 percent  said that Bush had reduced their taxes. <br> Why is it so hard to recognize a tax cut when you, and almost everyone else, have gotten one? <br> When it primarily appears in dribs and drabs over the course of the year through paycheck withholding, it’s just not that salient. Especially given all the other variables that can cause one’s take-home pay to fluctuate from year to year or week to week, such as changes in wages, hours and benefits. <br> Let’s say, though, that Republicans are right, and people do notice their taxes falling in 2018. Even then it’s not clear they’ll sweeten on the Trump plan. <br> In fact, they may sour on it further. <br> Despite what Republican legislative priorities suggest, most Americans . . . don’t care all that much if their taxes go down. As Brookings Institution scholar Vanessa Williamson has shown, Americans don’t exactly love paying taxes, but they regard doing so as their civic duty. To the extent they care about the system, they’re primarily mad that others are shirking this duty. <br> The thing that bothers Americans most about the tax system is “the feeling that some corporations don’t pay their fair share,” according to a recent Pew Research Center poll. This was followed by the feeling that “some wealthy people are not paying their fair share.” Next, tax-code complexity. <br> Then, in fourth place, was the amount they personally pay in taxes. <br> Americans know the Trump tax bill gives the biggest windfall to the rich and corporations. That’s probably why they hate it so much. This hatred will likely grow as clever accountants devise new ways to make the windfall even bigger, thanks to as-yet-undiscovered glitches and drafting errors throughout this hastily written bill. <br> “Newspapers are going to be full of stories about people creatively minimizing their taxes,” says tax historian Joseph Thorndike. <br> A fall in other people’s taxes, he says, is what Americans care about — and what, over the coming months, they’ll be looking for.  <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: A win for the wealthy, the entitled and the irresponsible <br> Catherine Rampell: A feast for regulatory parasites <br> The Post’s View: The Rubio tax bill saga is a perfect expression of Republican priorities <br> Hugh Hewitt: Here’s how the GOP can pay for its tax plan <br> Fareed Zakaria: The GOP tax bill may be the worst piece of legislation in modern history <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 “The intellectual cannot operate at room temperature.” <br> — Eric Hoffer, “First Things, Last Things” (1971) <br> Eric Hoffer (1902-1983) meant that intellectuals in his day tended not to be temperate. In our day, this defect — moral overheating — has been democratized: Anyone can have it. Now, everybody can be happily furious, delirious with hysteria and intoxicated with intimations of apocalypse, all day every day. <br> Hoffer was a longshoreman and an autodidact who wrote slender books hefty with wisdom. His first, “The True Believer” (1951), put him on a path from San Francisco’s docks to a Presidential Medal of Freedom, conferred in 1983 by a fellow Californian. In Hoffer’s time, intellectuals often were feverish because this was the best way to be noticed, and to say, about this and that: Listen to our intelligent selves or the end is nigh. <br> In 2017, many others emulated this act. Were Hoffer still with us, he would marvel at today’s vast, deep reservoirs of extravagant rhetoric. For example: <br> During two decades, the Internet was barely regulated as it delighted its users. In 2015, a regulatory policy (“net neutrality”), one without a constituency sufficient to move Congress, was imposed by bureaucratic fiat. Thirty-three months later, net neutrality was ended. And the rending of garments and gnashing of teeth commenced: “This is the end of the internet as we know it” (Sen. Bernie Sanders); “A brazen betrayal . . . disastrous . . . I am disgusted” (Sen. Richard Blumenthal); “Outrageous” (Sen. Cory Booker); “Horrible” (Sen. Tim Kaine); “Shameful” (Sen. Sherrod Brown). <br> Another example: Most of the nonstop noise emanating from the White House is white noise — audible wallpaper, there but unnoticed. Some is, however, interestingly symptomatic, as when a presidential assistant calls this year’s tax legislation “the most significant tax reform we’ve had since 1986.” Which is like bragging about the tallest building in Boise. The 1986 tax reform radically simplified the tax code. Since then, the code has acquired more than 15,000 new wrinkles. The 2017 tax legislation might — this is difficult to measure — have managed the minor miracle of making the 70,000-page code more complicated. On a scale of importance from one (negligible) to 10 (stupendous), the legislation might be a three. Never mind. Cue the Cassandras. This tax cut of less than 1 percent of the next decade’s projected GDP is “the worst bill in the history of the United States Congress” (House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi). It “will result in 10,000 extra deaths per year” and “our country will be living on a shoestring for decades” ( former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers). <br> The many Americans who are happiest when unhappy seem as addicted to indignation as the fewer Americans are to cocaine. Brain imaging might show the same pleasure points lighting up in both cohorts. Furthermore, because today’s technologies have eliminated barriers to entry into public conversations, ignorance and intemperateness are not barriers. Because modern technologies allow the instant, costless dissemination of fulminations, and because the more vituperative the fulminations the more apt they are to be noticed in the digital clutter, public conversations often quickly degenerate into something less. <br> Christopher DeMuth, president emeritus of the American Enterprise Institute, notes the interaction of high affluence and modern technologies. “Americans have attained levels of material comfort, leisure time, and education unknown until the recent past.” And as Americans have become “entangled by networks of communication,” they have entered “a world of empowered mass intimacy” that encourages the better but also “the darker angels of human nature.” New modes of communication enable us “to organize ourselves into highly defined networks of affinity and endeavor.” These enable splendid cooperative endeavors; but they also are “fracturing our politics.” <br> Institutions that hitherto organized and stabilized politics — parties, Congress, federalism, civic organizations — have been, DeMuth says, “deconstructed by a thousand networks of ideology, interest and identity.” Such “private networks have commandeered central institutions of government.” Congress, especially, has buckled beneath the weight of “many more numerous political causes than a representative legislature can manage.” Congress has responded by offloading onto the administrative state’s executive agencies activities that are essentially legislative. So, its members are free to “strut and fret on the national stage” on behalf of causes that are made conspicuous, articulate and potent by the new technology-created networks. <br> The result is an ever-more-clamorous politics, and the survival of the shrillest. Hence 2017, the year of living splenetically, has been replete with confirmations of Eric Hoffer’s aphorisms: “Rudeness is the weak man’s imitation of strength.” And: “We lie the loudest when we lie to ourselves.” <br> Read more from George F.

 Davos Man, that private-jet-taking, international-trade-dealing, easily caricatured master of the universe, is nervous. <br> This was clear even before he arrived this week in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, the exclusive annual meeting where the elites of finance, industry and governance mingle to discuss topics of global interest. <br> Just days ahead of the confab, Larry Fink, chief executive of the $6 trillion-plus asset management firm BlackRock and prototypical Davos attendee, made clear his own doubts about our economic future. “Popular frustration and apprehension about the future simultaneously have reached new heights. We are seeing the paradox of high returns and high anxiety,” Fink declared in his annual letter to thousands of top business leaders. Noting the low wage growth, dimming retirement prospects and other financial pressures that squeeze too many across the globe, he said, “I believe that these trends are a major source of the anxiety and polarization that we see across the world today.” <br> What should be done about this? Fink made some recommendations: “Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” <br> The BlackRock letter suggests that the current economic system, which has come to prioritize corporate gains and private growth above all, sees trouble ahead and is looking for ways to save itself. That animating worry is visible in the titles of sessions on the Davos schedule (Day 1 panels: “How Is Rentier Capitalism Aggravating Inequality?” and “Why Is Our World Fractured?”). And the same realization has threaded the pronouncements of the other industry and political leaders in attendance. <br> Clearly, all the fretting is justified. Stock markets may be at record highs, but the good times can’t last forever — especially if their benefits accrue only to a select, highly visible few. The pitch of worry increases whenever a reminder arises. Nearly every time a report about the advance of income inequality comes out — the most recent, from Oxfam last week, stated that 82 percent of all wealth created in 2017 went to the global top 1 percent — one can almost feel collars being nervously pulled in office towers around the world. <br> Yet it doesn’t quite seem that Fink and others of the Davos elite are worried enough. <br> In an interview upon his arrival at the forum, less than a week after his cautionary missive went out, the BlackRock CEO appeared to temper his call for a devotion to social purpose. To reporters from CNBC, Fink noted: “The most important thing I said, and I repeated maybe three times. . . . Profits are paramount to everything a company does.” <br> But that’s precisely the outlook that has gotten them into this mess. It will have to be rethought — and perhaps discarded — if the popular frustration and upheaval disturbing the sleep of Davos Man are to be mitigated. <br> For several decades, in large part because of the influence of Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, global elites have understood corporations to have one responsibility: maximizing shareholder value. This view has led to the jettisoning of the same responsibility to society at large that Fink and those of his set now warn is needed. That diminution of a larger duty has led predictably to the resentment that the Davos elites suddenly eye with such concern. <br> Yes, it is possible to rebuild popular faith in the global economy and the role that corporations play in the world. But it will take more than an open letter, later walked back, to an audience of lukewarm peers. Companies such as BlackRock will need to change their business practices to become more tangibly pro-social — and in ways that are visible to those who aren’t in attendance at exclusive alpine events. Even marginal shifts in corporate behavior and the flow of capital could have enormous impact, but that would require a new approach to business that considers more than just the bottom line. Are asset managers such as Fink prepared to steer clear of lucrative but anti-social investment opportunities? How about a new openness to regulation and oversight? To avoid higher scrutiny, BlackRock lobbied aggressively to keep from being labeled “systemically important” under post-financial-crisis U.S. reforms. Perhaps it might just admit that it is. <br> Will such shifts take place? It’s difficult to say. The economic system hasn’t come crashing down quite yet, and it’s far easier to talk the talk than walk the walk. Davos Man may be nervous, but it doesn’t yet sound as though he’s nervous enough to change. <br> Read more: <br> Ed Rogers: Maybe Trump has a new message for Davos <br> Niall Ferguson: Trump exemplifies the Ugly American.

 Congratulations, Republicans. Now you have your own Obamacare. <br> Emerging from their caucus meeting in the Capitol basement Tuesday morning, House Republicans were jubilant about their tax bill, which was on course to clear Congress on Wednesday. <br> “It’s a total winner,” said Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.). “And I never lie.” <br> Veteran Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) observed: “They’re pretty giddy in there.” <br> Rep. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.), a urologist, announced: “This is good medicine for America.” <br> And for that prescription, added Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), “you don’t need a second opinion.” <br> Don’t you? <br> The deeply unpopular bill has the support of only a third of Americans, most of whom (correctly) perceive that it’s a giveaway to rich people and big corporations. “Any concerns that this won’t translate into a political win for Republicans?” ABC News’s Mary Bruce asked House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). <br> “No concerns whatsoever,” Ryan replied. He blamed the bill’s unpopularity on opponents and the media spreading “mistruths” and said opinions will improve when people experience what’s in the bill. “When people see their withholding improving and see bigger paychecks, a simpler tax code,” Ryan said, “results will make this popular.” <br> Where have I heard this before? Ah, yes, it was March 2010, as Obamacare was about to clear the House. Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said people should look beyond the “controversies” surrounding the bill, to when people experience its “very exciting” benefits. “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it,” she said. <br> Obamacare did much of what was advertised, and its popularity grew. But it didn’t do everything that was promised, and anything Americans didn’t like about the health-care system became the fault of Obamacare, even if unrelated to the law. Now, Republicans are making impossibly high promises, and if anything goes wrong — if the economy doesn’t boom, wages don’t soar and the middle class doesn’t rebound — it will be the fault of this legislation, soon to be labeled “the Trump Tax” by Democrats. <br> The parallels are eerie. In 2010, as now, lawmakers who drafted the legislation were confident it would be transformational. Then, as now, the legislation passed on an entirely partisan basis, with the opposition complaining about a hurried process and side deals. <br> Actually, the Trump Tax is in worse shape than Obamacare was. USA Today reported last week that the bill had “the lowest level of public support for any major piece of legislation enacted in the past three decades, including the Affordable Care Act in 2009.” In March 2009, the Quinnipiac poll found opposition to Obamacare exceeded support by nine points; the latest Quinnipiac poll finds opposition to the tax bill exceeding support by 29 points. <br> Republicans worked hard to convince Americans that Obamacare was a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the poor. Democrats can now argue, truthfully, that the Trump Tax is a transfer of income from the middle class to the wealthy and big business. Under the law, the middle fifth of American households will see an average increase in after-tax income next year of $930, while the top 1 percent get an average increase of $51,140, according to the Tax Policy Center. The rich even get a greater proportional increase in after-tax income: 2.3 percent, compared with 1.4 percent for the middle class. <br> While the “forgotten man” Trump lured with phony populism gets little benefit, the things that bothered the forgotten man about the tax code — a tangled mess of loopholes for businesses, the rich and Wall Street — remain intact. This will be a “bigger albatross” for Republicans than Obamacare was for Democrats, argues Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. “They own the tax code. When you are upset about taxes, you’re going to be upset about the Trump Tax.” <br> On top of that, Republicans now have claimed ownership of health care. The tax bill kills the individual mandate that underpinned Obamacare, which will leave 13 million additional people without coverage. <br> Tuesday morning, Ryan declared (falsely) that the bill would “especially” benefit middle-income families. He said it would “bid up” wages, repatriate jobs, provide economic growth of 3 percent a year and create upward mobility. The bill, he said, “is what it will take to help people who are struggling.” <br> Maybe he’s right and all those blue-chip economists and the nonpartisan analyses by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office and others are wrong. Maybe growth will dramatically exceed forecasts, millions will enter the labor force and find work, wages will soar and the $1.5 trillion tax bill will pay for itself. But if all that doesn’t happen, the Trump Tax will be blamed. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> E.J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> FROM THE moment of enactment, it was clear that the sweeping federal tax overhaul would have big repercussions for the states. The first step in responding is to get a more specific idea of just how large the impact may be and which taxpayers will bear the brunt. In Maryland, Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) provided a credible first estimate Thursday, in response to a request from Gov. Larry Hogan (R). The bottom line: Maryland state and local taxes go up sharply under the new Republican-drafted law, to the tune of $572.3 million during the first full fiscal year the law is in effect, which begins this October. The state’s share of that would be $392 million. For reference, the state general fund collected $16.7 billion in fiscal 2017; income taxes accounted for roughly half of that. <br> Most Marylanders — 68 percent — will see no change in their state and local taxes, and 4 percent will get a cut, according to the report. The 28 percent who pay more will generally consist of middle- and upper-middle-income households. Many such taxpayers itemize their deductions under current law but would have an incentive to take the new, larger federal standard deduction ($24,000 for a married couple filing jointly). Under Maryland law, anyone who takes the federal standard deduction must also take the state’s standard deduction on their state return — but that has not been increased. A fix to this and other new wrinkles, such as the elimination of federal personal exemptions, which were previously incorporated into Maryland’s tax code, must be found if Mr. Hogan’s promise of no net state tax increase for anyone is to be kept. <br> Mr. Hogan said Thursday that the way to do that is to permit people to continue itemizing on their state returns even if they don’t do so at the federal level. It might work — while making filing a lot more complex. For their part, Democratic leaders in the General Assembly seem to have had second thoughts about spending some or all of the windfall for state programs, and they have come up with proposals to return much of the revenue to taxpayers. Del.  C. William Frick (D) of Bethesda, who is also running for Montgomery County executive, proposes establishing a nonprofit charity for the public schools, to which people could donate in return for a state tax credit. Whether the Internal Revenue Service would enable such a workaround by giving the new entity federal tax-exempt status, and how state politicians would allocate the “charity” among various jurisdictions, are major questions. <br> Maryland politicians now face the politically fraught job of rewriting the state tax code in an election year. It’s a job they didn’t ask for, but they are going to have to tackle it nonetheless, for the sake of basic democratic accountability. The alternative would be to let the Republican federal tax plan impose higher state taxes on about a quarter of Marylanders — which is the sort of thing that should never happen by accident. <br> Read more: <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax law doesn’t just hurt blue states.

 Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican from Utah, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. <br> For too long, middle-class Americans have struggled with stagnant wages, sluggish labor markets and economic growth well below the historic average. Much of the economic stagnation stems from our nation’s broken tax code, which has become too big, too complex and too antiquated to satisfy the needs of 21st-century Americans. Our tax code is a self-inflicted wound on our economy. <br> That’s why leaders in both the Senate and House, as well as the Trump administration, have been working together on comprehensive legislation to overhaul our tax system. Tax reform will provide relief and bigger paychecks to low- and middle-income families, make America a better place to start and grow a business, and allow American businesses to compete in the global marketplace. <br> Those are the primary objectives of the Senate’s tax plan, which we unveiled this week. <br> Under our proposal, a family of four with income around $73,000 — roughly the median last year — could see their federal income tax bill reduced by nearly $1,500, a decrease of nearly 40 percent, and a corresponding boost in take-home pay. Of course, with close to 150 million individual income-tax filers in the United States, there is substantial variation among individuals and families. Even among those with identical incomes, precise amounts of tax relief will vary. Without question, though, the Senate tax bill provides tax relief to the middle class, as promised. <br> By reducing individual tax rates across the board, doubling the standard deduction and expanding the child tax credit, our proposal would put real money in the pockets of working families to help them save for the future or just make ends meet. Our proposal also vastly simplifies the tax code by clearing away numerous special deductions, credits and the like, while preserving important deductions for things such as mortgage interest, charitable contributions and medical expenses. These changes unrig our code so it works for ordinary Americans — not special interests. <br> In addition, the Senate proposal would give a leg up to small businesses, which are engines of job creation in our economy, employing about half of all U.S. workers and responsible for significant amounts of job creation. Under the current system, most owners of small businesses that are not incorporated have to subject all of their income — both their regular compensation and their business income — to individual tax rates, as they “pass through” earnings from their businesses onto their personal tax forms. Our plan provides a simple way to give business owners a lower rate on their salaries, allows them to deduct from their taxable income a significant portion of their pass-through business earnings and protects against those trying to “game the system” by mischaracterizing one form of income as another to get a lower tax bill. <br> Make no mistake, tax reform for small business helps the middle class. The Senate plan will help small businesses expand, invest, increase wages and hire more workers, all for the benefit of middle-class Americans. <br> On top of that, our plan will lower our punitively high statutory corporate tax rate, currently the highest in the industrialized world, from 35 percent to 20 percent, bringing us below the average rate among our major trading partners. The lower corporate rate, coupled with enhanced abilities for companies to recover costs of investing in things such as equipment, will help boost investment, leading to higher productivity and wages. A lower corporate rate, by itself, means gains for workers, because corporate taxes drag down wages. <br> The Senate proposal also modernizes our international tax system, giving incentives, or “carrots,” to attract economic activity to the United States. It also provides “sticks” to patrol against companies eroding our tax base by moving capital, including intellectual property, to low-tax jurisdictions simply to lower their tax bills. <br> Our current business-tax system punishes U.S. companies for doing business and investing in the United States and, in many ways, pushes economic activity outside the country. It also gives significant advantages to foreign companies, which is why so many American businesses have been opting to become foreign companies themselves. <br> The existing tax code means less U.S. economic activity and pushes American jobs, production and intellectual property abroad. Overhauling our business-tax system will increase wages, create jobs, bring back capital and investment and make the United States an inviting place to do business. <br> These reforms — on both the individual and business sides — ultimately translate to significant benefits for American families. We have a historic, once-in-a-generation opportunity to take action to improve the lives of the middle class and to help America prosper. This is a time to pay attention to those Americans who have felt left behind in economic stagnation, by providing tax relief and economic opportunity. The Senate tax bill released this week does just that. <br> Read more here: <br> Hugh Hewitt: Here’s how the GOP can pay for its tax plan <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 Donald Trump has been credited with many political innovations. But his greatest contribution to politics is not his insult comedy, or even his intuition for what makes good TV. <br> It’s that he’s found a way to be both Santa Clauses. <br> The Two Santa Claus Theory was coined by Republican strategist Jude Wanniski in 1976. He argued that if Democrats were going to offer generous spending programs — that is, anoint themselves the “Santa Claus” of spending — Republicans needed to proffer their own gifts as well. Republican insistence on deficit-conscious spending reductions certainly seemed Scrooge-like, after all, and was turning off voters. Wanniski proposed that the GOP boost its popularity by becoming the “Santa Claus of Tax Reduction.” <br> Trump has taken the Two Santa Claus Theory a step further. For a man who so unabashedly celebrates his own greed, he is proving himself quite generous to the general public (with other people’s money, of course). Rather than choosing between spending and tax cuts, he’s giving voters pretty much everything they want, price tags and deficits be damned. <br> Take the tax plan he announced Monday. It’s gonna be the greatest, most un-loser-like tax giveaway, ever. Especially if you’re rich. <br> Trump’s giant tax cuts look a lot like Jeb Bush’s previously announced, wealthy-tilted plan, except with even lower rates. Trump promises to reduce personal income-tax rates across the board, cutting the top marginal rate to just 25 percent from the current 39.6 percent. Trump would cut the top capital gains rate to 20 percent, from today’s 23.8 percent. <br> He would also reduce corporate taxes to 15 percent from their top current statutory rate of 35 percent and eliminate the estate tax. <br> Trump’s oft-repeated (but false) claim that he’d raise taxes on the wealthy seems based solely on his willingness to close the carried interest loophole. This currently allows private equity and hedge fund partners to pay taxes on a huge chunk of their income at lower capital gains rates, even though the earnings in question aren’t really capital gains. It’s an indefensible loophole that should have been ended ages ago. But it also affects relatively few people, and lowering wage-and-salary tax rates as much as Trump wants to would still create a net tax cut for the uber-rich, including probably most hedge-funders. <br> Estimates on the budgetary impacts of Bush’s (large but again still more modest) tax cuts suggest that Trump’s plan would also dramatically increase government deficits, despite the candidate’s declarations of revenue neutrality. <br> His attempt at offsetting the revenue shortfall comes primarily in the form of a gimmicky change to the treatment of taxation of overseas profits and vague language about reducing or eliminating “loopholes for the very rich and special interests.” But this should offer little comfort to fiscal conservatives, at least if they believe in the laws of arithmetic. <br> Very wealthy households typically deduct only about 15 percent of their adjusted gross incomes. Even completely zeroing out their deductions — which, to be clear, is not what Trump proposes, since he wants to keep the costly mortgage interest and charitable deductions intact — wouldn’t make up for the revenue losses from a 14.6-point top tax rate reduction. <br> On to his Spending Santa bona fides. <br> Though offering few details, Trump has broadly promised the moon, stars, perhaps even additional galaxies to greedy voters. He has vowed not to touch Social Security or Medicare, and has guaranteed more infrastructure spending, including but not limited to his “beautiful” wall on the Mexican border. <br> While denigrating Obamacare’s largesse, he has also promised more generous health care, among other goodies. <br> “I am going to take care of everybody,” he said on “60 Minutes,” explaining that “people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies, and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.” <br> So how does Trump reconcile his giveaways on both sides of the fiscal ledger with his party’s alleged commitment to fiscal conservatism? Oddly, he’s not citing the usual supply-sider nonsense that tax cuts magically increase tax revenue. Instead, Trump just promises he’ll get us a really good deal — typically by getting someone else to pay for it. Maybe it’s Mexico, maybe China; either way, someone else. How he’ll strong-arm these sovereign nations into paying our bills, he doesn’t quite bother explaining. <br> But no matter.

 Stephen Moore is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and an economic consultant with Freedom Works. He served as a senior economic adviser to the Trump campaign. <br> Democrats attacking the Trump tax cut have primarily voiced two objections: first, that it is a tax cut for the rich. And second, that it will blow a hole in the deficit. <br> If Republicans get smart, they can squash both of these arguments — and strike a blow for a much more ambitious, once-in-a-generation tax reform than the plans now on the table in the House and Senate. <br> To do so, they should revisit an idea that was central to the original Trump campaign plan that Larry Kudlow and I helped to craft. In every meeting, Donald Trump told us he didn’t want a tax cut “for rich people like me.” So we solved this problem by putting a global cap of $150,000 on all deductions and credits. <br> Under this approach, no deductions (such as for home mortgage interest or charitable contributions) would be eliminated from the tax code. But families whose write-offs exceeded the limit would have to pick and choose which ones to use. <br> For at least 95 percent of taxpayers, the cap would be so high as to be irrelevant — and, remember, because of the doubling of the standard deduction, fewer than 2 in 10 Americans would itemize deductions at all under the House GOP bill. <br> But for multimillionaires and, even more so, billionaires, such a cap would effectively end their deductions. This would raise hundreds of billions of dollars a year in tax collections and would end tax-avoidance schemes by those with armies of tax lawyers. Internal Revenue Service statistics tell us that at least one-third of the cost to the treasury from tax write-offs come from the tax returns of Americans in the top 1 percent of income. <br> In short, tax deductions are the playpens of the very rich. <br> We ran the numbers on what this buys you. The money raised could be used to cut the highest income-tax rate to 36 percent — without giving the top 1 percent a net tax cut — and help fund the tax cut for everyone else. <br> This would eliminate with one swipe almost all the thorny issues in the current tax bill. No longer would it be necessary to eliminate state and local tax deductions (a tough vote for Northeastern Republicans) or place a lower cap on the mortgage deduction (anathema to the real estate agents’ and home builders’ lobbies). The middle class wouldn’t face any new limitation on deductions for medical expenses and student loan expenses. <br> Sure, the housing lobby and K Street will hate this idea. But let them explain to the American people why Warren Buffett, Taylor Swift and LeBron James need a mortgage deduction to pay for their mansions. <br> The idea offers something for Democrats, too: a much more progressive tax code. How could liberals such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who argue the rich don’t pay their fair share, stand against this idea? They would look extremely hypocritical if they did. <br> History shows that eliminating loopholes is a far more effective and less economically destructive way to raise money from the wealthy than raising tax rates. For example, in the 1980s, after tax rates came down from 70 percent to 28 percent but most loopholes were eliminated, the share of taxes paid by the top 1 percent nearly doubled from 19 percent to more than 35 percent. <br> Higher tax rates historically have been at best a disappointing revenue raiser — in part because they make loopholes even more valuable and thus more likely to proliferate. (At a 30 percent tax rate, a deduction saves you 30 cents on the dollar, while at a 50 percent rate, you save 50 cents.) This was a point that Democrats such as former senators Bill Bradley and Sam Nunn and former House majority leader Richard A. Gephardt made persuasively in the 1980s. <br> Speaking of the 1980s, one of the enduring lessons of the last great bipartisan policy triumphs — the 1986 Tax Reform Act — is that sometimes the best way to roll over the special interests is to take them all on at once. My guess is that if the GOP adopted this tax code cleanup, public support would skyrocket across the political spectrum. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Republicans turn their irresponsible tax bill into monumentally unwise social policy <br> Catherine Rampell: If the tax bill is so great, why does the GOP keep lying about it? <br> Ed Rogers: Trump’s noisy tweets haven’t derailed tax reform <br> E.J.

 Nicholas Bagley is a professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School. <br> To finesse the tricky politics and brutal math of tax reform, Senate Republicans say that they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. For Republicans, repeal would be a trifecta: a blow to Obamacare, a money-saver for the federal government and a way to finance a permanent cut to the corporate tax rate. <br> Republicans are right about all of this. What they haven’t highlighted, however, are the trade-offs: the estimated 13 million people who will lose insurance if the mandate is repealed. Is the country really better off if millions of people forgo medical care, and millions more go bankrupt, so that corporations can pay lower taxes? That’s not a rhetorical question. Those are the stakes of the game. <br> Under the rules for budget reconciliation — the procedural mechanism that Republicans want to use to avoid a Democratic filibuster — the tax reform bill can’t raise the deficit after an initial 10-year period. To make the corporate tax cuts permanent, they will have to be offset by spending reductions or other tax increases. <br> The trouble is that cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent — which is the Republican goal — is wildly expensive. Finding politically acceptable offsets has proved difficult, and Republicans are scrounging under couch cushions for loose change to make the numbers work. <br> There’s a lot of loose change in health care because the federal government subsidizes most forms of health insurance. If you’re covered through your employer, you get a big tax break. If you buy health insurance on the exchanges, the federal government probably picks up part of the tab. And if you’re on Medicare or Medicaid, the taxpayer covers most of your medical bills. <br> Taking insurance away from people is, thus, an effective way to save the federal government money. Which brings us to the mandate. The mandate is a tax penalty levied against people who refuse to get insurance. The goal is to encourage people to get covered before they get sick. Healthy people might otherwise go without, confident that they can buy insurance if and when they need it. <br> But opting out creates a problem: If lots of healthy people refuse to get coverage, those who keep their insurance will overall be sicker. Because a group of relatively sick people will have higher medical costs than a group of relatively healthy people, insurers will have to charge more for coverage. That drives up the price of insurance for everyone. <br> The individual mandate counteracts the problem by encouraging healthy people to sign up. Spreading risk across the entire population keeps insurance premiums in check, which allows people who might otherwise have been priced out of the market to afford coverage. <br> The whole point of the mandate, then, is to expand the number of people with federally subsidized insurance, which naturally increases federal spending. By the same token, eliminating the mandate would reduce federal spending — but only because fewer people will have insurance. Repeal may sound costless, but it’s really a covert way to slash billions of dollars in spending on health care for the poor and disadvantaged. <br> This isn’t controversial. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal government will save $338 billion over 10 years if the mandate is repealed, but 13 million people will lose coverage. You can flyspeck the projections, but the broader point, as the CBO reports, stands: “Despite the uncertainty, some effects of this policy are clear: For instance, the federal deficit would be many billions of dollars lower than under current law, and the number of uninsured people would be millions higher.” <br> To make that more palatable, Republicans want to pair repeal with a promise to pass a bipartisan bill backed by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.). Among other things, the Alexander-Murray bill would restore Obamacare funding — the cost-sharing reductions — that President Trump abruptly terminated last month. <br> But Alexander-Murray needs Democratic votes to pass, and Democrats won’t gain much by cutting a deal. Elimination of the cost-sharing money has proven less disruptive than originally feared; indeed, because of canny decisions by state insurance commissioners and the complex financial machinery of the Affordable Care Act, many consumers have found better deals on the exchanges than they have in the past. That may partly explain why nearly 1.5 million people have enrolled in new Obamacare plans in the first two weeks of open enrollment — a 45 percent increase over last year. <br> So there won’t be any grand bargain. The trade-off here is both simple and brutal: Republicans want to pay for a permanent corporate tax by taking insurance from millions of people. Is that who we are as a nation? <br> Read more about this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Republicans turn irresponsible tax bill into monumentally unwise social policy <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 With the release of the Republican tax proposal, the most important tax debate in a generation is in full swing. Most reasonable experts agree that tax reform has the potential to spur investment and raise wages while also simplifying the system and increasing its fairness and legitimacy. The right question for debate is not the desirability of tax reform or even of business tax reform directed at spurring investment. It is the likely economic effect of particular proposals. <br> Unfortunately, the proposal on offer by House Republicans may well retard growth, reward the wealthy, add complexity to the code and cheat the future, even as it raises burdens on the middle class and the poor. There are three aspects of the proposal that I find almost inexplicable, except as an expression of the power of entrenched interests. <br> First, what is the rationale for passing tax cuts that increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion in this decade and potentially more in the future, instead of pursuing the kind of revenue-neutral reform adopted in 1986? There is no present need for fiscal stimulus. The national debt is already on an explosive path, even without taking into account large spending needs that are almost certain to arise in areas ranging from national security to infrastructure to addressing those left behind by globalization and technology. <br> Borrowing to pay for tax cuts is a way to defer pain, not avoid it. Ultimately, the power of compound interest makes necessary tax increases or spending cuts that are even larger than those tax reductions. But in the meantime, debt-financed tax cuts would raise the trade deficit and reduce investment, thereby cheating the future. <br> Second, what is the case for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent? For at least five years under the GOP proposal, businesses would be able to write off investments in new equipment entirely in the year that those investments are made. So the government would be sharing to an equal extent in the costs of and returns from investment, eliminating any tax-induced disincentive to invest. The effective tax rate on new investment would be reduced to zero, or less, even before considering the corporate rate reduction. A corporate rate reduction serves only to reward monopoly profits, other rents or past investments. Given the trends of the past few years, are shareholders really the most worthy recipients of such a windfall? <br> Proponents of the House approach defend it by pointing to international considerations. Unfortunately, the “territorial” approach being pushed by the House, which would renounce the objective of taxing the global income of U.S. companies, could easily encourage offshore production. Wouldn’t it be much better for the United States to lead an initiative to prevent a race to the bottom in global corporate taxation than for it to try to win a race to the bottom? <br> Third, why include new complexities that help the richest taxpayers while taking steps that hurt middle-income families? Why should passive owners of businesses that are already avoiding the corporate tax get a big rate reduction to 25 percent when those who actually operate and work in such businesses pay at a higher rate? What is the rationale for eliminating the estate tax when it is paid by only 0.2 percent of estates? <br> At a bare minimum, if such provisions are to be adopted, one would assume they would be paid for, to the maximum extent possible, through steps such as eliminating the carried-interest loophole or loopholes that enable real estate tax shelters. Not so. The proposal instead goes after measures such as the adoption tax credit, deductions for major medical expenses and the deductibility of student-loan interest. These seem like far more important benefits to preserve than carried interest. <br> Congress should instead return to the 1986 approach of revenue-neutral tax reform, while being careful not to adversely affect the progressivity of the tax system. This would enable what is most needed now: strengthening incentives for investment in the United States relative to other countries and raising the legitimacy of the tax code. <br> It is possible (though I doubt it) that the questions I have raised here have good answers. And there may be reasons that 1986 is an inapplicable model for today. <br> What is certain, though, is that we have a once-in-a-generation debate underway. Even those who disagree on policy should be able to agree on the importance of not making decisions until all relevant analytical work can be completed. <br> Read more: <br> Jennifer Rubin: Threading the needle on the GOP tax plan <br> Catherine Rampell: The dumbest part of Trump’s dumb tax plan <br> Paul Waldman: The new GOP tax plan proves it: The problem isn’t just Trump.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> REPUBLICANS AIM to unveil Wednesday a long-awaited tax plan, premised on the fanciful idea that slashing taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years will somehow leave the federal budget better off. And it is not just the GOP’s most blinkered ideologues who have bought into this wishful thinking. <br> “I think at the end of the day this will actually be reducing the deficit because it’s going to finally get this economy moving,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Sunday on “Meet the Press.” In a sentence, Mr. Portman erased much of the credibility he developed while decrying deficits during the Obama years or running the White House Office of Management and Budget during the George W. Bush presidency. <br> Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the few moderate Republicans left in Congress, was hardly more responsible. “If we have just four-tenths of 1 percent increase in our [gross domestic product], which is entirely realistic, it will cover the cost of the tax reform package,” she claimed. In fact, those growth numbers cannot be assumed, and betting the federal budget on hopes of loads of new revenue is highly risky. <br> Just a couple days earlier, an independent report on the Republicans’ most recent tax-reform framework found that the plan would wallop the federal budget, even when effects on economic growth are considered. The Tax Policy Center concluded that cutting the corporate tax rate, encouraging business investment and enhancing incentives to work would each encourage economic expansion — modestly. The extra growth would result in maybe $50 billion in new federal revenue over 10 years. To secure these small economic gains and that tiny revenue bump, Republicans would cut taxes by well over a trillion dollars, leaving a massive hole in the budget. Over time, the negative consequences of higher federal borrowing would be a serious drag on the economy. <br> The bill Republicans present this week will look somewhat different than the older framework the Tax Policy Center’s experts assessed. But the warning should still shake Republicans who claimed to be deficit hawks when Barack Obama was president. Tax reform could be worthwhile, but only if it is paid for. Republicans such as Mr. Portman used to understand as much. <br> The country faces a huge funding squeeze as the Baby Boomers retire, raising pension and health-care costs. The Treasury will need ample revenue merely to maintain investments in everything else — roads, college aid, national parks, scientific research. A tax plan based on hopes, prayers and fiction puts all of that at risk. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Jennifer Rubin: Republicans are running out of justifications for their tax plan <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump’s tax proposal won’t actually help the middle class.

 Nearly every claim Republicans are using to market their tax plan is at best a distortion, at worst a deliberate falsehood. <br> Which raises the question: If their plan is really so great, why not sell it on the merits? <br> Consider just a few of the Republicans’ key talking points and their tenuous relationship to reality. <br> 1. The tax cuts will pay for themselves. <br> Republicans claim that tax cuts will unleash boundless economic growth. Through that growth, we’ll all become richer. And as our incomes rise, tax revenue will, too. Hence, the tax cuts will be free. <br> Some Republicans even argue that the bill is so pro-growth that it will reduce the federal debt. <br> “If we pass this tax reform package in something like its current form, we will reduce the size of the deficits,” Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), erstwhile budget hawk, said on “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “We will have smaller debt than we otherwise would.” <br> Despite searching high and low, however, Republicans have been unable to locate any credible tax outfit that thinks their proposals will do anything other than lose money. <br> Republicans’ solution: Just lie about what the experts say! <br> In that same interview, Toomey cited a Tax Foundation report he claimed showed that the Senate bill would reduce deficits once you accounted for growth.  <br> The Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank, uses relatively optimistic assumptions about the economic effects of tax cuts. But even its analysts determined the bill would increase deficits by a half-trillion dollars over the next decade. <br> 2. The tax plan primarily helps the middle class. <br> Nope. The biggest benefits go to higher-income Americans, both in raw dollar terms and as a percentage of income, as New York University School of Law tax professor David C. Kamin has illustrated. <br> To give you a sense of scale: Under the Senate bill, households making more than $1 million receive an average tax cut of nearly $50,000 in 2027; those making $40,000 to $50,000 get an average cut of $480. <br> Averages also disguise a lot. Lots of lower- and middle-income families won’t benefit at all. Many will be worse off. <br> Under both the Senate and House bills, nearly half of households making less than $100,000 will see either a negligible tax change or even a tax hike in 2019, according to calculations from Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts. By 2027, that share rises to 61 percent under the House bill, which phases down some of the provisions that help middle-class families. <br> Things look even worse for this population when you recall that deficit-financed tax cuts must eventually be paid for somehow. “Somehow” likely includes cuts to government spending, which disproportionately benefits lower- and middle-income families. <br> 3.The bill will hurt President Trump. <br> To be clear, we don’t know precisely what either bill would do to his taxes, because Trump won’t release his returns. But based on what we do know, it’s safe to say he and his family stand to benefit yooge-ly. <br> For example, both the Senate and House tax bills would repeal the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which cost Trump tens of millions of dollars in the most recent (leaked) tax return we have, from 2005. Both bills offer big tax cuts for income from “pass-through” corporations — such as the Trump Organization. And both bills would either kill or scale back estate taxes, allowing Trump’s kids to inherit his fortune tax-free.  <br> 4. This will be the biggest tax cut in history. <br> Arguably, the biggest tax cut ever was in 1872, according to Tax History Project Director Joseph Thorndike. That’s when Congress decided to get rid of income taxes entirely. <br> If you think going back 145 years is unfair, note that it’s also not the biggest tax cut in the past 100 years. Or the past 50. <br> In fact, it’s not even the biggest tax cut in the past five years, in either inflation-adjusted dollar terms or as a share of gross domestic product, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. <br> 5. The economy desperately needs a big tax cut. <br> Lots of headline measures, such as unemployment, suggest the economy is doing well. The time for deficit-financed stimulus is when the economy is in recession, not one of the longest expansions on record. Otherwise we’ll have no powder left in the keg when the economy actually needs it. <br> So: Why all the falsehoods? Why not just sell their tax agenda on the merits? <br> Presumably because Trump and Republican lawmakers know they’re offering a plan the public doesn’t want. Ergo, they need to promise things the tax plan doesn’t do.  <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous. Here’s why. <br> The Post’s View: Trump says the GOP tax plan would make him a ‘big loser.’ Prove it. <br> Catherine Rampell: Who wins biggest in the GOP tax plan? The lazy rich. <br> Robert J.

 2017 draws to a close. “Feminism” has been declared the word of the year. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has just urged women to have more babies for the good of the state. <br> A joke? An outtake from “The Handmaid’s Tale”? Alas, neither. At his weekly news briefing Thursday, Ryan (R-Wis.) suggested that the most important way to shore up the economy was for Americans to have bigger families. <br> “This is going to be the new economic challenge for America: People. . . . I did my part, but we need to have higher birth rates in this country,” he said as part of a riff on how Republicans planned to tackle entitlement reform in 2018. “We have something like a 90 percent increase in the retirement population of America but only a 19 percent increase in the working population in America. So what do we have to do? Be smarter, more efficient, more technology . . . still going to need more people.” <br> And we all know whose job that is. <br> It’s not that Ryan is wrong, exactly. The United States is in the middle of a baby bust, perhaps one more dire than we realize. Last year saw a record-low fertility rate, and an even sharper drop is predicted for 2017. To blithely instrumentalize the miracle of life in homage to the House speaker: We’ll need more bodies to keep the economy humming. <br> Even so, Ryan’s comments are shocking in their hypocrisy, not to mention obliviousness — at best — to the context in which they’ll be received. <br> To be clear: The prospect of having more children is not necessarily off-putting to women. True, Ryan’s comments feel particularly ill considered at this moment, given the creepy Congressional Surrogacy Surprise that emerged from the office of former House Republican Trent Franks (Ariz.) last week. And it is more than a little insulting to insinuate that to “do their part,” women need to lie back and think of America. That said, research has shown that many women in the United States have fewer children than they would like to have and begin having them later than they would prefer. <br> But this suboptimal situation is directly related to policies the speaker and his party have pursued. If Ryan wants more babies to prop up the United States, maybe he and the rest of the GOP should consider making it easier to live in America with one. <br> The reasons for delaying family formation are often economic. When those of child-bearing age spend their entire stagnant incomes on rent, debt and health care, the prospect of having a baby recedes into the distance. The effect is most acute for women, who are often least able to afford housing, whose incomes are likely to sink after breaks for childbearing, and whose health risks increase with motherhood. (Maternal mortality is on the rise in the United States, yet the GOP’s proposed — and mercifully failed — health-care reform considered cuts to pregnancy-related benefits.) <br> Yet rather than promoting policies that might ease the economic pressure, Ryan and his party are peddling a “tax reform” bill that prioritizes fiscal favors for corporations, which cannot have children, over everyday citizens who can. And once passed, the bill will cripple our country’s ability to pay for the sort of safety net that could make a new baby a cause for celebration rather than alarm. <br> If we must have tax reform, why not at the very least implement a more effective child tax credit that is fully deductible for those at the lowest income brackets? That would give those citizens generously contributing new “people” to our economy some support to help make ends meet. Or why not promote a real paid-leave proposal that encompasses both maternal and paternal leave, to make it easier to combine child care and work? The paltry provision attached to the bill is a gift for corporations, not parents. <br> Of course, maybe Ryan does really care about our demographic difficulties but doesn’t want to go about fixing them through economic means. If so, there is the obvious solution of liberalizing immigration, yet Republicans from top to bottom have refused to consider it. <br> When it comes down to it, there is a raft of policies that could help mitigate the problem of falling birth rates. The fact that they remain unimplemented suggests that maybe Ryan hasn’t “done his part” as well as he thinks. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Michael Gerson: GOP leaders made a huge wager — and they’re losing <br> Dana Milbank: The lights go out on the Republican Party <br> Catherine Rampell: Dear GOP: Stop investing in so much stuff <br> Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles: A moment of truth for our country’s financial future <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: The myth of Paul Ryan <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Regarding the Nov. 21 editorial “A tax plan gut check ”: <br> I’ve got questions. With the debt increased by no less than $1.5 trillion over the next decade, what will Republicans do on those many occasions when they will have to confront increases in the debt ceiling? How low is the likelihood that they will just sign off on them? Who will get the blame (and these things always are about blame), especially when the Democrats retake the White House? And what compensating budget cuts will they righteously insist on? Will they be from Medicare or Medicaid or, perhaps, from preschool programs? What will be the increased frequency and duration of government shutdowns? Is there any dialogue about these things? <br> David Cohen, Arlington <br> Steve Pearlstein’s Nov. 19 Business column, “The business lobby’s chance to do right by America,” about the Business Roundtable and the Republican tax proposal, made a substantial contribution to public understanding of the pitfalls of Congress’s direction. By pointing out that these proposals will create either “runaway federal debt” or meaningful reductions in essential government services, he shifted the burden back to the business lobbyists who support the current tax legislation. <br> Mr. Pearlstein’s argument is backed up with concrete data. In their work on U.S. competitiveness, Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin of the Harvard Business School found that while business leaders generally think corporate tax reform is needed, they feel equally strongly about a responsible federal budget. <br> A reckless gamble on tax cuts that is projected to contribute to an increase of our national debt from $20 trillion today to $33.1 trillion in the next 10 years (based on Tax Policy Center figures) is not likely to enhance business confidence and encourage leaders to make the investments necessary to elevate the growth in our economy. <br> Alexander Boyle, Chevy Chase <br> The writer, who retired as vice chairman of the Chevy Chase Bank, is a member of the Leadership Council of the Tax Policy Center. <br> The Nov. 21 news article “Here are the 5 key questions about the Republican tax plan” laid out the main deficiencies that endanger the plan’s chance of passage, including its negative effect on many middle-class taxpayers and the fact that it would add $1.5 trillion to America’s $20 trillion (and growing) debt. Whatever happened to discussion of the Simpson-Bowles plan to reduce the national debt? <br> Launched in 2010 by President Barack Obama, this bipartisan commission produced a plan with six major components, including discretionary spending cuts, lower income and corporate tax rates, and Social Security reform. Simpson-Bowles, if implemented, would have reduced the federal deficit by nearly $4 trillion by 2020, stabilized the growth of debt held by the public by 2014, and reduced debt 60 percent by 2023 and 40 percent by 2035 . Why not reopen consideration of the Simpson-Bowles plan instead of trying to push the deeply flawed Republican proposal through Congress?   <br> Gary Usrey, Arlington <br> In her Nov. 17 op-ed, “For humans, this tax plan is going to hurt,” Catherine Rampell described the two tax-reform bills in Congress. Her salient point was that the vast majority of the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts are headed to companies and are permanent. The minority of cuts go to individuals and are temporary. <br> GOP leaders claim that companies will invest their money to increase productivity and worker compensation. We are a “demand” economy, not a “supply” economy. We don’t have middle-class buyers with cash aching for a greater supply of cars or major home upgrades, as was the case after World War II. <br> Most executives are not going to invest to increase supply without new demand. Instead, they’ll put tax-cut money into stock buybacks and dividends — not more jobs. Those who do invest in supply without new demand are looking to cut labor costs. That suggests fewer jobs, not more.   <br> Responsible members of the middle class are not going to make major purchases unless their standard of living is improved sustainably. But their tax cuts are temporary. That has no lasting impact on jobs. <br> So in all these ways to deploy tax-cut money, the impact on jobs is near zero or negative. <br> Walt Culver, Reston <br> How many middle-class Americans realize that removing deductions for property taxes and restricting mortgage-interest deductions will depress the value of their homes? In my case, the loss could easily be more than $100,000. <br> I resent the Republican attempt not only to increase the taxes I must pay but also to depress the value of the property I own. <br> It is said, “Give a poor man $100 and he will spend it because he must. Give a rich man $100 and he will save it because he can.” The Republican tax bills will shift money from active circulation to stagnation in interest-bearing accounts. It sounds like bad economics to me. <br> Melvin F. Houston, Ellicott City <br> Take from the poor and give to the rich. In a nutshell, that’s the Republican tax bill — a reverse Robin Hood plan. This was outlined clearly in the Nov. 22 The Finance 202 blog excerpt, “To a skeptical Wall Street, GOP tax plan would just create a ‘fiscal sugar high’ ” [Power Post], which reported that after a decade, the plan would raise taxes on those earning less than $75,000. <br> The only mystery remaining is this: Where is the outrage from hard-working Americans? <br> David Tate, Arlington 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> DURING HIS visit to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, President Trump hailed the low number of people killed. “Sixteen people certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” he said with some relief about the official death toll, a number that has since been raised to 64 . It is now becoming increasingly clear, though, that those numbers are inaccurate. Far more people died as a result of the storm, and others remain imperiled by life-threatening conditions as Puerto Rico still struggles to recover from back-to-back storms that hit three months ago. <br> The island — home to more than 3 million Americans — needs all the help it can get. But the bad situation there threatens to get even worse if Republican lawmakers persist with a tax-reform bill that would devastate Puerto Rico’s economy with crippling new taxes. <br> The magnitude of the damage suffered by Puerto Rico was underscored with a report from the New York Times that called into question the official death count from Hurricane Maria. Data analysis by the newspaper found that 1,052 more people than usual died on the island during the 42 days after Maria made landfall on Sept. 20. People suffering from certain chronic conditions, such as diabetes, died at higher rates, and there was a surge in deaths from sepsis, a complication of severe infection. Delayed medical treatment and poor conditions in homes and hospitals — notably lack of power or access to safe drinking water — are suspected as playing a role. While there has been some progress, conditions are still grim. <br> Only 64 percent of the power grid has been restored. The human impact of that statistic was poignantly detailed by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda in a Post op-ed, which describes his uncle going 85 days without being able to turn on a light, stock a refrigerator or take a hot shower. Times reporter Sheri Fink visited a senior-citizen complex without power where vulnerable residents have fallen in the dark, medications are missed and special diets go by the wayside. Such situations would not be tolerated in any mainland American city or state. <br> The disgraceful treatment of Puerto Rico as an afterthought is evident in tax measures being proposed by the GOP in its overhaul of the tax code. Both House and Senate bills would impose new taxes on U.S. companies with operations in Puerto Rico, lumping the U.S. territory into the same category as foreign countries. The supposed goal is to protect and create American jobs, but, as Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosello told us, it would actually kill American jobs in Puerto Rico, devastating an already struggling economy. “Unconscionable,” he said of the proposals, pointing out how members of Congress have traveled to Puerto Rico, seen the catastrophic damage and promised help. “True hypocrisy,” he said. <br> Full details of final legislation being worked out by House and Senate negotiators have yet to be released, so it’s unclear how the residents of Puerto Rico will be treated. Here’s an idea: How about treating them like the Americans they are? Drop these unfair taxes and, while Congress is at it, approve the federal aid needed to get Puerto Rico on its feet. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Lin-Manuel Miranda: This is what Puerto Ricans need from the government.

 Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway musicals “Hamilton” and “In the Heights,” is a composer, playwright and actor. <br> Since Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico 84 days ago, my Uncle Elvin hasn’t had electricity. You read that right. Eighty-four days without being able to turn on a light, or stock a refrigerator, or take a hot shower. Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans on the island cannot do the simple things we all take for granted. Add to this lack of power the destruction of thousands of homes, rural areas still isolated, small businesses not operating and an ever-increasing migration of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland. It will take a long time for Puerto Rico to be totally functional again under the best of circumstances. <br> The federal government’s response to the disaster in Puerto Rico has been painfully slow and not commensurate with the hurricane response in Texas and Florida. It reminds me of Ricky Martin’s 1995 song “María.” He sang, “un pasito pa’lante María, un dos tres, un pasito pa’tras.” That’s the reality in Puerto Rico — one step forward, one step backward. We rejoiced when the first package of $5 billion in aid was approved by Congress. But then the House included a 20 percent import tax on products manufactured in foreign jurisdictions in the tax-reform bill it passed in November. Because Puerto Rico would be considered a “foreign jurisdiction” under the bill, this tax would deal a mortal blow to the island’s fragile economy, costing up to 250,000 jobs. <br> Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and so many of my friends in the artistic community can continue to do fundraising activities. We can march on Washington. I can write music and dedicate proceeds to Puerto Rico; Americans from all walks of life can continue to donate, following the examples of the 150,000 who already donated $22 million to the Hispanic Federation relief fund. There’s no shortage of compassion and goodwill for Puerto Rico among the American people. But it must be matched by the recognition of our government that the American citizens of Puerto Rico need, demand and require equal treatment. <br> I’m much more comfortable writing a song than a political opinion column. Calling members of Congress, knocking on their doors and asking you to do the same is strange territory for me. I can already imagine the online comments: “Stick to entertainment.” I wish I could. But the news is full of scandals and tragedies, and every day is a struggle to keep Puerto Rico in the national conversation. <br> Puerto Rico needs a lifeline that only Congress and the Trump administration can provide. The list of needed actions is short, straightforward and agreed upon by Puerto Ricans of all political stripes. First, drop the crippling 20 percent excise tax on Puerto Rican products. This is an easy one given that the tax doesn’t exist yet. It can simply be removed from the tax-reform bill right now being finalized in House-Senate conference negotiations. <br> Then, let’s take care of the health of 3.4 million Americans on the island. Puerto Rico receives only a small portion of the Medicaid funding that it would qualify for as a state. The island’s hospitals and health centers are struggling in the wake of the storm. We all have watched in horror how the death toll has been undercounted — by perhaps 1,000 people, according to credible estimates. With the health of so many at risk, let’s provide Medicaid parity while streamlining enrollment to many who are not working and need health care. <br> Next, move quickly on the $94 billion aid package requested by the Puerto Rican government. I was last in Puerto Rico in November; the massive need is not an invention. Alongside the Hispanic Federation, we’ve worked to raise money to purchase and distribute millions of pounds of food and millions of gallons of water. We have made water-filtration systems available to schools as part of the American Federation of Teachers’ Operation Agua. These partnerships, made possible by the generosity of everyday Americans, have been incredible. But they’re not enough. <br> Finally, Puerto Rico cannot pay its debt to creditors. President Trump said it best during his rocky visit, before his administration walked his comment back — “wipe that out” and move on. Investors do this every day. On Broadway, I’ve seen many invest in what they hope will be a successful show, only to lose their investment. Puerto Rico’s creditors should do the right thing and walk away. It is the only way forward. Anything short of full debt forgiveness would be a brutal form of economic punishment to a people already suffering. <br> The past 84 days have been trying for Puerto Ricans on the island and in the diaspora. More Puerto Ricans join us on the mainland every day. These are soon-to-be voters, moving to Florida, to Texas, to South Carolina, to Pennsylvania, just in time for midterm elections. It’s becoming increasingly clear that helping Puerto Rico is not just the right thing to do, it’s also the politically smart thing to do. <br> I remain in awe of the generosity of everyday Americans toward their fellow citizens. Congress, meet the American people where they already are. My Uncle Elvin and so many others wait in Puerto Rico. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Puerto Rico is still in the dark <br> The Post’s View: The misery in Puerto Rico is completely unacceptable <br> Jacqueline N.

 Erick Erickson is editor of the Resurgent. <br> Being a conservative who does not cheerlead President Trump can make one feel like the Prophet Amos. Amos went to Israel at a time of great prosperity to tell the nation God would destroy it for failing to care for its widows, its poor, its orphans and its refugees. Everyone looked around at the success, riches, and plenty and mocked the prophet. Like the people of Israel in a time of plenty, it is easy for conservatives right now to focus on the successes of Trump’s first year in office. But those on the right should consider the long-term costs. <br> Like many conservatives, I am delighted with a number of achievements in Trump’s first year. His administration has steered numerous good judges into the federal judiciary. Neil M. Gorsuch is a solid Supreme Court justice. The anti-competitive business regulations pursued by the Obama administration have been rolled back. Congress has passed a tax reform bill allowing U.S. businesses to repatriate tens of billions of dollars, give bonuses and pay raises to employees and invest in U.S. business infrastructure. These changes are inarguably good. <br> But there are many costs. Conservatives are reveling in their successes and increasing their immorality concurrently. The conservatives who 20 years ago wanted to chase President Bill Clinton out of town for having sex in the Oval Office are now trying to ignore the current president reportedlycheating on his current wife with a porn star. It has become far easier for conservatives to believe lies than believe truths, and it has become far easier for conservatives to turn a blind eye to injustices than speak up. More and more conservatives are modeling Trump’s bad behaviors. His vulgarity, his thin skin, his willingness to insult and demean, and his willingness to degrade his office are now reflected in conservative political leaders who increasingly see their goal as beating the other side instead of advancing ideas and sound public policy. <br> In straining to beat the other side, they are beginning to look like the other side. The party of small government is perfectly happy to grow government as long as Trump is spending the money. The party of limited government is perfectly happy to have a powerful chief executive as long as Trump is wielding the power. Trump and his supporters have also doubled-down on unwise precedents set by the Obama administration. President Barack Obama investigated leaks to reporters such as James Rosen; Trump now seems to revel in the idea of shutting down whole networks whose coverage he hates. Republicans who decried the left’s hostility to free speech in the Obama years now champion censorship of their opponents. <br> It is safe to say many of the president’s supporters have concluded that arguments and debates no longer work, so they will take what they can get as quickly as they can before the tide rolls in and washes this administration away. While perhaps an honest way of looking at things, those gains will be fleeting. The short-term gains of this administration, like those of the last, are being achieved by executive order and appointment. So too then can the gains of this administration be wiped out as easily as those of the last. <br> Along the way, conservatives are ceding moral arguments and policy arguments. There will always be partisans on the left who hate anything those on the right do. But they are not who conservatives have to worry about. Conservatives have to worry about those in the middle who are persuadable. They have to worry about minority voters increasingly skeptical of the secular drift of the Democratic Party. They have to worry about younger voters. All of these people are not only increasingly alienated by Trump’s behavior but also by his defenders’ constant justifications for it. <br> At a time of growing hostility to people of faith in the United States and a collapse of morality, the evangelical embrace of Trump hurts their Christian witness and minimizes the number of sympathetic ears to their cause. It has become harder to make the case for family and morality as prominent evangelicals applaud and justify the bad behaviors of a thrice-married adulterer who believes immigrants should be judged based on their nation of origin, not the content of their own character. <br> In a final irony of a party that uses “But Gorsuch” as the last, best rallying cry for Donald Trump, not only has Anthony M. Kennedy not retired from the Supreme Court, but also he has drifted left. He may now stay, hoping for someone other than Trump as president in 2020 and, should he retire with a Democratic-controlled Senate, the precedent is now there for Democrats to just ignore a replacement who Trump nominates. The conservatives who rallied to Trump to save the high court may very well lose it because of him. <br> Though many conservatives, myself included, have cheered the successes of this administration, most of them are easily reversible and, along the way, it will be harder and harder to separate the successes from the low character and behavior of the man whose name is connected to them. Conservatives may no longer care, but for most Americans, character still matters. At some point, those on the right will pay the price. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> E.J.

 Regarding the Jan. 17 Metro article “Democrats push back on U.S. tax law”: <br> Democratic Maryland state legislators are considering changes to reverse the impact of the federal income tax law. Under the federal law, residents in many cases will no longer be able to deduct as much state income tax as before. <br> Some states increased taxes largely on the basis of federal deductibility. The federal law would recover some of this money, in part to allow for widespread income tax reduction. Federal income tax rates are now lower, offsetting much of this loss of deductibility. Under consideration in Maryland is the creation of the ability to make an annual charitable contribution on state taxes to support Maryland public schools. This contribution would theoretically be deductible on federal taxes as a gift to charity and would be offset on Maryland’s books by giving the taxpayer a 95 percent state tax credit. <br> Sounds like a shell game to me, and I am confident the Supreme Court would rule it unconstitutional, because state funding for schools is not a charity but an obligation of government. If Maryland received no contributions to the new charity, it would fund the schools anyway through state law. <br> Proponents are confident that such a change would be a win for everyone involved with no downside. I see many negative impacts: reduced federal ability to provide tax relief and promote growth without worsening the national debt, and the potential for the government to reduce the deductibility of charitable contributions.  <br> Bob Hugman, Woodbridge 
 “Do we have any historical evidence that lowering tax rates, particularly among the richest strata, generates economic growth, as the Republicans always predict? Has this ever worked?” <br> — A reader <br> The answer is “no.” As Congress tackles “tax reform,” we really don’t have conclusive historical evidence of the relationship between tax rates and economic growth. To be sure, studies abound, but they are of two distinct types that — at least superficially — contradict each other. <br> The first approach compares tax rates with individual behaviors that should be good or bad for economic growth. Do lower taxes stimulate entrepreneurship and business investment? The answer, say some of these studies, is “yes.” Lower taxes encourage pro-growth behaviors; higher taxes do the opposite. The economy’s overall growth is assumed to benefit or suffer. <br> It’s this approach that the Trump administration touts in proposing that the top corporate tax rate be cut from 35 to 20 percent. The result will be a surge of business investment, which in turn will lift the wages of U.S. workers, says Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. <br> As companies invest more in computers, software and other technological advances, workers become more productive. Because they’re more valuable, their wages will rise. Hassett has predicted — controversially — that enactment of Trump’s corporate tax cut would result, over perhaps a three- to five-year period, in wage gains of $3,000 to $7,000 for households with the median income ($59,000 in 2016). A $3,000 wage increase would represent a 5 percent gain. <br> Be skeptical, cautions the second type of study. Rather than examine the effect of taxes on individual behaviors (say, entrepreneurship), it compares tax rates with the overall growth of the economy (gross domestic product). Do lower tax rates cause faster GDP growth? One prominent study by economist Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service found little connection. <br> This study “suggests that past changes in tax rates have had no large clear effect on economic growth,” Gravelle concluded. Faster growth wasn’t associated with lower tax rates or slower growth with higher tax rates. The most telling example is the 1950s, when the top rate on personal income averaged nearly 85 percent, more than twice today’s top rate of 39.6 percent. Yet, annual GDP growth averaged 4 percent in the 1950s compared with a recent average of about 2 percent. <br> This doesn’t mean that taxes have no economic effects. But the effects are often swamped by other influences. Economic growth is an incredibly complex process. Aside from government policies, here are some other factors that determine growth: new technologies; the business cycle; the quality of managers and workers; shifting demographics (women’s entrance into the labor force, an aging population); the competitiveness of markets; inflation — and much more. <br> The 1950s showed how this worked in practice. After World War II, there was a huge backlog of consumer demand for cars, housing and appliances caused by the interruptions of the Great Depression (1929-1939) and the war (1941-1945). Similarly, new technologies were waiting to be exploited: synthetic fibers, passenger airplanes, television. Given the wartime destruction, the United States dominated world trade. These were the forces that propelled the economy. <br> Some advocates of lower tax rates overstate their case. Like many others before him, Trump has credited President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts for the strong economy of the 1980s. At best, this is an innocent exaggeration. The real catalyst for the 1980s boom was the conquest of double-digit inflation, which fell from 13 percent in 1980 to 4 percent in 1982. This lowered interest rates and initiated a bull stock market. <br> The truth is that, among economists, there is no consensus on the role of tax rates in explaining economic growth. Some economists support Hassett’s general approach; others don’t. <br> Most critical has been Lawrence H. Summers — treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and once a top adviser to President Barack Obama — who, in a series of blistering commentaries, has dismissed Hassett’s analysis as wrong and justifying a giveaway to the rich, who own much corporate stock. Companies have ample cash to finance new investment, he says. If they don’t invest, added tax cuts won’t change their minds. <br> The lack of consensus doesn’t mean we should do nothing. A tax code with fewer tax preferences (a.k.a.“loopholes” or subsidies) would be simpler and would leave more business decisions to the market and not to tax planners. It might even spur faster growth. <br> But it’s essential that the lower tax rates be achieved by ending tax preferences as opposed to borrowing. To run up the debt to finance tax cuts for favored constituencies, as the Republicans propose, is not an exercise in enlightened economics. It’s politics at its most cynical. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Ed Rogers: Trump’s noisy tweets haven’t derailed tax reform <br> Kirk J.

 The United States is about to hear a great sucking sound as some of its best and brightest young people leave the country to get the training they need. The GOP-backed tax bill, sold as a job creator, is in fact a job killer. The House version of the bill would weaken the U.S. workforce by making it harder for the children of the middle class and poor to access postsecondary education in two broad areas: It would raise their costs by eliminating tax deductions for tuition and would likely cause reductions to student-assistance programs. <br> Canada and European countries will not believe their good fortune. They will expand their already superb academic programs and attract America’s talented young people, who will pay far less for their educations there than in the United States. These other countries will then do what they can to entice them to stay. It will be a talent bonanza that will only strengthen their countries. <br> Congratulations, GOP, you are about to drive a stake through the heart of the U.S. economy. Your self-inflicted national loss is the world’s gain.  <br> Keith Martin, Washington <br> The writer is executive director of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health. <br> Where is the Democratic Party’s tax-reform plan? <br> We see on TV and in The Post the House Republican tax plan and the Senate Republican tax plan, sometimes even with side-by-side comparisons. <br> What is needed is a Democratic tax plan so the media can add a third column to their charts. <br> It is not enough for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to go on television and complain about the GOP plans and then ask the Republicans to please, please negotiate with Democrats. <br> Maybe the Democrats’ plan should start with a $36,000 standard deduction and should keep the state and local tax deductions. <br> Charles Edwin Myers, Bethesda 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> RUSTLING UP votes for the GOP tax plan, President Trump on Tuesday reportedly assured Senate Democrats that he would not personally benefit from the proposal. In fact, he insisted, his accountant told him he will be a “big loser” if the House Republican tax bill passes. “The deal is so bad for rich people, I had to throw in the estate tax just to give them something,” the president said. <br> At least one of those statements is false. The deal is good for rich people. Wealthy people’s after-tax incomes would rise at a substantially higher rate than for those lower down the income scale, according to an analysis of the House GOP tax plan that the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center released Wednesday. <br> What about Mr. Trump’s own finances? There’s good reason to doubt Mr. Trump’s veracity there, too. But because, unlike every other president of the modern era, he refuses to make his tax returns public, we can’t be sure. If Mr. Trump wants to prove that he is promoting tax reform despite, not because of, his own financial interest, there is an easy way to do so: He can finally release his tax returns. <br> Mr. Trump’s story is not outside the realm of possibility. The professional staff at Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation found that the House GOP bill would cut taxes for most rich people but not all. About a quarter of households with an income over $1 million would see a tax increase in 2019, in part because the bill would scale back tax breaks, such as the write-off for state and local taxes. That write-off might be quite valuable to the president, a longtime businessman in high-tax New York. <br> Yet the House GOP bill also contains provision after provision seemingly designed to help someone such as Mr. Trump. It would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, a policy that ensures the wealthy can’t use loopholes to shrink their tax burden to nothing. The AMT obliged the president to pay $31 million in 2005, the one year for which the public has summary information about his taxes. The bill would reform how the federal government taxes “pass-through” income from certain privately held companies — companies of the sort that Mr. Trump used extensively in his real estate business. As Mr. Trump noted Tuesday, it would phase out the estate tax, an unnecessary shift that would amount to little more than a giveaway to wealthy families such as the Trumps. And then there are complex details such as how the tax bill singles out the real estate business for special consideration in how it handles corporate interest and like-kind exchanges. <br> Mr. Trump’s comments underscore a reason every major-party presidential candidate since Richard Nixon has released his or her tax returns. The public should know what conflicts of interest the president has, particularly when questions of taxing and spending are on the table. The president says GOP tax reform is not about enriching himself. A Congress with a modicum of self-respect would answer: Great to hear. Now show us. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Helaine Olen: We don’t know what’s in Trump’s tax returns.

 When Republicans in the Senate follow in spirit if not exact word their colleagues in the House, we will have, after some interhouse haggling, what Catherine Rampell labeled, with great restraint, a “plutocratic, sloppy tax overhaul” [“Why the GOP is rushing tax reform,” op-ed, Nov. 28]. <br> If the new tax law goes into effect with its, for most of us, torturous slow drip of deduction and benefit removals while corporations grow richer but fail to invest or hire, Republicans will have one great achievement. Republicans will own this law. They will be unable to blame its predictably ugly outcomes on Barack Obama. <br> Ann McCormick Scott, Gaithersburg <br> The tax bills are obviously complicated and opaque. One nugget in the Senate bill would allow repatriation of the pre-1987 earnings of U.S.-owned foreign corporations to the United States with no U.S. tax. What conceivable rationale would justify that? <br> H. David Rosenbloom, Washington <br> Regarding the Nov. 29 news article “Trump trade policy may imperil U.S. digital clout”: <br> No amount of tax cutting or fiddling with education policy can replace investments in basic infrastructure, research and development, and a trade policy that encourages technology firms to create the high-skilled jobs of tomorrow. <br> President Trump continues to coddle populist special interests, promising the coal lobby and blue-collar workers that he will “revive” struggling industries in a global market that has less and less demand for their products. While offering obvious political points, doing so at the expense of technology companies is deeply cynical and harmful to the future of the very families he’s claiming to help. <br> We can and should offer all American families a better chance at high-quality, good-paying work. That chance rests with supporting the technology companies that are already making America great. <br> Robert M. Holland, Washington <br> Here’s to Tom Toles for defending my middle-class cohort from tax predation [editorial cartoons, Nov. 20, 21, 23, 27 and 28]. Nearly 80 and diagnosed with lethal cancer, I would suffer a 35 percent tax increase through loss of the personal exemption, medical deduction and state and local tax deduction. <br> The Republicans want to pick our pockets to fatten their billionaire donors — Robin Hood perverted. Mr. Toles’s coal train to Santa was right: President Trump’s only industry revival plan is to send the elderly ill a nasty lump of bituminous for Christmas. We get no warmth from such gifts, save perhaps from anger. <br> J. Marvin Watts, Bluemont 
 It’s not enough to give money to rich people. Apparently, Republicans want to kick the poor and middle class in the face, too. <br> I used to think the Republican Party’s obsession with top-heavy tax cuts was about pleasing wealthy donors and maybe also fulfilling some misguided Randian fantasy. If the poor and middle class happened to be collateral damage, so be it. <br> But it’s starting to look like shafting the little guy has become a feature, not a bug, of the GOP’s budget-busting tax plan. <br> In years past, when Republicans wished to pass huge tax cuts for the wealthy, they at least offered a few goodies to so-called regular Americans. Take the George W. Bush tax cuts: They were also extremely weighted toward the rich, but some of the provisions helped the middle class and poor. The 2001 legislation made the Child Tax Credit partially refundable, for instance, which for the first time allowed many poor families to receive it. <br> More important, the Bush tax cuts didn’t actually raise taxes on any households, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center. <br> This time around, Republicans have taken a different approach. They’re offsetting their tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy by hiking them further down the income distribution. <br> Yes, it’s true that lower- and middle-income households would get a tax cut initially. But according to Congress’s own official nonpartisan scorekeepers, by 2027 the Senate tax bill would actually raise taxes on households making less than $75,000. That’s the case even if you strip out the controversial effects of repealing the individual mandate. <br> No wonder this bill is less popular than any major change in federal tax policy since at least 1981.   <br> But wait, it gets worse. Higher taxes aren’t the only way in which Republicans plan to punish the poor and middle class. They also plan to gut the government services these populations depend on. <br> This tax bill is merely a prelude to, or perhaps an excuse for, shredding the social safety net. <br> Despite all those fanciful promises about how tax cuts will pay for themselves, Republican politicians know their legislation will blow a major hole in the deficit. According to lawmakers’ own official scorekeepers, the Senate bill would cost $1 trillion over the coming decade, even after accounting for additional economic growth. <br> And in recent days and weeks, prominent Republicans have pledged to patch over this budget hole by cutting programs that millions of Americans need to get by. <br> At an event on Wednesday, for example, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) linked tax cuts to coming entitlement cuts.  <br> “Many argue that you can’t cut taxes because it will drive up the deficit,” he said. “But we have to do two things. We have to generate economic growth which generates revenue, while reducing spending. That will mean instituting structural changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.” <br> At another event this week, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said that once the tax bill was done, “welfare reform” — code for rolling back means-tested benefits — was on the agenda. <br> House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) of course has been trying to block-grant Medicaid and other safety-net programs for years. At a recent town hall, when asked why the tax bill wasn’t paid for through spending cuts, he assured the audience that spending cuts would be coming quite soon. <br> Even President Trump, supposed defender of the downtrodden, remarked at a recent Cabinet meeting: “We’re looking very strongly at welfare reform, and that’ll all take place right after taxes, very soon, very shortly after taxes.” He added that such a policy was “desperately needed in our country.” <br> You might question these pledges because cutting entitlements and other safety-net programs is easier said than done. Republicans learned this when they tried and failed to roll back Medicaid earlier this year. <br> But it’s worth noting that if Trump signs tax cuts into law in December, some spending cuts would be triggered automatically in January — without lawmakers having to lift a single finger or herd a single cat. Medicare alone would be slashed by $25 billion between January and September. <br> Such cuts would be triggered by a law known as statutory PAYGO, which was designed to promote fiscal responsibility. Overriding the law requires 60 Senate votes. Even if Democrats get on board with cleaning up the GOP’s budget mess, recent comments suggest not all Senate or House Republicans may choose to join them. <br> Income inequality is near record highs, and yet Republicans’ regressive tax and spending plans forge forward. It’s time for voters to ask their elected officials: How much upward distribution of wealth will ever be enough? <br> Read more here: <br> Robert E.

 Watching the Republican tax plan race through Congress, one is reminded of a big apparent difference between President Trump’s program and other populist movements in the Western world. In the United States, Trump is leading something that is best described as plutocratic populism, a mixture of traditional populist causes with extreme libertarian ones. <br> Congress’s own think tanks — the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office — calculate that in 10 years, people making between $50,000 and $75,000 (around the median income in the United States) would effectively pay a whopping $4 billion more in taxes, while people making $1 million or more would pay $5.8 billion less under the Senate bill. And that doesn’t take into account the massive cuts in services, health care and other benefits that would likely result. Martin Wolf, the sober and fact-based chief economics commentator for the Financial Times, concludes, “This is a determined effort to shift resources from the bottom, middle and even upper middle of the U.S. income distribution toward the very top, combined with big increases in economic insecurity for the great majority.” <br> The puzzle, Wolf says, is why this is a politically successful strategy. The Republican Party is pursuing an economic agenda for the 0.1 percent, but it needs to win the votes of the majority. This is the issue that University of California at Berkeley political scientist Paul Pierson discusses in a recently published essay. Writing in the British Journal of Sociology, Pierson notes that Trump’s program does have strong populist aspects, especially on trade and immigration. But, he points out, “On the big economic issues of taxes, spending and regulation — ones that have animated conservative elites for a generation — he has pursued, or supported, an agenda that is extremely friendly to large corporations, wealthy families, and well-positioned rent-seekers. His budgetary policies (and those pursued by his Republican allies in Congress) will, if enacted, be devastating to the same rural and moderate-income communities that helped him win office.” <br> Pierson argues that Trump entered the White House with a set of inchoate ideas and no real organization. Thus, his administration was ripe for takeover by the most ardent, organized and well-funded elements of the Republican Party — its libertarian wing. Nurtured and built up over the years, this group of conservatives decided to ally with the Trump administration to enact its long-standing agenda. Pierson quotes Grover Norquist, the fiercely anti-statist GOP operative, explaining in 2012 his views on the selection of a Republican presidential nominee. “We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don’t need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. . . . We just need a president to sign this stuff.” <br> Is it that the Republican Party is cleverly and successfully hoodwinking its supporters, promising them populism and enacting plutocratic capitalism instead? This view has been a staple of liberal analysis for years, most prominently in Thomas Frank’s book “What’s the Matter with Kansas?” Frank argued that Republicans have been able to work this magic trick by dangling social issues in front of working-class voters, who fall for the bait and lose sight of the fact that they are voting against their own interests. Both Wolf and Pierson believe that this trickery will prove dangerous for Republicans. “The plutocrats are riding on a hungry tiger,” writes Wolf. <br> But what if people are not being fooled at all? What if people are actually motivated far more deeply by issues surrounding religion, race and culture than they are by economics? There is increasing evidence that Trump’s base supports him because they feel a deep emotional, cultural and class affinity for him. And while the tax bill is analyzed by economists, Trump picks fights with black athletes, retweets misleading anti-Muslim videos and promises not to yield on immigration. Perhaps he knows his base better than we do. In fact, Trump’s populism might not be as unique as it’s made out to be. Polling from Europe suggests that the core issues motivating people to support Brexit or the far-right parties in France and Germany, and even the populist parties of Eastern Europe, are cultural and social. <br> The most important revolution in economics in the past generation has been the rise of the behavioral scientists, trained in psychology, who are finding that people systematically make decisions that are against their own “interests.” This might be the tip of the iceberg in understanding human motivation. The real story might be that people see their own interests in much more emotional and tribal ways than scholars understand. What if, in the eyes of a large group of Americans, these other issues are the ones for which they will stand up, protest, support politicians and even pay an economic price? What if, for many people, in America and around the world, these are their true interests? <br> Read more from Fareed Zakaria’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> Robert E.

 If Congress cannot agree on a budget plan by Jan. 19, the government will shut down. This isn’t the outcome anyone wants. But Democrats ought to start steeling themselves now: If the Republican majority’s budget plan leaves the “dreamers” in limbo, fails to supply desperately needed aid to Puerto Rico and coastal states battered by natural disaster, or allows the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to wither away, Democrats need to be ready to shut the whole thing down. <br> It is necessary to recognize the damage a shutdown could cause in the course of recommending, as I am, that the Democrats prepare to let it happen. If the outcome were sure to be harmless, the possible costs would be small. But the moral stakes of this budget negotiation are extraordinarily high. Taking a stand for dreamers, children and disaster-stricken citizens will come with a price. <br> Trump has said a shutdown could be politically useful for him, and Democrats seem nervous. It’s hard to predict, at this point, which party (if either) a shutdown would benefit: Republicans could wind up with the blame, but they could also gain from underscoring the notion that government is broken. As Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a Post contributor, warned me on Wednesday: “These government shutdowns feed into a narrative that is not politically neutral.” <br> [The wall goes up. The ‘dreamers’ stay.] <br> There are practical concerns, too. “The biggest impact tends to be on people who work for the government [and] are nonessential employees,” Bernstein said. During past shutdowns, nonessential employees have been paid after the fact, but there is no guarantee Congress would elect to do the same this time. Bernstein added that a shutdown would be “a ding to the economy” and “massive inconvenience,” putting all kinds of activities — from sorting out Social Security questions to visiting national parks to getting passports renewed — on hold. A shutdown wouldn’t grind daily life to a halt. But it would affect millions, with serious ramifications for many. <br> But there are potential strategic upsides for Democrats. For one, triggering a shutdown could demonstrate that Democrats take the interests and desires of the American people seriously. “The public wants CHIP, Puerto Rico and Texas to get relief, and wants to protect dreamers,” said Ben Wikler, Washington director of MoveOn.org. “Keeping all these priorities on hold in a perpetual game of kick-the-can doesn’t actually line up with what most Americans want.” <br> In an October Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 62 percent of respondents said Puerto Rico has not received the help it needs in the wake of Hurricane Maria; a November Kaiser survey likewise found that 62 percent of Americans consider funding CHIP a top priority — far above tax reform or strengthening immigration controls. In that same poll, only 16 percent of respondents said dreamers shouldn’t be allowed to remain in the country. Likewise, a Post-ABC News poll found that 86 percent of Americans want dreamers to be allowed to stay. <br> [If the poor must work to earn every dollar, shouldn’t the rich?] <br> But it isn’t just the premise of democracy or the possibility of 2018 advantage that demands relentless commitment to these three causes. It’s ordinary morality. <br> The beneficiaries of CHIP, disaster aid and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals are innocent insofar as none of them brought onto themselves the statuses that have made them vulnerable. It is important to understand them as innocents at the mercy of a merciless faction; otherwise the harms they face might appear more morally complicated than they are. As the Roman Catholic Archbishop José Gomez recently wrote: “It would be cruel to punish [dreamers] for the wrongs of their parents, deporting them to countries of origin that they have never seen, where they may not even know the language.” It would likewise be cruel to allow children with diabetes to die for lack of insulin or to plunge poor families deep into debt because they happened to have a child with a disability. The same can be said for those who had the misfortune of living in areas struck by storms, the ne plus ultra of situations one didn’t cause and cannot prevent. <br> A shutdown would cause real problems for real people. It is, in the words of Wikler, “something to be avoided if possible, but not at the expense of fundamental priorities.” What is remarkable about the priorities at hand, however, is that they have no business being articles of compromise. These aren’t ordinary policy squabbles; they constitute a choice between America as a humane nation with democratic principles and America as a negligent sovereign with a dim future. The protection of innocents shouldn’t be up for debate. But it is. And Democrats can’t back down. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Bernie Sanders: It’s on Republicans to stop a shutdown <br> Dana Milbank: ‘Dreamers’ need to get out of their own way <br> The Post’s View: Take a deal for the dreamers.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> REPUBLICANS WANT to pass the biggest rewrite of the federal tax code since 1986. They could do so the right way, taking care to simplify the code without harming the country’s already stretched finances. Or they could hypocritically balloon the debt to pay for tax cuts, nullifying the benefits of the rewrite by plunging the country into dangerous fiscal territory. <br> A plan before the Senate, possibly to be voted on this week, would do tax reform the wrong way. Any Republican who ever breathed a word of concern about the debt when Democrats were in charge has no excuse to support this plan. They should reject the budget outline. <br> The reason is simple: The Senate budget plan would allow lawmakers to add a whopping $1.5 trillion to the debt over a decade in order to cut taxes. Backers of the idea insist that the impact would not be as bad as this top-line figure would suggest. The way the Congressional Budget Office calculates the budget baseline is not realistic, they insist, and must be adjusted. Tax cuts pay for themselves, they add. In other words, their response is a combination of budget gimmickry and magical thinking. There is no credible model showing that a big tax cut would pay for itself. There is no historical precedent justifying Republicans’ exuberance. Outside experts insist that, though economic growth would allow the government to recoup some of the revenue it loses by cutting taxes, the level of growth that would be necessary to fully offset a big cut is massive — and totally unrealistic outside of a rigged economic projection. <br> The country’s debt already equals nearly 80 percent of the economy. Large numbers of baby boomers are retiring and will demand expensive old-age benefits. Health-care costs continue to rise. Spending on entitlements and debt service promises to crowd out investments in infrastructure, education and every other public need. Tighter military spending is already affecting the readiness of U.S. forces. The last thing the Senate should do is make these problems worse. <br> While imperfect in several ways, the House budget plan points to a better path. It calls for tax reform that is revenue-neutral. Under this proposal, Republicans would slash corporate and personal income-tax rates, but they would have to pay for them, ideally offsetting those cuts by eliminating tax deductions and other loopholes. The result would be a simpler code with fewer twists and turns that distort where people and companies invest. The country would become more competitive relative to other nations with simpler tax codes and more favorable corporate rates. And there would be no net impact on the debt. <br> It is not too late for the Senate to avoid fiscal disaster. Senators still have the option of following through on years of rhetoric promising budgetary responsibility. They should reject the reckless budget outline they have before them. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 Great nations and proud democracies fall when their systems become so corrupted that the decay is not even noticed — or the rot is written off as a normal part of politics. <br> President Trump has created exactly such a crisis. He has not done it alone. The corrosion of norms and values began long before he propelled the nation past the edge, and his own party is broadly complicit in enabling his attacks on truth, decency and democratic values. <br> In fact, Republicans are taking full advantage of the bedlam Trump leaves in his wake. They are using a twisted process to push through a profoundly flawed tax bill with scant scrutiny. <br> The convoluted proposal is so generous to the wealthiest interests in the country and so damaging to significant parts of the middle class and the poor that GOP leaders know it would not survive extended debate. <br> They dare not take on Trump because doing so might derail the pursuit of what are now their party’s only driving purposes: court packing, the care and feeding of the privileged, and the gutting of federal social services and regulation. This, too, is a form of corruption, a refusal to face larger questions when partisan political victories are at hand. <br> We are so inured to the chaos and the lying that characterize Trump’s presidency that we see each outrage as little more than another passing episode on an ongoing cable news drama. <br> But events of just the past few days should remind us that the longer this president is in power, the weaker our country will become. <br> On Wednesday morning, the nation learned that it has a president who traffics in fascist propaganda — and I am not using the f-word lightly. Trump retweeted three inflammatory anti-Muslim videos of unknown accuracy put out by an ultra-right British group called Britain First. <br> Britain’s Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, was horrified and did not mince words in a statement put out by her office criticizing Trump for distributing “hateful narratives.” She added that “British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far-right, which is the antithesis of the values that this country represents: decency, tolerance and respect.” <br> We’d like to think that the United States is also a nation of decency, tolerance and respect. We can’t make this claim while Trump is president. <br> In the meantime, we learned how low the right will sink to advance the interests of accused sexual predator Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, and to discredit mainstream journalism. Thanks to meticulous reporting, The Post exposed the apparent efforts by conservative activist James O’Keefe to bait the paper into publishing a false account that Moore had a sexual relationship with a woman when she was 15 and encouraged her to have an abortion. <br> Please think about this: These conservatives are defending the sanctity of life by setting up a woman to lie about having an abortion. In the effort to bring down fair-minded journalism, nothing is sacred. It is another case of corruption, and at an astonishing level. <br> Recently, my friend (and Brookings Institution colleague) Benjamin Wittes issued a widely noted series of tweets arguing that the left and the right needed to engage in a “temporary truce” to confront the emergency Trump represents and “unite around a political program based on the protection of American democracy and democratic institutions.” <br> I could not agree more. As a liberal, I salute the anti-Trump conservatives (many of them writers) who understand the threat the president poses and have spoken out unequivocally and bravely. <br> But here’s what also needs to be recognized: At the moment, political power in our elected branches (and, in effect, in the Supreme Court) is held by Republicans and conservatives. They are using Trump to push through outlandish policies on taxes and health care. They are lauding Trump’s executive orders that scuttle regulations safeguarding consumers, workers and the environment. They are ecstatic about his filling the judiciary with his, and their, allies. Progressives cannot be asked to pretend this isn’t happening. We’re a long way from a “truce.” <br> It is an unfortunate fact that the corruption Trump exemplifies has seeped deeply into the Republican Party and substantial segments of the conservative movement. The burden is on the responsible right to dismantle the permission structures that are allowing Trump to wreck our democracy, despoil our values and endanger our standing in the world. Otherwise, the people will have to do it themselves by voting his Republican enablers out of office. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Robert E. Rubin, a co-chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, was U.S. treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999. <br> Proponents of the Republican tax bill claim it will pay for itself with increased growth. But what if that growth doesn’t materialize? To mollify colleagues concerned about the bill’s deficit impact, Senate GOP leaders are planning to add a new provision: a “trigger” to raise corporate taxes if revenue doesn’t meet a specified target. <br> This notion is both unworkable and misguided. No serious deficit-minded lawmaker should support it. <br> Fast-forward a few years. Anyone who has watched Washington in action knows how unlikely it is that the president and Congress will allow the threatened corporate tax increases to take effect. Even if that were to happen, under the reported plan the triggered cuts would offset only a small share of the lost revenue. Meanwhile, if the trigger were to be pulled during an economic downturn, the effect could be to further slow the economy and make deficits even worse. <br> Here’s why: <br> According to congressional scorekeepers, the Senate tax bill would cost an estimated $1.4 trillion over 10 years. That’s on paper. In real life, the cost would likely be much higher. The bill includes a number of tax cuts for individuals that are slated to expire after 2025, but future policymakers will very likely extend them, making the long-term deficit impact worse than the stated figure. <br> Using highly questionable supply-side arguments, the bill’s advocates argue that it will spur so much economic growth, with so many businesses and individuals paying so much more in taxes on their higher earnings, that the measure will largely or entirely pay for itself. <br> Nevertheless, to assuage deficit-minded senators who aren’t satisfied by this argument, the trigger would activate $350 billion in corporate tax increases if that projection falls short. If the bill were to lose $1.4 trillion, as the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, the $350 billion would add back only a quarter on each dollar of those lost revenues. <br> But just as the policymakers of tomorrow are unlikely to let the personal tax cuts expire after 2025, history suggests that they likely won’t let corporate tax increases take effect once triggered. <br> To comply with Congress’s complicated budget rules, President George W. Bush and Congress crafted the 2001 tax cuts so that they would expire after 10 years. When the time came, however, policymakers eventually made more than 80 percent of them permanent. And they did so even though deficits were high and debt was rising. <br> Similarly, the federal “pay-as-you-go” law requires that tax cuts and entitlement increases be paid for in the year they’re enacted; it that doesn’t happen, automatic cuts in Medicare and other important programs are supposed to be triggered automatically. But GOP leaders are now publicly stating that once their tax bill is approved, they will follow quickly with legislation to exempt the just-passed tax cuts from this trigger. Why would anybody think they won’t end up doing the same with the trigger, if the need arises? <br> But let’s presume for a moment that lawmakers would let the $350 billion in corporate tax increases take effect. That could cause more harm than good. <br> Let’s say that the economy is weak in the year the tax increases are triggered. That would be a bad time to raise taxes; by taking money out of the economy, a tax increase then could push a weakened economy into recession. And a struggling economy weakened by a tax increase could mean even lower federal tax receipts from businesses and individuals, undercutting the purpose of the corporate tax increase to begin with. <br> Deficit-minded senators are right to be concerned about our fiscal future. Even under current tax and spending policies — much less a big tax cut that would make matters substantially worse — the nation’s outstanding debt is expected to rise significantly as a share of the economy in the coming years and decades. If left unaddressed, that would weaken the economy over time, eroding the living standards of our children and grandchildren. <br> At some point, we’re going to have to address the nation’s rising debt. For now, at least, Congress should not make things worse. <br> As for the trigger, no one should be fooled. Rather than mitigating the impact of future revenue losses, it will likely prove a toothless tiger whose main function was to provide cover for deficit-increasing tax cuts. The policymakers of tomorrow almost certainly will let it fall by the wayside. The time to prevent the president and Congress from enacting misguided tax cuts that swell the debt is now. <br> Read more here: <br> Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles: A moment of truth for our country’s financial future <br> Catherine Rampell: John McCain, tax-cut-tanking class warrior? <br> Marc A.

 The Republican tax bill is often described as being weighted toward “the rich.” But that’s not the full story.  <br> It’s actually weighted toward the loafer, the freeloader, the heir, the passive investor who spends his time yachting and charity-balling.  <br> In short: the idle rich. <br> Republicans claim the opposite, of course. For years the GOP has argued that we need to cut taxes to incentivize work and job creation. If only today’s allegedly sky-high marginal rates were lower, millions of talented, driven Americans would apply more of their talent and drive toward growing the economy.  <br> Why? Well, if they got to keep more of their hard-earned cash, there would be a greater payoff from clocking that extra hour, taking on that extra project, seeing that extra patient, scoring that extra client, building that extra business, and so on. Working would look more attractive relative to playing an extra round of golf.  <br> Yet the GOP tax bill offers the biggest windfall to those who sit on their duffs and do nothing. <br> Rich layabouts benefit in multiple ways from the proposal.  <br> The most obvious way is the repeal of the estate tax, which currently affects only estates worth at least $5.49 million, or roughly the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans who die each year.  <br> Eliminating estate taxes paid by the very wealthy few seems unlikely to improve their work ethic. If anything, increasing the value of their bequests will make it less attractive for heirs and heiresses to hold down a job or start a company that they actually run. <br> This is hardly the only way that the Republican tax proposal would reward passively received income. The big cut in corporate tax rates and the corporate repatriation holiday also disproportionately benefit passive owners of capital rather than workers. <br> But the bill’s differential treatment of those who work and those who don’t is starkest in provisions related to “pass-through” entities.  <br> Almost all businesses in the United States are structured as pass-through businesses, such as partnerships, sole proprietorships and S-corporations. This means their incomes are taxed at individual rates, rather than corporate ones. Despite the usual rhetoric, these businesses are not necessarily “small”; the Trump Organization, for instance, is organized as a pass-through.  <br> The Republican tax plan would dramatically slash tax rates for pass-through income, down to no more than 25 percent. This special pass-through rate is much lower than the normal top marginal rate for individual income, which would continue to be 39.6 percent.  <br> As you might imagine, a gap in tax rates is likely to create a tax-sheltering bonanza. Lots of high-income people currently working as employees would likely start calling themselves “companies” — by working as sole-proprietor “consultancies,” for instance — to take advantage of the lower rate.  <br> The bill also includes some “guardrails” to discourage people from gaming this system. At least in theory.  <br> Among them is a rule that says if you’re actively involved in your business, typically only a portion (30 percent) of your earnings would qualify for the special pass-through rate. The rest of your earnings (70 percent) would be considered equivalent to the wages you’d pay yourself for your work at the firm. Accordingly, these would be taxed at regular individual income-tax rates.  <br> But here’s the rub. This 70-30 rule would apply only if you’re “actively” working for the company you own. If instead you’re considered a “passive” owner — determined by, for example, how many hours you log working for it — then you inexplicably qualify for the special pass-through rate on 100 percent of your earnings.  <br> Consider a hypothetical, similar to one New York University School of Law’s Lily Batchelder suggested to me recently: A family business has been passed down to several siblings with varying levels of industriousness and IQ. <br> The most competent sibling works for her family’s company full-time. The least competent sibling kicks in a few hours of work each year, but otherwise spends his time popping bottles of champagne and hunting endangered wildlife. <br> Under the Republican tax bill, the lowest tax rate is paid by the ne’er-do-well brother, rather than by the worker-bee sister who actually grew the business. Although, with a good enough accountant, she might be able to convince the Internal Revenue Service that she’s just as lazy and uninvolved as her brother. <br> This is a strange way to design tax incentives. As New York University law school professor Daniel Shaviro has noted, our existing tax code typically incentivizes people to avoid being classified as passive and instead to prove that they’re “materially participating” in running their business. This bill encourages rich people to do the opposite. <br> So much for the dignity of work. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The dumbest part of Trump’s dumb tax plan <br> Dana Milbank: What’s in it for Johnny Lunchbucket? <br> The Post’s View: Republicans break their promise on tax reform <br> George F.

 Regarding the Nov. 3 front-page article “GOP unveils sweeping tax overhaul”: <br> The estate tax exempts the first $5.49 million of an estate’s value. Any business or farm valued at more than $5.49 million is not hurting. Eliminating the estate tax would benefit only those whose wealth exceeds $5.49 million and would increase inequality. <br> William Thomson, Arlington <br> The repeal of medical deductions in the tax bill would hurt a lot of people [“The winners and losers in proposed GOP tax plan,” news, Nov. 5]. This would have a deeply harmful financial and emotional impact on poor and middle-class people, older adults in assisted-living facilities, their caregivers and beyond. It would affect people in every state — Republicans, Democrats and independents. This would result in a significant tax increase for people who are paying out large sums of after-tax money to support our loved ones. Caregivers would be devastated. The costs of decreasing taxes for corporations and the wealthy would once again be borne by citizens who can ill afford it, emotionally, financially or otherwise. <br> Barry Brenner, Westfield, N.J. <br> <br> I am somewhere on the spectrum of being middle class. I am told that I should expect a tax break with the proposed tax-reform bill now being engineered through Congress. Well, it turns out that in its present form, not only will I not get a tax break, but also I will end up paying a substantially higher income tax should the proposed tax-reform plan be enacted. <br> I am among those who has a family member in need of full-time care. My wife has Alzheimer’s disease. My annual costs run well into the $150,000 range. Under the provisions of the tax plan, I would not be able to claim any medical deductions. I am not alone here. Those who are responsible for non-reimbursed annual medical costs for the long-term care of family members suffering with Parkinson’s disease, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or other neurological degenerative diseases will find themselves facing higher taxes under the new plan. <br> This needs to be fixed. Congress should retain the medical expense deduction. <br> Robert Tedesco, Gaithersburg <br> Relatively few articles on the proposed GOP tax plan have highlighted the terrific break eliminating the alternative minimum tax would give to the upper brackets [“Mortgage plan would hurt D.C.’s middle class,” news, Nov. 3]. It was initially installed to stop the excessive use of tax loopholes. Apparently, President Trump would have saved $31 million on his 2005 tax return alone. This would be one of the biggest benefits to the wealthy under this ill-advised so-called tax reform. <br> Jerry Samuel, Gaithersburg <br> Problems with tax cuts are neatly captured in a quote from Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), who said, “Paul [Ryan] believes that if it’s worth doing, the private sector will do it” [“White House revisits gas-tax increase,” news, Oct. 27]. <br> People who actually want the economy to grow are going about it exactly the wrong way if they support proposals to cut federal taxes and increase the burden of state and local taxes. Roads and bridges, Medicare and Medicaid, disaster relief and adaptation to climate change — these will not be funded by the private sector without public revenue instead of increased deficits. More tax cuts will just impede the development of an economy that provides services that people actually need and want. <br> John Cross, Burke <br> The Nov. 3 news article “Mortgage plan would hurt D.C.’s middle class” gave a misleading impression of the hardships that would be created for middle-income taxpayers by the provision of the Republican tax proposal that would limit the deduction of mortgage interest for new mortgages in excess of $500,000. First, the U.S. household median income (50 percent of families have higher income and 50 percent have lower income) is less than $60,000. Not many people in this middle-income range are going to be able to afford mortgages that exceed $500,000. Second, people would still be able to deduct the interest they pay on the first $500,000 on their mortgage, so high-priced houses would still be subsidized. <br> The fact is that this provision of the Republican proposal (unlike many others) is a progressive change compared with current policy. The current write-off of mortgage interest provides the largest subsidies (paid by other taxpayers) to high-income people with high marginal tax rates who borrow to buy expensive houses; not only do they deduct more, but also a deduction of a given amount is worth more because their marginal tax rates are higher than those of lower-income people. <br> Elliot K. Wicks, Reston 
 You wouldn’t expect to find good news in a federal government report titled “Prisoners in 2016,” but this lugubriously named Justice Department document is indeed full of fact-based reasons to feel better about the United States. <br> Specifically, it confirms that the U.S. incarceration rate reached a 19-year low at the end of 2016: There were 450 prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents held in state and federal prisons in 2016, compared with 444 prisoners per 100,000 in 1997. This rate was 11 percent below the all-time peak of 506 per 100,000 in 2007. <br> There’s a lesson here, and it’s not just the familiar one about the need to remember all the ways life in the United States might actually be improving, or at least not getting worse — despite the endless flow of troubling, and spectacular, news from President Trump’s Washington. <br> It’s also about the relationship between alarmism and progress, and how the former may help bring about the latter, even if the facts don’t necessarily support it 100 percent. <br> We now know that the U.S. incarceration rate, though still far higher than that of other industrialized democracies, was already on its way down as of 2010, when Michelle Alexander published “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,” propelling the issue of racially disparate imprisonment onto the national agenda. We also know, thanks to Justice Department data, that the incarceration rate for African Americans declined almost twice as fast as the rate for whites between 2007 and 2016. <br> The consciousness that Alexander’s book raised cannot possibly explain these trends, because they started before it was published. Yet if she hadn’t rung the alarm, positive developments might not have intensified as rapidly or as durably as they did. <br> Her ideas swiftly mutated from radical critique to conventional wisdom, influencing policy from the then-Obama administration to state governments in the deep-red Deep South, where several states’ imprisonment rates have been declining faster than the national average. <br> Another example of the alarmism-progress dialectic from a different policy area: Concern over rising health-care costs is the stuff of both Republican and Democratic jeremiads, with the GOP blaming Obamacare and Democrats blaming a different cast of villains, including private insurance companies and Big Pharma. <br> What if both blue and red alarmism are, at least in one respect, behind the times? According to a newly published study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the gap between the per capita growth rate in health-care spending and the per capita growth rate of the overall economy has been shrinking for years. <br> The two rates were essentially the same between 2010 and 2013, though health-cost growth exceeded economic growth modestly in 2014 and 2015. There’s a good chance the 2010s will see the lowest differential between health-cost growth and overall growth since the 1990s. <br> In short, growth in health care’s share of the economy is decelerating. We may be slowly but surely bending the cost curve downward, to a sustainable rate of growth, even at a time of coverage expansion. <br> There are undoubtedly many reasons for this, including the simple fact that there must be some inherent limit on health-cost growth. We can’t devote 100 percent of the economy to health care any more than we could sentence 100 percent of the population to prison. <br> Cost control in Obamacare, such as the proposed excise tax on “Cadillac” private health plans, probably helped, too; but surely one source of progress was the general belief, accurate or not, that the situation was getting worse and therefore required urgent action. <br> Could Trump administration policy reverse these two positive trends, given Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s tough-on-crime rhetoric, plus the president’s promises to repeal Obamacare and otherwise fiddle with health care? Maybe, but the states, not the Justice Department, control the vast majority of criminal prosecutions and prison sentences; Obamacare repeal, meanwhile, keeps failing, though ending the individual health-insurance mandate via Republican tax reform did cloud the picture. <br> Reality and perceptions of reality will probably never coincide perfectly. Yet the role that alarmism sometimes plays in spurring change shows that this is not necessarily a bad thing. The point is to take neither alarm at the status quo, nor satisfaction with it, to a counterproductive extreme. <br> A balanced sense of both the challenges and opportunities in our current predicament — a.k.a. sanity — would seem to be the appropriate aspiration. <br> And notwithstanding everything that you see, hear and read, optimism is sane. The data prove it. <br> Read more from Charles Lane’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> Michelle Alexander: Incarceration around the world <br> Eric Liu: A colony of incarceration for people of color <br> The Post’s View: How to move the tax bill from worse to bad <br> Nicholas Bagley: People’s health care swapped for corporate tax cuts <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 If Congress is intent on passing a tax-reform bill, leaders from both parties should insist that it not pump more steroids into the national debt [“Tax reform for cowards,” editorial, Sept. 29]. Publicly held national debt now tops $14 trillion. It’s already headed for almost $25 trillion over the next 10 years, pushing the ratio of debt-to-gross domestic product higher than ever, even the peak just after the end of World War II. President Trump’s proposal is pouring gasoline on the fire, endangering our capacity to fund a strong national defense and to take care of our aging population. <br> The best solution would be a creative, bipartisan compromise that gives our dealmaking president the lower rates he seeks without piling on more debt: a fee on carbon emissions to pay for the tax cuts. A $49-per-ton fee on emissions, increasing by 2 percent (plus inflation) a year, would generate $2.2 trillion over 10 years. Rebate half to cover the impact on low- and middle-income households and use $1.1 trillion to cover cutting rates. It would also enable our country to honor its Paris climate pledge. This is an efficient, free-market, nonregulatory idea that deserves bipartisan support. <br> Walt Minnick, Boise, Idaho <br> The writer, a Democrat, represented Idaho’s 1st Congressional District from 2009 to 2011 and is co-founder of the Partnership for Responsible Growth. 
 Do we really want to spend $18 billion on a wall [“$18 billion sought to begin wall on border,” front page, Jan. 6]? I can think of more than a dozen better ways to use that money: grants to the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for important health research and disease prevention; aid for the disaster in Puerto Rico that still remains; fighting the war that is raging against and killing opioid addicts; needed support to fund treatment for HIV/AIDS, which remains prevalent. And there are many other projects, now fallen by the wayside, that our president has neglected and forgotten: aid to cities to fight crime; help for the many homeless across the country; subsidies for schools, especially programs that assist young children who are hungry and need health care. A useless wall? Not with my tax dollars. <br> Alice L. Haber, Frederick <br> President Trump wants an initial $18 billion to placate/entertain/distract his base with a (useless) border wall. Because the Republican tax cut is going to magically generate an increase in tax revenue, how about proving it by tying the wall funding to those new incoming dollars? <br> Don Cruikshank, Warrenton, Va. <br> The Trump administration’s decision to expel some 200,000 Salvadorans is the latest example of the administration’s cruelty [“U.S. to revoke protected status for Salvadorans,” front page, Jan. 9]. The president canceling Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and holding it hostage for a border wall, the indifference to reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the travel ban targeted at several majority-Muslim countries are examples of a cruel and mean spirit that pervades the Trump White House. <br> This same cruelty can be found in the tax bill and in the many Trump tweets. This approach does not represent the American people who are generous, not cruel, in our public speech and actions. <br> Dick Klass, Arlington 
 The Nov. 18 front-page article “Local worries over tax changes” reported that municipalities were protesting the Republican plan to eliminate state and local tax deductions, and with good reason. But where are the protests from the recipients of charitable tax deductions? Even though donations by individual taxpayers to qualified institutions would remain deductible under the House plan, a Nov. 7 memorandum prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that under the present law, 40.7 million taxpayers will be taking about $241 billion in charitable deductions next year, but if the law were to be changed, only about 9.4 million taxpayers would take an estimated $146 billion in charitable deductions. That is too bad. <br> All is not lost, however, because it does not appear corporations will lose their charitable deductions. <br> John R. Maney Jr., Springfield 
 This Thanksgiving, I am grateful for many things — but when it comes to politics, I am especially thankful that Hillary Clinton is not sitting in the Oval Office. <br> I am thankful that Neil M. Gorsuch is on the Supreme Court and that President Trump has secured a conservative majority that will protect human life, religious liberty, the Second Amendment and limited government. I am also thankful the president is moving at record pace to fill the federal appeals courts with young conservative judges. While the Supreme Court only hears about 80 cases a year, the federal appeals courts get final say on about 60,000 — and because Democrats ended the filibuster, they can’t stop Trump from filling those courts with conservative legal rock stars. The Senate has already confirmed eight of Trump’s nine appellate nominees — the most this early in a presidency since Richard Nixon – and Trump will appoint plenty more before his first term expires. As former Clinton adviser Ronald A. Klain complained in The Post, “the next two generations of Americans will live under laws interpreted by hundreds of [Trump-appointed] judges.” <br> That alone is worth it. But there is more to be thankful for. <br> I’m thankful the New York Times’s Linda Greenhouse is complaining that Trump has appointed so many “individuals who have devoted their adult lifetimes to the anti-abortion cause” that federal agencies now resemble an “outpost of the National Right to Life Committee.” <br> While Congress could not repeal Obamacare, I’m thankful that failure now makes passage of conservative tax reform more likely, because House and Senate Republicans know that failure to do so is political suicide. And I’m thankful we have a president who is ready to sign that tax reform into law. <br> I’m thankful that Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, is dismantling President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, clearing the way for the Keystone XL pipeline, and undertaking the largest regulatory rollback in the EPA’s 46-year history. <br> I am thankful Trump has secured the release of American citizens imprisoned by China, North Korea, Egypt and the Taliban-linked Haqqani Network — without releasing senior Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay. <br> I am thankful that Trump finally enforced Obama’s red line on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, took the shackles off of our military in the fight against the Islamic State, got NATO allies to kick in $12 billion more for our collective security, imposed new sanctions on Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps , requested emergency funding for ballistic missile defense, declared North Korea a terrorist state, and sent a clear message to Pyongyang that it will not be permitted to threaten American cities with nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles. His foreign policy is far from perfect, but it is a marked improvement over the Obama-Clinton approach. <br> Trump hasn’t ushered in a new era of American isolationism. And despite the dire warnings of creeping authoritarianism, there are no gulags in the United States today. Quite the opposite, there are plenty of checks on Trump’s power. Federal judges have narrowed his travel ban, blocked his cut of funding for sanctuary cities, and stopped his ban on transgender troops. He has not changed libel laws to go after a free press, restored waterboarding, or built his border wall. Heck, he could not even repeal Obamacare. Our system of Constitutional checks and balances works — in some cases, too well. <br> The republic will survive the Trump presidency, and so will the Republican Party. I don’t buy the argument that Trump is doing irreversible damage to the GOP or the Republican brand. Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, and six years later we were inaugurating Ronald Reagan and then it was Morning in America again. If Trump does end up dragging the Republican Party down, all it takes is one great leader to resurrect it. <br> In the meantime, I want Trump’s presidency to be a success. Trump was not my first choice for president (or my second . . . or third . . . or fourth), and I am well aware of his many deep flaws. When he is wrong, I have called him out and will continue to do so. But I want Trump to fill the courts with conservative judges, reform the tax code, take on North Korea, counter Iran, defeat Islamist radicalism, roll back the regulatory state, expand school choice, and protect the unborn. And I’m thankful that because of his election, we are making progress on these fronts — and that Clinton is hawking books for a living. <br> That is something worth celebrating this Thanksgiving. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> Gary Abernathy: When your liberal aunt shows up at Thanksgiving in Trump country <br> Garrison Keillor: It’s Thanksgiving.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> TAX REFORM was supposed to attract wide, bipartisan support. Lower rates would be fully offset by cutting unneeded deductions and loopholes. The benefit would be a simpler, more efficient tax code. But the idea has moved steadily toward just another irresponsible GOP tax cut, paid for with magical thinking, that would erode the nation’s fiscal health and burden future generations. Republicans who know better must resist this path. <br> President Trump released a tax reform framework Wednesday, promising that “historic tax relief” would result in higher wages and a “middle-class miracle.” That’s about as likely as it sounds. In fact, the plan is packed with giveaways to the wealthy and threatens to add even more to the debt. <br> Mr. Trump promises hefty tax cuts for ordinary people and little benefit to top earners such as himself. But because he refuses to release his own tax returns, Americans have no idea how much he would benefit from his own tax plan. Three major provisions suggest it would, in fact, do a lot for the wealthy. <br> First, it would create a special rate for so-called pass-through corporations, which, if not done carefully, could open a massive loophole in the tax code, leading to widespread tax avoidance among financiers, lawyers and people who can pay for savvy tax advice. <br> Second, the plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which prevents wealthy people from ducking their tax bills. Mr. Trump’s leaked 2005 tax return showed he paid a hefty bill because of the alternative minimum tax a decade ago. <br> Third, the plan would end the estate tax, which would be a brazen giveaway to wealthy heirs. Only the richest of estates are subject to the tax, yet cutting it would blow a big hole in public finances. The plan would do this while promising uncertain benefits to ordinary people who work for a living. In a time of extreme wealth inequality, this is the last thing Congress needs to do. <br> And Republicans are not going to pay for these giveaways to the rich, which means future workers will pick up the tab. They have promised to raise money by cutting tax deductions, but they have been more specific about the deductions they would keep than the ones they would eliminate. They’ve done none of the hard work, in other words. Meanwhile, they admit they are unwilling to fully pay for the tax cuts they want, so they are giving themselves permission to cut up to $1.5 trillion in taxes without any offsets at all, arguing that a spurt of economic growth would make up for much of the lost revenue. <br> This is tax reform, in other words, for dishonest political cowards. It is not a legacy that members of Congress should want to leave to their children. <br> Read more: <br> Jennifer Rubin: Trump’s spin doesn’t match his tax plan <br> Paul Waldman: Trump’s new tax plan shows how unserious Republicans are about governing <br> Greg Sargent: Hey, deplorables: Trump and his advisers are laughing in your faces <br> Jennifer Rubin: Let’s stop taking Trump’s tax plan seriously <br> David Von Drehle: We’re running out of time on tax reform <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The Jan. 3 news article “Can forgotten American towns be saved?” should have mentioned that if the president wants people to move to where the jobs are, as economists generally suggest, then it was certainly counterproductive to support repeal of the tax deduction for moving expenses. The deduction was eliminated in the tax-reform legislation just enacted, despite a complete lack of any expressed policy reason for doing so. Without the deduction, many people will be discouraged from moving for a job opportunity.

 President Trump isn’t draining the swamp. He unveiled his long-awaited “tax reform” package last week, and although many crucial details were missing (for example, the income brackets), he was full of accolades. “This is a revolutionary change,” he said. <br> Well, not yet. <br> The federal income-tax system — almost everyone seems to agree — is a mess. It features relatively high nominal rates (up to 39.6 percent on individual income and 35 percent on corporate income) whose impact is offset by a baffling array of tax breaks, loopholes, preferences or “tax expenditures,” depending on which buzzword is in fashion. <br> A truly revolutionary tax overhaul would eliminate most existing tax breaks and use the resulting surge in revenues to lower rates sharply. But Trump may only partially rely on this process. He may also borrow to cut taxes. The crux of the debate is whether the tax cuts will pay for themselves, through higher economic growth, or whether they will simply add to the debt. <br> Economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Manhattan Institute, a Trump supporter, argues that reducing the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent will cause more internationally based companies to locate in the United States and fewer American firms to flee abroad to lower-taxed countries. Kevin Hassett, head of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, makes a similar point: “Particularly [for corporations], there is a deep literature that has found that capital investment is highly responsive to changes in tax policy.” <br> Reduce tax burdens, and companies will respond. Economic growth will increase; the tax cut will pay for itself. <br> Wishful thinking, say many economists. Deficits will grow, neutralizing some or all of the gain from lower tax rates. The logic is simple: Larger federal deficits will drive up interest rates, crowding out private-business investment. <br> Just how much more debt the Trump plan might involve is unknown, because so many details (including the distribution of the tax cuts across income class) remain undecided. But an estimate by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the figure at $2.2 trillion over a decade. That’s on top of projected added debt of about $10 trillion in the same 10 years from present policies. <br> This returns us to “the swamp,” Trump’s colorful metaphor for all the Washington lobbying for federal money, tax breaks and favorable regulation. He suggests that the process is corrupt, and often it is. But mainly it is democracy in action: groups arguing that they deserve special help. Regardless of whether it’s corrupt or not, Trump has inveighed against the swamp more than he has actually tried to drain it. <br> To do that, he’d have to challenge many more tax breaks. There is no shortage of targets. The 2018 federal budget lists 167 tax breaks; the costliest 15 alone lose roughly $1 trillion in tax revenue a year. Public benefits are often dubious. Consider two big tax breaks: the mortgage interest deduction for homeowners and the tax-free treatment of employer-paid health insurance. Arguably, both have had ill effects: The mortgage deduction has caused Americans to overinvest in housing, and the insurance break feeds medical inflation. <br> Still, it’s hard to oppose tax breaks that have such large constituencies. Similarly, tax breaks allow politicians of both parties to announce their support for various economic and ideological causes. Thus, we have tax breaks for college costs, wind and solar power, and corporate research and development. Also, some tax breaks surely do good. Would people save as much for retirement without tax-favored 401(k) and IRA accounts? <br> As a nation, we’d probably be better off with a simpler income-tax system with much lower rates and a much broader base. People and companies would decide what to do with their money rather than have government push and pull them through various legal bribes, rewards and punishments. That would relieve pressure on government to do more and more — often raising unrealistic expectations. <br> In Trump’s vocabulary, the swamp would begin to contract. There might be fewer tax lawyers, lobbyists, accountants, economists and publicists. This would be good but is also unlikely. <br> The political logic preventing such a system is daunting. No recent president, with the exception of Ronald Reagan, has tried. Indeed, Reagan’s experience is instructive. With bipartisan support, he succeeded in reducing rates and broadening the tax base in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But President Bill Clinton undid the reform when he raised the top rate to 39.6 percent. <br> Trump’s tax plan is being squeezed from two sides. If he doesn’t eliminate enough tax breaks, the debt will grow more rapidly. But if he — or his congressional allies — target too many tax breaks, he risks losing essential support. This suggests that, as the proposal winds its way through Congress, all the pressures will be to scale it back. The swamp will survive. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> David Von Drehle: We’re running out of time on tax reform <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> PRESIDENT TRUMP probably was untruthful when he insisted last week that his tax plan “is not good for me.” We can’t be certain, because Mr. Trump is asking us to take his word on the matter; he won’t release his tax returns. He is the first president in modern times, in fact, to so refuse. Before last week, questions centered on what his tax records might show about his connections, if any, to Russia. Now Mr. Trump has himself posed another crucial question: whether he is pushing tax cuts that could profit him and his family to the tune of millions of dollars. <br> This is no idle speculation. Though vague on crucial aspects, such as how to pay for it, Mr. Trump’s tax reform outline contains several specific proposals that would help the wealthy. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center released Friday an analysis showing that, by 2027, the GOP tax plan would provide massive benefits to upper-income taxpayers even as it smacked large sections of the middle class with a net tax hike. <br> Mr. Trump in particular might benefit from the elimination of the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which prevents taxpayers from using deductions and loopholes to avoid paying at least a minimum amount to the federal government. There are some reasons to criticize the AMT; it tends to hit those with moderately high incomes harder than the super-rich, for example. But there is at least one prominent example of the AMT working as designed — on Mr. Trump’s 2005 tax bill. Mr. Trump’s return from that year, and that year alone, was leaked in March, and it showed that the AMT obliged him to pay $31.3 million more in taxes that he otherwise would have. <br> Then there is Mr. Trump’s idea to eliminate the estate tax. Republicans pretend killing the “death tax” is about allowing family farmers to pass their land to their children without government interference. In fact, the tax affects only the wealthiest of estates — those worth $5.49 million or more, twice that for a married couple. The Tax Policy Center estimated that only about 80 small farms and businesses would pay estate tax this year. No one fortunate enough to qualify to pay the estate tax requires sympathy — let alone a budget-busting change in tax law. But its elimination could be a great favor for Mr. Trump’s heirs. <br> A drastic change in the taxation of business “pass-through” income also could greatly benefit businesses such as the Trump Organization. Again, it is impossible to know for sure, given the secrecy shrouding Mr. Trump’s finances. <br> Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign promising to release his tax returns, as every major-party candidate has done for decades. But first, he said, he had to wait for the Internal Revenue Service to finish auditing them — though an audit, even if one were going on, would not legally prevent him from releasing his returns and certainly would not keep him from releasing prior years’ returns. Then he dismissed continuing questions by insisting that only reporters care — though polls show that isn’t true, either. <br> So, on one side, there are specific elements of the president’s tax plan that would benefit the wealthy at the expense of the nation’s fiscal health. On the other side is an empty space where Mr. Trump’s tax returns should be. A Congress with integrity would agree to consider his tax proposal only after he published his tax returns. <br> Read more: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s tax ‘miracle’: Cowardice and dishonesty <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 A Roman coin struck in the year 44 B.C. reveals that a temple was dedicated to Julius Caesar months before his death, in honor of him and his legendary mercy, or perhaps to him and the goddess Clementia herself, patroness of leniency and forgiveness. Many statesmen have to wait for history to bestow upon them the virtues they will be remembered for, but not Caesar: Even by then, he was known for his laudable mercy. It pleased him to be thought of this way. “You are correct in your opinion of me (for you know me well),” he wrote in a letter to the statesman Cicero in 49 B.C., “nothing is further from my nature than cruelty.” <br> If mercy is not only meeting but exceeding the requirements of justice — giving others not just their due but more — then cruelty is its opposite, exceeding even the privations of injustice: not only failing to give others their due but taking from them even more. <br> President Trump’s comparison to Caesar in a brief 2017 run of Shakespeare’s famous play may thus have been too generous — merciful, even. Whatever virtues Trump and his administration are aiming for, mercy isn’t among them. Mercy, after all, is a quality of the strong; in his repeated attacks on those with the very least, Trump is most obviously weak. <br> While many of us were absorbed in the holidays, the Trump administration relaxed Medicare’s penalty protocols by “scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury.” In other words, nursing homes that neglect, abuse or even cause the death of residents may be protected from or entitled to lighter fines than they would have been under Obama-era rules. <br> Then there’s the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides health-care coverage for roughly 9 million children. For the first time since the program’s inception in 1997, Congress has failed to reauthorize funding for the program, aside from a short-term cash injection passed in late December. As a result, several states have begun closing enrollment in their programs, or warning families that their children will likely lose their health insurance in the coming months. <br> And if Trump gets his way, they won’t be the only ones. Congress succeeded in repealing the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate with its tax bill, which could destabilize plan prices in the coming years, and Trump still hasn’t given up on replacing Obama-era health-care reforms altogether — with no viable replacement to protect health coverage for Americans who have come to rely on the ACA. Meanwhile, Trump and his administration also are taking aim at welfare this year. <br> The elderly, children, the sick, the poor: All of these are biblical categories of people who are deserving not just of justice — as all people are — but of mercy, as they are especially unable to advocate for themselves and press their interests in the public sphere. Trump could read up a little on the Christian God’s mercy toward the weak in all those Bibles he claims to have. God is a great champion of mercy because he is the ultimate source of all goodness; he can infinitely exceed the demands of justice because he is infinitely good and infinitely strong. But instead of making certain that the weakest people in American society are able to not only exist but thrive, Trump is attacking the relatively meager support they have. <br> Caesar didn’t opt for showy displays of clemency strictly out of personal beneficence. Nor did his leniency make him a benevolent leader. “Merciful he may have been,” Tom Holland wrote in “Dynasty: The Rise and Fall of the House of Caesar,” “but mercy was properly the virtue of a master.” Caesar showed mercy because he had it to give, because he was powerful enough to dispense it. He didn’t need to be stingily protective of his own dignity or wealth, and to be so would have made him seem weaker than he knew he was. Trump, for as much as he styles himself a figure of abundance and luxury, with the guts to take on the strongest in society, is derelict where it comes to justice, and the most nakedly fragile where it comes to mercy. <br> Read more here: <br> Jennifer Rubin: The pathetic neediness of Trump <br> Eugene Robinson: What Trump is really saying in his tweets: I’m weak <br> Eugene Robinson: Trump’s mindless cruelty to a soldier’s widow speaks to the core of his character <br> Gary Abernathy: My New Year’s wish for Trump <br> Alexandra Petri: ‘Julius Caesar’ should go, and all of these, too <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Regarding the Feb. 8 Metro article “An idea whose time has come?”: <br> Since the president and members of Congress suggest revising the tax code to address the gaping hole in the Highway Trust Fund, the most fitting provision to look at is ending the commuter parking benefit, a senseless $7.3 billion tax giveaway that harms our national and local transportation interests.  <br> The parking subsidy tends to benefit mostly upper-income commuters in expensive cities. They generally have options other than driving, and they don’t need a tax break. Meanwhile, the subsidy harms most motorists because of the congestion it induces, which in turn contributes to the deterioration of roads . <br> While ending this tax break won’t solve our funding problems or provide a quick fix for our crumbling infrastructure, it is a logical way to improve transportation for most Americans. <br> David Bragdon, New York 
 Hurricane Harvey has devastated Texas. Now board your windows, evacuate the low ground and watch the damage it is poised to unleash on the nation’s finances. <br> Harvey makes landfall in Washington as soon as next week, when President Trump is expected to ask for what could be tens of billions of dollars in storm relief. And paying for storm recovery — probably with few offsetting spending cuts — will be but the first blow to fiscal discipline in what looks to be a particularly active, and calamitous, spending season. <br> After Harvey comes the debt ceiling, and there are rumblings that the vote to raise the limit could actually be used to increase spending. (In the past, such votes were used by fiscal hawks to cut spending.) At the same time come negotiations to fund the government for fiscal year 2018, and indications are that lawmakers will try to avoid a shutdown with a short-term spending deal that will include a Pentagon slush fund worth tens of billions of dollars. <br> Then, still forming over the Treasury Department is a fiscal Category 4: Trump and Republicans have given clear signs they are moving away from tax reform (a simplification of the tax code that doesn’t necessarily reduce revenue) toward all-out tax cuts, financed by deficit spending. <br> Trump, who came to power promising to eliminate the $20 trillion debt, or at least to cut it in half, is poised to oversee an exponential increase in that debt. Republicans, who came to power with demands that Washington tackle the debt problem, could wind up doing at least as much damage to the nation’s finances as the Democrats did. <br> Rising are the floodwaters of hypocrisy. Surging is the tide of amnesia. Blowing are the gales of profligacy. <br> If the red ink rises according to worst-case forecasts, “we’re talking additions to the debt in the trillions,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, tells me. All from actions to be taken in the next few months. “It turns out the Republican-run Congress is not willing to make the hard choices,” she says. “It is a fiscal free-lunch mentality on all sides.” <br> Trump, announcing his tax-reform plan in a speech Wednesday afternoon in Missouri, left little doubt that he’d ditch tax reform for tax cuts. He dutifully read out his principles from the teleprompter — which he uses when giving a speech somebody else wants him to give — but made clear that he isn’t expecting Democratic cooperation. “We must lower our taxes, and your senator, [Democrat] Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you,” Trump said. “And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to vote her out of office.” Democrats, Trump said, “are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other things.” <br> There is no way to pass a comprehensive tax-reform plan of the sort Ronald Reagan secured — a simplified code, lower rates and closed loopholes — without bipartisan support. And Democrats want tax reform that doesn’t add to the deficit and doesn’t benefit the wealthiest 1 percent of households. But Republicans could pass a simple, deficit-mushrooming tax cut without Democratic support. <br> Trump’s partisan speech confirms other indications that his administration has essentially abandoned tax reform in favor of cuts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn have not been reaching out to Democrats, party leaders complain. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he plans to use the same “reconciliation” resolution he used on the failed attempt to repeal Obamacare to allow for a party-line vote on a tax cut. That process would nominally prevent Republicans from ballooning the deficit — but they could avoid such concerns by using the well-worn gimmick of having the tax cut expire before 10 years. <br> MacGuineas calls this “the predictable spiral from tax reform to tax cuts.” <br> Of course, if Trump and Republican leaders were to come right out with a pure tax cut that would add trillions to the debt, the blatant hypocrisy might swamp the effort. But what if that were to come after months in which other, smaller storms had already saturated the ground and weakened the roots of fiscal responsibility? <br> First, a Harvey recovery bill without the spending “offsets” so many Republicans demanded of previous bills. Then, a debt-limit increase, possibly secured with promises to spend more money on defense (which would buy GOP votes) and domestic priorities (for Democratic votes). Next, a spending deal that busts previously agreed budget caps by allowing an extra $70 billion or so for an “Overseas Contingency Operations” slush fund. Eventually, a reckless tax cut doesn’t seem so crazy — particularly with midterm elections looming and no accomplishments to show. <br> When it rains, it pours. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 T. R. Reid is the author of “A Fine Mess: A Global Quest for a Simpler, Fairer, and More Efficient Tax System.” <br> Republican leaders have proposed to cut the corporate income-tax rate to 20 percent, in a tax plan that adds $1.7 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. How should Democrats respond? <br> They should propose to cut the corporate tax rate to zero — in a tax plan that doesn’t add a penny to the deficit. That way, congressional Democrats can be fiscally responsible and pro-business, promoting new jobs and investment while soaking the rich at the same time. <br> The time has come to kill the corporate income tax once and for all because that tax simply doesn’t work any more. It used to bring in about 30 percent of federal revenue. Today, even with record corporate profits, it amounts to barely 9 percent of total tax payments. <br> That’s because corporations spend hundreds of millions devising ways to avoid the income tax. If we eliminate the tax, the firms could spend that money for capital investment and job creation. And the thousands of Internal Revenue Service employees now assigned to collect corporate taxes could focus instead on catching upper-bracket evaders of the personal income tax. <br> In any case, the Republican plan for a corporate tax rate of 20 percent won’t stop corporations from shifting profits overseas. Many countries have tax rates lower than 20 percent, including such desirable venues as Ireland (12.5 percent), Canada (15 percent) and Germany (15 percent). Bermuda has a corporate rate of zero, which perhaps explains the existence of a subsidiary called Google Bermuda Unlimited. <br> Beyond that, nations will cut special deals to lure corporate money from the United States. When Caterpillar, the maker of those iconic yellow earthmovers, shifted the profits from its spare-parts business to Switzerland, the Swiss agreed to a tax rate of around 6 percent, according to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Would a U.S. rate of 20 percent induce Caterpillar to bring that business home? <br> In short, cutting the rate to 20 percent would slash federal revenue sharply without achieving the goal it is designed for. But a zero-percent rate would give corporations no reason to send profits or jobs overseas. <br> The government wouldn’t have to lose any money from eliminating the corporate income tax. Indeed, it would probably take in more. <br> The United States could collect the revenue it gets now from the corporate tax by taxing corporate distributions through the personal income tax. The money that companies pay out for dividends, stock options, executive perks, commissions, C-Suite bonuses and incentive payments would all be taxed at the full personal income-tax rate. Because most business big shots are in the top income brackets, those distributions would actually be taxed at a higher rate than they are now through the corporate income tax. <br> If corporations use their zero-percent tax windfall to buy back their own stock — causing their stock prices to rise — the capital gains tax would bring in more and more revenue. To make this work, Congress would have to tax capital gains at the same rate as labor income. <br> Conservatives, of course, will denounce such a move as a socialist attack on income from investments. Democrats can reply that the last person to make the capital gains rate the same as the top income-tax rate was that notorious socialist Ronald Reagan. Explaining his 1986 tax-reform plan, Reagan said the capital gains rate had to be raised to stop the “fast-money boys” from devising accounting tricks to cut their tax burden. <br> It would be fascinating to see how business leaders respond to Democrats proposing eliminating the tax on corporate profits. In theory, they would have to embrace this bold move — it would save their companies large sums and significantly enhance the bottom line. But this plan would increase the personal income taxes of highly paid executives. Would chief executives dare to oppose it in order to protect their own bank accounts? <br> So far, the Democrats have had little to say in response to the GOP plan for corporate income-tax cuts. Proposing a zero-percent corporate income-tax rate, with no increase in the deficit, would in a single stroke make them champions of U.S. industry and the darlings of fiscal conservatives everywhere. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: If the tax bill is so great, why does the GOP keep lying about it? <br> E.J.

 I offer my highest praises to photographer Melina Mara for her expertly timed and framed, snort-coffee-out-your-nose photograph of the self-proclaimed congressional leadership for “tax reform” [front page, Sept. 28]. Mara should be encouraged to provide material for a weekly caption competition. I’d suggest, “One guy you want in your wallet, and seven you don’t” for this one. But I’m sure readers would find this picture and more like it fertile ground for a wide range of humorous responses. <br> Allan Williams, Arlington 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> THE SENATE late Thursday narrowly approved a budget plan that could cost the nation dearly. The goal is a massive tax cut with uncertain benefits for most Americans, in an economy that does not require the sort of short-term jolt that deficit-financed tax cuts are good for. The price tag is $1.5 trillion in new debt over 10 years. <br> The bad news is that several Republicans who previously expressed deep concern about the country’s shaky finances voted for the budget outline, clearing the way for this foolish plan. The good news is that they still have a chance to show that they are not irresponsible hypocrites. Thursday’s vote was just the first step in a long process of hashing out exactly what the tax cut would look like — and, therefore, how damaging it would be. <br> This policy push began with a much better idea: real tax reform. Congress would cut tax rates — particularly for corporations, which face a relatively high nominal rate — but would recoup the revenue by closing tax loopholes and ending big tax breaks. Both sides of this plan would help the economy. Lowering corporate rates would make the United States a more attractive place to do business. Ending tax breaks would fight tax gaming by the wealthy and cut unneeded government interference in private decisions about where to invest money. The result would be a fairer and more efficient tax code, without adding a penny to the debt. Republicans and Democrats should be able to agree on such a policy. <br> But as the plan has developed, Republicans have balked at doing the hard stuff — that is, raising revenue. Instead of clipping their ambitions to reduce tax rates so that it continued to line up with their willingness to offset them, Republicans have steadily gravitated toward simply not paying for them. The Senate on Thursday put a number on its fiscal recklessness, giving itself permission to leave $1.5 trillion in tax cuts unpaid-for. <br> Republicans respond that the way these numbers have to be officially counted makes them look worse than reality. The reasoning is complex, but the bottom line is simple: They want to use a budgeting gimmick that previous congresses have properly declined to exploit. The tax plan’s backers also argue that the cut will spur economic growth, which will eventually return more money to the Treasury than traditional budget calculations would suggest. The myth that tax cuts pay for themselves has been debunked by both economic theory and practical experience. While some “dynamic” effects are possible, they are hard to predict and certainly not as large as tax-cut enthusiasts claim. <br> There is still time for reason to prevail. Before the Senate voted for fiscal irresponsibility, the House passed a budget plan calling for revenue-neutral tax reform. This concept must be revived as the action turns to congressional committees, which will fill in the crucial details — which taxes will be cut, by how much, with which offsets. At the end of this process, the chambers must vote again on the whole package. The senators who surrendered to fiscal cowardice on Thursday will have one last chance to prove themselves responsible. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> REPUBLICANS INSIST that their tax reform is designed to help the middle class and curb the use of tax loopholes. But a little-discussed provision tells a different story. That provision is the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, which would serve the interests of wealthy taxpayers — and tax avoiders. <br> For taxpayers who itemize, the AMT is a small annual hassle. About 5 million taxpayers end up paying more because of the tax; many others would no doubt welcome a break from the annoyance. But the AMT serves a purpose: It prevents wealthier taxpayers from using deductions and loopholes to shrink their tax liability to little or nothing. It asks tax filers to run their numbers twice — once under the traditional code and once under a separate structure designed to ensure everyone pays a minimum rate. If the latter results in a higher number than the former, the taxpayer must pay extra. <br> The AMT hits very few households making below $200,000 a year. By contrast, the majority of households earning between $500,000 and $1 million annually pay the AMT. It does not hit the super-wealthy as hard, forcing only a fifth of households making above $1 million a year to pay more, in part because it excludes dividend and interest income, from which the super-wealthy disproportionately benefit. Even so, the public knows of at least one high-profile, high-income AMT payer: Donald Trump, whom the AMT obliged to pay $31 million in 2005, the one year for which the public has seen his summary tax information. <br> AMT critics argue that, in addition to adding complexity, the tax fails to rein in the most egregious tax sheltering. Yet even if it does not crack down on all tax avoidance, it ensures that a lot of relatively well-off people can’t get away with paying little or nothing. <br> Critics also argue that if Republicans eliminate many of the tax code’s deductions and loopholes, and in particular the big deduction for state and local taxes, the AMT would become less needed. But the GOP plan keeps plenty of loopholes in place. And even if that were not the case, the AMT, or a modified version that better targeted the super-rich, would future-proof the tax code against the likelihood that lawmakers over time will restore deductions and loopholes, a safe bet over the coming years and decades. It is unlikely that, when lawmakers add a new deduction here or there, they will have the foresight or discipline to create a new AMT. Not until the resulting tax avoidance becomes egregious — and maybe not even then. <br> In the name of code simplification, Congress would enable tax-gaming among people who can afford to pay their fair share. Meanwhile, the GOP plan would tax worthier interests, such as university endowments, to raise cash. Like much else in the GOP plan, this is neither fiscally responsible nor just. <br> Read more: <br> Catherine Rampell: This tax reform thing won’t be as easy as Republicans think <br> The Post’s View: Trump says the GOP tax plan would make him a ‘big loser.’ Prove it. <br> Jennifer Rubin: No doubt about who wins under the GOP tax plan <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s tax ‘miracle’: Cowardice and dishonesty <br> George F.

 The focus on President Trump’s political strength among white working-class voters distracts from a truth that may be more important: His rise depended on support from rich conservatives, and his program serves the interests of those who have accumulated enormous wealth. <br> This explains why so few congressional Republicans denounce him, no matter how close he edges toward autocracy, how much bigotry he spreads — or how often he panders to Vladimir Putin and denounces our own intelligence officials, as he did again this weekend. <br> The GOP leadership knows Trump is tilting our economy toward people just like him, the objective they care about most. <br> To borrow from the president, he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and still not lose House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) as long as they have a reactionary tax bill to push into law. <br> Last Tuesday’s elections demonstrated how fed up large parts of the nation are with Trump and how mobilized his opponents have become. The returns ratified polls showing the overwhelming majority of Americans rejecting his stewardship. <br> Rather than just celebrate the good news, Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans should move next to undermine Trump’s key asset. He needs to be exposed as a fraud whenever he says he has the backs of the “forgotten men and women” whose living standards have been shattered in the new economy. <br> Admittedly, doing this will be harder for conservatives than for progressives. After all, many conservatives have defended trickle-down economics for decades. But there is a wing of conservatism that has criticized the GOP for exploiting the votes of working-class Americans for years, even before Trump, while delivering them a whole lot of nothing. <br> This was the argument of the 2008 book “Grand New Party” by Ross Douthat, now a New York Times columnist, and Reihan Salam, an independent-minded conservative policy analyst. They proposed that Republicans become “the party of Sam’s Club.” But the existing party’s tax proposals confirm that the GOP is the party of Prada. And Prada may be a trifle downscale to capture the radical redistribution upward that these tax cuts would bring about. It is Exhibit A for how far Trump and his party will go to entrench an economic oligarchy. <br> Trump’s willingness to help Republican leaders pay off their largest contributors is the clearest explanation for why they debase themselves through their complicity with him. If you think this is harsh, consider the words of Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.): “My donors are basically saying, ‘Get this done or don’t ever call me again.’ ” <br> I bet they are. <br> As Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, told CNBC’s John Harwood: “The most excited group out there are big CEOs, about our tax plan.” <br> They should be. The bills now before the House and Senate don’t simply favor the well-off over the middle class and the poor. They advantage certain kinds of extremely rich people over Americans who work for salaries and wages, including some rather affluent people who draw those old-fashioned things called paychecks. Even Karl Marx would be astonished at how far Republicans are willing to go to benefit capital over labor. <br> All sorts of deductions used by the middle and upper-middle classes are being thrown over the side to pay for a cut in the nominal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, which is especially helpful to the biggest stockholders — and, in the House version, to relieve those struggling millionaire and billionaire heirs and heiresses from the horrible burdens of the estate tax. (The Senate version would reduce but not eliminate the tax.) <br> Repealing various tax breaks might be justified if these proposals actually simplified the tax code to make it fairer. But in many ways, this concoction makes the code even more complex with all its special provisions for “pass-through” income and the like. That’s another big lie in this deal: The GOP never cared about simplification. It just wants to further the interests of its flushest friends. <br> Oh, yes, and Republicans, who would demand that Hillary Clinton disclose every penny of her high school earnings from lawn mowing or babysitting, won’t think of asking Trump to release his tax returns so we can know how many benefits he might sign into law for himself. <br> The Trump regime is not all that innovative. It hides its policies behind divisive rhetoric about kneeling National Football League players — NFL owners would profit from the bill, by the way — and immigrants. This is the sort of thing right-wing authoritarians have done for decades. It never turns out well. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Kirk J. Stark is the Barrall Family Professor of Tax Law and Policy at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law. Eric M. Zolt, the Michael H. Schill Distinguished Professor of Law at UCLA, served in the Office of Tax Policy at the Treasury Department from 1989 to 1992. <br> Amid the partisan rancor surrounding the framework for tax reform developed by GOP congressional leaders, there is one area of remarkable consensus: lower taxes for the middle class. The political logic is not hard to understand. The middle class continues to struggle, and, with midterm elections just around the corner, both parties need the support of middle-class voters. <br> But missing from the tax debate is an appreciation that lawmakers have already crafted a tax-friendly regime for middle-income taxpayers. The result is a more progressive tax system that raises less revenue. Unless Congress is willing to dramatically cut major entitlement programs and eschew new social programs to address poverty and declining economic mobility, we need more tax revenue from the middle class, not less. <br> Middle-class tax burdens are at historic lows. The Congressional Budget Office reported in 2016 that the average federal income tax rate for the middle class — here meaning the middle 60 percent of the income distribution — declined from 7.8 percent in 1979 to 3.4 percent in 2013. Focusing on all federal taxes (not just income taxes), the average tax rate dropped from 19.2 to 13.8 percent over the same period. With these lower tax rates, the share of taxes paid by the middle class has also declined. The middle class paid 35 percent of income taxes in 1979 but only 16 percent in 2013, while its share of all federal taxes fell from 43 to 30 percent. <br> Tax burdens on the American middle class are low not only by historical standards, but also in comparison with other developed countries. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reveal that American families with children face substantially lower average income-tax rates (in some cases, less than half) than similar families in other developed countries. And this is before factoring in consumption taxes, which represent a large share of middle-class tax burdens in most countries, but not in the United States. <br> How did we get here? To be sure, some of the decline in middle-class tax burdens results from its declining fortunes. The middle 60 percent of households accounted for 49 percent of all pre-tax income in 1979 but only 43.4 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, the share of pre-tax income going to the top 1 percent increased from 8.9 to 15 percent. Even without changes in the tax code, such skewed income growth would have reduced the middle-class share of taxes paid. <br> But the current tax structure is also the product of a host of pro-middle-class policies. This is not a well-thought-out, comprehensive strategy, but rather a series of uncoordinated changes in our tax laws. Some of the changes, such as expansions in the earned-income tax credit, were designed to help poor families but also benefitted many middle-class households. Others, such as the child tax credit, were expressly crafted to benefit the middle class. <br> Still other cuts, such as the 2001 rate reductions, provided political grease for the “tax cuts for everyone” strategy that dominates U.S. politics. This approach appeals to both parties, since Republicans favor small government while Democrats favor tax progressivity. But it also undercuts the government’s ability to pay for its core responsibilities. <br> The middle class faces significant economic challenges and increased vulnerability, such as income stagnation, declining wealth and decreased job security. It is also grappling with dramatic increases in housing costs, medical care and education. The Big Six tax-reform framework responds to these challenges by reducing the already low federal tax burden on the middle class even further. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the framework would result in an average tax cut of $660 per household for members of the middle 20 percent (as well as an $8,500 cut for households in the top 20 percent and $130,000 cut for the top 1 percent). <br> While this modest increase in middle-class disposable income might be helpful, it would do little to fund government programs that alleviate economic insecurity. What the middle class needs is not meager tax cuts but a muscular commitment to robust public institutions designed to benefit middle-income individuals. The higher taxes could come from our current income tax (from tax increases on the middle class and the wealthy) or a broad-based consumption tax (such as a VAT or carbon tax). <br> How a country raises revenue strongly influences how the money is spent. Countries with more comprehensive social programs impose higher taxes on the middle class. Paradoxically, then, we may need less progressive taxes to fund more progressive spending programs. <br> So enough of the middle-class tax cuts. It is time for a new fiscal strategy. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump’s tax proposals won’t actually help the middle class.

 Desperation seems to be driving Republicans this grateful season as they seek to trade polar bears for tax cuts, while fervently praying that former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore didn’t do what he’s alleged to have done, which might give the U.S. Senate another Democratic vote. <br> The race is on to pass tax reform before Dec. 12, when Alabama will select a new senator to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Moore, best known as the “Ten Commandments judge,” has been accused of having pursued teenage girls several decades ago when he was in his 30s. He is set to face off against Democrat Doug Jones, who prosecuted two of the Klansmen accused of setting off the bomb in a Birmingham church that killed four African American girls in 1963. <br> Paging Flannery O’Connor. Not that this evolving Southern gothic narrative needs a fiction writer’s labors. Even O’Connor, who once explained Southerners’ tendency to write about “freaks” because “we are still able to recognize one,” would be hard-pressed to embellish the already weird. We might also ping William Faulkner while we’re at it, who noted that the past isn’t past. In Alabama, where I once worked as a reporter, the past just keeps on truckin’. <br> In the wake of these accusations by four women, including one who was 14 at the time of Moore’s alleged advances, several Republican senators have offered cautious remarks, saying that “if true,” then Moore should step aside. If true, Moore should probably have reread those commandments more closely rather than forcing his courtroom audiences to study them as he presided over others’ moral failings. <br> While it is neither right nor fair to condemn another without due process, the statute of limitations is well past on these allegations, which were published by Post reporters who spent a month interviewing dozens of people in addition to the accusers. In the case of one teen, Moore allegedly offered alcohol to his underage date and modeled his “tight white” underwear. The swirl of allegations arrived at a moment when it seemed likely that Moore was to become Alabama’s senator. The state hasn’t elected a Democrat to the office in more than 20 years. <br> As momentum builds for Moore’s possible retreat and optimism grows among Alabama Democrats, Republicans desperate to pass something before year’s end have been trying to pull elephants out of hats. Or something. In addition to proposing tax cuts for the rich, they’ve turned from draining the swamp to thawing the Arctic to scrounge up more money. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has introduced a bill that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. <br> Murkowski, usually the more rational member of Alaska’s Senate duo, seems to have fallen under the spell of the greedy brotherhood. If we were desperate for oil, her bill might make more sense, but we’re in the midst of a glut. Some environmentalists, meanwhile, have questioned the Congressional Budget Office’s projection that Arctic drilling would produce $1.1 billion over a decade. For this to be true, they say, oil would need to earn $70 per barrel. Yet, in West Texas today, a barrel of crude oil is selling for about $57. Obviously, this is only a $13 difference. And the refuge contains 19 million acres, of which Murkowski proposes exploiting only 800,000. <br> For now. But what about later? And what refuge might be next? <br> More than 100 years ago, when the first national wildlife refuge was established by President Theodore Roosevelt, we seemed to have a better sense of our role as wardens of our nation’s natural resources and the ecosystems that support wildlife. The idea that we no longer need to protect or manage animals humanely — or that they still have more than enough acreage to sustain them — ignores the reasons we created these protections in the first place and the reality that the planet does not, in fact, require our presence. <br> The fact that this is a partisan issue simply ignores reason. <br> That a few Republicans would sacrifice even a square inch of the Arctic unnecessarily for the profit of a political victory is, frankly, as stomach-turning as the image of a tighty-whitey-wearing Roy Moore pawing a 14-year-old. Surely, there’s a better way to make a buck — and a better soul to warm Sessions’s seat. <br> Read more from Kathleen Parker’s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> Dana Milbank: Roy Moore and Republicans, taking the Bible literally but not seriously <br> The Post’s View: The Republican rot runs deeper than Roy Moore <br> Kathleen Parker: Congress grizzly betrayal <br> Catherine Rampell: This tax reform thing won’t be as easy as Republicans think <br> The Post’s View: Neither side is really right on offshore drilling <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 President Trump campaigned on helping the little guy. His latest tax proposal, he says, is about helping the middle guy. <br> “It’s a middle-class bill,” Trump promised an audience of truckers last week. <br> Other administration officials and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have also claimed that their primary objective in reconfiguring the tax code is to help the middle class, not the wealthy. <br> Unfortunately, they seem to have gotten things backward. <br> In a preliminary analysis, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that 80 percent of the proposed tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of earners over the next decade. Meanwhile a quarter of households in the middle quintile would see their tax bills rise. <br> This should be no surprise, when you consider what’s in the Republican framework. <br> It cuts the top personal income tax rate; eliminates estate taxes, which currently befall only estates worth at least $5.5 million; kills the alternative minimum tax; and slashes rates on pass-through income. The White House has lately even made the absurd claim that its enormous, unfunded corporate rate cuts are primarily about helping the middle class. <br> On Monday, the president’s Council of Economic Advisers released a report claiming that corporate tax cuts would boost the average household’s income by at least $4,000. This estimate relies on a series of assumptions that seem dubious at best, given other research (including one recently deleted paper by Treasury’s own staff economists).   <br> All this made me wonder: What would a tax plan that actually prioritizes the middle class look like? <br> Not much like the one Republican leadership cooked up, but it could still include elements appealing to both parties. <br> A real middle-class tax plan would likely include a large expansion of the earned income tax credit. <br> For decades the EITC has supplemented lower-income people’s pay through a tax refund. It’s pro-work, because it increases the payoff from holding down a job. It also meaningfully improves working families’ living standards. <br> Given these selling points, the EITC has historically enjoyed support from both Republicans and Democrats. In recent years, both Ryan and President Barack Obama proposed making it more generous to workers who don’t have custody of a minor child. <br> Curiously, though, the current GOP framework says not a peep about this powerful tool. <br> Fortunately, there’s an (admittedly expensive) off-the-shelf policy available: a Democratic plan to expand EITC eligibility up the wage ladder, to households making as much as $76,000 depending on family size. The legislation would also roughly double the maximum size of the EITC for working families and almost sextuple it for childless workers. <br> These expansions are designed to help middle-income workers “reclaim” the pay they would have received had there not been decades of wage stagnation, the House bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), told me in a recent interview. <br> Khanna also observed that expanding the EITC is a much more direct way to raise middle-class families’ earnings than some Rube-Goldberg-like corporate tax-code machinations. <br>  “Trump is saying he’s going to cut the corporate tax rate in order to raise your wages,” Khanna said. “I’m saying: Let’s just raise your wages.” <br> We could also help middle-income families by expanding the child tax credit. <br> The GOP tax plan does include an expansion of this credit, to be sure. But what they’ve announced so far doesn’t do much for the middle class.  <br> That’s because the expansion appears to be non-refundable (meaning it primarily helps higher-income filers), and it mostly serves to offset the framework’s elimination of personal exemptions, explains Tax Policy Center researcher Elaine Maag.   <br> Other more generous expansions would be possible though, including a version pushed by Republican Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Mike Lee (Utah). <br> What about the corporate tax code? <br> There are some changes that could arguably boost growth and productivity, some of whose benefits could (ahem) trickle down to workers. Cutting rates and eliminating distortionary loopholes could be helpful — which is why Democrats previously said they’d support such a plan. <br> Only, though, if the plan were revenue neutral. <br> A revenue-negative plan most likely hurts growth in the long run, as Obama’s former chief economist Jason Furman points out. More important, someone eventually has to cover the cost of unfunded tax cuts through some future combination of higher taxes and lower spending. Lower spending almost certainly would disparately hurt lower- and middle-income families. <br> Which is why the best thing elected officials can do to help the middle class would be to make sure any promised benefits are adequately funded. Which would mean raising rather than cutting tax revenue. <br> Something tells me that’s not what Republicans have in mind here. <br> Read more here: <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: Trump’s tax-reform pitch is entirely divorced from reality <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s tax ‘miracle’: Cowardice and dishonesty <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 Christmas is back, and better than ever: Haven’t you heard? “People are proud to be saying Merry Christmas again,” President Trump declared on Twitter on Christmas Eve, with an unmistakable note of triumph. <br> As has been widely pointed out, this whole enterprise is a farce. But it’s a particular kind of farce: One we might call a “Trumpish victory.” If a Pyrrhic victory is one that secures a minor win at the cost of a larger defeat, a Trumpish victory is a nominal success that illuminates an overall loss: In this case, interpreting a greeting-card salutation as a win for Christianity when it’s really another episode in a war of resentment that shares little with the Christian faith. <br> “I am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!” Trump’s tweet continued. “Trump just hasn’t put Christ back in Christmas, but he’s also put prayer back into the White House,” rejoiced Paula White, Trump’s on-hand evangelical Christian, during a Monday appearance on Fox News. Rev. Franklin Graham echoed her sentiment during his own Fox News spot: “I’m so excited that the president isn’t afraid to mention the name of Jesus Christ.” <br> It has been lengthily observed that President Barack Obama said “Merry Christmas” during his tenure as commander in chief and as recently as this year; that Trump has gladly uttered “Happy Holidays” in the past; that nobody ever really stopped wishing their friends and loved ones a Merry Christmas; that prayer has long been in the White House; and that Trump himself seems almost comically indifferent to the Christian religion unless it can be summed up in a phrase that might, hopefully, offend somebody. <br> It’s possible that, seeing all the ruckus being raised over the greeting, some person somewhere felt newly encouraged to wish a neighbor a merry Christmas. But it’s also the case that more Americans (52 percent) don’t care what store clerks say to them at the holidays than consider Christmas a primarily religious holiday to begin with (46 percent), and that acknowledging the secure right of private citizens to say whatever they want — festive greetings notwithstanding — is affirming the same socio-political order that permits people to be credibly offended by whatever it is you choose to say. You can say “Merry Christmas,” in other words, not because there’s anything special about Christianity, but precisely because there isn’t. <br> Trump’s defenders don’t bother saying the purported resurgence of their preferred salutation signals any kind of comeback for Christianity itself; they’re concerned with the greeting as a speech act, as rebellion against the “political correct police,” as White inartfully put it. Moreover, White emphasized, Trump has “put justice back into, and religious freedom back into, our courts.” It’s not about evangelization, in other words, and it’s not about anything so bold as the secular state affirming the truth-value of Christianity. It’s about freedom, liberty and exploiting the resentments that arise in a society where people hold vastly different, diametrically opposed, emotionally charged beliefs that they are expected to keep private. Even Breitbart News agrees. When the 30,000-member Freedom from Religion Foundation took out an ad in the New York Times criticizing Trump partly for his merry Christmas campaign, the conservative outlet countered that “Trump . . . has made religious freedom a hallmark of his agenda,” citing Trump’s vow that “We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced again and we will never stand for religious discrimination” as a summary of his ethos. <br> The liberty framing is crucial. It means that Christian greetings, like other Christian signs and symbols, ought to be permitted to private citizens because the state ought not privilege one religion over any other. This is a classically liberal approach to religion, and it presumes that religion is something that can be safely privatized, domesticated, narrowed to a point of personal preference or, if you’re feeling cheeky, a salutation proffered to a store clerk you don’t know as they pick up working hours over the holidays. Go ahead and say it if you want, or don’t if you don’t; if you get really lucky, somebody you already don’t like may even be bothered by it. This sentiment contains almost every pathology of contemporary American life, but it’s not Christian, and aggressively wishing others a “Merry Christmas” strictly to assert that your in-group is currently empowered isn’t a victory for the faith, even if it passes for one in our current conditions. <br> On the other hand, if you want to see the measure of a politician’s commitment to Christianity, try telling them something they don’t want to hear. In a Nov. 22 letter to the Senate analyzing the Republicans’ tax reform bill, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops declared that “Congress must . . . make certain that the nation does not further enshrine indifference toward the poor into law,” a most un-Christian practice, by amending its legislation to “better ensure a just and moral framework for all.” Congress didn’t listen. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> David von Drehle: The mythical ‘war on Christmas’ drives us apart <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Can we get real about “tax reform,” the Republican promise to enact deep tax cuts that will spur economic growth? Probably not, but let’s give it a try. <br> For starters, we can stop calling it “reform.” That’s a charged word, implying that the new tax system will be superior to the old. We don’t know that for a fact; the new system might be worse. Better to call what we’re doing the “tax debate” or “tax overhaul.” (The point is a general one. Advocates of policy changes routinely label their proposals “reform.” This suggests improvement, which may be nonexistent.) <br> Second, we cannot afford a net tax cut. If we are to lower tax rates and simplify complex tax provisions, we must offset the revenue losses by plugging loopholes, raising other taxes or cutting spending. Under current policies, the Congressional Budget Office has projected $10 trillion in deficits from 2018 to 2027. Trump’s tax plan, including provisions that would raise revenue, would add an additional $3.5 trillion in deficits over a decade, estimates the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (TPC). <br> Third, if tax cuts were initially financed by more deficit spending, the costs of today’s lower taxes would be transferred to future generations. “Tax cuts often look like ‘free lunches’ for taxpayers, but they eventually have to be paid for with other tax increases or spending cuts,” says a new report from the TPC. (The report is based on a broad outline of Trump’s plan, subject to change.) This is not “reform.” Social Security and Medicare — paid mainly by workers’ payroll taxes — already involve huge intergenerational transfers. Deficits are both a cause and consequence of those transfers. <br> Still, the superficial appeal of Trump’s tax plan is undeniable. For individuals, taxes would be reduced and simplified. There would be only three personal rates — 10, 25 and 35 percent — compared with today’s top rate of 43.4 percent. The top corporate rate would fall from about 35 to 15 percent. To help pay for these cuts, most itemized deductions would be ended (exceptions: the deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest payments). <br> Roughly 71 percent of households would receive a tax cut, estimates the TPC. The trouble is that the tax cuts are regressive: That is, compared to household incomes and existing tax burdens, they favor the rich and upper middle class as opposed to the poor and lower middle class. The cuts for the richest fifth of Americans would average $19,510, with the cuts for the top 1 percent averaging $196,420, estimates the TPC. Meanwhile, the fifth of Americans in the middle of the income distribution would get an average cut of $1,320. <br> Actually, nothing would be wrong with this if there were convincing evidence that lower tax rates stimulate significantly faster economic growth. But there isn’t. Tax cuts may cushion a recession and improve the business climate, but they don’t automatically raise long-term growth. A 2014 study by the Congressional Research Service put it this way: “A review of statistical evidence suggests that both labor supply and savings and investment are relatively insensitive to tax rates.” <br> The truth is that we need higher, not lower, taxes. When the economy is at or near “full employment,” the budget should be balanced or even show a slight surplus. At 4.3 percent, the jobless rate is surely close to full employment, while the deficit for fiscal 2017 is reckoned to approach $700 billion, about 3.6 percent of the economy (gross domestic product). Both figures are expected to increase, despite continuous (assumed) economic growth. The gap can’t be blamed on the business cycle. <br> We are undertaxed. Government spending, led by the cost of retirees, regularly exceeds our tax intake. In the past, I have advocated a carbon tax — introduced gradually to minimize any recession risk — as a pragmatic way to pay for the government we want, while trying to cope with global climate change. Letting the federal debt buildup continue is an exercise in self-serving optimism. It presumes that the possibly adverse consequences (the crowding out of private investment, a currency crisis) will never materialize. <br> Given the complexities, the best we can probably expect from a tax overhaul is a modest reduction in tax rates paid by tightening or eliminating some tax preferences. This would not be undesirable; the fewer tax preferences, the less lobbying to keep or expand them. Washington’s “swamp” would be a tad drier. <br> But we should not delude ourselves that we are fixing the economy, the budget or the tax system. Mostly, through deficits, we would be shifting the costs of today’s lower taxes and higher benefits onto tomorrow’s Americans through higher taxes and lower benefits. Admitting this would require a more honest debate than most Americans are willing to abide. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> The Post’s View: How the GOP may break its promise on its tax plan and the debt <br> The Post’s View: Expect this to be a key GOP talking point in the tax-reform debate <br> The Post’s View: The latest on tax reform is about cutting rates.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> PROMISES ARE made to be broken, especially in politics — and especially about tax reform. If not, then we would be talking about Congress’s passage of “significant” tax reform before its August recess, which is what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pledged six months ago. Admittedly, that busted promise was about only process; policy is what counts. In that regard, Republicans have said repeatedly that their plan, details of which are still in flux, will be “revenue-neutral.” That’s Washington-speak for: The rewritten tax code will raise as much money for the government as the old one, so as not to increase the national debt. <br> Unfortunately, as President Trump prepares to go on the road rallying public support for tax reform this week, there are signs this promise of fiscal responsibility might be about to get, well, bent. Bear with us for some technical background. Revenue neutrality is not an absolute, but measured in relation to how much money Uncle Sam would take in under a given set of assumptions. Under current tax law, revenue should rise from 17.3 percent of gross domestic product now to 18.4 percent by 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Before the August recess, the House Budget Committee actually voted for a bill that said tax reform would have to produce as much revenue as this so-called “current law” baseline projects. This happens to be the usual rule. <br> Yet the Senate Budget Committee has yet to decide whether to follow suit, and key voices in the Republican camp are urging that lawmakers define revenue neutrality down, via adoption of a more fiscally permissive standard known as the “current policy” baseline. Current tax law is cluttered with special “temporary” breaks that Congress has habitually renewed in the past. Assuming that this past practice, not the letter of the law, would prevail reduces the government’s expected revenues by nearly a half-trillion dollars over the coming decade. To the extent that it comports with Congress’s fiscally slipshod history, the “current policy” baseline does have the advantage of realism, just as Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s “Better Way” blueprint noted last year. Not coincidentally, however, it also makes it easier to slice tax rates for the wealthy and business without offsetting loophole reductions, and still claim revenue neutrality. <br> There’s another catch: In December 2015, Congress passed a bipartisan measure making many of the perennial “temporary” tax breaks permanent, which, by negative implication, made the remaining ones really, truly subject to expiration. Indeed, the bill was trumpeted as a last go-round for the bad old habit of extending such breaks. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) specifically said the law would “end . . . the repeated tax extenders exercise,” making “conditions vastly more favorable for comprehensive tax reform in the future.” For Republicans to act as though none of those words had any meaning would confirm that not only promises were made to be broken, but rules were, too. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: The Republican tax-reform plan isn’t reform at all <br> Douglas Holtz-Eakin: Trump’s tax plan is built on a fairy tale <br> The Post’s View: The Trump administration’s magical thinking on taxes would bust the budget <br> Derek Kaufman: Trump’s tax and infrastructure plans couldn’t come at a worse time <br> Lawrence Summers: On tax reform, take a page from Ronald Reagan <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Regarding the Aug. 31 news article “Trump’s speech on tax reform rekindles debate”: <br> As the president reveals his plan for so-called tax reform, he’s calling for a lower corporate tax rate, which he says will create all sorts of new jobs. This certainly hasn’t happened in the past, but if the administration really wants tax reform to help create more jobs and raise pay, why not try tying any reduction in a corporation’s tax rate to the number of jobs it adds and the amount it raises its hourly wages? If a corporation added a specified number of jobs in a year, its tax rate would be decreased according to how many jobs it added, putting more money into the economy rather than just lining the pockets of its executives. <br> Morton Lebow, Washington <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> “HERE IS everything you need to know about our plan,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s (R-Wis.) press office promised in an email offering links to thousands of words of material on the House GOP’s new tax-cut proposal. But it did not contain some crucial information that we would like to know and that every lawmaker should have before voting on the package: how the plan would personally benefit President Trump. <br> Figuring this out would be easy for anyone following the tax-cut debate — if, that is, the public had access to the president’s tax returns. But Mr. Trump has broken with decades of bipartisan tradition and refuses to release his tax forms, past or present. So Americans can only guess about the nature and size of his personal stake in the GOP tax plan. <br> There’s reason to guess he might do very well by it. <br> For example, the House GOP tax plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax. When summary information from Mr. Trump’s 2005 tax return leaked, it showed that the AMT obliged him to pay $31 million more in federal taxes that year. The tax worked in that case just as intended, limiting Mr. Trump’s ability to deduct and loophole his taxable income far below what would have been reasonable for someone of his wealth. How many millions would Mr. Trump stand to save just from the AMT repeal? <br> Similarly, the House GOP proposal would cut rates on “pass-through” income for certain types of privately held companies — the types that Mr. Trump frequently used to conduct his business. Republicans may limit the scale of the break, out of concern that they would otherwise create a new loophole for tax dodgers. But they are still debating how to structure the shift. These details could have large implications for the president’s bottom line. <br> Lawmakers also should not ignore the fact that Mr. Trump’s family would almost certainly benefit from eliminating the estate tax, another piece of the GOP plan. Republicans argue that killing the “death tax” is about preserving family farms and other heirloom property. In fact, the tax already applies only to the richest of estates. The Trump family is a better example of the likely beneficiary. Without more information on Mr. Trump’s financial situation, it is hard to know by how much. <br> Refusing to release tax returns is just one of many ways in which Mr. Trump represents a distressing departure from the country’s democratic norms. Members of Congress should respond by conducting their own business with the dignity Mr. Trump lacks. A self-respecting legislature would insist on minimal transparency from the executive branch. The House Ways and Means Committee on Monday began several days of formal discussion on the GOP tax-cut plan. The debate should not have even started without some basic clarity about the president’s conflicts of interest. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> The Post’s View: If Republicans believe their tax cut will pay for itself, here’s how they can prove it <br> The Post’s View: Republicans break their promise on tax reform <br> Ruth Marcus: Tax cuts are worse than unwarranted.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> AFTER ALL the GOP howling about deficits when President Barack Obama was trying to stave off a depression in 2009, Republicans now in power are getting ever closer to adding an enormous amount to the debt — not to save the economy but to finance a big tax cut. The hypocrisy is bad, but if they succeed, the consequences for the country would be far worse. <br> Republicans began their push to reshape the tax system by promising to make their reforms revenue neutral. Individual and corporate tax rates would be cut, they vowed, but so would expensive loopholes. With enough offsets, the government would lose no money and end up with a more efficient tax code. <br> But tax cuts are easy to hand out, while closing loopholes takes a bit more spine. So “tax reform” has steadily evolved toward “tax cuts.” And last week the Spineless Caucus scored a notable victory when Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who had pressed for revenue neutrality, agreed to a budget framework that would allow $1.5 trillion in tax cuts without direct offsets. <br> Defenders of the plan say that it could still end up being revenue neutral, in part because economic growth would offset much or all of that $1.5 trillion hit. Outside experts, however, warn that these assurances are too optimistic. Changes in taxing and spending policy certainly can affect the rate of economic growth. But economists cannot project how much, nor the effects on federal revenue, with precision. Given the country’s already stretched finances, the only reasonable option is to avoid tax plans that could make budget problems worse, burdening future generations even more than they already will be. <br> The United States is in the midst of one of the longest periods of uninterrupted economic expansion in the country’s history, negating the case for a short-term stimulus in the form of unpaid-for tax cuts. Moreover, a demographic wave is set to clobber public finances, as baby boomers retire and demand expensive social services. No amount of wishful thinking can override these realities. <br> The White House and congressional leaders aim to release a tax-reform outline this week. Following that, Republicans will work on budget outlines that set broad taxing and spending goals. As the process has proceeded, Republicans have moved steadily further away from the prudence they demanded of Democrats just a few years ago. No GOP plan that proposes tax cuts without fully offsetting loophole cuts or spending reductions should be taken seriously. As talks continue, Mr. Corker and others who have shown they understand the danger still have an opportunity to resist piling on more debt. They should hold firm. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Paul Waldman: Republicans are going to sell their tax cuts with lies. Will we hold them accountable? <br> Robert J.

 Poor Johnny Lunchbucket. He’s been had. <br> President Trump promised to look out for the forgotten man and to fix a “rigged” tax system. Now he and congressional Republicans have proposed a tax cut that makes the rich richer and shifts the burden onto the working class. <br> The numbers don’t lie, but if you need more evidence, consider this: Billionaires Sheldon Adelson, Todd Ricketts, and Charles and David Koch are paying tens of millions of dollars to persuade working-class Americans to support a tax bill that would net these billionaires even more billions. In a cynical twist, they’re not even arguing, primarily, about trickle-down or rising-tide economics. These plutocratic populists are actually claiming the tax cuts would go to the middle class. <br> “What’s in it for you?” asks a new ad, reportedly backed by $10 million, from the “45 Committee,” founded by Adelson and Ricketts. Axios, in a report “presented by Koch Industries,” says the 45 Committee will spend “at least $10 million” on the ad. “The Republican tax cut saves middle class families more than $1,200 a year, according to independent analysis. The first $24,000 of your income would be tax free,” the announcer says, over images of a factory floor. “It will simplify your taxes and close loopholes so everybody pays their fair share. More money in your pocket. A stronger economy. That’s what’s in it for you.” <br> Then there’s the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity ad in which a young woman speaks earnestly. “The powerful, the well-connected, the politicians — they’ll stop benefiting from a rigged system,” says this ad, paid for by the powerful and well-connected. “It means everyday Americans will have more to spend on what’s important to them.” <br> Next up, an ad from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, also Koch-backed. Another factory scene. “We don’t have a team of lawyers and lobbyists to look out for our business,” says a small-business man in this ad, paid for by those with the most powerful team of lawyers and lobbyists. “The hard-working folks simply can’t afford to be sending more to Washington.” <br> Finally, we have the American Action Network. It doesn’t disclose donors, but big oil and big pharma acknowledge contributing. Says a mom from her kitchen: “A simpler, fairer code with tax cuts for working families will give us some peace of mind, and closing loopholes means everyone pays their fair share.” <br> Fair? The proposal cuts corporate taxes by $1 trillion, gives $200 billion to the richest Americans in the form of estate-tax repeal and tilts the other $300 billion in cuts in favor of the wealthy. And that doesn’t take into account the hit the working class would take eventually from reduced benefits — health care, education and the like — to pay for the up to $1.5 trillion the legislation would add in debt over a decade. <br> An analysis by the Tax Policy Center of an earlier version of the bill found that it would reduce taxes by $660 for the typical family, but the richest 1 percent would get an extra $129,000 a year, and the richest one-tenth of 1 percent would get an extra $723,000 — or about $1,100 for every dollar Johnny Lunchbucket gets. The share of taxes paid by the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans would shrink. The share will rise for those in the middle. <br> If this works, we can surely expect these billionaires to try the same plutocrat-as-populist ruse on other matters. Let’s consider how the Adelson and Ricketts “What’s in it for you?” script could be adapted to try to trick working-class Americans into supporting other sops to the rich: <br> What’s in it for you? The Republican health-care bill saves you from the inconvenience and wasted time of visiting doctors. You hate medical visits — all that poking and prodding, and hard-to-swallow pills. Health-care reform simplifies your life, because you know how to cure your illness. Not well-connected doctors. That’s what’s in it for you. <br> What’s in it for you? The Republican Social Security bill saves middle-class families from the shame of retirement. You don’t want to retire. You’ll be bored. Retirement relief, by removing your retirement benefits, will help you work longer. That’s what’s in it for you. <br> What’s in it for you? The Republican education bill saves middle-class families from more than 12 years of education. Education relief will put more workers into the workforce sooner. Less hifalutin stuff like “knowledge” and “skills.” More workers. That’s what’s in it for you. <br> What’s in it for you? The Republican deregulation plan saves middle-class families from the humiliation of wearing hard hats and eye protection. Airplanes would arrive faster without air-traffic control, according to an independent analysis. If your co-worker dies in a crane accident, there’s more work for you, and smaller crowds in the lunchroom.

 The Trump administration’s tax plan is not a plan. It is a melange of ideas put forth without precision or arithmetic. It is not clear enough to permit the kind of careful quantitative analysis of its expected budget costs, economic effects and distributional implications that precedes such legislation in a serious country. <br> It is clear enough, however, to demonstrate that the claims of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett are some combination of ignorant, disingenuous and dishonest. Hassett, whose job is to stand up for rigorous apolitical economic analysis, had the temerity last week to accuse the Tax Policy Center — staffed by many of the most distinguished tax analysts in the country — of issuing “scientifically indefensible” “fictions.” He and his colleagues should look in the mirror. <br> I have strong disagreements on tax policy with Republican economists such as Greg Mankiw, Glenn Hubbard and Martin Feldstein and with Treasury alumni such as Nick Brady, John Snow and Hank Paulson. Nothing I have ever heard or read from them seems absurd or dishonest in the way that almost everything coming out of this administration does. <br> We know enough to say that a tax-reform plan along the lines of the administration’s sketch would not substantially increase economic growth, would blow out the budget deficit and would make the United States an even more unequal place. <br> The administration pushes the idea that somehow cutting the corporate tax rate will be a huge spur to investment. It is certainly possible that with a lower tax rate accountants will locate more corporate income in the United States, but a big spur to investment seems unlikely. With after-tax long-term interest rates well below 2 percent, the stock market sky-high and businesses able to write off investments immediately, capital costs have never been lower. True, there is much cash parked overseas. But almost all the companies that have done so also have cash hoards in the United States that they have chosen not to invest. The first-order effect of a Trump administration “territorial system” that renounced a U.S. tax claim to overseas corporate income would be to encourage relocation of productive activity to tax-haven jurisdictions, slowing U.S. growth. <br> It should not be forgotten that the most rapid gross-domestic-product growth achieved in the United States took place in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, when top tax rates were nearly twice as high as now. These rates were surely too high, and punitive rates would be a huge mistake in the current context, but it is absurd to suggest that reductions from current levels will call forth some renaissance of hard work. Just as likely, people who feel richer will reduce their effort. <br> What about the budget deficit? For tax cuts to pay for themselves, as Mnuchin sometimes asserts would happen, they would have to massively increase growth. Because this is unlikely, they would bloat the budget deficit at a time when we should be preparing for the next downturn, for rising entitlement costs and potentially for the need for increased national security spending. <br> But it’s worse than this. Many in the administration’s orbit have expressed the belief that the Federal Reserve’s quantitative-easing program has inflated asset prices by absorbing long-term bonds. If this logic is correct, increasing the supply of bonds to fund the large increase in deficits that tax cuts would entail should have a significant depressing effect on asset prices and the economy. Any possible supply-side benefits of the tax program have to be weighed against this damping impact. <br> Finally, there is the question of fairness. Those secure in their beliefs do not seek to depublish studies by apolitical civil servants. There is little doubt among serious economists that — as explained in a 2012 paper that has mysteriously vanished from the Treasury website — the immediate impact of corporate tax cuts is to help corporations and that the vast majority of corporate shareholding is concentrated among those at the top of the income and wealth distribution. There is the further point that in defending fairness the administration ignores its proposed estate-tax repeal, which affects only the top two-tenths of a percent of the population. <br> Furthermore, Cohn’s argument that corporate tax cuts would benefit firefighter pensions is, as he must know, disingenuous; such pension benefits are promised and not dependent on the performance of the stock market. And Mnuchin and Hassett’s arguments about investment depend on the false premise that domestic investment will be spurred by corporate tax cuts. Anyone in doubt about such fairness questions should just note that the administration is not willing to do what all previous Treasuries have been willing to do: present a revenue and distributional analysis of its plan. <br> This week, the world’s finance ministers and central bank governors will gather in Washington for the annual International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings. These meetings used to be a time when the United States urged other countries to respect the laws of economics and arithmetic in formulating their economic policies. This time the lecturing should go in the opposite direction. <br> Read more: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s tax ‘miracle’: Cowardice and dishonesty <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: Trump’s tax-reform pitch is entirely divorced from reality <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 The Republican leadership has outsourced its economic agenda to a handful of billionaires and corporate donors. From attempting to kick millions off of health insurance to rolling back rules protecting worker health and safety, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have relentlessly pursued their donors’ interests at the expense of working families. The Republican tax plan unveiled Thursday is the latest example. <br>  American families are already on the ropes. Booming corporate profits have not translated to higher wages for workers. The result is a middle-class squeeze: Most workers barely make more than what they did 30 years ago, while the costs of necessities such as housing, transportation, health care and education have risen sharply. If Congress tackled the middle-class squeeze head-on, it could provide more financial security for America’s families and produce faster economic growth.   <br> But the Republican Party’s rich donors want tax giveaways, and the party is happy to oblige. According to estimates based on the original outline of the Republican tax plan, it showers $2.5 trillion on big corporations. Fewer than 10 years after sparking a devastating financial crisis and receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts, big banks would reap billions from the Republican plan. Wells Fargo is projected to receive a bigger tax handout than any other U.S. company.   <br> Wealthy foreign investors also win big. By slashing the corporate tax rate, the Republican plan could put as much as $700 billion in the pockets of the foreign investors who now hold nearly 35 percent of the stock in U.S. companies. Is that what President Trump means by America first? <br> Multinational corporations are big winners, too, with a giveaway that establishes a lower tax on money earned abroad than money earned here at home. That makes it even harder for small U.S. businesses without overseas operations to compete with the giants. It also creates a powerful incentive for U.S. multinationals to shift investments — and jobs — abroad. Fewer investments in America will mean even lower wages for American workers.   <br> But the GOP plan isn’t all giveaways. The Republicans have thrown a lot of working families under the bus. The Republican plan imposes a double tax on millions of families who pay state and local income and sales taxes. The plan also makes home ownership more expensive by nullifying the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction for many families. <br> It’s hard to sell a plan that imposes new taxes on millions of working families while shoveling money to big banks, multinational corporations and wealthy foreign investors. That’s why Republicans are pushing two big lies about their plan instead. <br> The first big lie is that the plan will “supercharge” economic growth, creating a rising tide that would lift all boats. Despite Republicans’ wild claims, independent analysts agree: The corporate tax cut at the center of the Republican plan will have a negligible or even a negative impact on economic growth.    <br> The second big lie is that corporations will pass along their tax giveaways to workers in the form of higher wages. When multinational companies got a huge tax break under President George W. Bush, corporate profits shot up and shareholders grabbed nearly all the gains. When the United Kingdom cut its corporate tax rate by 11 percent, wages went down. Republicans know the facts aren’t with them, which is why Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tried to bury Treasury’s own report showing that wealthy shareholders would be the overwhelming beneficiaries of a massive corporate tax giveaway. <br> In fact, corporate executives are already telling their investors that tax giveaways from the Republican plan will be passed not to workers but to shareholders, through bigger dividends and more stock buybacks. Stock ownership is highly concentrated among the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans — and half of all Americans don’t own a single share of stock — so the Republican plan will be a bonanza for America’s richest. <br> Meanwhile, the Republican plan will make the middle-class squeeze worse. As the government collects trillions less in corporate taxes in coming years, the national debt will explode. After voting over their careers to add more than $3 trillion to the debt through tax giveaways to the rich and the Wall Street bailout, Ryan and McConnell will suddenly rediscover their concern over the debt. They have already shown their hand, promising to pursue deficit reduction next year with trillions in cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, housing and infrastructure programs on tap. If Republicans push through those cuts to address the very debt they created, that means higher health-care, transportation and housing costs for many working families. <br> The GOP tax plan lays bare the corporate priorities of the Republican Party. The trillions that Republicans hand over to corporations could go to rebuilding our roads and bridges and energy grid, creating millions of high-paying jobs and a stronger economy. Or that money could raise millions of American children out of poverty. But jobs and children aren’t priorities for today’s Republican Party. Instead, it grovels before wealthy corporate donors who want tax giveaways — and want them now.  <br> We can build an economy that grows faster and provides every American family with basic economic security. That work starts by shutting down the McConnell-Ryan $2.5 trillion corporate giveaway. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Catherine Rampell: This tax reform thing won’t be as easy as Republicans think <br> The Post’s View: These Republicans used to pretend to care about debt.

 The Post recently interviewed a Utah couple who had mixed feelings about the tax bill, partly because the 10 percent of their income they give to the Mormon Church may no longer be deductible [“Angst over tax bill where big families are the norm,” front page, Dec. 17]. <br> They intend to keep tithing. But the article also pointed out that nationwide donations to churches and other charities are likely to decline about 4.5 percent because many people will no longer itemize due to the larger standard deduction.   <br> As with most media coverage of the tax bill, the article focused on questions of who gains and who loses. But there is a more urgent question: What can people do about it? <br> In the case of charitable contributions, people with savings can keep the tax deduction by making contributions this year that they would otherwise make in the next few years.  There are also special mutual funds called “donor-advised funds” to which one can contribute and take the deduction this year and distribute the money over the next few years. <br> James G.

 Andy Slavitt is former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration and senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center. <br> President Trump claimed he repealed the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday. But in striking down an important provision of the ACA in the Republican tax bill passed this week, Trump may have unwittingly helped solidify the law instead. <br> There was a significant benefit for Republicans in repealing the individual health-insurance mandate in the tax bill. The resulting savings on subsidies to millions of lower-income Americans allowed the Republicans to pay for more than 20 percent of their bill. Without this, it would have been much more difficult to pass massive tax cuts for corporations and choice items such as the estate tax threshold change. Republicans also have a rhetorical victory, bringing back a trophy to fulfill their anti-ACA promises. <br> But that benefit didn’t come without some significant costs. Trump and the Republicans have now taken ownership for driving up insurance premiums for millions of middle-class families who buy insurance on the ACA’s individual markets. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that premiums will rise 10 percent out of the gate in 2019. <br> Most people understand the logic of the individual mandate, even if they never loved it. If people think about their health-care needs before they get sick instead of waiting until they fall ill, it leads to a better, fairer system. Still, the mandate, requiring those Americans who can afford it to buy insurance or else pay a small fine, was never popular. President Barack Obama included it only grudgingly in the ACA after coming out against it. Like most people who study the issue, he was persuaded that having a mechanism to compel more participation would bring everyone’s costs down. Ironically, it may have also been a nod to conservatives who originated the idea. <br> When premiums rise on middle-class families, taking the blame is part of the deal Republicans have now made. And premiums will rise, particularly in rural areas or states with higher uninsured rates that didn’t expand Medicaid. In other words, a lot of Republican voters will be asked to pay the price. <br> Not only will Trump and the Republicans be blamed for raising premiums, but also they may have just solidified the rest of the ACA. First of all, most of the people helped by the ACA will see no change to their premiums. Those who earn under 400 percent of the poverty level (approximately $100,000 for a family, $50,000 for an individual) will be largely protected from the impact of these rate increases because of fixed subsidies. So when insurance premiums on these low- and moderate-income families go up, it will actually be the government, not the families, that will pay the bill. Because prices will stay stable for millions of Americans, it will ensure steady and constant demand for the ACA offerings. <br> In a larger sense, the Republicans’ rhetorical victory of cutting out the individual mandate will make the ACA — which is increasingly popular — even more popular. The individual mandate was the only aspect of the law that didn’t enjoy wide support among the public. The other components of the law — protecting preexisting conditions, ending lifetime caps, ensuring that certain benefits such as chemotherapy and mental health are covered by law — enjoy widespread popularity. <br> A more popular law will be a more challenging target to repeal. And already Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), with an even narrower majority after the Alabama Senate race, is signaling that repeal may be a bridge too far. <br> So where does this leave us? It leaves us with two laws. <br> Call the first one Obamacare. It provides preexisting condition protections and other safeguards to American families. And for the millions covered under the Medicaid expansion or who have family incomes less than $100,000, it delivers affordable health-care coverage. <br> Call the second one Trumpcare. It exposes many — especially in rural areas and those who make too much for subsidies — to significantly increasing premiums, driven by the calculated decision from Republicans to get rid of the mandate. <br> This is damage to middle-class families that the Republicans should aim to quickly undo. Early next year, they should seek to pass some simple solutions that will bring down premiums and increase competition. They should pass a permanent reinsurance package — an extension of a current bipartisan Senate proposal. They should also consider an option introduced by Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine (Va.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) to allow Americans in areas where there isn’t enough competition to buy into something like Medicare. This will help attract Democrats and, more importantly, drive competition and lower premiums. <br> This year’s recently ended ACA enrollment period attracted unexpectedly high figures despite countless efforts to diminish it. The elimination of the individual mandate won’t alter the reality of coverage for millions. For people who are affected, the ball is in Republicans’ court, and the need for action is urgent. <br> Read more: <br> Nicholas Bagley: The GOP is trading 13 million people’s health care for corporate tax cuts <br> The Post’s View: Republicans turn their irresponsible tax bill into monumentally unwise social policy <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump’s Obamacare order could destroy the health-care system <br> The Post’s View: Voters just sent a message — Republicans are way out of step on health care <br> Andy Slavitt: The Trump administration just imposed a massive tax increase.

 Vice President Pence’s obsequiousness at a recent Cabinet meeting — “Thank you for seeing, through the course of this year, an agenda that is truly restoring this country. . .” and on, and on — might be appropriate at a Communist Party Central Committee meeting or at a despot’s birthday party. But it is not the language of any self-respecting republic. <br> The divestment of self-respect is a qualification for employment in the Trump administration. Praising the Dear Leader in a Pence-like fashion seems to be what the Dear Leader requires — not in the way we might need dessert after dinner, but in the way an addict needs drugs. President Trump divides the world into two categories: flunkies and enemies. Pence is the cringing, fawning high priest of flunkiness. It is hard to know whether to laugh or puke (and difficult to do both at the same time). <br> It is precisely the claim of miracles by mediocrities that makes it hard for some of us to judge Trump’s first-year record with any objectivity. Compared with his claims of world-historic change, Trump has accomplished little. But how does his record compare with more realistic expectations? <br> The Republican case for Trump comes down to: the appointment of conservative judges, including Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court; the “defeat” of the Islamic State; and tax and regulatory reform. Whatever your views of the merits of these actions, they are consequential. Add to this the facts that Trump hasn’t blown up the world or suspended the legislature, and Trump is gaining a strange new respect among some conservatives. <br> There is less here than meets the eye. Trump chose Gorsuch from a Federalist Society list and didn’t fatally undermine Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) careful confirmation effort. The demolition of the Islamic State was largely the continuation and culmination of an Obama-era strategy. And the tax overhaul, with serious virtues such as the cut in corporate rates, also has serious distributional and deficit problems. <br> This agenda was remarkable only for being so typical. Any Republican president from the 2016 primary field would have appointed conservative judges, continued the offensive against the Islamic State, and cut taxes and regulations. (He or she would also, in all likelihood, have succeeded at an Obamacare replacement.) But this is precisely the point. Trump spent the political capital of his first year — the highest it will ever be — on a few, generic GOP goals. Despite the fulminations of the left, this is not as frightening as some of the alternatives. <br> It is important to count our blessings, even when they are meager. But for Republicans and conservatives, it is also important to count the costs — the tonnage on the other side of the balance. <br> The war against terrorism has been rebooted on the basis of anti-Muslim bigotry, which undermines domestic law enforcement and anti-radicalization efforts. Authoritarian regimes around the world — now shielded from human rights criticism — feel more secure. Dissidents and democratic activists feel more lonely and abandoned. Fleeing refugees feel more desperate and friendless. The president is conducting delicate nuclear negotiations with demeaning pet names. Morale at the State Department is in collapse, leading to the hemorrhaging of diplomatic talent and experience. Trump has alienated important allies with demands for protection money. The United States has stepped back from effective economic competition in Asia, leaving China a more dominant regional power. Russia, in all likelihood, has helped elect a favorable U.S. president in the largest intelligence coup of modern history. <br> Trump has tried to undermine the credibility of important institutions — the courts, the FBI, intelligence agencies, the media — that check his power and expose his duplicity. He has used his office (and Twitter account) to target individual Americans for harm without due process. He attacks the very idea of truth in a daily torrent of despicable lies. The moral authority of the presidency is in tatters. He has made our common life more vulgar and brutal, and complicated the moral education of children. Racists are emboldened and included in the GOP coalition. He has caused a large portion of Republicans to live in an alternate reality of resentment and hatred, which complicates the possibility of governing and is likely to discredit the party among the young, minorities, women and college-educated voters for decades to come. <br> Trump’s domestic agenda . . . requires another column. But after a year, this much is clear: Almost all of Trump’s accomplishments are the work of traditional Republican policy staffers and congressional leaders. Almost all of Trump’s failures are functions of his character. And that isn’t going to change. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more on this topic: <br> E.J.

 On Wednesday, the 335th day of his presidency, Donald J. Trump did something most extraordinary and uncharacteristic. He told the truth. <br> The president, celebrating his $1.5 trillion tax cut with fellow Republicans at the South Portico of the White House, was midway through his remarks when he veered sharply off message. <br> “I shouldn’t say this,” Trump said, “but we essentially repealed Obamacare.” <br> No, he probably shouldn’t have said it. But it’s true. Republicans, in rushing the tax bill to passage, kept fairly quiet about the fact that they were killing the “individual mandate” and thereby removing the engine that made the Affordable Care Act work. In doing so, they threw the health-care system into chaos without offering any remedy. And Trump just claimed paternity of the destruction. <br> Trump, in a Cabinet meeting earlier Wednesday, let his fleeting encounter with honesty get the better of him when he read aloud the stage directions that called for Republicans not to advertise that they were killing Obamacare. “Obamacare has been repealed in this bill. We didn’t want to bring it up,” he said. “I told people specifically, ‘Be quiet with the fake-news media because I don’t want them talking too much about it.’ Because I didn’t know how people would —.” Trump didn’t finish that thought, but he said he could admit what had been done “now that it’s approved.” <br> [A win for the wealthy, the entitled and the irresponsible] <br> With those admissions now on tape, Trump has officially claimed full ownership of the health-care system for himself and fellow Republicans. Whatever it is now — or isn’t — is Trumpcare. Here are some of its features: <br> ●Premiums for the most popular health insurance on the individual market exchanges are estimated to rise 34 percent on average next year, according to the consulting firm Avalere Health, because of previous sabotage done by the Trump administration. Premiums in Iowa would be up 69 percent, Wyoming 65 percent and Utah 64 percent. <br> ●Employer-based health insurance costs are forecast to rise in 2018 by the most since 2011, at 4.3 percent, according to the human resources consulting firm Mercer, and overall medical costs will be up 6.5 percent, the first increase in the rate in three years, according to the consulting firm PwC. Assuming those increases are passed along to workers, they would eat up half of the $910 tax cut received next year by households with income between $55,000 and $93,000 and all of the tax cut received by households earning $27,000 to $54,000. <br> The more Trump claims to have done away with Obamacare, “the more he owns problems in the health system of his making or not,” says Drew Altman, head of the Kaiser Family Foundation and an authority on health care and public opinion. Altman tells me Trump will “certainly own” responsibility for premium increases on the former Obamacare exchanges and for the up to 13 million who will no longer have coverage under the new tax plan. <br> The new system also belongs to Republicans such as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who, in exchange for her vote for the tax bill, was hornswoggled into believing Congress will take action before year end on subsidies to stabilize the former Obamacare exchanges. That has now been put off until next year, and it will meet stiff resistance from Collins’s fellow Republicans. <br> [What Trump’s economic handiwork will bring in 2018] <br> This will be but one source of division among Republicans now that they have secured the tax cut, which was a rare source of unity within the party — and the main reason many GOP lawmakers who find Trump distasteful have stuck with him until now. <br> Trump and congressional leaders, walking along the White House driveway Wednesday afternoon to “Hail to the Chief,” applauded GOP lawmakers around the South Portico, and the lawmakers applauded back. But soon they will be fighting about immigration, funding the government, cutting Medicare and attacking special counsel Robert Mueller. The divisions will only worsen if Trump continues to have bouts of unaccustomed honesty, as he did Wednesday. <br> In addition to his confession about Obamacare, he also acknowledged that “the tax cuts supersede” reform in the tax bill and that “the biggest factor in this plan” is the cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Republican lawmakers had taken pains to describe their work as tax “reform” and asserted that it was primarily for the middle class, but Trump was correct: The legislation does little to simplify the tax code, and it is primarily a windfall for corporations. <br> Trump did not trespass long in the land of truth. He also renewed his claim that the tax bill is “the largest tax cut in the history of our country.” It isn’t that, by a long shot. But it is many other things, including a huge shock to the health-care system, with no remedy in sight. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> E.J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> REPUBLICANS IN Congress passed a huge tax bill Wednesday, in what is being hailed as a major win for President Trump and his party. In time, however, it very likely will be remembered as an ignominious moment for Republicans. <br> To be sure, there will be some unmitigated winners. The bill is a victory for wealthy heirs, who will no longer have to pay estate taxes on inheritance worth up to $22 million. It helps tax dodgers and their lawyers, who will have some potentially huge new loopholes to exploit. Because the drafting process was so hasty and sloppy, no doubt there are many hidden in the text that even its authors do not realize are there. <br> The bill is a victory for corporations that look like the Trump Organization, the president’s privately held real estate business. “Pass-through” businesses like many of those within the Trump Organization get a new tax break. Other provisions single out real estate for special consideration in the tax code. The public can only guess at how much the president will personally benefit from the tax bill he is about to sign, because he has defied decades of bipartisan tradition by refusing to release his tax returns. In that sense, the bill is also a win for nontransparent government. <br> The bill is a victory for the discredited theory of trickle-down economics. It embodies the notion that big tax cuts for the wealthy will benefit low- and middle-class workers rather than simply enrich the already well-off. <br> The bill is a win for know-nothing anti-intellectualism. At every stage, Republicans have ignored or attacked independent experts warning them that their bill was unwise. They have undermined scorekeepers such as the Congressional Budget Office and the professional staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation because they did not like what these nonpartisan institutions said about their plans. <br> The bill is a victory for corrosive partisanship. Republicans could have hashed out a better, bipartisan plan, but they never seriously tried. Instead, they added to the bill a stealth repeal of a key piece of Obamacare and a provision allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. <br> Most of all, the bill is a victory for fiscal irresponsibility. Some of its provisions, such as lowering the corporate tax rate, would have been worthwhile if they had been paid for by closing loopholes or raising other federal revenue. Instead, the bill will make the nation’s debt trajectory even worse, by a trillion-plus dollars, even after accounting for new economic growth. The bill’s mild potential effects on competitiveness and growth are not worth such a steep price tag. <br> Cleaning up this mess will take years but must start now. The bill’s Obamacare rollback requires immediate passage of legislation to limit the damage to already shaky health-care insurance markets, preferably a significantly pumped-up version of a plan Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) have already negotiated. A technical-corrections bill may be needed to close unintentional loopholes, and government programs will have to be protected from automatic cuts triggered by the GOP tax policy’s fiscal irresponsibility. Longer-term, the picture is bleaker. Taxes will have to rise and spending on entitlement programs drop to fix sharply unbalanced budgets to come. This is the “victory” Republicans just handed the country. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The emergencies the GOP is ignoring <br> E.J.

 The New York Federal Reserve estimates the U.S. economy will grow at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the fourth quarter. That would be after breaking 3 percent growth in the second and third quarters this year. The Trump economy is booming. And the New York Fed predicts the boom will continue, with growth above 3 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The last time we had four consecutive quarters of growth above 3 percent was 13 years ago, in 2004-2005. <br> Can that kind of growth be sustained? Many economists are skeptical and point to President Trump’s trade and immigration policies, which they say undermine his efforts. The passage of pro-growth tax reform this week, on the other hand, could help Trump keep his pledge. <br> But one thing Trump has done that has received little attention despite arguably driving today’s economic boom is his decision to declare war on the regulatory state. <br> Government regulations are like millions of Lilliputian threats that tie down our economy and prevent businesses from expanding and creating jobs. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague Jim Pethokoukis points out, one recent study found that “the past 50 years of federal regulations have reduced real GDP by roughly two percentage points a year, or nearly $40 trillion. Instead of the US economy growing by just over 3% a year since World War Two, it would have grown by over 5% a year.” Put another way: Without all that regulation, our economy would be about four times larger than it is today. <br> We obviously can’t eliminate all regulations — we all want clean air and clean water. But the unbridled growth of the regulatory state has imposed extraordinary burdens on job creators and robbed American workers of wages and opportunity. <br> Trump inherited a regulatory state that had grown to unprecedented levels under President Barack Obama. One way to measure the growth in regulations is by counting the number of pages in the Federal Register, the book the government publishes containing all new regulations. Seven of the eight largest annual page totals in American history occurred under Obama. Before Obama, no president had ever exceeded 80,000 pages in the Federal Register. In 2016, Obama became the first president to break the 90,000-page mark — 96,702, to be exact — and if you add his last 20 days in office, the total reaches 103,432. <br> Trump cut that number nearly in half. From Jan. 23 through Dec. 19 of this year, he has added just 53,550 pages to the Federal Register. And many of those pages were not new regulations but announcements of regulations being withdrawn. His efforts exceeded even those of President Ronald Reagan, who cut Federal Register pages by more than one-third during his time in office. <br> Obama also set a land speed record for “economically significant” regulations — regulations costing the economy $100 million or more. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Obama imposed 494 major regulations during his time in office — a 38 percent increase over his predecessor. And in his final eight months in office alone, according to Neomi Rao, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Obama “saddled the economy with as much as $15.2 billion in regulatory costs.” <br> When Trump came into office, he immediately began reversing this trend. He worked with Congress to repeal 14 major regulations implemented under Obama, and withdrew or delayed more than 1,500 others by executive action. Most importantly, he issued Executive Order 13771, which directed government agencies to eliminate two existing regulations for each new one issued, and to ensure that the net costs of any new regulations are zero. <br> Last Thursday, Trump announced the first results of this effort: His administration achieved $8.1 billion in lifetime regulatory savings — and is on track to achieve an additional $9.8 billion in savings in fiscal 2018. Since excessive regulations are a hidden tax on American workers and businesses, that amounts to an $18 billion tax cut. <br> These actions have helped unleash the growth we are experiencing today. It is no mere coincidence that under Obama, the most regulation-happy president in modern times, GDP growth averaged less than 2 percent. Trump has done more in 11 months to lift those burdens than any president in modern history. He is regulating bureaucrats instead of businesses. Those efforts don’t get a lot of attention, and they will not be enough to bring us to sustained 3 percent growth on their own. But without Trump’s crusade to tame the regulatory state, the chances of doing so are zero. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Robert J.

 Add this to the growing file folder that can be labeled “Depressing but not Surprising”: The only thing today’s Republican Party knows how to do is cut taxes for the very rich. <br> It’s depressing because the GOP has abandoned roles it once played in our public life: pioneering programs aimed at assisting Americans of modest means in lifting themselves up, and supporting productive government investments that the private sector was unlikely to undertake. <br> The party of Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell has abandoned the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, who championed the Homestead Act and land-grant colleges; Teddy Roosevelt, who protected vast tracts of nature on behalf of future generations; and Dwight Eisenhower, who pushed for student loans and the Interstate Highway System. <br> The heirs to Honest Abe, TR and Ike seem to believe in only one thing: throwing vast quantities of money at the already wealthy. And they have the nerve to pretend that they aren’t really trying to further enrich the moneyed classes. They claim that comforting the comfortable will someday, really and truly, help working people by creating jobs and economic growth. <br> They pretend a lot of other things, too. They say their goal is to “simplify” the tax system, so they reduce the number of individual income-tax brackets to three. Isn’t it funny that in their “simplification,” the tax rate for the richest among us (people earning more than $418,400 a year) would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, but the tax rate for the poorest (those earning less than $9,325 a year) actually would go up , from 10 percent to 12 percent? <br> The GOP apparently believes that taxing the poor is part of the recipe for growth. Now there is an innovative idea. <br> The Republicans claim that this tax increase would be offset by other provisions. But there is no way to know exactly how their tax scheme would work because they have still not put out a full plan. All they have offered is a sketch. <br> For eight months, Republicans told us repeatedly that they would enact a tax bill. Yet they still can’t show us the whole thing. <br> In fact, for a large swath of the middle and upper-middle classes, this is not a tax cut at all, but a tax increase. Using the details available, the Tax Policy Center concluded that nearly a third of taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and $150,000 would see their taxes go up, as would a majority of those making between $150,000 and $300,000. <br> There is much that is very bad here, but perhaps the most insidious aspect of the bill is the part that might be called the Punish Our Opponents Tax Act of 2017. <br> To pay for their tax cuts for the rich, Republicans propose to make the tax code “fairer” by getting rid of the deduction that people can take for the taxes they pay to state and local governments. Republicans rail against “double taxation” of income when it comes to capital gains. But they have no problem with double taxation when it hurts taxpayers in states that ask their citizens to pay a bit more to provide decent public services and stronger social safety nets. <br> As the Wall Street Journal reported, the states with the largest deductions for state and local taxes as a percentage of adjusted gross income are New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and Maryland. All voted against Trump. <br> Republican House members from the higher-tax states may yet scuttle this provision that belies the GOP’s devotion to “states’ rights.” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) called their bluff: “Republicans used to say that the best decisions are made locally, and now they want to tax local decisions.” <br> Naturally, a tax proposal designed to pamper the super-rich does exactly that for a man named Donald Trump. The New York Times estimated his savings at about $1 billion. But his refusal to release his tax returns conveniently clouds how much he’ll get. <br> Heather Long of The Post’s Wonkblog usefully listed “nine ways Trump’s tax plan is a gift to the rich, including himself.” One of the biggest boons to the wealthiest Americans is the complete repeal of the estate tax, which is paid on only the very, very, very largest fortunes. They account for only two-tenths of 1 percent of all estates. Talk about a carefully tailored benefit for the Savile Row suit crowd. <br> And imagine this: Republicans want to use this deficit-bloating, inequality-enhancing, inflation-courting, social-justice-insulting monstrosity to prove they can actually govern. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IT IS HARD to say what is most damning about the process Republicans used to produce their $1.5 trillion overhaul of the tax code. Is it the suggestion by critics that a key senator dropped his opposition because of a last-minute change that would benefit him personally? Or is it his defense that the provision didn’t influence his support for the legislation because he never actually read the entire bill before changing his position? <br> The kerfuffle that followed the announcement by Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) that he would vote for the tax bill when it comes up for a vote this week underscores the unseemly way legislation of such consequence has been cobbled together behind closed doors and with Democrats completely shut out. And the fact that real estate businesses would get a hefty tax break from the provision in question is further evidence of just how much the GOP bill tilts toward the wealthy. <br> [Two moderates disappoint those who bought their rhetoric] <br> Mr. Corker, as the New York Times reported, surprised many in Washington when he announced Friday that he was dropping his objections to the legislation, thus providing critical support in light of Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) planned absence. Mr. Corker had voted against the Senate bill because of his concerns over the budget deficit, which it would greatly worsen. So why did he change his mind when nothing was done to address those very real concerns? <br> Mr. Corker said it was because he felt that on the whole, the country would benefit from the tax overhaul and its expected job growth. But as details about the bill emerged over the weekend, critics suggested his vote was a trade-off for a provision that would make it easier for real estate developers — such as Mr. Corker as well as President Trump — to take advantage of a new, more generous tax structure for pass-through businesses. Mr. Corker denied knowing anything about the benefit and called upon Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) to lay out how it got into the bill. Mr. Hatch offered a convincing explanation that the provision was derived from a House version and was the product of negotiation between House and Senate tax-writing committees that didn’t involve Mr. Corker. <br> [The emergencies the GOP is ignoring] <br> That, though, doesn’t let Mr. Corker, or GOP leadership, off the hook. Mr. Corker — whose vote potentially is key to passage of what will be a transformational remaking of the tax code — changed his position after reading only a short summary and acknowledging that his concerns about the deficit were not alleviated. It is hard not to conclude that it was easier for Mr. Corker to stand on principle when his vote really didn’t matter. As for Republican leaders, it’s hard to be sympathetic to their claims that Democratic partisanship is behind the questions about Mr. Corker’s vote switch. They are the ones who turned their backs on regular order, making a charade of lawmaking and thus inviting suspicion. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jennifer Rubin: The most infuriating falsehoods about the tax bill and those who told them <br> The Post’s View: The Rubio tax bill saga is a perfect expression of Republican priorities <br> Fareed Zakaria: The GOP tax bill may be the worst piece of legislation in modern history <br> E.J.

 In his Oct. 23 op-ed, “A budget primer for the weary,” Robert J. Samuelson promised to help us sort out today’s debate. Unfortunately, he muddied the waters. <br> He implied that the United States has moved toward spending less on defense and more on welfare. Wrong. Absolute levels of defense spending have remained high for 50 years. In 1962, the United States spent $400.5 billion on defense (adjusted for inflation), and in 2015 — after sharp unplanned cuts because of sequestration — it was $528.2 billion. And this undercounts vastly more spending on homeland security. Yes, we spend less as a percentage of the gross national product. So what? Does it take more to defend the United States because we have more money? More important, Mr. Samuelson seemed not to understand how democracy works in today’s United States. He said “we” want more than we are willing to pay for. Does Mr. Samuelson imagine that the preferences of American voters are accurately reflected in Congress and its spending decisions? The effects of redistricting, voter suppression, overrepresentation of rural states in the Senate and, above all, the impact of money via lobbying and campaign contributions and influence networks heavily distort democratic preferences in the direction of wealthy interests. These interests want more than anything to keep taxes low on the rich and corporations. Most Americans want their government to do more — a powerful minority doesn’t want to pay for it. <br> That’s the real story. <br> Adam Wasserman, Vienna 
 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) promised Obamacare repeal, funding for the wall and tax reform, all by the end of August. For the GOP, it is now September, both literally and metaphorically. <br> In the spring of their hopes, Republican leaders placed a bet — which seemed reasonable at the time — that they could contain President Trump and pass legislation despite him. This required looking away from the uglier aspects of Trump’s appeal — his Twitter transgressions, his appallingly frenzied rallies, his rule by ridicule. All this was worth swallowing because Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would pass their conservative agenda. <br> The wager was large and lost. The attempt to revive a health-care alternative in the Senate seems halfhearted and doomed by the same ideological dynamics that killed the legislation the first time. Republican enthusiasm for the Mexican border wall is limited by the fact that it is among the most wasteful, impractical and useless ideas ever spouted by an American president. And ambitious tax reform has been tabled in favor of a few tax cuts that are likely to reaffirm public impressions that the “P” in GOP stands for “plutocracy.” <br> In the process, Republican leaders have been made to look hapless and pathetic, not least because Trump has taken to taunting them. A president incapable of legislative leadership mocks the ineffectiveness of Republican legislators, publicly humiliates them on the debt-limit deal, then revels in the (very temporary) friendship of “Chuck and Nancy” — Democratic leaders Schumer and Pelosi. <br> Those Republicans who believe that Trump is being cynical, disloyal or politically calculating continue to misunderstand the man. The president has no discernible political philosophy or strong policy views to betray. His leadership consists mainly of instincts, reflexes and prejudices, which often have nothing to do with self-interest. He has a genius for fame, which usually involves attention-attracting unpredictability and transgressiveness. Trump reads events moment by moment, making him a cork on the waves of cable coverage. Any choice he makes is correct by definition, because he has made it. And any person — on his staff or on Capitol Hill — who does not precisely mimic his political gyrations is disloyal and should be punished. <br> Most public officials have never worked with anyone like this before. Among other things, it means that any vocal conviction politician — any leader, such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who regularly heeds the whisper of duty and conscience — will be Trump’s enemy. With a little patience. <br> What have Republican leaders who bet the other way — on accommodation — lost in the process? <br> The wager has been a disaster in the realm of policy. During legislative debates on issues such as health care, Trump has been erratic, unfocused, impatient and frighteningly ignorant. His White House policy staff — some of whom are responsible and talented — try to work with Capitol Hill, but always under the threat that their efforts will be destroyed by a tweet. Congressional Republicans see the White House as a basket case, don’t think that any administration official speaks authoritatively for the president and increasingly fear entering the midterm elections entirely naked of accomplishment. <br> The wager has been a disaster in the realm of politics. The president takes it as an accomplishment to secure the support of about 35 percent of the public. This leaves Republicans in the worst of political worlds, where the intensity of Trump’s base is increased by words and policies that alienate the majority — making Trump a powerful force within the party and a scary, galvanizing figure beyond it. The damage is broad, profound and generational. A recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll recorded 26 percent approval for the president among those aged 18 to 34. <br> The wager has been a moral disaster. News accounts following Trump’s betrayal of Republican leaders on the debt limit reported them to be “livid.” What does it tell us about Republican politicians that they were livid about a three-month debt-limit extension but not so much about misogyny, nativism and flirtation with racism? Or maybe they were, but they still thought the wager might work. Such lack of wisdom and proportion is an indictment as well. <br> All Republican efforts — at least in the traditional wing of the party — must now be bent toward one, difficult end: establishing a GOP identity apart from Trump. And that will require Republican leaders to cease being complicit in their own humiliation and irrelevance. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jennifer Rubin: What Republicans should have learned (other than not to trust Trump) <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: Republicans’ empty words against Trump <br> John C.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IN A tax-bill saga full of clarifying moments, there was one particularly eloquent expression of Republican priorities. First, Republicans refused to fund Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s plan to expand tax benefits for low-income families because he proposed paying for it by dropping the corporate tax rate to merely 21 percent rather than 20 percent. Then, in final negotiations on the bill, they adopted the 21 percent rate Mr. Rubio had sought, after all — and used the savings not to help needy families or to lessen the bill’s impact on the national debt but to lower the top income tax rate for the highest wage earners. <br> After some last-minute theatrics, a smaller version of Mr. Rubio’s plan was added to the final package. But it is telling how easy it was for Republicans to drop top income tax rates, how hard it has been for Mr. Rubio to secure even a limited victory for low-income people and how irrelevant concerns about ballooning the national debt have been for most in the GOP. <br> What started as a bipartisan push for smart tax-code reform mutated over the past year into an expensive, one-sided legislative power play animated by ideological misconceptions rather than a sober assessment of the country’s real needs. This process is nearly complete, with the conclusion this week of negotiations among GOP lawmakers reconciling House and Senate versions into a final tax bill, set to be voted on early next week. <br> In a bill slanted toward the wealthy, Mr. Rubio’s idea to expand the child tax credit for low-income families would make the overall tax plan a bit more progressive, diverting a little more money toward those who could really use the help. By contrast, the GOP plan to lower the top income tax rate to 37 percent would sharply and unexpectedly increase incomes at the top. As with previous iterations of the GOP plan, the overall picture is still of a tax reform that offers little benefit to many ordinary people while handing huge benefits to the rich at the expense of the country’s long-term fiscal health. <br> A tax cut for corporations would be warranted under different circumstances — particularly if it were paid for. But many of the bill’s provisions are simply unjustifiable. Obamacare’s crucial individual mandate should not be repealed. Wealthy heirs do not require relief from the estate tax. High earners do not need a lower top tax rate. <br> Republicans claim that the bill’s provisions will spur economic growth and Americans will share broadly in the resulting prosperity. In fact, the growth effects will probably be mild, and the price tag will probably be a trillion-plus dollars in new debt, according to nonpartisan projections. This debt will further burden low- and middle-income Americans in future generations as their government loses the means to invest in research, education, health care and infrastructure. <br> Independent analysis after independent analysis concluded that the GOP tax framework would exacerbate economic inequality and add massively to the debt — well more than the Obama stimulus Republicans attacked as an irresponsible monstrosity — for relatively little in return. The Republican response has been to ignore the experts, attack the messengers and double down on bad policy. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jennifer Rubin: Profiles in cowardice on a rotten tax deal <br> Fareed Zakaria: The GOP tax bill may be the worst piece of legislation in modern history <br> David Ignatius: Voters will remember the Republicans who made this mess <br> The Post’s View: How to move the tax bill from worse to bad <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 I commend David Ignatius for his excellent Dec. 13 op-ed, “The GOP’s haste will make waste,” but it fell a little short of hanging a title on the GOP as ushering in an autocratic oligarchy that this action portends. President Trump and the Republican-led Congress are instituting the Russian economic system Mr. Trump admires while weakening any resolve to get our national debt under control. The president and his wealthy ilk are salivating all the way to their getaway dachas this Christmas. With Mr. Trump’s approval rating at a new low and Congress’s at half of that, this Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa should be anything but joyful, peaceful or optimistic for anyone but the top 1 percent. <br> Hank Hegener, Round Hill <br> 
 In his Dec. 5 op-ed, “What is Trump trying to cover up?,” Eugene Robinson stated, “We know that Trump has apparently obstructed justice to try to halt investigation into what happened.” This statement is incorrect because Robinson, as with virtually every other thoughtful political writer, used the wrong tense of the verb “obstruct.” <br> If President Trump’s actions obstructed justice in the beginning of his presidency, his continued public dialogue regarding the FBI investigation means that he is still obstructing justice. Even if we generously assume he did not obstruct justice early on, and that he was unaware of his campaign staff’s dealings with Russia, do we think that 11 months later, Trump remains unaware? This would mean that a man whose preternatural temperament demands that he know what every pundit says about him would also have the ability to allow his staff to keep their campaign actions secret from him. <br> Only by being completely ignorant of the events surrounding the Russians and Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, could Trump not intend to obstruct justice with his recent public interactions. It seems much more likely that Trump is continuing to obstruct justice. <br> Craig Merrill, Kitty Hawk, N.C. 
 The Post’s willingness to use the expression “fake news” troubles me [“Harnessing populism and fake news, the 1920s Klan became mainstream,” Book World, Dec. 3]. Although it’s true that Pamela Newkirk, reviewing Linda Gordon’s book “The Second Coming of the KKK,” used the term (accurately) to describe the Ku Klux Klan’s media fabrications, I wish The Post would avoid such usage. “Fake news,” whether or not coined by President Trump, has been weaponized by him to attack the press, a pillar of our democracy. The Post is a great advocate for press freedom, so it should not normalize or legitimize the expression “fake news” by using it, except when quoting. <br> Paul Reinstein, Rockville 
 The GOP tax plan’s top beneficiaries aren’t actually rich people, or even corporations, though both groups will indeed benefit mightily. The biggest winners are the nation’s tax planners, thanks to the tax-sheltering bonanza this bill is about to unleash. <br> As my own CPA father likes to say: Congress has once again taken pity upon the nation’s poor accountants and guaranteed them all lifetime employment. <br> Tax-filing is already unbelievably resource-intensive. Every year, the nation collectively spends billions of hours and hundreds of billions of dollars on tax planning, compliance and preparation. <br> At many companies, tax departments have effectively become profit centers, where armies of accountants and tax attorneys devise ways to legally shortchange Uncle Sam. <br> With all due respect to my dad and his fellow “regulatory parasites” (his term, not mine), these are surely resources that could be more productively deployed elsewhere. <br> For all these reasons, Republicans have said that simplification is one of their primary goals in overhauling the tax code. And it’s true that their proposal to nearly double the individual income tax’s standard deduction would streamline tax preparation for many households (at least for a few years, before this provision expires). <br> But on the corporate side — and for higher-income individuals who may soon decide to self-incorporate — it’s a different story. <br> “The amount of complexity they’re adding is staggering, just unbelievably staggering,” fumes the usually mild-mannered Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax attorney and senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. <br> There are lots of changes to the tax code that will cause a boom in aggressive tax planning. Some of these are deliberate, others clearly accidental. <br> Among the intentional changes, for example, are new rates and rules for pass-through businesses. These would create an entirely new, parallel system of taxation. <br> Say you work as a chef at a restaurant. Your tax rate will vary tremendously depending on whether you call yourself an employee, an independent contractor receiving pass-through income for your labor or a corporation contracting out your services to the restaurant. <br> There are also complicated, as-yet-unsettled new criteria for determining how much of your income qualifies for which rate, as well as what expenses can be deducted. All this creates a mind-boggling number of possible tax-planning permutations for the exact same job.  <br> Or consider the proposed changes to taxation of overseas profits, which would also lead to new opportunities for intricate tax scheming. <br> Here, too, Congress would effectively create two parallel regimes — one for income earned abroad and one for income earned at home. With these two regimes come incentives to invest in tax attorneys who can find ways to game the system — including whether and how to shift operations, jobs and paper transactions overseas. <br> Tax experts are already identifying this sloppily written bill’s glitches and drafting errors. Some of these have been laid out in a new 35-page paper, written by 13 tax professors and lawyers. <br> They note that one provision, for example, would encourage U.S. companies to sell goods abroad, only for them to be sold right back into the United States. The interaction of two other provisions would encourage companies to make investments that they know would lose money. <br> And so on. <br> “The tax code ought to be about defining a base as broadly as possible, keeping tax rates as low as possible, and removing taxes as a calculation for how you order your economic affairs,” Rosenthal says. <br> This plan, he says, does the opposite. <br> It will lead more businesses to make decisions based not on market demand, not on where the biggest economic opportunities lie and not on what kind of innovations, investments and expansions hold the most potential, but where the biggest loopholes are. So much for making the U.S. economy more competitive. <br> The haste with which this bill is being written and voted on — before the public or even lawmakers have time to fully understand what’s in it — will do more than just distort business decisions. It will also likely cause the plan to cost considerably more than estimated, as New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait has pointed out. <br> That’s because the staffers at the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s official scorekeepers on tax bills, haven’t been given sufficient time to identify and model all the ways in which the tax profession will take advantage of accidental loopholes — especially as IRS funding gets slashed. <br> Congress has a pretty simple choice, in fact. It can slow down, find and fix those loopholes now. Or it can let all the regulatory parasites find and exploit them later. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP tax plan is ridiculous.

 Christopher Buskirk is editor and publisher of the website American Greatness and co-author, with Seth Leibsohn, of “American Greatness: How Conservatism, Inc. Missed the 2016 Election What the D.C. Establishment Needs to Learn.” <br> American conservatives are engaged in a generational struggle for the future. In the political press, with its preference for trivialization over ideas, this fight is portrayed as a mere clash of personalities jockeying for power, with Breitbart News chairman and former White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon in one corner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in the other. <br> But this battle is bigger than the posturing between the two men and their aides. Its stakes are higher than who won the Alabama special election. On one side are McConnell Co.’s tired grab bag of 1980s-era slogans — free trade, supply-side economics and American exceptionalism — that, although good ideas, seem to have lost their sense of urgency. On the other is a vibrant new conservatism that takes on the challenge posed by an ambitious, bellicose China, the moral imperative of a pro-citizen immigration policy and the necessity of trade policies that strengthen the middle class rather than undermine its economic foundations. <br> Under the McConnell regime, too many Beltway Republicans continue to see the base of their own party as the problem, a resource to be used in even-numbered years to fill campaign coffers and pull levers — a necessary evil, not a participant citizenry. In this context, many Republican incumbents look conservative only in the sense of being cautious and resistant to change. <br> If 2010 was a wake-up call for the Washington establishment, 2016 was the start of a revolution, when 63 million voters rallied to then-candidate Donald Trump’s calls to “drain the swamp.” And if Trump’s White House position requires him to cooperate at times with McConnell and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Bannon’s new perch outside the official White House structure allows him to use the energy of this new movement to overturn the existing Republican power structure and build something new and, ideally, more responsive to voters. <br> Despite a year’s worth of overwrought anti-Trump rhetoric from certain quarters on the right decrying the imminent rule of the one — the tyrant — many rank-and-file Republicans see oligarchy — the rule of the privileged few — as the real threat. In this view, too many elected Republicans are willing to see elites consolidate power at the expense of the people, as long as they can retain their offices and perquisites. <br> The Bannon wing of the party offers an essentially class-based critique of the nation’s economic and political woes that argues that the people have lost control, and that they have been superseded by an economic, cultural and political elite. <br> The fulcrum in this war of ideas is President Trump. From the moment he came down the escalator, Trump has instinctively sided with the base, channeling its anxieties and aspirations and becoming its tribune. Doing so won him the election but engendered some lingering antipathy from party bosses. Now as president, he is head of the party and must work with Republican leaders in Congress who are often hostile to the ideas, and maybe the people, behind Trump’s victory. <br> To persuade or cajole the Republican Congress he inherited to enact his agenda, Trump must make both the intellectual and the political cases for a new conservatism. He was able to win more voters than any Republican candidate in history, and now he must be part of the effort to convince elites if he wants to remake the Republican Party the way President Ronald Reagan did in the 1980s. <br> The cognitive dissonance within the Republican Party that Trump and his allies must resolve is evident in the tax bill. It’s a hash of rate reductions and elimination of deductions that does not advance any clearly articulated principle other than the belated recognition by congressional Republicans that they must accomplish something or risk voters’ wrath. <br> It would have been better for Republicans to make sure that the working and middle classes directly experienced the benefits of tax reform. In addition to rate reductions for high-income earners, Republicans could include tax credits for hiring U.S. citizens and for tuition, and exemption of some income from the payroll tax. Each would provide more tangible benefit than a small rate reduction. <br> Still, elimination of the Obamacare individual mandate fulfills a promise and hands the president an important political victory. It’s about time, because the base, which overwhelmingly backed Trump, is impatient with the infuriating combination of insouciance and threadbare slogans offered by Republican elites. <br> Republicans can build a lasting majority if they act decisively to enlarge and strengthen the beleaguered middle class. That means a pro-citizen immigration policy, a pro-worker trade policy and a foreign policy that is more circumspect of foreign military commitments. And that requires a reformation of the party. Will the GOP be republican or merely Republican? At root, that’s what the fight is all about. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Fareed Zakaria: Maybe Trump knows his base better than we do <br> Colbert I.

 When historians examine President Trump’s tax program, they will surely be struck by a large and momentous contradiction. Although the nation faces endless budget deficits — and although the president purports to speak about the future — his tax program does little or nothing to curb long-term deficits and, arguably, might make them worse. <br> It is said that the tax gap of the Trump-Republican program — the net amount of the tax cut — is somewhere between zero (the administration’s position — the tax cut will pay for itself through stronger economic growth) and $1.5 trillion over a decade (the position of many economists who doubt much of a boost to economic growth). <br> Wrong, on both counts. A more realistic estimate of the tax gap is somewhere between $7 trillion and $12 trillion, again over a decade. <br> How do I get these fantastic figures? The answer is that I ignore Trump’s program altogether and simply deal with existing deficits, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). It’s not that I believe that Trump’s program will work as promised. I don’t. My real point is that, in many ways, it’s too small to matter. <br> Even if it works, it won’t cure chronic deficits. And neither party is pretending it will. Both find it more convenient to argue over the plan’s distributional effects — are the rich and well-to-do unfairly favored? — than to close the gaping deficits. <br> Here’s some basic arithmetic that reinforces my point. Although it’s a bit tricky, stick with me. <br> Our economy — the annual production of goods and services, or gross domestic product (GDP) — is now approaching $20 trillion. So every 1 percent of GDP is worth about $200 billion. In fiscal 2017, the deficit was 3.5 percent of GDP, or almost $700 billion. Over a decade, and assuming unrealistically that the deficit doesn’t rise, taxes would need to increase by $7 trillion in today’s dollars to balance the budget. <br> But what if the deficit does rise? By the late 2030s, the CBO estimates that annual deficits will reach 6 percent of GDP, almost doubling from their present level. The increase mainly reflects the growing number of elderly drawing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, in addition to swelling interest payments on the existing debt. To balance the budget would require annual tax increases averaging $1.2 trillion, or $12 trillion over a decade, both in today’s dollars. <br> Either way, the required tax increase would be enormous, ranging from about a fifth of today’s tax burden to about a third. If instead Congress tried to balance the budget by cutting spending, the reductions — including defense — would be huge. <br> Some tentative conclusions emerge from this exercise: <br> ●Plausible rates of economic growth aren’t fast enough to eliminate massive deficits, though they would help. The required growth to do more than Trump has already proposed is simply too high. The present and estimated-future deficits are so large that they can be reduced only through the politically painful process of raising taxes or cutting spending. <br> ●The presumption of politicians of both parties, despite some loud rhetoric to the contrary, is that large deficits and growing federal debt do not now pose a serious threat to the economy. It’s easier to defer major changes — to hope that something will come along to cope with the deficits — rather than wade into the quagmire of substantially higher taxes or lower spending. <br> ●If this optimistic assumption about deficits — call it “benign neglect” of deficits — turns out to be wrong, the U.S. economy faces a serious jolt somewhere in the future. <br> What’s clear is that, regardless of the fate of Trump’s tax program, it’s not the be-all and end-all in economic policy that both friend and foe suppose it to be. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Kevin Hassett evidently has not received the memo that economics is “the dismal science.” The ebullient chairman of President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers is relishing the intellectual feast of applying to policymaking the predictive tools of a science that was blindsided by the Great Recession. <br> Economists, like other scientists, learn things even when — actually, especially when — they are surprised. What must surprise Hassett today is that acrimony has infected even economists’ arguments. When he predicted that 2017 would be “the biggest supply-side policy year in American history,” he was not just thinking of the administration’s deregulations, which proceed apace, but was counting an unhatched chicken — tax reform. Concerning which: <br> Speaking recently to the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation — left- and right-leaning, respectively — Hassett defended the administration’s tax plan, although important provisions remain undecided. He criticized the TPC for a premature analysis that used “imagined numbers” to anticipate the consequences of a bill still being written. And he said that while the plan allows for a $1.5 trillion revenue loss in a decade “statically scored” (i.e., not allowing for the plan’s stimulative effects), the TPC analysis “ignored any growth effects from tax reform and suggested there would be none,” and “makes assumptions that would deliver” a $2.4 trillion revenue loss. He questioned the TPC scoring for this number “when there is agreement that the bill has to score” $1.5 trillion. <br> This detonated Harvard professor and former treasury secretary Lawrence Summers. While praising “civility in public policy debates,” Summers poured vitriol on Hassett, calling his analysis “some combination of dishonest, incompetent and absurd.” Summers was incensed about this Hassett contention: If cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent would mean that corporations would bring home the 71 percent of foreign-earned profits now kept abroad, over eight years, “the median U.S. household would get a $4,000 real income raise.” Summers says that Hassett’s assertion that the corporate rate cut “will raise wages by $4,000 in an economy with 150 million workers is a claim that workers will benefit by $600 billion or 300 percent of the tax cut!” Hassett’s comparatively laconic and heroically patient response: <br> Summers ignores the “deadweight loss” from taxes on production — the economic activity that does not happen because of those taxes. Because Summers mistakenly assumes that the only economic factor affected by cutting corporate taxes is government revenue, he mistakenly considers it impossible to reduce government revenue by $1 and have workers gain more than $1. But corporate tax reductions are not transfers of money from government to workers; they are catalysts for increased economic output, making American investment more attractive and the United States more competitive. The size of the economic pie isn’t fixed. Hence the bipartisan support for aspects of President Barack Obama’s 2012 proposal for cutting corporate taxes. And Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) supports some cuts because workers gain from increased competitiveness. The debate is about not whether but how much heavy corporate taxation suppresses workers’ compensation by blocking various channels to wage growth. <br> Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers’ platoon of PhDs — perhaps America’s best economics “faculty” — might be mistaken about this or that. Dealing with a dynamic economy’s multitudinous variables, they understand the fatal conceit of thinking that even the immediate future can be planned. From the 1862 Homestead and Morrill acts through the GI Bill and the Interstate Highway System, the federal government has planned the long-term knowledge, skills and infrastructure prerequisites for economic growth. These, however, are — even given the accelerated velocity of economic change — easier for government to plan than are short-term consequences of fiscal and monetary policies. <br> It is said that if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. In her prepared remarks to University of Virginia Law School graduates last May, Catherine Keating, chief executive of Commonfund, said: “Don’t count too much on your plan. The world just moves too fast today.” It used to take 25 years for a new product, like the automobile or the TV, to reach 25 percent of the U.S. population. “Facebook did it in five years, and some mobile games have done it in months. It took Hilton Hotels almost 100 years to acquire 800,000 hotel rooms. Airbnb acquired a million rooms in just six years. How do you plan for that? You can’t. Don’t even try.” <br> Hassett’s job is to try. And the stakes are as high as America’s political temperature: If growth does not surge, distribution conflicts will. <br> Read more from George F.

 In her Oct. 17 op-ed, “A tax plan that really helps the middle class,” Catherine Rampell wondered what a tax plan that actually prioritized the middle class and addressed the earned-income tax credit would look like. Tax reform to help the middle class, those earning $127,200 or less in 2017, could combine federal employment taxes (Social Security and Medicare withholding taxes) with the income tax. <br> Too often, politicians talk about income tax without addressing the 7.62 percent employment tax paid by the employed wage-earner and the employer on the first dollar earned up to the maximum limit (self-employed Americans pay both parts at 15.3 percent on net earnings). Expanding the tax-paying base by combining earned and unearned income on a single graduated rate schedule might provide for lower tax rates for all to the point at which the EITC could be eliminated as a work incentive.   <br> Ken Tomcich, Arlington 
 According to much conventional wisdom, the flap over corporate “tax inversions” is just the latest evidence that the tax code needs a comprehensive overhaul like the one agreed to by congressional leaders and President Reagan in 1986. <br> Whether you consider it greedy and unpatriotic for U.S. companies to establish corporate headquarters in lower-tax foreign countries, or merely regrettable but rational, part of the solution is to lower that rate and recoup lost revenue by closing loopholes, it is said. <br> “Lower rates, broader base” was the cardinal principle of the 1986 reform. And it is still the mantra of tax reformers today. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.) unveiled a 1986-style plan in March that would trim the top individual and corporate rates, while pinching popular breaks such as the mortgage interest deduction. <br> There’s just one problem: In 2014, the 1986 model looks like “a dead end.” Or so argues Michael J. Graetz, a former Treasury official in the first Bush administration and longtime advocate of radical tax reform who teaches at Columbia Law School. <br> In his latest paper, published by the National Tax Journal, Graetz contends, plausibly, that the 1986 tax reform worked because it was then possible to pay for rate reductions by eliminating billions of dollars in individual and corporate tax shelters without tackling middle-class breaks like the mortgage interest deduction. <br> Today, though, there’s less low-hanging fruit; a 1986-style reform would be politically difficult because it would be financially difficult, as Camp’s plan and similar attempts at “revenue-neutral” reforms suggest. <br> Even if our politicians did manage to push this boulder up the hill, Graetz notes, it would roll right back down. At the behest of lobbyists, Congress began fiddling with the 1986 reform almost as soon as it was enacted, giving us today’s loophole-ridden mess. <br> The United States’ real problem, according to Graetz, is its undue dependence on income taxes — corporate and individual — in the first place. He supplies a nifty world map with all nations shaded except the ones that don’t have a value-added tax (VAT), essentially a sales tax on goods and services imposed at each stage of their production and distribution. It’s striking to see the United States grouped with Burma, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and exactly zero developed nations. <br> Graetz would put a 12.9 percent VAT at the center of a new system — using the revenue to slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and eliminate income taxes for all households earning less than $100,000 ($50,000 for singles), that is, 80 percent of current filers. <br> For those above that threshold, there would be two rates, 16 percent and 25.5 percent. Payroll tax rates would stay the same, with credits for low-income workers to offset the regressive impact of the VAT, as well as an additional child tax credit. <br> Graetz points to independent analyses showing this would raise about as much revenue, about as progressively, as the current system. It could spur growth by reducing uncertainty and perverse incentives — of which “tax inversions” are but one example. By taxing consumption, it would encourage savings and investment, but not steer them in politically favored directions, as the current code does. <br> Indeed, Graetz’s latest pitch reiterates points he has made before — with no takers. Many Democrats object to the regressivity of a VAT. Republicans regard the very efficiency of a VAT as its biggest drawback, because if it’s easy for government to raise money, it will become too easy for it to spend money. <br> Graetz’s proposed credits would offset the VAT’s impact on lower-income consumers. As for the Republicans, they have a point — but you would think they’d like the near-elimination of income taxes. Besides, under what plausible scenario would the GOP shrink government to the point where it wouldn’t absorb a big share of the economy? <br> Federal spending last came in at less than 17 percent of gross domestic product in 1965; even Rep. Paul Ryan’s (R-Wisc.) supposedly draconian 2011 budget plan wouldn’t get it below 19 percent of GDP until 2040, according to the Congressional Budget Office. <br> Graetz’s plan is undoubtedly susceptible to unintended consequences. The United States, and the world, rely on the American consumer to fuel growth, so higher consumption taxes here might be even more radical than Graetz realizes, and not necessarily in a good way. <br> Still, the sterile debate over tax inversions illustrates the limits of traditional tax-reform thinking. Graetz would go beyond the “lower rates, broader base” swap to a truly grand compromise — which, if it worked, might make this country more stable not only financially but also politically. <br> Read more from Charles Lane’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Charles Lane: A credit to the tax code that’s worth increasing <br> Glenn Hubbard: Tax reform is the best way to tackle income inequality <br> George F.

 Of all the follies of 2017, the most tawdry may be the GOP’s headlong rush to pass a tax bill that even its proponents don’t understand. What’s especially sad is that otherwise sensible Republicans seem to be capitulating to the tax-cut frenzy. <br> Political desperation is the mother of this legislation. Despite Republican control of both houses of Congress, the Trump administration has failed in its first year to enact legislation that deals with major problems, such as health care and immigration. So at year end, we have the spectacle of Trump Co. bellowing a populist message about lower taxes, even as special-interest lobbyists drive the legislation toward a chaotic conference and final passage. <br> The tax bill is a Rubik’s Cube of potential problems, but the difficulties begin with the fact that it has been pushed through Congress in two months without hearings or careful analysis. The provisions were crafted in secret and passed on party-line votes, without a chance for assessment or analysis. <br> This haste guarantees confusion later. Without a clear legislative history, tax lawyers at the Internal Revenue Service won’t have adequate guidance when they try to write regulations implementing the law. Courts won’t have a record of congressional intent, other than news conferences, tweets, and hurried floor and committee statements. <br> The centerpiece of the legislation is a big cut in corporate taxes, down from 35 percent to roughly 20 percent. The theory is that this will encourage companies to invest in job-creating plants and equipment. But there’s little evidence to support this assumption, and lots to challenge it. Companies may instead use the windfall to buy back their own stock, boosting stock prices and inflating executives’ personal compensation, as Steven Clifford explains in his recent book, “The CEO Pay Machine.” <br> The premise is that by stimulating growth, the tax cuts will pay for themselves. But there’s no good evidence for this claim, either. Congress’s bookkeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, predicts that over 10 years, the tax law would balloon the deficit by roughly $1 trillion, even assuming that it stimulates new growth. An even more pessimistic estimate was issued this week by the Wharton School, which President Trump is always bragging about having attended. <br> The Treasury Department on Monday offered a one-page rebuttal asserting that Trump administration policies, including the tax cuts, would grow the economy by 2.9 percent annually over the next 10 years (much higher than most other forecasters have projected) and reduce the deficit by $300 billion. Take a bow, Rosy Scenario. <br> The capricious effects of the bill are becoming clearer as Congress races to marry the House and Senate versions. Tech companies are howling that they will lose the benefits of research credits if they have to pay an alternative minimum tax (as in the Senate version). Homeowners will be hurt by new limits on the deductibility of interest payments; but landlords, meanwhile, will benefit from new breaks for pass-through companies, argues a Bloomberg analysis. How is that fair? <br> An analysis by 13 law professors last week warned that the legislation will produce “tax games, roadblocks and glitches” as companies, individuals, and state and local governments try to manipulate the new system. “Congress should immediately reconsider its approach,” the tax lawyers pleaded. <br> One of the trickiest games ahead was explained in a research report published Tuesday by Goldman Sachs. The tax bill implicitly punishes high-tax “blue states” by limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes. But Goldman analyst Alec Phillips noted that affected states might “change their own tax systems to reflect the new federal system” by reducing personal income taxes and adding more state-level value-added taxes or property taxes. That could reduce federal revenue. <br> One more hidden danger: Existing tax law is mildly countercyclical (in that tax receipts increase when times are good and decline when they’re bad). But the Goldman analyst notes that provisions in the new law “look likely to move the tax code in a more procyclical direction.” That’s dumb economics. <br> Robert Crandall, the former chief executive of American Airlines and one of the smartest business executives around, described the tax bill last week as “particularly stupid because there is a broad consensus of bipartisan agencies and economists who agree it cannot increase growth by anywhere near enough to offset the revenue losses.” He’s right. <br> Responsible Republicans seem to have adopted a fatalistic view that it’s too late to clean up this mess. They’re wrong. Voters will remember who tried to slow the rush toward passage of this ill-considered legislation and who jumped on the bandwagon. <br> Twitter: @IgnatiusPost <br> Read more from David Ignatius’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: The Trump administration’s tax ‘report’ reads like fan fiction <br> The Post’s View: Susan Collins is getting it wrong <br> David Von Drehle: Republicans don’t need to be ashamed of their tax bill <br> Robert J.

 The Dec. 9 editorial “Before a final vote on taxes” had a point that the hypocrisy of the Republicans’ tax plans is staggering and releasing President Trump’s tax returns would help make that clear. But this hypocrisy runs deeper. Investors will get as much as $6 trillion out of the tax plan. That’s how much the Wilshire 5000 market capitalization has risen since Election Day. While some of this trickles down via pension funds and some reflects economic growth pure and simple, a sizable chunk reflects anticipation of lower corporate taxes and ends up lining the pockets of the rich and super-rich.  <br> Also, note that this past week Home Depot, United Airlines and T-Mobile all announced stock buybacks. In fact, since the Senate voted on its tax bill, buybacks have been running at about two a day, something that is great for shareholders (and management) but is not investing in the economy or employment. Tax cuts for rich Republican donors don’t create jobs. They just make rich Republican donors richer.  <br> Charles Taylor, Washington 
 Obamacare repeal? Dead. <br> Tax reform? Dead and demoted to tax cuts, now also on life support. <br> Republicans may have unified control of government, but they seem curiously incapable of getting major agenda items through. <br> Maybe it’s because Republicans have insisted on cutting out Democrats and doing things unilaterally. Or at least they had been until Thursday, when a bipartisan coalition of 24 senators signed onto a bill to patch up Obamacare. While President Trump and congressional Republican leadership remain skeptical about working with the enemy, this could be the start of a turnaround for the GOP. <br> To be clear, “bipartisan” ideas are not necessarily “good” ideas. Sometimes a policy that both parties support turns out to be a huge mistake. <br> As a political matter, though, it can be extremely useful for the majority party to get buy-in from the other side, for three reasons. <br> First, it offers political cover to do necessary but unpopular things. <br> If you actually want to reform and simplify the tax code, you have to close loopholes benefitting some constituents. If you want to cut rates without increasing deficits, you need to find money elsewhere, either through spending cuts or other tax increases. Which some affected group is going to be unhappy about. <br> Likewise, if you want to wring money out of the health-care system, you likely have to inflict pain on someone, whether it’s patients, providers, insurers or drugmakers.  <br> In other words, despite what Trump may claim, few policy changes are really win-win. There’s almost always going to be at least one loser, who will likely be loud and angry. <br> And if your party and your party alone takes ownership of these changes, that loud and angry loser is going to direct this rage at you. <br> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) surely knows this. It’s one reason he refused to work with President Barack Obama on almost any major policy initiative. That way, whenever bad things happened, Republicans could throw up their hands and proclaim: Don’t blame us! <br>  And in fact Republicans said this all the time, even over bad stuff unrelated to any Democratic policy decisions. <br> Now, surprisingly, McConnell has boxed in his own party in the exact same way. <br> He declared his intention for Republicans to govern solo, both by crafting bills of major consequence in secret, without Democratic input, and by attempting to pass those bills through a process requiring zero Democratic votes. <br> In so doing, he’s forced Republicans to take the heat for every controversial decision Congress makes. <br> No wonder, then, that the party appears to be giving up or watering down basically every major pay-for in their tax overhaul. These include the border-adjustment tax (remember that?) and full elimination of the state and local tax deduction. <br> Republicans are similarly stuck with the blame for everything that goes wrong in the health-care system. A majority of Americans already say that Trump and congressional Republicans are responsible for any problems with Obamacare moving forward because they’re the ones in charge, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. <br> And when the broader economy softens — which it inevitably will — Republicans will again get stuck holding the bag. Because they hogged the bag. <br> Second, if Republicans worked with Democrats to find some middle ground and pass their initiatives through so-called regular order, the Grand Old Party wouldn’t be so easily tripped up by hostage takers. <br> Right now, Republican leadership is beholden to the craziest members of its own party. Someone such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) knows he can make unreasonable demands because McConnell can’t afford defections. <br>  And of course giving in to fringe demands can cost leadership the votes of more moderate members of their caucus, a dynamic we saw during the Obamacare repeal efforts. <br> Aiming for a bipartisan coalition of the middle 60 or so votes, instead of requiring the vote of nearly every Republican, would avoid giving undue power to any one legislator (crazy or otherwise). <br>  Finally, if the majority party successfully achieves meaningful support from the minority, it’s less likely that a major policy initiative would be undone or sabotaged when the balance of power shifts. <br> That’s a lesson the Democrats have of course learned with Obamacare, which passed along party lines (despite Obama’s efforts to woo Republican votes). <br> Presumably GOP leadership fears that working with Democrats on an Obamacare fix could leave Republicans vulnerable to being primaried from the right. But what’s a bigger threat: some criticism for playing nice today or facing millions of uninsured Americans a few years from now? <br> Read more here: <br> Dana Milbank: Republicans feeling betrayed, at last <br> The Post’s View: Time for Republicans to accept reality <br> Michael Gerson: Republicans, it’s time to panic <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Dinah Sykes, a Republican, is a member of the Kansas State Senate. <br> Americans want efficient government, responsible spending and reasonable taxes. This is not difficult. Yet sometimes what seems so simple becomes complicated when these concepts are turned into buzzwords and used as weapons for political gain. <br> In 2012, Republicans in Kansas enacted a “revolutionary” tax overhaul promised to be a “shot of adrenaline to the heart of the Kansas economy.” With the benefit of hindsight, we can say with certainty this promise was unfulfilled. In the following five years, Kansas experienced nine rounds of budget cuts, stress on state agencies and the inability to effectively provide the core functions of government for our citizens. <br> As Republicans in Congress begin working to modify the federal tax code, I worry that tax reform done poorly could lead to similar failure. I hope federal lawmakers learn from mistakes made at the state level. <br> This year, the Kansas legislature — including many Republicans like me — voted to partially restore income-tax rates and to repeal a provision that allowed independent business owners to pay almost no state taxes on their income. We also overrode our governor’s veto, who opposed rolling back the tax cuts he championed. <br> Critics of our vote claim that Kansas didn’t cut spending enough to accompany the tax cuts. In reality, we cut our budget through across-the-board cuts, targeted cuts, rescission bills and allotments. Roughly 3,000 state employee positions were cut , salaries were frozen, and road projects canceled . We delayed payments to the state employee retirement system and emptied our savings accounts. Even as we issued more than $2 billion in new bonds to float our debt, Kansas received three credit downgrades, making that debt costlier. <br> In Kansas, we understand the allure of tax-cut promises. We want to believe promises of amazing growth or outcomes. In 2012, traditional budget forecast models accurately predicted the devastating effect the tax breaks would have on state revenue. Proponents of the plan used dynamic scoring predicting incredible economic growth and supporting their own preconceived ideas. Today, we know which forecasts were correct. <br> Across the state, citizens may have been paying less in income taxes, but those decreases were offset by increases in sales taxes, property taxes and fees. These changes alone were not enough to put the state on the right path. Education and infrastructure, key investments necessary for strong economic growth, were treated as the enemy. As we went through our 2017 legislative session, the “shot of economic adrenaline” still showed no signs of materializing. Our state functioned as though the Great Recession had never ended. <br> Kansas should serve as a cautionary tale illustrating the damage done when the normal order is shortchanged. America’s founders and countless generations of leaders embedded deliberative procedures into our legislative process for a reason. But in 2012, the governor’s tax proposal looked very different from the package he signed. A dispute between House and Senate versions should have gone to conference committee; however, the House cut short debate and rammed through a motion to concur with the Senate instead. I watch now as lawmakers in Congress use similar tactics, and I worry that backroom dealing and circumvention of process will lead to similar results. <br> I never anticipated entering public service. I was content raising my family, participating in the PTA and operating my business. However, I saw the impact that bad tax policy was having on the state. I felt the results of growing class sizes and shrinking programs in the schools my children attended. I witnessed a gradual erosion of the quality of life that makes Kansas such a great place to live. <br> There is a real temptation to let our frustration turn into anger. In our increasingly polarized world, we see what happens when we retreat to our ideological trenches. The antidote, it would seem to me, is listening carefully to those we disagree with and seeking common ground as a starting point. (We should also note that failing to listen to constituents while blindly holding to ideology can have consequences: About a third of Kansas legislators became ex-legislators in 2016.) <br> As our country looks at the key issues ahead of us, including tax policy and health-care reform, we face important questions: How can we as Americans work together to improve our tax policy? How can we work together to provide core government functions? Answering those questions requires having civil conversations, learning from our neighbors and sharing our experiences. We are better when we can work together to find compromise. <br> Read more here: <br> Eugene Robinson: Trickle-down economics is a nightmare <br> The Post’s View: Kansas recognizes reality <br> Jared Bernstein and Ben Spielberg: Exhibit A against trickle-down tax cuts <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> OF ALL the votes for the Senate GOP tax bill, those of Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) were perhaps the most puzzling. These lawmakers killed an Obamacare repeal bill last summer because it was hastily drafted and poorly designed. Yet they each just endorsed a tax bill that contains a hastily drafted and poorly designed repeal of a key piece of Obamacare, the law’s “individual mandate” requiring all Americans to carry health-care coverage. <br> When pressed Sunday, Ms. Collins insisted that repealing the mandate would not damage health-care markets, in large part because she received assurances from congressional leaders and the White House that two bipartisan fix-Obamacare bills would come up next. But Ms. Collins is wrong in her certainty that these bills, if passed, would fill the gap that repealing the individual mandate would leave. <br> The Obamacare system guarantees that insurers cannot turn away sick and old people. To keep costs down, this, in turn, requires that young and healthy people do not refuse to buy insurance until they need care. The individual mandate is meant to spur everyone to join the insurance pool. <br> Striking the mandate endangers insurance markets because fewer young and healthy people would buy into the system. Insurers would raise premiums to offset this effect, driving more people out of the market and potentially leading to even higher premiums over time. The scale of the potential damage is a matter of hot debate. But the prospect of more uncertainty and further-weakened health-care markets might scare more insurers out of the Obamacare system. If Republicans are set on repealing this important element of Obamacare, they should at least have ready a replacement policy designed to achieve similar effects, spurring the young and healthy to buy insurance and balance out the pool. <br> Instead, they have a bill that Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) negotiated that would restore for two years subsidy payments to insurers participating in Obamacare, payments that were halted at Republican insistence. Restoring these payments could lower premiums for insurance-buyers in some states. But in many places regulators have found ways to effectively restrain premiums in the absence of the federal payments, so temporarily restoring them would in fact not help as many people as one might have imagined. Also in the bill are some permanent regulatory reforms, but their effects are still a matter of uncertain speculation. <br> Ms. Collins also pointed to a proposal she hashed out with Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), which would provide money to help insurers pay for very high-cost patients. With the federal government bearing more risk, insurers could lower premiums and attract more customers. Unfortunately, the bill would not devote enough money to this “reinsurance” program, and the funding would dry up after two years. <br> To be clear, each of these bills is worth passing on its own merits. But trading them for the permanent loss of the individual mandate is a bad exchange. If the reinsurance plan were larger and perpetual, Ms. Collins would have a better argument. If Republicans had spent months examining the effectiveness of the mandate, waited for a new assessment from the Congressional Budget Office and drafted a stand-alone bill that included replacement policies, they would have more credibility in making such a large and risky change in the Obamacare system. But this is not what happened. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Time for Republicans to accept reality <br> Nicholas Bagley: The GOP is trading 13 million people’s health care for corporate tax cuts <br> Letters: Thoughts on health-care’s individual mandate <br> Craig Garthwaite: Why replacing Obamacare is so hard: It’s fundamentally conservative <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 I loved Bloomington, Ind., Mayor John Hamilton’s (D) statement in his Dec. 8 op-ed, “No city would pass this tax bill,” that the proposed federal tax bill, if done at a smaller scale, “would never survive a local city council discussion.” <br> But it just might if the mayor and council were dependent on local businesses and wealthy local families for their positions and possible future employment. And if those entities didn’t really need or care about the welfare of the undereducated, the poor or anyone else, what is going on in Washington would be going on in Mr. Hamilton’s city as well. <br> Craig Hoogstra, Washington <br> 
 Lawrence H. Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Barack Obama from 2009 through 2010. <br> The approaching end of President Trump’s first year in office, another strong employment report and a still-strong stock market make it appropriate to revisit my year-old judgment that the economy is enjoying a “sugar high.” Unfortunately, the best available evidence suggests that signs of current market and economic strength are largely unrelated to government policy, that the drivers of this year’s economic strength are likely transient and that the structural foundation of the U.S. economy is weakening. Sugar high remains the right diagnosis, and tax cuts are very much the wrong prescription. <br> Growth in the four quarters of 2017 now looks likely to come in at 2.3 percent, marginally faster than the consensus just before the president’s election. Consensus expectations for 2018 are only marginally greater today than they were before the election. So there has been no substantial updraft in the economy. In fact the United States has trailed the global economy in the sense that other countries, notably in Europe, have seen greater upward forecast revisions. <br> The U.S. stock market has been very strong, rising by close to 25 percent since the election, which is far more than most observers expected a year ago. This appears to be heavily driven by increases in corporate profits. But performance is running behind that of Japan and Germany, belying the idea that the market is being driven by U.S.-specific policy factors. <br> The idea that U.S. fundamentals have importantly improved since the election is further called into question by the observation that the dollar has declined by 8 percent against the yen and 7 percent against the euro. If something fundamental had happened to improve the U.S. business environment, we would have seen capital inflows and an appreciating currency. <br> Is the growth the United States has seen in 2017 sustainable over the medium term? This seems unlikely, from both supply- and demand-side perspectives. From the supply side, it is hard to imagine that, with 4.1 percent unemployment, the economy can continue creating anything like 200,000 jobs a month, given that normal growth in the labor force is about 60,000 people. From the demand side, this year’s growth was driven in significant part by a more than $6 trillion increase in household wealth from the stock market rally. Even if the market holds its level, similar wealth increments cannot be expected on a regular basis in the future. <br> Such poor prospects for sustained rapid growth are not surprising given the economy’s weak foundation. Despite record-low capital costs and abundant corporate cash as inducements to investment, productivity growth has been slow. Even very innovative companies such as Apple and Google cannot find enough high-return investments and so choose to engage in large-scale share repurchases. Given record profits and low capital costs, it seems more plausible to blame poor productivity performance on insufficient public investment rather than inadequate incentives for private investment. <br> This is a major issue because, given slow labor-force growth, a substantial acceleration in productivity growth will be needed to even maintain the economy’s rate of expansion in the years ahead. <br> Even if growth can somehow be maintained or accelerated, it is foundational for a healthy economy that its benefits be widely shared. Unfortunately, the tendency has been very different in the United States. Inequality has steadily increased, and much of the growth that has taken place has been captured by a small share of the population. This is a reflection of both increased dispersions in pre-tax income and the inadequate progressivity of the tax and transfer system. <br> There will be no meaningful and sustained growth in workers’ take-home pay without successful measures both to raise productivity growth and to achieve greater equality. Only in this way can we achieve healthy growth. <br> The tax-cut legislation now in conference committee on Capitol Hill exacerbates every important problem it claims to address, most importantly by leaving the federal government with an entirely inadequate revenue base. The bipartisan Simpson-Bowles budget commission was surely not biased toward big government. Yet it concluded that the federal government needed a revenue base equal to 21 percent of gross domestic product. The tax-cut legislation now under consideration would leave the federal government with a revenue basis of 17 percent of GDP — a difference that works out to $1 trillion a year within the budget window. <br> This will further starve already inadequate levels of public investment in infrastructure, human capital and science. It will likely mean further cuts in safety-net programs and cause more people to fall behind. And because it will also mean higher deficits and capital costs, it will likely crowd out as much private investment as it stimulates. <br> Tax cuts may prolong the sugar high a bit. But they are no substitute for the new economic foundation we desperately need. <br> Read more here: <br> Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles: A moment of truth for our country’s financial future <br> Robert E.

 House and Senate Republicans have begun to hammer out a merger of the two bodies’ tax bills, and President Trump stands ready to sign whatever can pass both chambers. There are a few great opponents and one enormous obstacle between them and the sort of success that defines a presidency and a congressional career. But there is also a solution that turns opponents into allies and red ink into black. <br> Opposed to the bill are residents of high-tax states (and members of those states’ governments), real estate agents, home builders, mortgage holders, businesses that have borrowed in the past and see all or part of their interest deduction vanish (and with it, for some, their very viability as a business), and students, especially those who chose a college based on a tuition benefit derived from the school’s employment of a parent. <br> This last group will almost certainly get relief. No congressman or senator I have spoken with fails to see how unjust it is to penalize students who did not search for a scholarship or financial aid elsewhere because they took the tuition benefit that came with their status as children of staff or faculty. (I had one email this week from a low-wage worker at a “Little Ivy” whose son passed up an ROTC scholarship to go to the college that employs her. Their family will be crushed if his and his siblings’ tuition benefits are suddenly taxed after they forwent scholarship trains that left years ago.) <br> Far more numerous, though, are all the other aggrieved groups. There are fixes for each, but revenue must be found. <br> Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) offered a solution he credited to my radio show but that actually originated from years of lawyering for home builders: allow every individual with retirement assets to withdraw up to 25 percent of the assets at a one-time federal tax rate of 10 percent (plus applicable state income taxes) provided that the proceeds are used to pay off existing mortgage debt or purchase a principal residence for the withdrawing taxpayer or a child. Americans hold more than $26 trillion in retirement assets, and $6 trillion to $7 trillion of those assets would thus be made available for withdrawal. Billions of dollars would be paid in the one-time taxes (the revenue!), with mortgages paid off and new homes purchased. Those newly free of mortgages would have more cash on hand, and many renters and children of homeowners would buy a first home. Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, and high-tax states looking at a revenue rush to help ease the transition to the new tax world would shift from opponents to friends of the bill. Crucially, far more Americans would be better off under such a tax bill than under either the House or Senate version. <br> The objection is that we can’t allow Americans to drain their retirement assets, as they already save too little. Setting aside for the moment that conservative legislators should favor giving Americans more freedom to use their own assets, the reality is that principal residences are the key retirement asset for most Americans. Huge majorities want to live their retirements out in their own homes. Getting rid of the mortgage on the biggest retirement asset via the use of other retirement assets has long been the big gap in our retirement laws, but Congress can remedy that. And in so doing, legislators can make millions of Americans’ retirements more secure, provide a huge stimulus to the housing sector and reduce the debt that most Americans labor under. <br> It may be difficult to score the Inhofe amendment, given the vast combinations of Americans’ retirement assets and mortgage debt. But I haven’t found any mortgage holder who wouldn’t leap at this opportunity because of the benefits it would bring to retirement security and long-term cash flow. If only half the assets that qualify were brought out from their tax-protected status, more than $300 billion would be added to the revenue side of the ledger — revenue that could be used for other fixes in the bill. <br> So GOP conferees: Please put aside the Beltway vanity that tax proposals must originate from staff or be contaminated by K Street. Sometimes common sense should be allowed into the sausage factory. This is one of those times. Let retirement assets work for the people who earned them — and ease the passage of this enormous legislative victory as they are set free. <br> Read more: <br> Hugh Hewitt: Here’s how the GOP can pay for its tax plan <br> The Post’s View: A Trump tax idea that might actually do some good <br> Lawrence H.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> WHITE HOUSE press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that President Trump will submit to a full physical exam early next year and release the results. The announcement was meant to quiet speculations about Mr. Trump’s health after he seemed to slur his words in a speech the previous day. If, and this is a big if, Ms. Sanders’s announcement is more than a rhetorical maneuver to end the questioning — if the president actually follows through on his latest pledge to release information of public concern — it will be a welcome turn toward transparency for a man who has disrespected Americans’ interest in disclosure since he entered politics. <br> Yet there is a matter of presidential openness that is perhaps even more urgent. Congress is on the verge of passing the most significant tax bill in a generation. Nonpartisan experts report that the GOP plan would add $1 trillion or more to the debt to pay for a plan that would mostly benefit the rich. Mr. Trump has been unusually involved in determining the details of the plan. Yet the public can only guess at how he and his family would benefit from the bill, because he has broken with decades of bipartisan practice — and has flouted a direct campaign promise — by refusing to release any of his tax returns, past or present. <br> Left to speculate about Mr. Trump’s possible conflicts of interest, experts have identified provision after provision seemingly tailor-made to help the Trumps. Corporate tax breaks would disappear for many industries — but not for real estate. Income from businesses set up as “pass-throughs” would be taxed less, and the Trump Organization extensively uses the pass-through business design. Mr. Trump’s children would no doubt benefit from an eliminated or significantly curtailed estate tax. <br> Exactly how the estate tax would change is just one of the many details Congress must settle before passing a final bill — details the president could push in one direction or another. For example, the House version of the bill would eliminate the individual alternative minimum tax, which ensures that upper-end taxpayers cannot use tax breaks to zero-out their tax bills. By contrast, the Senate bill would leave the AMT in place in a modified form. A leaked copy of his 2005 tax return shows Mr. Trump paid $31 million because of the AMT that year. The president would appear to have a large financial stake in which version Congress chooses. <br> With these speculations swirling, Mr. Trump has claimed, without offering any evidence, that the tax bill would in fact cost him, not benefit him. That seems unlikely. But if it is so, all the more reason to let Americans see for themselves. Congress should insist on it before taking a final vote. <br> Read more: <br> The Post’s View: Will Trump’s tax cuts profit Trump? <br> The Post’s View: Trump says the GOP tax plan would make him a ‘big loser.’ Prove it. <br> Helaine Olen: We don’t know what’s in Trump’s tax returns.

 The Oct. 9 editorial “The wrong way to fix Obamacare” brought readers closer to the real meaning of a government-run health-care system. That is, if I may quote from the editorial, “The right response is not to cut poor and sick people off insurance rolls but to stop paying for treatments and services that are unneeded . . . This is hard, because it involves telling people to change — and occasionally saying ‘no.’ ” This was solved, the editorial concluded, by creation of the “Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a panel of experts tasked with making some hard choices.” I have a lot of questions regarding the IPAB (not a death panel), though some might think I’m being cynical. But did the editorial mean what it seemed to suggest: that the government, to cut costs, intends to ration treatments and services, as well as “tantalizing but expensive medical innovations”? Would this apply to all Americans regardless of ability to pay (Medicare for all)? <br> John Conradis, Chevy Chase <br> Merely reiterating that the efforts of the Republicans to “dismantle and replace the Affordable Care Act” failed is insufficient [“Republican lawmakers have little to say about Trump-Corker war of words,” news, Oct. 10]. <br> Without President Trump’s stated promises as to what his health-care plan to replace the ACA would provide, and without some information as to what Congress actually proposed and what the House actually voted to do, the cause of the failure of this legislation is left to speculation. The use of that failure as a comparison with a proposed “tax overhaul” is of limited use. <br> Mr. Trump’s promises of wonderful and cheap health care for all, congressional Republicans’ actions to try to deny tens of millions of Americans health care, and the rest of the reality of what was promised and who actually would have benefited and suffered, however, provide a firmer comparison with what might be expected in the upcoming signature tax “reform” legislation being proposed. <br> David M. Siegler, Oakton 
 Regarding Paul Kane’s Dec. 3 @PKCapitol column, “Republicans savor a win that could be swept aside by shutdown negotiations”:  <br> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said there is no need for action on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program because it is not a crisis or an emergency. Really, is that his management style? <br> Maybe that’s why Congress can come up with money for hurricane recovery but not to help people to move out of houses that flood repeatedly. Still, it seems that about 690,000 people not knowing what is going to happen to them in three months is at least as much of an emergency as the need for a deficit-financed tax cut for a nation with a booming economy and a $20 trillion debt. <br> Mike Zasadil, Silver Spring 
 Robert J. Samuelson’s Dec. 4 op-ed, “Beware an economic boom. Really,” set forth some important points. But it also missed a huge one. Any sensible family will pay down its debt when it gets extra income. Congress should be raising taxes to balance the budget and pay down national debt now that the economy is humming along. At the same time, the extra taxes would also help bridle the growing economy, as Mr. Samuelson rightly advocated doing. <br> Congress’s tax-cut bills would do the opposite. All to enrich the rich. <br> Charles Murn, Washington 
 Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) recently argued for the end of the estate tax as a reward and incentive for hard work and investment [“Grassley’s movie moment,” Act Four excerpt, Dec. 5]. In fact, by definition, an estate tax does not reward hard work — the hard workers are deceased at the time an estate tax is imposed. An estate is income the beneficiary did not work to earn. The imposition of income taxes on a person’s hard labor, but not their inheritance (which is gifted), speaks volumes about what is rewarded in this current tax proposal. Hint: It’s not hard-working people. <br> Mr. Grassley’s moralistic formulation about why it is that some remain in the working class (and therefore, I suppose, obliged to pay taxes) is also revealing. But if he would like to do a case study on differential spending patterns to determine who among us is worthy of tax exemption, I suggest he begin locally — 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., perhaps? I wager that the 5,000 households affected by the estate tax have spent more than their share on “booze or women or movies.” <br> Irit Rasooly, Bala Cynwyd, Pa. 
 Deb Fischer, a Republican, represents Nebraska in the U.S. Senate. <br> Congress has a chance to make history by enacting the first nationwide paid family leave policy as part of the Senate tax reform bill. <br> While many working adults have been busy raising children, our nation’s aging population has created a dual strain as those adults’ caregiving duties have expanded to looking after elderly relatives. Life is stressful for families trying to make it all work. It can feel like there simply aren’t enough hours in a day. <br> For four years in the Senate, I’ve been working on the plan to address this challenge that was included in our tax bill. My proposal aims to increase Americans’ access to paid family leave while remaining cognizant of the realities of running a business — especially a small one. <br> This plan uses a tax credit to encourage employers to offer workers up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. Using what I call the “carrot approach,” the policy gives businesses an incentive to give employees more flexibility when they face family worries. <br> This is the kind of paid-leave program the American people support. A Pew Research Center study released in March looked at people who have taken, or wanted to take, leave in the past two years. Participants said that having paid leave for family or medical reasons was more helpful than any other benefit or work arrangement. The findings showed that 87 percent of participants somewhat or strongly favor a tax break for employers who provide paid family leave. That’s exactly what my measure does. <br> Larger corporations are already offering paid family leave, especially to C-Suite and high-salaried employees. Leaders of big businesses realize that this particular benefit can increase productivity and help them retain top talent. But a family-run fast-food franchise in Nebraska doesn’t have the same means to offer paid leave as a global tech company. And companies already providing paid family leave to their executives and managers don’t always extend the benefit to middle-to-lower-income or hourly workers. <br> My plan targets the category of workers who commonly lack access to paid family leave by instituting a $72,000 yearly pay cap for employee eligibility. Additionally, this proposal would extend to those employed by mom-and-pop businesses who may not have access to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, and it is tailored to part-time workers. Employers in the District, or in states such as California and New York, where paid family leave is already required, would be able to build upon existing programs to expand access. <br> Men and women can use their leave to take an hour, a day or weeks off to care for a family member. They can take maternity or paternity leave to bond with a biological or adopted newborn. With this option, fewer American workers would have to forfeit the wages they need to provide for their loved ones. <br> This plan is a middle ground that respects both families and businesses. Employers who take advantage of the program are entitled to a tax credit of up to 25 percent of wages replaced — a significant incentive. There are no government mandates or new federal programs, the burdens of which usually produce costs for both employers and employees. <br> Creating a way for small companies to more easily provide paid family leave will tip the balance toward broad adoption of this family-friendly policy. <br> Still, because it’s set up as a two-year pilot program, once the provision is implemented there will be an opportunity to gather data and evaluate whether the credit works. Neither families nor businesses should be stuck in something that doesn’t work for them. My proposal does not create an open-ended, expensive program without an expiration date and without knowing whether it meets its goals. It is a responsible way to move forward. <br> Critics of this proposal should recognize the step we can take here. Why stick to the status quo when we have a viable option that could make a positive difference for our families, right now? We know the conversation on this important issue is not going away. <br> A recent Ernst Young survey of full-time workers in eight countries revealed that paid family leave is more important to millennials than to generations before them. Eighty-three percent of those surveyed are more likely to join a company that provides this benefit. Our future workforce wants to see action. The plan passed by the Senate should prevail in conference. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Sheryl Sandberg and Rachel Thomas: Celebrate Labor Day by supporting national paid family leave <br> Michael Gerson: Republicans had a chance to reject their inner plutocrat.

 Dan Schwerin was director of speechwriting for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and collaborated on her memoir “What Happened.” <br> As a Democrat, I have appreciated Republican senators such as Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and John McCain (Ariz.) warning about the damage President Trump is doing to our country. I wish they would oppose a tax bill that explodes the deficit and punishes working families. But if they’re not going to do that, they should at least use this moment of maximum leverage to impose some checks on what they themselves describe as an out-of-control president. <br> Under normal circumstances, it would be surprising if GOP senators didn’t fall in line. After all, no policy unites Republicans like cutting rich people’s taxes. But these are not normal circumstances. Flake himself warned his Senate colleagues never to “regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals.” Yet Flake, McCain, Susan Collins (R-Maine) and others gave away their votes on the tax bill for practically nothing. This was either terrible negotiating or a failure of imagination. Or maybe their big talk about Trump is just that — talk. <br> Trump’s GOP critics should use their power as swing votes to extract specific concessions that would limit the damage the president can do. They missed a golden opportunity on Friday, but they will likely get another chance after the tax bill emerges from a joint Senate-House conference committee. Here are some concrete steps they should take. <br> First, they should protect special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. Now that former national security adviser Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with Mueller, preventing Trump from rashly firing the special counsel is more important than ever. Two bipartisan bills have already been introduced to do just that, one by Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and another by Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.). These lawmakers and their colleagues should insist that a version of their legislation be approved and signed into law before they vote for the final tax bill. <br> Second, the GOP anti-Trumpers should require some form of congressional approval for any future “first strike” attack with nuclear weapons. Even better would be a “no first use” policy for nuclear weapons. This wouldn’t prevent the commander in chief from responding to an incoming attack on our homeland, but it would prevent the most terrifying danger we face under this president: the prospect of an angry and impulsive Trump firing off a nuclear missile the way he fires off a tweet. <br> Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has warned that Trump is putting the nation “on the path to World War III,” recently held a hearing on the issue. He and other Republicans concerned about national security and worried about Trump’s capacity as commander in chief should strongly consider something like Sen. Edward J. Markey’s (D-Mass.) legislation, which would put a check on this doomsday nuclear scenario. <br> Third, they should force the president to meet basic standards of ethics and transparency. The House GOP has voted down legislation that would require Trump to release his tax returns and official visitor logs from the White House and Mar-a-Lago. Flake and like-minded Republicans should make passing such legislation a prerequisite for final passage of the tax bill. <br> This list is just the beginning of what Congress could do to constrain the risks of the Trump presidency. Of course, the best outcome would be for Republicans in both houses of Congress to vote the final tax bill down on the merits. But if that’s not going to happen, then the president’s critics should insist on these steps. <br> Many Republicans won’t want to vote for these measures and Trump certainly won’t want to sign them. But they really want to cut taxes for billionaires. Now may be the single best opportunity to force real action. Based on the dire warnings coming from Flake and Corker, we can’t afford to wait another minute. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: A new Poor People’s Campaign wants to change how society defines morality <br> Catherine Rampell: Populism died on Saturday <br> Dianne Feinstein: Republicans in Congress are about to give Trump even more power <br> Michael Gerson: God bless all the anti-Trump Republicans <br> Robert Kagan: Would checks and balances stop Trump?

 Cynics are said to be people who are prematurely disappointed about the future. Such dyspepsia is encouraged by watching Republicans struggle to move on from the dog’s breakfast they have made of health-care reform to the mare’s nest of tax reform. Concerning which, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), whose preternatural optimism makes Candide seem morose, says: “If we’re going to truly fix our tax code, then we’ve got to fix all of it.” Trying to fix “all of” immigration in 2013 and health care in 2010 with “comprehensive” legislation left almost everyone irritable. Perhaps the third time is the charm. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is skeptical about fixing much this year, even given Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) decision to limit the August recess. <br> The fourth-most-senior Democrat and the ranking minority member on the tax-writing Finance Committee, Wyden, 68, is usually relaxed but now is especially so, for two reasons. He was just elected to a fourth term. And for him and other Finance Committee Democrats, tax reform is, so far, an undemanding spectator sport. This was underscored last weekend when, as he was being driven from one Oregon town hall to another, he read a Wall Street Journal article headlined “GOP Tax Overhaul’s Fate Rests on ‘Big Six’ Talks.” <br> Five of the six were in an almost taunting photo provided to the Journal by Ryan’s office — Ryan, McConnell, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The missing sixth person was National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. No congressional Democrat is included. Evidently, Republicans plan to pass tax reform without Democratic votes, under “reconciliation,” which is inherently partisan — 51 votes will suffice — and limits debate to 20 hours. The 1986 reform, the gold standard of bipartisan tax legislation, was on the Senate floor for more than 100 hours spread over 20 days — after seven days of hearings and 16 days of mark-up. <br> Ryan and McConnell say tax reform will be “revenue-neutral.” This might require dynamic scoring — calculating that reformed incentives will stimulate economic growth — to project implausible growth rates. Plausibility is, however, optional, as it was in April, when Mnuchin’s department produced a tax plan that resembled Lincoln’s “soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death.” The document — “shorter than a drug store receipt,” says Wyden — was one page long, contained 218 words, eight numbers and a thumping vacuity, the promise to “eliminate tax breaks for special interests.” <br> Last November, Mnuchin told CNBC there would be “no absolute tax cut for the upper class,” meaning no net cut after lost deductions. In Mnuchin’s January confirmation hearing, Wyden mischievously suggested calling this “the Mnuchin rule,” which enthralled Mnuchin, who later said: “I feel like I’m now in good company with the Volcker rule and the Buffett rule.” In a June hearing, however, Mnuchin told Wyden: “You made it a rule, I didn’t make it a rule.” It would be entertaining to watch Republicans try to adhere to that rule while fulfilling their promise — from which they began retreating on Tuesday — to repeal the 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on investment income. <br> No Democrat, says Wyden, likes the status quo. When he recently described the tax code as “a rotting economic carcass,” his wife asked him to stop scaring the children. The complexity of the code, which is about 4 million words, is why America has more people employed as tax preparers (1.2 million) than as police and firefighters. If tax compliance were an industry, it would be among the nation’s largest; it devours 6.1 billion hours annually, the equivalent of more than 3 million full-time workers. <br> Wyden knows he sounds like “a one-song jukebox” when he keeps stressing “wage growth” but he notes that last week the encouraging number of jobs created in June (222,000) was accompanied by discouraging wage growth (year-over-year, 2.5 percent, barely ahead of inflation). Many economists are puzzled that low unemployment (4.4 percent) is not forcing employers to bid up the price of labor. Wyden says he is puzzled by neither the cause (persistent slow growth, limping at about 2 percent) nor the cause of this cause — insufficient money in middle-class paychecks to power an economy where 70 percent of the fuel comes from consumer spending. He favors, for example, doubling the earned-income tax credit. He seems, however, to be preemptively, but not prematurely, disappointed about a legislative process that will fall somewhat short of fixing “all of” what ails the rotting carcass. <br> Read more from George F.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IT’S UNDERSTANDABLE why Donald Trump has felt no compunction about refusing to release his tax returns. After all, he got elected president despite breaking his promise to release his IRS filings, thus thumbing his nose at a tradition that had been followed by every major-party candidate for four decades. Keeping the information under wraps also appears to be an effective way of stymieing questions about whether there are potential conflicts of interest posed by his private business empire. What doesn’t make sense is that Congress lets him get away with this, particularly since it soon will be debating an overhaul of tax policy. Shouldn’t elected representatives know how President Trump might benefit and what interests are really being served? <br> Unfortunately but predictably, an effort that would have forced release of Mr. Trump’s tax information was shut down last week by House Republicans. In a party-line vote Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee rejected a resolution that would have directed the Treasury Department to turn over the tax returns of Mr. Trump and his many businesses. A law enacted in 1924 after the Teapot Dome scandal allows the Way and Means Committee, along with the Senate Committee on Finance and the Joint Committee on Taxation, to request tax information for review in a closed session with possible public disclosure. <br> The rarely used authority to obtain tax information can be invoked only in the public’s interest. “How can we debate tax reform proposals without seeing the president’s tax returns?” asked Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), who sponsored the resolution. “Congress has the authority and the duty to obtain and review President Trump’s tax returns to ensure there are no potential conflicts of interest in the tax policies he is proposing.” Release also would provide insight into whether Mr. Trump’s private business dealings, including with foreign investors, created conflicts that undermine the public interest. <br> Republicans saw it differently, calling the attempt to get Mr. Trump’s information an invasion of privacy. Need they be reminded that the person who sits in the Oval Office is not a private citizen, something recognized for the past 40 years by every person — Democratic and Republican — who held the high office? It appears Republicans also need to be reminded that Congress’s job is not to provide slavish political cover for the executive, but rather independent oversight. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> George K.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> BOTH HOUSES of Congress have now passed tax bills, and GOP lawmakers will over the next couple of weeks try to reconcile the two versions. Neither is an improvement over the status quo, and we’d be delighted if the conference collapsed and everyone agreed to start from scratch to craft a bipartisan, fiscally responsible bill. Still, that’s not likely — and there are worse and worser possible outcomes from a conference agreement. <br> The first step to a less-bad agreement would be to excise extraneous provisions tacked onto one bill or the other in order to pay off a particular lawmaker or to satisfy narrow ideological preoccupations. The Senate bill eliminates Obamacare’s individual mandate, a big step toward repealing Obamacare without any sufficient replacement policy included or promised, and it allows drilling in the precious Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These should go. The House bill would open a gigantic campaign-cash loophole that in the name of “religious freedom” would enable people to funnel vast amounts of dark money into politics and claim a tax deduction for it. Strike that, too. <br> Next, bicameral negotiators should reduce the impact on the debt by scaling back the most unjustifiable giveaways to the wealthy. Rather than lowering the top individual income tax rate, they should agree to keep it at 39.6 percent, as the House bill would. Rather than accepting the House proposal to eliminate the estate tax, which applies only to very wealthy heirs, they should keep it as is — or, if they must help the idle rich, adopt the Senate’s idea to pare it back temporarily. They should accept the Senate’s plan to maintain the individual alternative minimum tax, which ensures that wealthy wage earners cannot use loopholes to entirely escape paying a fair share. <br> Negotiators should take up President Trump on his willingness to drop the 35 percent corporate tax rate to 22 percent, rather than the 20 percent each bill currently prescribes. Instead of spending the extra cash, they should use the savings to limit the damage GOP tax cuts would do to the nation’s already stretched budget. <br> Finally, negotiators should soften their blatant attacks on Democratic states and other constituencies Republicans have singled out for punishment. Instead of chopping away at the deduction for state and local taxes, which would target taxpayers in blue states, they should reduce tax breaks in a fairer way, perhaps by further limiting the home mortgage deduction. The House bill, for example, would cap the applicability of the mortgage deduction at $500,000 in loans. And negotiators should drop all of the provisions in each bill that would slam universities and their students. These provisions raise little money, serving primarily as shortsighted legislative assaults on the country’s crucial institutions of learning and innovation. <br> Even if House-Senate negotiators took every one of these recommendations, the product would still be an expensive tax cut bill that a country in the midst of an accelerating economic recovery does not need and, over the long term, cannot afford. But the consequences would be less extreme. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jennifer Rubin: After huge tax breaks for the rich, there’s not enough for the sick and poor <br> E.J.

 With all due respect to The Post, all of the front-page articles that focused on the supposed winners and losers in the tax-cut debate were ignoring the most important story. <br> Article after article spotlighted the obvious: Most of the proposed tax cuts benefit the richest Americans. This only supported the political narrative that the media was ignoring the incredible job growth to be spurred by the cuts. <br> Whether that’s true or not is also not the point. The story we rarely saw was that this tax cut is not what President Trump and the rest of the Republicans have been promising. <br> It is not simplifying the code, it is not immediately reducing corporate taxes, it is not eliminating loopholes that send jobs overseas, it is not eliminating loopholes that prevent some from paying taxes at all. It is not reducing the deficit. It is filled with politically driven provisions such as sabotaging Obamacare and selectively taxing Democratic-leaning voters. <br> This tax bill is the most cynical tax legislation we’ve seen in our lifetimes. But, most important, it is a broken promise, and the media should be taking our elected officials to task for it. <br> Scott Ableman, McLean <br> The list of tax-bill winners and losers was fine until it came to “the 13 million Americans who won’t have health insurance” [“Amid Senate vote, here are some likely winners and losers,” Wonkblog excerpt, Dec. 2]. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that these people will stop buying health insurance because there will no longer be a penalty imposed on them if they don’t. If I am buying health insurance because of the penalty, you eliminate the penalty and I then decide not to buy health insurance, that makes me a winner. People who are compelled by the government to buy products they don’t want are losers, and people who get to make their own decisions are winners. <br> David R. Godofsky, Oakton <br> After reading numerous reports in The Post on the very rapid passage of the Senate tax bill, I am sickened and disheartened. All possible negative effects were clearly spelled out, with most benefits clearly going to the wealthy. I believe that this tax bill was passed so quickly to ensure that the big donors to the Republican Party keep giving and for senators (and House members) to try to ensure their reelection in 2018, something I question will happen when people feel the effects of this bill and what may follow. This and the House bill are not about what is good for the country, but what is good for their donors and them. This is not the America I know. <br> Ann Wild, Chevy Chase 
 We don’t need an economic boom, but that’s what we may be getting. Since the 2016 election, the stock market is up roughly 24 percent, reports Wilshire Associates. The price of the cybercurrency bitcoin soared more than 1,000 percent before retreating. The unemployment rate of 4.1 percent is the lowest since 2000. The economy’s growth has exceeded an annual rate of 3 percent for the past two quarters. <br> Anyone familiar with the post-World War II economy is bound to feel ambivalent about these dazzling developments. On the one hand, after so many years of disappointment following the Great Recession of 2007-2009, it’s nice to see the economy outperforming. Since the low point in late 2009, non-farm jobs have increased by 17 million. On the other hand, extended booms give rise to long busts that have been hugely destructive in human terms — meaning higher unemployment and lower incomes. <br> Since World War II, there have been two instances of these grand boom-bust cycles. The 106-month expansion in the 1960s was followed by more than a decade of economic turmoil: double-digit inflation, four recessions (unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent in late 1982) and a stagnant stock market corrected for inflation. The second grand cycle started with the tech boom of the 1990s that lasted exactly a decade. It led to the economic carnage of the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession. <br> The ultimate source of these boom-bust episodes is human nature. Although prosperity is a good thing, long stretches of good times can become self-destructive. People — consumers, business owners and managers, bankers, investors, entrepreneurs — become sloppy, overconfident and complacent. They become increasingly vulnerable to economic setbacks, but their careless behavior continues because it is crowd-driven. <br> This history cautions prudence. We don’t know whether the economic recovery that began in mid-2009 will end in some sort of crackup. But we should minimize the odds of this happening by avoiding policies that overstimulate the economy when it doesn’t need more “stimulus.” <br> In the present context, there are two implications. First, the Federal Reserve should continue raising short-term interest rates, which are still low. And second, the Republican tax legislation now being considered by Congress should not increase budget deficits by a penny. The various tax proposals are estimated to add from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion to deficits over a decade, depending on how the calculations are done. <br> Lowering tax rates is good; borrowing to do so, as opposed to closing other tax breaks, is bad. What’s often overlooked is that even before the Republican tax proposals, projected budget deficits were sizable. The Congressional Budget Office estimates them at $10 trillion cumulatively from fiscal 2018 to 2027. <br> Many mainstream economists have convinced themselves that the tax proposals won’t stimulate the economy or threaten the recovery. Here’s the conclusion of a study from Moody’s Analytics: <br> “Neither the House or Senate [tax] plans would meaningfully improve economic growth. . . . Growth would be stronger initially, since the deficit-financed tax cuts are a fiscal stimulus. But given that the economy is operating at full employment, stronger inflation and higher interest rates will result. The economic benefit of the lower tax rates on business investment is washed out by the higher interest rates.” <br> Maybe. But in practice, this view may be too sanguine. Suppose the strong demand of a boom economy causes inflation to exceed expectations — say 4 percent instead of 2 percent. The increase could set off a destructive chain reaction. Higher inflation begets higher interest rates. (The Fed raises short-term rates; market pressures push up long-term rates on bonds and mortgages.) Higher interest rates darken the economic outlook, causing stocks to crash and confidence to slump. <br> The truth is that we don’t fully understand the effects of budget deficits on the business cycle. On the other hand, we better understand history, and history suggests that the bigger the boom, the bigger the subsequent bust. A patient economy may ultimately be more rewarding and sustainable than its more spectacular counterpart. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jennifer Rubin: The last thing we need is a massive tax cut <br> Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles: A moment of truth for our country’s financial future <br> George F.

 I’ve had many troubles with Post charts in the past, especially with unlabeled and/or unnumbered axes. Such was the case with the Sept. 30 chart labeled “Who actually benefits from the proposed tax plan” that accompanied the continuation of the front-page article “Report: Wealthiest gain most from GOP tax plan.” <br> For example, the chart showed that the “Middle fifth” “Income Group” would get an “Avg. Tax Cut” of “-$660”! As most of us know, a negative tax cut is an increase. So what’s this chart about? It is a complex, double-sided X-axis chart. Positive X values show incomes, negative X values show “tax cuts.” Both values couldn’t be on the positive side, because the cuts would be dwarfed by income. Why not split it? <br> Charts have labels, titles and, in some form, numbers. Change any one and the information becomes wrong. To match language and data, the “Middle fifth” “tax cut” should have had positive numbers (otherwise, money disappears from your wallet). Those Americans earning $150,000 to $240,000 would have had a minus sign, however. Lucky they weren’t on the chart — or were they? <br> R.T. Furno, Silver Spring 
 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were plain wrong to skip their scheduled meeting with President Trump on Nov. 28 [“Schumer and Trump share the schmooze. Is it enough?,” front page, Nov. 29].  <br> Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi are representatives of the people. It is their obligation to go further to try to resolve issues of critical importance such as keeping the government funded, addressing major immigration matters and even discussing the Republican tax plan.  <br> I am sorry Mr. Trump’s tweets criticizing the pair were offensive, but the American people expect their representatives to act like grown-ups. The failure to attend this meeting is one clear example of why the approval rating for Congress is so low. <br> Wayland Marks, Fredericksburg 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> GARY COHN, a Trump administration cheerleader for tax reform, said recently that the administration is “trying to get rid of all of the loopholes and all of the deductions that mostly wealthy people use.” <br> Unfortunately, that is not the case. The administration tax plan does not target “all” of the deductions that mostly wealthy people use. It takes aim at one that wealthy people in mostly Democratic states use disproportionately — and leaves others hardly touched. Inasmuch as the plan contains any details on how it would pay for the tax cuts it envisions, the proposal stipulates that it would preserve two of the most expensive and wealth-favoring tax breaks: the deductions for home mortgage interest and for charitable giving. Still on the chopping block, however, is the state and local tax deduction, which helps taxpayers in high-tax states more than those in low-tax states. Eliminating it would wallop blue states such as California, New York and Illinois while leaving red states such as Texas relatively unscathed. <br> True, wealthy people reap most of the state and local tax-deduction benefits. But that is also true of the tax breaks the administration is protecting. The plan’s cynicism is transparent. <br> Mr. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, also told Bloomberg TV that the administration’s position is not set in stone. “We are willing to work with the tax writers on the other dials that we have in the system,” he said, indicating that lawmakers could find other ways of paying for tax-rate cuts. They might have to. Big blue states still have Republican lawmakers in the House who will fight to preserve the state and local tax deduction. Some swing states also have large numbers of people who take advantage of the tax break. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Capitol Hill Republicans are already looking for other options. <br> Republicans will be tempted to jettison all responsibility and simply enact a big, deficit-widening tax cut instead of trying to close anyone’s loopholes. That would be disastrous — for the economy, for future generations and for the credibility of the GOP, which has spent the past decade pretending to care about the national debt. <br> There is a fairer way, which would close loopholes without singling out one tax break, one area of the country or one set of wealthy people. Congress could limit the total value of the tax breaks — of any kind — that taxpayers can claim. Americans would still be able to deduct mortgage interest, charitable giving or state and local taxes from their taxable incomes. But they would face stricter limits on how much they could benefit overall from holes in the tax code. <br> This idea is not new, and it is not partisan. Mitt Romney and President Trump each proposed some form of this plan in the 2012 and 2016 presidential races, respectively. President Barack Obama advanced his own version during his second term. Depending on how lawmakers crafted it, the policy could raise huge amounts of money almost exclusively from the wealthy — across the country. <br> A deduction cap would also face political resistance. But it would be a fairer, more honest, more balanced policy than what the administration is peddling now. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> George F.

 How long are we going to pretend that President Trump is fully rational? How long are we going to ignore the signs that he is dangerously out of control? <br> Trump’s supporters comfort themselves with the idea that he’s being crazy like a fox — that all the outrageous lies, abrupt reversals, bizarre pronouncements and vicious personal attacks are calculated to achieve some rational goal. He’s just playing to his base, perhaps, or distracting everyone from unpopular legislation cutting taxes for the rich, or trying to deceive other world leaders into thinking he might be unhinged and therefore should be accommodated. <br> But what evidence is there of calculation? Congress may indeed pass a slapped-together tax bill, but there is no indication Trump even knows what’s in it. That would be his first and only significant legislative accomplishment. His approval rating plummeted after the inauguration and has been stuck at 40 percent or below since June, according to Gallup. He has managed to alienate our closest allies — even drawing a rare rebuke this week from British Prime Minister Theresa May — and created a vacuum in world leadership that China is happily beginning to fill. <br> The logical thing to do, at this point, would be to come up with a new strategy. But Trump stays his wild and erratic course, as if he simply cannot help himself. <br> The most alarming development is the revelation that Trump continues to entertain paranoid conspiracy theories of the kind usually found beneath tinfoil hats. According to both The Post and the New York Times, Trump still clings to the ridiculous “birther” theories about where former president Barack Obama was born. The papers also reported that Trump has privately claimed the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, in which he bragged about harassing and assaulting women, was somehow forged or doctored. <br> You will recall that Obama’s birth in Hawaii has been definitively proved; and also that Trump acknowledged the “Access Hollywood” tape when it surfaced last year and gave a video address apologizing for it. “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,” then-candidate Trump told the nation. <br> It would be one thing if Trump were broadcasting this nonsense for a reason. I’d feel better even if he had a nefarious reason — to appeal to racists who cannot accept the legitimacy of the first black president, say, or to encourage his base to doubt everything they see and hear in the media and instead to trust only him. But Trump has raised these off-the-wall subjects in private conversations with aides, associates and a sitting U.S. senator — settings in which the president is likely to say what he truly believes. <br> It is one thing to create a fantasyland for political ends — appealing to some voting group’s prejudices or giving supporters a reason to excuse bad behavior. It is another thing altogether, however, for Trump to fall into his own rabbit hole and actually believe what he once knew to be untrue. <br> For decades, when he was a publicity-seeking developer and social-climbing Manhattan playboy, Trump’s method was to fabricate his own reality; he even called gossip columnists and pretended to be a publicist named “John Miller” or “John Barron” in order to sing his own praises. But he employed this shtick with a wink and a smile, knowing it was all a game. Increasingly he sounds and acts as if he thinks his make-believe is real. <br> One of the things that first drew attention to Trump as a presidential candidate was his public speaking style — free association, basically, with no discernible filter between brain and lip. Follow one of his speeches and you can track how his mind works. On Monday, at a White House ceremony honoring Navajo code talkers, he bizarrely slipped in his “Pocahontas” slur against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who wasn’t there and had nothing to do with the event. On Wednesday, at a Missouri rally touting the tax bill, he came to a line about how it would add “rocket fuel” to the economy, paused a second, and then reprised his “rocket man” insult of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom Trump went on to call a “sick puppy.” <br> Kim’s state-controlled media has called Trump an “old lunatic.” That the rival nuclear-armed leaders speak the same language is not comforting. <br> Maybe Trump is rattled by the Great Reckoning on sexual harassment and assault. Maybe he is worried about the steamrolling Robert S. Mueller III investigation. Or maybe his mental state is just deteriorating. <br> Whatever the problem is, it’s serious — and it’s getting worse. <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 The legislative change proposed to the federal commuter transit benefit, while seemingly minor, would be devastating for our region’s transit riders, local transit providers and even those who choose to commute by car. As the Nov. 26 Commuter article “Commuter benefits could be squeezed by tax overhaul bills” noted, the House and Senate versions “would repeal a tax deduction for employers who provide parking or transit passes as a fringe benefit for their employees.” <br> Combined with a lower corporate tax rate, this repeal leaves little incentive for businesses to provide transit benefits. Roughly 90 percent of Virginia Railway Express passengers and 65 percent of Metro’s Virginia riders rely on the commuter transit benefit, as much as $260 per month per person, to pay all or part of their fares. Any change to the benefit program could mean a dramatic reduction in ridership and a significant increase in the number of cars on the region’s roads. And more congestion means negative effects on our local economy and the quality of life for our residents. Congress should leave the commuter tax benefit intact. <br> Katie Cristol, Arlington <br> The writer is vice chair of the Arlington County Board, co-chairman of the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission’s Legislative Committee and secretary of the Virginia Railway Express Operations Board. 
 What the Republicans are offering on taxes is a bad bargain for America’s future. They would borrow — roughly $1.5 trillion over a decade — to finance tax cuts that are pleasing for the present. Future Americans would pay the bill. There are at least three reasons why the Senate should reject its version of this self-serving deal. <br> First, it’s got the proper priorities reversed. What we need is a tax increase, not a tax cut. As almost everyone should know by now, the nation faces chronic budget deficits as far as the eye can see. In its latest estimates of the long-term budget outlook, the Congressional Budget Office puts it this way: <br> “Under current law, spending growth — driven by outlays for Social Security, the major health care programs, and net interest — is projected to outpace revenue growth.” <br> For fiscal 2017, the deficit totaled $666 billion, or 3.5 percent of the economy (gross domestic product). By 2030, according to the CBO’s long-term projections, the deficit will increase by nearly two-thirds as a share of GDP to roughly $1 trillion or more (in today’s dollars). <br> Just how much longer this can continue without provoking some sort of crisis is anyone’s guess. To be fair, and given all the inevitable uncertainties, the CBO’s projections are likely to be wrong — but the error could be an underestimate of the deficit, rather than an overestimate. Why? The projections assume that defense and other discretionary spending decline to near post-World War II lows. These deep assumed cuts may be politically impractical. <br> But wait, say Republicans: Our tax package — particularly the tax reduction from 35 percent to 20 percent on corporate profits — will increase economic growth, improving the budget outlook. Writing in Monday’s Wall Street Journal, nine respected conservative economists endorsed this position. The general argument is that the extra economic growth stimulated by the tax cut would pay for all or most of the $1.5 trillion in additional borrowing to finance the tax cut. <br> Among other economists, there is ample skepticism. A study by Moody’s Analytics concluded that neither the House nor the Senate tax plans “would materially increase long-run economic growth, but each would add significantly to the government’s deficits and debt load.” <br> Second, even if a tax cut represented good economic policy, the timing is wrong. The economy is at or near so-called “full employment” — which means that most people who want a job can find one. The unemployment rate is 4.1 percent. <br> Adding further “stimulus” to the economy now could boomerang. It could intensify inflationary pressures, forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten money and credit faster than is now expected to preempt a wage-price spiral. This could also trigger a confrontation between the Fed on the one side and the Trump White House and Republican Congress on the other. <br> If Republicans believe, as they say they do, in the potency of corporate tax-rate reductions for added economic growth, they should finance these reductions by ending other tax breaks or cutting spending. There should be no net increase in budget deficits; indeed, other taxes (a carbon tax?) should be gradually increased to help close the long-term gap between federal spending and taxes. <br> To close the budget gap also implies cuts in retirement benefits, which now dominate federal spending. But liberal Democrats have been as stubborn in protecting these benefits as Republicans have been in promoting tax cuts. Hence, the political and policy stalemate. <br> Finally — and this follows from the political paralysis — the Republican tax plans fail because they’re Republican. Not that everything Republican is automatically suspect. But if we’ve learned anything in the past few decades (and it’s not clear that we have), it’s that major economic and social legislation should have at least some bipartisan support. Otherwise, we get caught in a game of ceaseless disruption. One party enacts some of its agenda; then the other party, when it gains power, undoes or modifies the status quo. Uncertainty rises. <br> Of course, this is what politics is about, but what starts as normal can be taken to undesirable extremes — and that has happened to U.S. politics in recent decades. The search for consensus, cooperation and compromise has become increasingly futile. That is the story of the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) and other policies. If the Republicans succeed in overhauling the tax code, their handiwork could meet the same fate. <br> To avoid that, kill this legislation. It’s an easy call. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Marc A.

 Shortly after Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) was elected to the Senate in 2006, I found myself seated next to him at a dinner. Corker’s race against Harold Ford Jr. had included a Republican National Committee ad with ugly racial overtones, and I asked the new senator what he had learned about running against an African American opponent. <br> I can’t recall what Corker said, but I do remember what happened after: The next afternoon, my office phone rang. It was Corker on the line, no aide placing the call, saying he had been thinking about my question and felt he hadn’t given me a full enough answer. <br> This was, as it turned out, quintessential Corker, unassuming, thoughtful, decent and diligent. Which is why Corker’s announcement Tuesday that he would not seek a third term, while not exactly a surprise, was such a disappointment — especially coming, as it did, hours before racist homophobe and disgraced judge Roy Moore won the Alabama Republican primary for the Senate. <br> The Senate — and the Republican Party — needs more Bob Corkers, fewer Roy Moores. The trend line is not promising. <br> Certainly, Corker is no liberal squish — he is not even a moderate along the lines of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). You’re not going to find him casting a vote against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos or to save the Affordable Care Act or to expand background checks for gun buyers. <br> Yet in an era of virulent partisanship, he has been unwilling to cede the possibility of bipartisan cooperation, whether with Mark Warner (D-Va.) on housing finance reform or with Ben Cardin (D-Md.) to ensure a Senate role in approving the Iran nuclear deal. <br> Voluntarily relinquishing power is an alien concept in Washington, so Corker’s retirement announcement felt particularly jarring; he is not only an incumbent senator, but chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Yet Corker, 65, is not a traditional Washington creature. He came here saying he expected to serve just two terms, and flirted with leaving after one. <br> “I have always felt like I was a free agent,” he told me in a phone interview Thursday. “I have never felt particularly tied to electoral outcomes because I never expected to be here that long.” <br> So it is possible to misread or overinterpret Corker’s decision as a sign of the poisonous times, of frustration with the gridlocked legislative environment (although Corker freely admits to being as frustrated as the next senator) or about having to fend off a primary challenge (a notion that Corker summarily dismisses, noting that he had ample cash and had faced only “third-tier” challengers). <br> But to talk to Corker is also to get a glimmer of the excitement — perhaps even relief — he feels at being entirely liberated from political concerns, and of the role he can play in his remaining 15 months. <br> Speaking of the environment today where any incumbent who dares seek bipartisan compromise is in danger of being primaried from the party’s extreme flank, Corker said: “No matter what anybody says, you’re kind of held hostage, aren’t you? You get in a tough, tough primary and as principled as you are, it’s in the back of your mind.” At “the peak of my producing time here,” Corker said, “I didn’t want to do anything that would in any way take away from me making the most difference possible.” <br> One of those differences could involve the fate of tax reform, Republicans’ last best hope for a legislative win. Corker voted to proceed with a budget framework that allows for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts — but insists that he won’t agree to a final deal that adds to the deficit. <br> “Once the election occurred in November, it’s like a light switch went off and we went from caring about deficits to it being party time,” Corker said of fellow Republicans. “At the end of the day, if I think it adds one penny to the deficit, I’m not going to vote for it. . . . I’m going to lay on the railroad tracks and keep it from happening.” <br> The Senate will be worse off for Corker’s eventual departure. But his decision to leave may have the paradoxical effect of making it a better place over the 15 months that remain. <br> Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this: <br> Bob Corker: Congress should reject the bad Iran deal <br> George F.

 Walter Shaub is a senior director at the Campaign Legal Center. He previously served as director of the Office of Government Ethics. <br> The special counsel is facing the biggest test of his career. I’m referring not to Robert S.Mueller III but to Henry Kerner of the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), the small agency that investigates Hatch Act violations. That law prohibits executive branch employees from using their government positions to influence elections, which is precisely what presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway did last week. Whether Kerner will enforce the law is another matter. <br> When Conway appeared on“Fox and Friends” last Monday, it was clear she was doing so in an official capacity: One of the show’s hosts introduced her by her title and she articulated the administration’s views as she stood in front of the White House. In discussing whether the president has enough votes to get a tax bill through the Senate, Conway (without prompting) attacked Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Alabama. “And Doug Jones in Alabama?” she said, “Folks, don’t be fooled. He’ll be a vote against tax cuts. He’s weak on crime, weak on borders. He’s strong on raising your taxes. He’s terrible for property owners.” <br> Conway’s intent was clear enough already, but she decided to make it clearer. “I’m telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through,” she admitted. Playing down the sexual misconduct allegations against Jones’s Republican opponent Roy Moore, Conway added, “If the media were really concerned about all these allegations and that was what this was truly about with the Democrats, Al Franken would be on the ash heap of bygone, half-funny comedians.” After a startled “Fox and Friends” host pointed out that even the Republican National Committee had withdrawn support for Moore, Conway doubled down on her advocacy against Jones. “Nobody ever says his name, and they pretend he’s some kind of conservative Democrat, and he’s not,” she said. <br> Based on this obvious violation of the Hatch Act, the Campaign Legal Center (where I am a senior director) filed a complaint against Conway with the OSC. The White House has offered typical misdirection in response, asserting that Conway was innocently championing the president’s agenda. The question is not whether Conway was championing the agenda of the president — who, it’s worth noting, actively supports Moore — but whether she was advocating against Jones. Only in a world of alternative facts could Conway’s televised words amount to anything other than advocacy against Jones. <br> In short, the case against Conway is airtight. Or it would be, that is, if President Trump hadn’t appointed Kerner to lead the OSC. <br> Kerner comes from a conservative group called the Cause of Action Institute. When I served as director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), Cause of Action was the only organization that wrote to me in defense of Conway after she told Americans to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” The group claimed Conway was exempt from OGE’s ethics regulations and that OGE lacked authority to oversee the White House’s ethics program, despite four decades of White House compliance with OGE oversight and an example in OGE’s White House-approved regulations expressly highlighting their applicability to White House staff. <br> Kerner and his group also went after potential whistleblowers at the Environmental Protection Agency. Shortly after the incoming administration demanded that the Energy Department turn over lists of employees who had worked on climate change issues, a small group of EPA employees understandably feared for their jobs and used encrypted texts to forge networks for potential whistleblowing. Cause of Action sued the EPA for release of the texts, which would have revealed the names of the would-be whistleblowers to the Trump White House and its allies. That action alone should have disqualified Kerner from consideration for a position that makes him the federal government’s top guardian of whistleblowers. <br> But Kerner got the job anyway, and the Conway incident now presents him with as clear a violation of the Hatch Act as he’s likely to encounter during his five-year term. The trouble for Kerner is that Conway is close to his new boss, who notably sided with her the last time she violated ethics rules. Kerner criticized the last administration for its Hatch Act issues, saying that, “The law is clear: public officials paid by taxpayers cannot use their position to engage in political activities,” and “the Obama administration’s unprecedented history of Hatch Act violations threatens to undermine this important protection.” If Kerner plans to hold Trump’s administration to the same standard, he’ll have to issue a clear finding that Conway violated the Hatch Act. To do so, he’ll have to sign a letter asking Trump to take action against Conway. Kerner will have broad discretion in recommending a penalty because consequences for violating the Hatch Act range from a letter of reprimand to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 to suspension, termination or even debarment from federal employment for up to five years. <br> What happens to Conway will send an unmistakable message to the rest of the federal workforce about this administration’s commitment to enforcing the Hatch Act. Kerner asked for this thankless job, and he’s taken an oath to enforce the Hatch Act. His willingness to pursue this slam-dunk case will tell us whether he has any intention of fulfilling that oath. If he does seek to hold Conway accountable, his penalty recommendation will tell us how vigorously he intends to go about fulfilling that oath. We should all watch what Kerner does next. <br> Read more here: <br> Dana Milbank: How will this sexual assualt moment end?

 America is currently cursed, not only with tribal politics, but with tribal morality. Some liberals tend to minimize or excuse offenses against a few women in the broader cause of women’s rights. What is a politician’s wandering hand in comparison to maintaining legal abortion? Some conservatives tend to minimize or excuse offenses against women in the cause of conservative governance. What are a few old accusations compared to cementing a conservative Supreme Court or passing tax reform? <br> Both sides give personal failings less weight than a compelling public good. It is not always an unserious argument, but in this case, it is a cruel and dangerous one. <br> This description may sound like a columnist’s caricature. But, on occasion, a caricature becomes incarnate. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) has admitted she has “no reason to disbelieve” any of Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore’s accusers. Yet Ivey has announced she will vote for Moore anyway. “We need to have a Republican in the United States Senate,” she explained, “to vote on the things like Supreme Court justices.” <br> This is worth a pause. One of the accusers in this case says that in the late 1970s Moore, then a county prosecutor, offered to drive her home. Instead, she alleges, he parked behind the restaurant where she worked, touched her breasts, tried to pull off her shirt, grabbed her neck and pushed her head toward his crotch, leaving nasty bruises and a lifetime of trauma. The victim was 16 years old at the time. If Ivey truly believes this accusation, she is voting for someone who committed sexual assault on a teenage girl, in order to help secure one Senate vote on a prospective Supreme Court nominee. <br> This has the virtue, at least, of philosophic clarity. It is utilitarianism, unadorned. Ivey believes she is pursuing Jeremy Bentham’s imperative, achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of people. It is a simple, easily stated moral rule. <br> There are many varieties of utilitarianism, but they share some weaknesses. While the principle is easy to state, it is not easy to apply. It always involves speculative judgments about the future. What if, as a senator, Moore becomes a rolling scandal of misogyny and intolerance? What if this deepens the image of the GOP as the party of prejudice and male dominance? And what if this costs Republicans control of the House of Representatives and a few other Senate seats? How would this affect Ivey’s utilitarian calculation? <br> This scenario is not unlikely. During his recent defeat in the Virginia governor’s race, Ed Gillespie — a comparatively good GOP candidate — lost female voters by 22 percentage points. Is the three-ring spectacle of Roy Moore in the Senate going to improve Republican electoral performance with women? <br> But the main problem with utilitarian calculation in politics reaches deeper. By definition, it means that the rights of the few can be sacrificed to the interests of the many. It is a theory that has always been plagued by hypothetical questions: What if punishing a few innocent people would, on balance, have a good social result? What if keeping a few people in slavery clearly benefited the many? What if a politician who is currently abusing teenagers demonstrably served a greater public good? At what point does the “but he’ll vote right on Supreme Court nominees” argument end? Three rapes? Four murders? Wouldn’t utilitarian calculations still apply? <br> In the cases before us — if you believe the credible testimony of the accusers — the rights and dignity of women have already been violated. Ignoring or playing down those violations in the pursuit of other social goals — conservative or liberal — is an additional form of victimization, this time by the broader society. By politicians such as Ivey. By voters willing to downplay the abuses on their own ideological team. All are making the statement that some lives, when weighed in the balance, really don’t matter. <br> None of this is to make light of the difficult task of applying appropriate punishments for differing degrees of guilt. But various traditions of ethics rooted in religion — as well as the Enlightenment theories that informed America’s founding — place a primary emphasis on the rights and dignity of individuals protected against the shifting interests of the majority. <br> This is the firm moral ground upon which our debate on sexual harassment should be conducted. Political figures guilty of coercion, exploitation, dehumanization, cruelty and the abuse of power should not be trusted with power. Even on our own side. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more here: <br> Eugene Robinson: The only way to defeat Roy Moore <br> Ruth Marcus: The end of shame <br> Catherine Rampell: The GOP readies itself to welcome Roy Moore <br> Marc A.

 Does our country face a big problem with deficits? Is it a mistake to add to them? <br> House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) certainly thinks so. Or he used to. In 2010, he told Fortune magazine that the nation was “sleep-walking toward a debt crisis,” and he foresaw calamity on a grand scale. “Within a few years a sale of government bonds will fail,” he said. “The capital markets will go crazy, and the Fed and Treasury will run to Capitol Hill demanding a giant bailout.” Wow. <br> He offered much the same view in 2011. “We face a crushing burden of debt, which will take down our economy,” Ryan predicted. “It will lower our living standards.” <br> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also once seemed to think it ill-advised to enact a whopping corporate tax cut when the deficit is such an enormous challenge. He said so as recently as last December. <br> “I think this level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,” McConnell argued. “My preference on tax reform is that it be revenue neutral.” <br> Yes, McConnell really said “revenue neutral,” which usually means offsetting tax cuts with tax hikes elsewhere. He now says that miraculous economic growth will take care of everything. <br> One other thing McConnell used to believe: that it’s a bad idea to advance far-reaching initiatives on a partisan basis. In March 2009, the Republican leader said he had hoped that newly installed President Barack Obama “would govern more to the middle.” He assailed Democrats for instead intending to do as much as they could “on a strictly partisan basis.” <br> “The danger of that, politically, is they end up owning the whole thing,” McConnell said, warning of “blowback.” <br> This week or next, McConnell will be pressuring Republicans in the Senate to pass a sweeping, 515-page tax bill on, well, a strictly partisan basis. The radical bill would shift taxes away from corporations and the rich to regular folks and would increase the deficit by at least $1.4 trillion. <br> When it comes to the middle class, by the way, this proposal doesn’t even deserve to be called a tax cut. According to the Tax Policy Center, it would leave about half of taxpayers paying more by 2027. <br> Republicans are lying coming and going. They hold down the sticker price of the bill and minimize its impact on the deficit by having the middle-class tax cuts (but not the corporate reductions) expire. But they insist that future Congresses would keep the middle-class tax cuts in place. <br> So they are either lying about the deficit or misleading the middle class. <br> Ryan has already burnished his standing as a deficit hypocrite by pushing a comparable tax cut through the House. But don’t you worry. As soon as Republicans shovel every dollar they can to the people who pay their party’s bills, he’ll dust off those old the-sky-is-falling quotes and warn about the deficits he helped to bloat. He’ll tell us how urgent it is to slash Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and programs for the needy (although he’ll try to bamboozle us again by claiming to be only “reforming” them). <br> What can stop this duplicitous raid on the federal treasury? A mobilization at the grass roots that tries to muster some of the energy that went into saving Obamacare would be helpful. But in the end, the honor of the Republican Party is in the hands of a small number of senators. <br> Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona have said over and over that (unlike their two-faced leaders) they actually do care about the deficit, even where this tax-cut bill is concerned. If they don’t vote against it, they will be enrolling in the Ryan-McConnell Deficit Prevarication Association. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is as close as there is to a genuine moderate in the Senate GOP. Voting for this utterly immoderate scheme would mean tossing her moderate credentials into a bonfire. <br> But the man whose voice most needs to be heard is Arizona Sen. John McCain. Over the past few months, he really has been the conscience of the Senate. This summer, he gave a remarkable speech during the Obamacare debate in which he chided the party’s leadership for “asking us to swallow our doubts and force [the bill] past a unified opposition.” <br> “I don’t think that is going to work in the end,” he said, “and it probably shouldn’t.” <br> It definitely shouldn’t work on this Pay-Off-Our-Donors tax cut. More than anyone, McCain could give Corker, Flake and Collins the heart to follow their convictions. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> THE SENATE adjourned for its August break on Thursday, closing an unproductive half-year that underscored a fundamental truth about U.S. politics: The country cannot be governed from the fringes. If much is to get done — and there is much to do — compromise must occur. <br> Republicans’ unilateral effort to repeal Obamacare dominated Congress’s past several months. Even with the GOP holding majorities in both houses, Republican health-care proposals were too cruel and too unpopular, and the procedure congressional leaders used to try to jam them through were too reckless. Only a hard-core base of extreme Obamacare haters wanted Republican lawmakers to proceed. In the Senate, where broad popular opinion is more important than in the heavily gerrymandered House, the repeal effort narrowly failed, and it should have. <br> Republican leaders face a choice: They can continue trying to force right-wing policy on an unwilling country, or they can work with Democrats to solve problems both parties acknowledge. The path of compromise would diverge sharply from the nasty politics of the recent past. But that is the point: Congress’s recent record is abysmal. Here’s an alternative to-do list. <br> Following the collapse of repeal-and-replace, Congress will need to stabilize shaky health-care markets. One solid compromise proposal, from the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, is already on the table. Moderate senators are discussing deals of their own. The contours of a fair bargain are clear: a commitment to fully fund Obamacare programs and reinsurance in exchange for some regulatory reforms and added state flexibility. <br> Also on the must-do-soon list is raising the federal debt ceiling and funding the government — in time to prevent panic that the United States might default on its obligations. <br> Meantime, Republicans want to turn to tax reform. Good. The U.S. tax code is complex, distortional and internationally uncompetitive. Members of both parties have spoken for years about lowering tax rates, paid for by ending economically inefficient deductions, and bringing home income that U.S. companies have parked overseas. Passing a bill would be easier if Republicans focused on the corporate tax code rather than monkeying with personal tax rates. Democrats should be willing to work with the GOP as long as Republicans make their plan authentically revenue-neutral, not a stealth tax cut. <br> President Trump ran on a campaign to improve the nation’s infrastructure. Democrats share the goal. They should be open to innovative ways of paying for new roads, rails, wires and ports, including marshaling private funds, if Republicans are willing to raise public money, too. <br> On foreign affairs, Congress has already made some progress, passing a sanctions bill limiting Mr. Trump’s ability to bargain with Russia, a geopolitical foe for whom the president has a bizarre affection. In reasserting Congress’s prerogatives, lawmakers should also redraft the authorization for the use of military force that provides the legal basis for ongoing military operations against the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and others. Congress has not visited this issue since 2001, and the legal ground for continuing conflict is shaky. <br> Last week saw the introduction of a couple of immigration bills — but the mainstream, bipartisan compromise looks different, pairing enhanced border protection with a pathway for legal status for people currently in the country. <br> Finally, lawmakers must stand up for a democratic system under stress. They should stick with their Russia investigation, consider how to harden the nation’s voting procedures against future attack and continue to give special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the support he needs to complete his inquiry. <br> Republicans can blow off steam, or they can govern.

 Since Ronald Reagan’s rise to the White House in 1980, tax cuts have been the one issue that has unified all wings of the Republican Party. According to conservative legend, Reagan’s massive first-term tax cuts led to his 49-state landslide victory in 1984. GOP tradition also holds that George H.W. Bush’s convention declaration “Read my lips: No new taxes” pushed him toward the White House in 1988. Most Republicans are just as certain that Bush’s backing off that pledge finished his political career four years later. During his one term, Bush committed the mortal sin of raising taxes to control Washington’s exploding deficits. Conservatives never forgave him, but they did embrace his son a decade later for slashing taxes in 2001. <br> The political success that has followed past GOP tax cuts — and Bush’s record as the only president to lose his reelection bid since Jimmy Carter — may be why Republican presidents have been imbued with a blinding faith in any tax-cut plans crossing their desks. <br> And yet most Americans oppose the “big, beautiful” tax cuts President Trump and his GOP Congress are pushing through the Senate. Perhaps that’s because this is not the middle-class tax cut that Republicans say it is. The Tax Policy Center’s analysis of the Senate bill concludes it will ultimately lead to tax hikes for 50 percent of Americans. Most of those negatively affected will be middle-class Americans, and it will be the wealthy who benefit the most from the Trump plan. In fact, Trump and his family stand to gain more than $1 billion if the tax plan passes. If Alan Greenspan is correct that income inequality poses one of the gravest threats to American capitalism, then this tax package takes the economy in the wrong direction. <br> Even if America’s staggering income inequality means nothing to you, America’s exploding national debt should. That debt doubled from $5.8 trillion to $11.9 trillion under Republican George W. Bush. It nearly doubled again to almost $20 trillion under Democrat Barack Obama. And it is projected to explode to $30 trillion within the next decade. With Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid’s coming meltdowns making that fiscal crisis exponentially worse, real conservatives know that Washington just can’t afford to add another $2 trillion to our national debt. That is exactly what will happen if the Republican bill passes. <br> But creating big deficits is nothing new for the GOP. Since tax cutting became the favorite pastime for Reagan’s party, the Republicans’ fiscal record is nothing less than shameful. During Reagan’s two terms, the Gipper may have reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent, but defense spending exploded at the same time while Medicare coverage was expanded. Reagan’s policies nearly tripled the national debt. Under George W. Bush, it was more of the same. Bush slashed taxes, pushed through massive military increases to fund his Wilsonian foreign policy, and championed a $7 trillion expansion of Medicare. Again, not one difficult spending decision was made over eight years, and once again, the national debt skyrocketed under a Republican president. <br> Now the same conservatives who promised voters they would never again be as reckless as they were under Bush are repeating the same old cycle of big tax cuts, big spending increases and no fiscal restraint. As Maya Angelou said, when people show you who they are, believe them. And for four decades, the Republican Party has shown itself to be the party of reckless budgets, runaway deficits and exploding entitlement spending. Just because the GOP donor class is willing to overlook those glaring failures in exchange for a corporate tax cut doesn’t mean other voters will be so blind. This is another Republican tax plan that helps the rich, hurts the poor, increases inequality and blows a hole in the debt. It will also lead to more GOP losses at the polls next year. To the big-money donors driving this bill, all I can say is good luck with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. <br> Read more from Joe Scarborough’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Bruce Bartlett: I helped create the GOP tax myth.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> MICK MULVANEY, the phony deficit hawk President Trump tapped to oversee the nation’s budget, all but admitted on Sunday that the GOP tax plan currently before the Senate is built on fiction. Senators from whom the public should expect more — such as Susan Collins (R-Maine), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) — should finally denounce this nonsense. <br> Mr. Mulvaney, the head of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Republicans are trying to “game the system” by pretending that expensive tax cuts will expire in several years, arguing that the pretense is necessary to “shoehorn the bill into the rules” of the Senate. “A lot of this is a gimmick,” he said. <br> Yet those rules exist for a reason — to prevent senators from busting the federal budget. The Senate GOP bill would lower personal tax rates but schedule them to tick back up in future years. This maneuver cuts the plan’s nominal sticker price to $1.5 trillion. But Mr. Mulvaney and other Republicans reason that, once written into the law, Congress would not allow these provisions to sunset. So the Senate Republican tax plan would cost $1.5 trillion on paper — already too much — but a lot more in reality. <br> [It’s time for moderates to moderate the tax bill] <br> This is just one indication that the plan directly contradicts the specific promise Mr. Corker made to oppose any tax bill that would “add one penny” to the deficit, not to mention the general concern that other lawmakers have expressed about the nation’s deteriorating finances. <br> Mr. Mulvaney and many other Republicans argue that the bill’s tax cuts would spur economic growth, in turn increasing federal revenue, and therefore pay for themselves. No credible analysis substantiates this fantasy. But there are many that predict fiscal ruin. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center released one Monday. Assessing the House version of the plan and accounting for the economic growth its tax cuts would induce, the analysts found that growth would offset only about 12 percent of the plan’s cost over the first decade. After an initial economic boost, bigger deficits and rising interest rates would drag on the economy. <br> Attempting to brush away concerns about the numbers, Mr. Mulvaney said Sunday, “What you should really be looking at is the policies themselves. And we think these are excellent policies.” In fact, the Senate bill would load up on debt to provide upper-income tax breaks that no serious assessment would put on a list of national priorities. Curbing the estate tax, for example, would do little other than enrich well-off heirs. Though dropping the corporate tax rate could make the United States a somewhat more attractive place to do business, it is not worth adding substantially to the debt. <br> [And the biggest loser in the GOP’s tax plan is . . . humans] <br> This is a gut-check moment for any senator who has ever claimed to care about the debt. The Senate is on the verge of further burdening future generations that already face a big bill from decades of budgetary recklessness. The GOP tax bill is a charade. In case anyone thought otherwise, Mr. Mulvaney just confirmed it. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Republicans break their promise on tax reform <br> Catherine Rampell: Who wins biggest in the GOP tax plan?

 President Trump is making history at a historic level. He tells us this himself. <br> “Good morning,” he said at the start of his Cabinet meeting Monday. “We just returned from a historic, 12-day trip to Asia.” <br> We knew the trip would be historic because the White House announced in advance that it would be “very historic.” And the day after the president returned, he himself affirmed that it had indeed been “historic.” <br> This is not surprising, because, in Trump’s telling, his first trip was historic, too. He said so before the trip (“a trip with historic significance”), during the trip (“historic and unprecedented . . . very historic . . . a truly historic week for our country”) and after (“full of historic and unprecedented achievements . . . it was truly historic”). <br> Technically, either trip could be categorized as historical, in the sense that both occurred in the past. But in the sense of being moments of great and lasting importance? Well, consider that on his latest voyage, the president arguably got the most attention when he called the nuclear-armed leader of North Korea short and fat. Nixon-goes-to-China it wasn’t. <br> Yet there is something truly historic about Trump — his histrionics. He surely has no rival in trying to assert the historic nature of everything he does. A search of the White House website finds that the president and his team have declared their actions historic nearly 400 times in their first 10 months in office. <br> Trump has always asserted that he is the best and the greatest, but his attempts to write himself into the history books have truly been history-making. <br> Among the things Trump has called “historic”: His initiative on women’s entrepreneurship. Pulling out of the Paris climate-change agreement. Executive orders on whistleblowers, financial services and the Antiquities Act. His apprenticeship initiative. The Clemson football team’s 2016 season. And the launch of a ship named for Gerald Ford. <br> In his inaugural address, Trump declared his election the work “of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.” In his first address to Congress, he announced “a historic effort” to deregulate and said he would introduce “historic tax reform.” After 11 weeks on the job, Trump reported that he had “achieved historic progress.” At the 100-day mark, his “historic progress” included “historic steps to secure our border.” <br> He predicted that his first Cabinet meeting would be “a historic Cabinet meeting” — and it was, as measured by the volume of praise heaped on him by his subordinates. He boasted in June that he had secured “historic increases in military spending.” (He hadn’t.) At his last Cabinet meeting before Monday’s, he declared that his “historic tax plan” would have a “historic cut.” (It didn’t.) He announced “a historic immigration bill.” (We’re still waiting.) <br> Some things are more historic than others. When Congress missed its “historic” chance to repeal Obamacare, Trump’s executive order to undermine Obamacare was “truly historic.” <br> His approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and his executive action on energy were just plain historic, as were his historic actions on trade and his historic tax overhaul, and both the nomination and swearing in of Neil Gorsuch. But his executive orders on trade and his work for veterans were both “very historic.” Also “very historic” was his effort to “modernize critical IT systems.” But “there’s never been anything so historic” as the recent hurricanes, the handling of which earned Trump high grades — from himself. <br> Vice President Pence is making even more historic strides to see historic occasions everywhere. He labeled a roundtable discussion on health care “historic.” So was the swearing in of the labor secretary, the confirmation of the education secretary, the swearing in of the ambassador to Israel, Trump’s meetings with the Indian prime minister and the pope, Trump’s air traffic control proposals and events such as the National Summit on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, the “Northern Triangle Conference” and the “Adriatic Charter Summit.” Pence even knows that Trump’s yet-to-be-announced infrastructure spending “will be historic.” <br> Other White House officials have given “historic” designations to things such as the Congressional Picnic; HR 1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017; and HR 1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform and Accountability Act. <br> “Historic pace.” “Historic accomplishments.” “Historic visit.” “Historic gathering.” “Historic day.” “Historic act.” “Historic event.” “Historic speech.” <br> What actually is historic about this first year of the Trump presidency will be left to the historians. But so far, Trump’s actual achievements have been few. What seems most historic about this moment: <br> Trump’s hysterics. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 NEW YORK <br> This city’s annual gridlock festival, otherwise known as the U.N.General Assembly, is a proper metaphor for the United States’ current state of affairs. <br> While Manhattan’s already snarled streets filled beyond capacity with limos toting dignitaries, a quieter, less-theatrical group of thinkers and leaders was meeting to discuss strategies for a rising new political center. <br> The Sunday event was the inaugural “Ideas Summit” of the New Center, the policy arm of No Labels, an organization dedicated to restoring bipartisanship and a centrist governing philosophy in Washington. Organizers presented their first policy book with solutions to “re-center America.” And about 100 politicians, financial backers and others convened to hear former British prime minister Tony Blair in a conversation with Joe Lieberman,a former U.S. senator from Connecticut and a No Labels co-chair, about the dire need to counter partisan ideology and the concerning global rise of strongman leadership. (Disclosure: I moderated.) <br> If such a gathering seems vaguely Third-Way-ish in a “This Is Us,” you-need-a-hug sort of way, it is also a serious attempt by serious people to give Blair’s “politically homeless” a place to land and from which to lead. <br> “If we can’t mobilize the center,” he said, “the consequences will be driven deep.” <br> Blair, who has been hitting the media and think-tank circuit hard this past week, isn’t new to the No Labels movement, which he finds compatible with his own push for progressive centrism in Britain, despite his status as something of a political pariah these days. In his spare time, he’s also pursuing Middle East peace through his namesake institute and recently offered proposals to reverse Brexit, which he considers a terrible mistake. <br> Lending his support to No Labels is also consistent with his view that the United States and Britain must work together to protect and advance our shared values. On Sunday, he noted as hopeful signs the recent election of centrist French President Emmanuel Macron and the likely reelection next week of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. <br> Contrary to early criticism of No Labels as a front for right-leaning 1-percenters, and its predicted failure, the group’s composition and much of what it proposes are very much in the middle of the muddle. Successful by most measures, the organization has about 15 staffers and, importantly, a group of committed financiers who can underwrite political campaigns in the absence of party support. There’s also a “Problem Solvers” caucus of 43 members of Congress who have committed to work for solutions rather than political points. <br> Going forward, the New Center is building a website that will aggregate news and commentary, call out those on both sides whose bias is showing, and offer a “fact-checking” operation that includes crying foul when context is manipulated. Just last week, caucus members visited the White House to share ideas with President Trump, who recently has shown signs of cooperative behavior, notwithstanding his U.N. shout-out to “Rocket Man” (Kim Jong Un) and his open threat to destroy North Korea. <br> Although the New Center policy book offers no foreign policy counsel, Blair did note that Trump’s tweets and nicknames for others, though entertaining, probably aren’t helpful. Which is a very grown-up way of putting things — and precisely the way I would characterize this rather Mother and Father (not mom and dad) group. Mature, practical and a little bit (refreshingly) boring, the centrist crowd doesn’t mind being gruff at times (“Call laziness what it is”) but also recognizes the need to help the unemployed or unemployable find a place within a globalized economy. <br> On the domestic front, inclusiveness means helping people not only get jobs but also relocate to where the jobs are. Greater equality also means taxing all income equally, including profits from capital gains and dividends. <br> One of the group’s more ambitious ideas, which also has been suggested by Republicans on Capitol Hill, combines tax reform with infrastructure. Suffice to say, tax reforms that beckon American businesses to return to the United States would not only create jobs but also produce income to pay for infrastructure, which would beget more jobs and more income, thus stimulating the larger economy. <br> President Barack Obama leaned — and Trump is leaning — toward this idea, which smacks of something like cooperation. Problem-solving, said Blair, needs to be seen again as “winning” and cooperation should be rightfully understood as a powerful force. <br> But, I asked, can centrism really become a movement? Does it need a party? <br> Said Lieberman: “There’s nothing in the Constitution that says we have to have a two-party system. We can do whatever we want.” <br> Indeed, we can. <br> Read more from Kathleen Parker’s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Radical centrism dominates in France <br> Fareed Zakaria: The political center holds — barely <br> Neera Tanden and Matt Browne: American progressives and Macron <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the president says will be the largest tax cut in history for the middle class — except in Maryland, where nearly one-third will pay substantially more. One person from Maryland voted for it: Rep. Andy Harris (R). <br> The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has determined that 30.5 percent of Marylanders would pay substantially higher taxes under the Republican plan. The capping of deductions for state and local taxes would make this bill onerous to Maryland residents. The removal of the tax deduction for student loan interest is mean-spirited and anti-education. <br> Mr. Harris won by 39 points last year, so maybe he feels immune to the concerns of state citizens. <br> Mr. Harris is doing tremendous harm to the middle-class citizens of Maryland. How many Marylanders voted Republican in the last election expecting a tax cut? Well, about 31 percent can expect an increase — an average of $2,350 — on their federal taxes next year instead. <br> Thomas J. Snyder, Baltimore 
 Thanks to Ruth Marcus for her Nov. 12 op-ed, “Roy Moore and the art of the cowardly dodge.” In it, she asked what I and many women and men have been asking: If some Republicans believe the allegations of sexual improprieties against Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore are credible, why not those against President Trump? <br> Mr. Trump admitted what he does to women. Women came forward to describe Mr. Trump’s behavior with them. Shame on the Republican leadership for not believing them and doing something about it. <br> It is clear to me that the Republican leadership believes women when it is convenient for them and their politics. <br> Roberta Avila, Biloxi, Miss. 
 In his Nov. 13 op-ed, “Why tax breaks don’t die,” Robert J. Samuelson cited a study as proof that a cap on mortgage interest deduction would not significantly affect homeownership. While this is true in the short term, it is not the entire story. When Denmark reformed its mortgage deduction in the 1980s, although homeownership did not decline, the study indicated that “long-run effects on housing demand are quite sizeable” and that “significant effects on home size and home value” also occurred. The study showed that demand for housing was reduced because “reduction in the subsidy will induce homeowners to reduce total interest expenses by up to 20%,” which in the long run will cause homeowners to “reduce the square footage and value of their houses.” <br> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> If the mortgage deduction is capped, U.S. homeowners will see a significant deflation of property values, which will have the effect of reducing the overall wealth of many middle-class Americans, since home equity is a mainstay of middle-class wealth building. Because Danes rely more on a robust and ubiquitous private and government pension scheme, the outcome would be direr than predicted in the study. <br> </span> </span>Poul Hertel, Alexandria 
 Corporations are people, my friend. Both Mitt Romney and the Supreme Court told us so years ago. <br> Still, they left out one key fact: It’s way better to be a corporate-person than a person-person. At least when Republicans are reshaping the tax code. <br> Republicans love cutting taxes. They’d cut all the taxes in the world if they could. But the rules that allow senators to pass their tax agenda with only 51 votes require setting priorities for who gets the most generous cuts, or any cuts at all. This week, the party made its top priority abundantly clear. <br> It chose corporations. By a long shot. <br> Both the House tax bill — which passed handily Thursday — and the Senate version are heavily weighted toward business. Both bills would slash rates on regular corporate profits, “pass-through” business income (currently taxed at regular individual rates) and overseas profits that get repatriated. They also provide other tax breaks for companies, such as allowing full and immediate expensing for qualified investments. <br> Of course, Republican lawmakers and administration officials promise that these corporate giveaways will really, truly, honest-to-goodness primarily benefit us regular humans, especially humans in the middle class. <br> That’s because, they claim, corporate tax cuts will unleash a wave of business investment and therefore economic growth, most of which will trickle down to the little people-people. <br> It’s hard to find an independent economist who buys this. Even corporate executives won’t back up this story. <br> At the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council meeting this week, a Journal editor asked audience members to raise their hands if their companies planned to invest more should the tax legislation pass. Only a smattering of hands went up. <br> Gary Cohn, the director of President Trump’s National Economic Council, looked out at the crowd with surprise. <br> “Why aren’t the other hands up?” he said, laughing a bit. <br> This was no one-off embarrassment. A survey of 300 companies this summer similarly found that a tax holiday on the repatriation of overseas profits was more likely to lead to share buybacks, mergers and paying down debt than investment and hiring. <br> It gets worse. The Senate plan isn’t just more generous to companies than it is to individuals. It effectively takes from low- and middle-income individuals to give to corporations. <br> The Senate bill makes the corporate rate cuts permanent. Which is expensive. So expensive, in fact, that the cuts would cause the bill to run afoul of those rules that allow passage with a simple majority vote. <br> Senate Republicans came up with a solution, however. To offset the cost of those corporate cuts, they did a few things that hurt individuals. <br> First, they decided to “sunset” — that is, make temporary — nearly all of the goodies for households, such as the doubling of the standard deduction and expanding of the child tax credit, in their bill. Further, they changed the way that individual tax brackets are calculated so that households move into higher marginal rates more quickly than they do under current law.   <br> Finally, they added the repeal of the individual health-insurance mandate, which would have the not-very-intuitive effect of reducing tax subsidies for lower- and middle-income Americans, some of whom will cease buying health insurance without the mandate. <br> The net result of these changes: Over time, fewer American households get tax cuts. In fact, as of 2021, households making $10,000 to $30,000 would see their taxes go up on average, according to a report released Thursday by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s nonpartisan internal analysis shop. <br> And, by 2027, every income group under $75,000 would experience tax increases, on average, relative to what they would pay if Congress left the law unchanged. <br> This doesn’t even account for other effects of repealing the individual mandate that would also hurt many human-persons. Premiums, for instance, would spike, as healthier and younger people dropped out of individual insurance pools. <br> Nor does it include the fact that passing tax cuts this year would trigger automatic cuts to Medicare starting in January. Not a decade from now, or five years from now, but January. Overriding these cuts would require 60 votes in the Senate. <br> Perhaps because the legislative process has been so rushed, many senators don’t appear to even know that these cuts are in the offing. Even so, when given the opportunity to vote for an amendment explicitly ruling out cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid if their tax bill blows a hole in the budget, Republicans voted no Wednesday. <br> Person-persons, rather than corporate-persons, may still be the ones who vote. But they’re clearly not Republican lawmakers’ most prized constituents.  <br> Read more here: <br> Robert E.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> OF THE unparalleled advantages the United States has over other countries, its dynamic, well-funded system of colleges and universities is among the most significant, drawing talent from around the globe, educating future leaders and producing innovations that drive the modern economy. House Republicans on Thursday took an alarming step toward eroding this advantage. The assault on higher education is one of the less- examined unwise provisions in a tax bill full of unwise provisions. <br> Recognizing the importance of high-level teaching and research, generations of U.S. leaders have refrained from taxing elements of the country’s unique public-private system, and colleges and universities have built educational models around these breaks. For example, the graduate students who do much of the research and teaching at major universities often get their tuition waived, and they do not have to pay tax on that forgone tuition. This enables students who are not independently wealthy to pursue graduate education in science, engineering and other fields that will shape the future economy. <br> Many graduate students, who might receive only $20,000 in actual cash per year, could not cope if they suddenly had to pay income taxes on $50,000 of waived tuition. The best international students would no doubt look to attend graduate school outside the United States, preventing the country from attracting and keeping future innovators. No doubt some of the best American students would leave, too. <br> Yet this fate is exactly what the GOP tax bill the House approved Thursday would provoke in its provision insisting that graduate students treat tuition waivers as taxable income. Thankfully, this bad idea is absent from Senate Republicans’ tax bill. But the Senate bill contains other provisions that would undermine the nation’s colleges and universities. <br> Both bills would slap a 1.4 percent excise tax on investment income that universities earn on endowments that Republicans deem to be too large. Advocates for this change insist that rich universities should not take advantage of tax breaks in order to sit on ever-expanding piles of cash but rather should spend their resources on students. Reducing universities’ capability to pay for their operations — including student financial aid — hardly seems an effective way of doing this. In fact, though the provision would mainly hit elite institutions, they are generally the ones that offer the most tuition aid to students from needy — and even securely middle-class — families. <br> Over a decade, the endowment excise tax would raise nearly $3 billion, a relatively insignificant amount. Meanwhile, Republicans would either scale back or eliminate the estate tax, which would cost as much as $172 billion, an expensive giveaway that would help only the wealthiest of heirs. As an expression of GOP priorities, the trade-offs found in the GOP tax bills are repugnantly eloquent. <br> Some conservatives have in recent decades become increasingly leery of the country’s colleges and universities, caricaturing these centers of learning and invention as little more than radical left-wing safe spaces. Critiquing campus culture, particularly on questions of free speech, is legitimate. But financially undermining these institutions and their independence would be destructive to the future well-being of the nation. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> George F.

 The media has missed the real villainy in the various Republican tax proposals: territorial taxation, which would encourage the export of jobs and profits and give multinational corporations a competitive advantage over domestic companies. <br> The Paradise and Panama papers gave concrete examples of how these companies can create stateless income or shift profits to the lowest-tax countries. Territorial taxation is so important to multinational companies that they would trade the promised tax cut for territorial taxation. Look how quickly House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) dropped any constraints on shifting income in his original proposal. <br> If Republicans are serious about leveling the playing field and cutting the deficit, there are simple ways to do so. Eliminate deferral of taxes on foreign profits and go to a unitary accounting system. The multinationals would scream that this was unfair, but they have had the benefit of using those untaxed funds for years, so it is fair they pay now to help cut our deficit. And if we went to a unitary accounting system so that, for example, we only taxed multinationals’ profits based on the percentage of worldwide sales in the United States, we would collect a lot more from both U.S.-based and foreign multinationals. <br> The states have used similar systems for more than 100 years, so why not internationally? <br> Martin Lobel, Washington <br> The Nov. 13 Grade Point excerpt, “Republican tax plans place a target on the backs of colleges and universities,” was excellent and terrifying. The proponents of the tax bill want to cut taxes on the rich and take money from colleges and charities. I understand from the retired teachers’ groups I belong to that the tax bill could make it more difficult to raise funds for public schools by not giving a tax deduction for state and local taxes. Of course, we all know that state and local taxes are the primary means of support for public schools. <br> I’d like to know more about the effect on community colleges, because many people prepare for universities or get certified for vocational jobs there. Mechanization causes job loss. Education and training can prepare people to enter the workforce or retrain them if they have lost jobs or just want better jobs. <br> I like the idea of enrolling more low-income students and making colleges seem less frivolous. <br> Betty Daniel Dunn, McLean 
 The GOP bill that should be called the Cut Taxes on President Trump and Other Very Rich People Act of 2017 always had a secondary purpose: to jack up the deficit so Republicans could later cry out in horror, “Look at that awful debt!” They would then use the pools of red ink they created to justify deep cuts in social programs. <br> But people who call themselves conservative are shoveling out so much money so fast to corporations and the privileged that they needed some health-care cuts upfront — at the expense of coverage for millions of our less fortunate brothers and sisters. <br> And so on Tuesday, the Senate majority took an appalling bill and made it even more atrocious. To their ungainly concoction of tax breaks for the various interests that support them, they added the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. <br> According to the Congressional Budget Office, scrapping the mandate would reduce the number of Americans with health insurance by 13 million over a decade. To which the champions of redistributing money to the boardrooms and the yacht clubs say: Oh, goody! <br> This cutback in coverage would save the government $318 billion. The Republicans would use this money to pay part of the cost of making their corporate giveaways permanent, thus getting around budget rules. They also nudged up temporary personal income tax rate cuts and increased the child tax credit. The idea is to disguise just how much this bill tilts toward the wealthy. <br> It gets worse: The CBO says that ending the individual mandate would raise health insurance premiums by 10 percent — another way regular folks are being asked to cough up cash because of this bonanza for the well-heeled. <br> And while the child tax credit hike sounds good, it, too, helps the better-off more than lower-income Americans. Those who make less money can’t qualify for most of the new increase because they tend to pay little in income taxes (even as they often pay significant payroll taxes). <br> As Sharon Parrott of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted, “some 10 million children in low-income working families would get $75 or less.” On the other hand, she said in an interview, a “married couple with two children earning $500,000 would newly receive a full $4,000 child tax credit, even as many are getting additional tax cuts from other provisions.” <br> Then there is this sleight of hand: While the Senate bill makes the corporate tax cut permanent, it sets all the proposed reductions for individuals to expire at the end of 2025. This artificially decreases the short-term costs of the bill. If those tax cuts did expire, Americans in large numbers would eventually see their taxes go up under this deal. <br> Let’s take a step back and ponder the exceptional irresponsibility of what’s transpiring here. The same people who complained that more than a year of hearings, analysis and debate around Obamacare constituted “rushing” the bill are now recklessly spiriting through the system a gigantic piece of legislation that would touch all corners of the American economy. <br> They are changing it willy-nilly, day by day, to accommodate this or that political problem. They are rationalizing their thrown-together product with false claims about everything from whom it will benefit to how it will affect the long-term deficit. They are using a tax bill to punish their political enemies (people in high-tax blue states, major universities, low-income Americans) and reward their friends and donors (corporations and the very affluent). <br> And the allegations of outrageous past conduct by Roy Moore, their Senate candidate in Alabama, and the shifting stories about all things Russian from Attorney General Jeff Sessions are consuming so much media energy that these truly radical policies and procedural abuses are floating by with minimal public scrutiny. <br> We are told that there still are responsible Republicans. It’s to his credit that Sen. Ron Johnson (Wis.), usually a reliable conservative, came out against the bill, citing its corporate bias. Sens. Bob Corker (Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) have said they are concerned about the deficits this tax bill would create. Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) had the courage to block repeal of Obamacare. McCain has been especially eloquent about the need for “regular order.” <br> Well, responsible Republicans, your time has come. You have the power to say a loud no to cavalier, partisan legislating; no to budgetary folly; no to wrecking the health-care law; and no to a bill that would impose real sacrifice on your constituents down the road. Yes, you’ll enrage your colleagues. But history will treat you better. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Robert E. Rubin, a co-chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, was U.S. treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999. <br> The deficit-funded tax cuts advancing through Congress are a fiscal tragedy for which our country will pay a huge price over time. While the details of the tax plan remain in flux, its fundamental contours will not change. Nor will its $1.5 trillion of deficit funding, the amount stipulated in the recently passed budget resolution. <br> Perhaps it’s hopeless to expect those in Congress who have long bemoaned deficits and the debt to oppose the plan. If, however, as a matter of conscience or renewed reflection they decide to take heed, here are the fiscal dangers posed by the plan. <br> To start, the tax cuts will not increase growth and, given their fiscal effects, would likely have a significant and increasingly negative impact. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center’s latest report estimated that, over 10 years, the average increase in our growth rate would be roughly zero, counting the crowding out of private investment by increasing deficits but not counting other adverse effects of worsening our fiscal outlook. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, using the same approach, estimates virtually no increase in long-term growth. Goldman Sachs projects an increase of 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent in the first couple of years and an average increase over 10 years of just 0.05 percent per year, not counting any of the adverse fiscal effects. <br> These estimates reflect three underlying views held by mainstream economists. First, individual tax cuts will not materially induce people to work more. Second, corporate tax cuts will likely have limited effect on investment or decisions about where to locate business activity, given the many other variables at play. Third, deficit-funded tax cuts will have little short-term effect on growth, except perhaps for some temporary overheating, because we are at roughly full employment. <br> With no additional revenue from increased growth to offset the tax cuts’ cost, the publicly held debt of the federal government would increase by $1.5 trillion. An additional danger is that the actual deficit impact would be increased by abandoning the Congressional Budget Office’s nonpartisan evaluation that has been used for decades by both parties in favor of partisan calculations by those pushing the tax cuts. <br> Adding $1.5 trillion or more to the federal debt would make an already bad situation worse. A useful measure of our fiscal position is the ratio of publicly held government debt to economic output or gross domestic product, called the debt/GDP ratio. In 2000, the debt/GDP ratio was 32 percent. The ratio is now 77 percent. Looking forward, the CBO projects the debt/GDP ratio to be 91 percent in 2027 and 150 percent in 2047. After $1.5 trillion of deficit-funded tax cuts, those future ratios have been estimated to increase to roughly 97 percent in 2027 and 160 percent in 2047. These estimates likely substantially understate the worsening of our fiscal trajectory. That’s because they do not account for the increasingly adverse effect on growth of the difficult-to-quantify effects of fiscal deterioration. <br> Exacerbating our already unsustainable fiscal trajectory with these tax cuts would threaten growth in five respects. These are highly likely to be substantial and to increase over time. <br> </b>First, business confidence would likely be negatively affected by creating uncertainty about future policy and heightening concern about our political system’s ability to meet our economic policy challenges. <br> Second, our country’s resilience to deal with inevitable future economic and geopolitical emergencies, including the effects of climate change, would continue to decline. <br> Third, funds available for public investment, national security and defense spending — a professed concern of many tax-cut proponents — would continue to decline as debt rises, because of rising interest costs and the increased risk of borrowing to fund government activities. <br> Fourth, Treasury bond interest rates would be highly likely to increase over time because of increased demand for the supply of savings and increased concern about future imbalances. That, in turn, would raise private-sector interest rates, which could also increase due to widening spreads vs. Treasuries, further reflecting increased concern about future conditions. And even a limited increase in the debt/GDP ratio could focus attention on our fiscal trajectory’s long-ignored risks and trigger outsize increases in Treasury and private-sector interest rates. The ability to borrow in our own currency, and to print it through the Federal Reserve, may diminish these risks for a while, as might capital inflows from abroad. But these mitigating factors have their limits; at some point, unsound fiscal conditions almost surely would undermine our currency and debt markets. <br> Finally, at some unpredictable point, fiscal conditions — and these market dynamics — would likely be seen as sufficiently serious to cause severe market and economic destabilization. <br> We have an imperative need to address our unsustainable longer-term fiscal trajectory with sound economic policies. Few elected officials want to face this fact, but, at the very least, they should not make matters worse. We can only hope that responsible elected officials will prevent this irresponsible tax plan from being adopted. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: So much for the party of fiscal responsibility <br> Catherine Rampell: If the tax bill is so great, why does the GOP keep lying about it? <br> Robert J.

 The supposed price tag for the Republican tax bill is $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Republicans would have you believe that the measure would sprinkle enough magical growth dust throughout the economy to wipe out that cost. Don’t believe them, but also: Don’t believe for a moment that the bill would cost a mere — mere! — $1.5 trillion. Peel away the budget tricks and it becomes clear that the real price tag would be hundreds of billions of dollars higher. <br> Which is where “Fiddler on the Roof” comes in — specifically “Sunrise, Sunset.” What once was a schmaltzy ballad is now the blueprint for Republican tax gimmickry. <br> The House and Senate measures differ in details, but both play the same hide-the-cost games to disguise the real price — the House to the tune of $400 billion, the Senate clocking in at $515 billion, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. By the way, those numbers understate things, because they don’t include the cost of paying interest on the additional debt. <br> Some provisions have a “sunrise” — that is, they phase in over time. Of those, the priciest is the estate tax. To begin with, the House bill would merely — merely! — double the size of estates exempt from taxation, from $11 million per couple to $22 million. But beginning in 2024, the estate tax would be repealed entirely. <br> There is zero policy basis for this change. It serves only to display a lower price tag during the initial 10-year window and to mask the real long-term cost. Of the first-decade price tag of $172 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, all but $39 billion accrues in the second five years. <br> Next, “sunsets.” The opposite of delayed implementation is the pretense that a break once provided to taxpayers will ever be taken away. Thus the House measure hands out a $300-per-adult tax credit — but sets it to end after 2022, shaving $225 billion off what would have been the 10-year cost. The Senate sunsets most of its individual tax goodies — lower rates, doubling the standard deduction and child tax credit — after 2025, “saving” $240 billion. <br> These sunsets are one reason why many middle-income families whose tax bill would be lower at first would pay more by the end of the decade than if current law were to stay in place. <br> So either Republicans are lying when they say these taxpayers will be better off — or they are lying about the plan’s true cost. But of course there will be a clamor to make the cuts permanent — just as there was with the George W. Bush tax cuts, which played similar games, although not quite on this audacious scale. <br> Then there is the biggest gimmick of all — think of it not as sunrise or sunset but as an eclipse, obscuring a whopping $462 billion in deficit-financed cuts. That is the cost of assuming that the size of the tax cut should be measured by how it differs from current policy, not from current law, under which many tax breaks are set to expire. In the real world, they end up getting extended, year after year. They are supposed to sunset, but never do. <br> Yes, but, the cost of making these breaks permanent is not cost-free, as Republicans fantasize in telling themselves that the $1.5 trillion price tag they’ve allowed themselves isn’t really as big as it sounds. You can’t “disappear” extra spending, and tax breaks are spending. Think about it: Your weekly grocery budget is $100. You regularly spend $150 at the market. When you sit down to arrange your finances going forward, you’ve got a choice: Either cut back on the organic raspberries or acknowledge that you’re going to be spending $150 from now on. If so, you need to find some way to pay for — or borrow — that extra $50 a week. If you’re like the federal government and going into hock to afford the raspberries/tax cuts, your overall debt is going to be higher than you had planned. <br> The GOP’s games are even crazier than this, because its approach pads the baseline with tax breaks that have already expired or have been scheduled to phase down. In other words, they’re not current policy at all. <br> Sunrise, sunset, eclipse. These are music to tax-writers’ ears, because they allow them to cram a tax cut that will cost more than $2 trillion into a $1.5 trillion package and pretend it won’t really increase the debt. Lawmakers can fool themselves into believing this is fiscal responsibility. Don’t let them fool you, too. <br> Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: Who wins biggest in the GOP tax plan?

 In his Nov. 12 op-ed, “The new repeal-and-replace,” George F. Will said that the next “repeal-and-replace” target should be the tax code. <br> The current tax code has grown to an unwieldy muddle of revenue-collection and social-engineering functions that should be separated. If the people, through their representatives, see fit to subsidize child-bearing, homeownership, support of local governments or other charities, etc., they should issue a check to the deserving individuals under separate legislation. The amounts should not increase with individual income as they do under the current deduction scheme. If the overt payments would embarrass the proponents, so should the deductions. <br> Businesses should be free to conduct themselves without contortions needed to avert taxation; profits should be taxed only when they reach individuals (or are sent overseas). A single rate should be applied to all income; those deemed to be too poor to pay should receive an overt stipend. The rate should be set to balance revenue and spending, plus or minus a few percentage points depending on whether it is time to simulate the economy or to pay down the deficit. <br> Imagine the spending discipline that would follow if each year’s budget were announced as the (single) tax rate. <br> R.A. LeFande, Silesia <br> The Nov. 13 front-page article “Difficult decisions loom on tax cuts” mentioned that the Senate version of the GOP tax bill would add $1.5 trillion to the debt. Just to be clear, that $1.5 trillion is in addition to the already humongous deficit spending that is baked in the cake with existing spending and revenue projections. <br> When President Ronald Reagan’s tax-reduction package passed in 1981, the total U.S. public debt was about 25 percent of gross domestic product. The projection by the Congressional Budget Office is that the House tax-reform bill would result in public debt of 97.1 percent of gross domestic product in 10 years. <br> Then-Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) was a key figure in the passage of legislation that embodied supply-side economics: Federal revenue would increase after a tax cut because of rapid economic growth. When the deficit instead increased in the wake of the Reagan tax cuts, Kemp said he did not “worship at the shrine of a balanced budget.” <br> Given the current full-speed-ahead attitude of the Republicans in Congress to cut taxes, an appropriate update of the Kemp quote should be: “Republicans now worship at the shrine of deficit spending.” <br> John Plashal, Great Falls 
 Never accuse Republicans of being uncreative. Once again, they’ve found an innovative way to punish the poor and simultaneously increase budget deficits — all with one nifty trick! <br> To pull off this impressive twofer, they would put every American applying for the earned-income tax credit (EITC) through a sort of mini-audit before getting their refund. This would both place huge new burdens on the working poor and divert scarce Internal Revenue Service resources away from other audit targets, such as big corporations, that offer a much higher return on investment. <br> For those not familiar, the EITC is basically a way to top up low- and moderate-income people’s pay through a tax refund, to give them a bigger payoff from working. <br> The EITC has an excellent track record both economically and politically. Lots of studies have found that it increases workforce participation, for example. Since its introduction in 1975, it has also received bipartisan support, given its dual purpose as both an anti-poverty and a pro-work program. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have overseen major EITC expansions. <br> Thanks to a combination of innocent mistakes and outright fraud, though, some EITC money is disbursed erroneously. And so in 2015 Congress passed a bipartisan law to improve the program’s integrity. The changes that went into effect this year include a several-week delay in issuing EITC refunds so the IRS can match basic documents such as W-2s and 1099s to tax filers’ reported income. <br> The IRS hasn’t yet analyzed the full effect of these changes, though early numbers look promising. <br> Before the full results are in, however, House Republicans have decided to do something far more drastic. <br> Sometime in the next few weeks, the House is expected to vote on the fiscal 2018 budget resolution, a procedural step that’s designed to pave the way for tax cuts. That’s gotten a fair amount of coverage, of course. Less publicized is troubling language in the budget resolution committee report, which proposes decreasing “improper” EITC payments by requiring verification of all income before benefits go out. <br> The language is vague but appears to refer to a Heritage Foundation proposal that would require the IRS to “fully verify income through a review of Form W-2, Form 1099, business licensing or registration, and relevant invoices” before dispensing any refunds. So, a mini-audit. <br> As noted in a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, conducting mini-audits of all 28 million EITC claimants would be an astonishingly laborious task, both for tax filers and for the IRS. <br> It would impose huge administrative burdens on low-income workers, many of whom cobble together a living through multiple jobs and part-time “gig economy” positions, from which they may not earn enough money to require a 1099. <br> At a time when Republicans are flogging tax simplification, this would make tax preparation infinitely more complicated. Unless, of course, the goal is to discourage poor people from applying for the EITC in the first place. <br> Even for those who persisted in applying for the refund, EITC payments might be delayed for many months, causing great hardship. The vast majority of recipients use their refund checks for rent, utilities, mortgage payments and other necessities, as well as to pay down debt. <br> But the proposal is more than just cruel. It’s also likely to cost the government a lot of money. <br> Recall that Republicans have been steadily cutting the IRS’s budget, which is a silly thing to do if you’re truly a fiscal conservative who believes in “law and order.” The IRS brings in far more money than it receives, particularly in its work going after tax cheats. <br> And cutting the IRS budget is an especially silly thing to do if you’re also giving the agency an enormous new mandate likely to crowd out other enforcement activities — including those that bring in much bigger paydays. <br> The amounts at stake in EITC audits are relatively small. Overclaim errors are often just a few hundred dollars, compared with the hundreds of thousands or even millions that can be recovered from deep-pocketed corporations and individuals. <br> Arguably the IRS already devotes too many resources to these small-potatoes cases; EITC audits represent about 39 percent of all individual income-tax audits, despite accounting for just 7 percent of additional taxes that audits find to be owed. <br> If Republicans actually cared about reducing EITC tax cheating, there are more effective and compassionate things they could pursue, such as regulating the fly-by-night unlicensed tax preparers responsible for a disproportionate share of EITC fraud. Both the Trump and Obama administrations have asked Congress for authority to do this, to no avail. <br> President Trump said he’d help America win again. He can start by persuading his fellow Republicans to ditch this lose-lose proposition. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump’s nifty plan to spend more and hurt poor people more — at the same time! <br> Jennifer Rubin: The argument for tax reform, not cuts <br> The Post’s View: How Republicans may break their promise that their tax plan won’t raise the debt <br> Robert J.

 Without nearly enough fanfare, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made history this week with a scant four words: “I believe the women.” <br> All across the United States, forks dropped, glasses shattered and knees wobbled as women turned to each other in astonishment. Wait. What? Did he say what I think he said? <br> Suddenly, McConnell, whose characteristic solemnity inspires envy in statues, suddenly became irresistibly magnetic. Admit it: You wanted to hug him. <br> The Kentuckian was responding to a reporter’s question about the alleged sexual misconduct of Roy Moore, the erstwhile “Ten Commandments judge” and aspiring U.S. senator from Alabama. Moore, as you surely know, has been accused of sexual misconduct by five women who claim that he groped, attempted to rape or otherwise made overtures when they were teens and he was in his 30s in the 1970s. <br> McConnell — who fought Moore’s candidacy even before the accusations — and several other Republicans have urged Moore to step aside before Alabama’s Dec. 12 special election, saying he is unfit to serve. Anyone who knows Moore will tell you that he won’t quit, while skeptics and loyalists shrug at the charges, saying they’re “politically motivated.” Shocking. As Bill Clinton can attest, ugly things tend to surface when people aspire to high places. Sadly, they’re often also true things, though it seems these days that one’s moral compass follows the needle of political affiliation. <br> This is why McConnell’s words were so stunning. Rather than try to ensure that Republicans keep the seat, he opted to do the right thing. It’s a shame we have to be surprised when this happens, but rare is the politician who is also a statesman. <br> In fairness, one observes that the man Moore allegedly was in those days may not be the same man today. As a society, we tend to believe that people can change and be forgiven for past transgressions, especially if they’ve led exemplary lives in the interim. But forgiveness requires that one confess and repent — and Moore has done neither. <br> His denial and steadfast refusal to step aside may be viewed in one of two ways. Either he’s innocent or he’s confident that his supporters don’t care if he is guilty. As in: That was a long time ago and that’s not the Roy Moore we know. Both scenarios could be true, though having lived in Alabama, I lean toward the latter scenario. In a state where Moore achieved hero status in some quarters for refusing a federal judge’s order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from his court building — and where good ol’ boys look out for each other — it’s much easier to blame the media’s “fake news” for Moore’s troubles than to be bedeviled by women with their cursed agendas. <br> Moore is threatening to sue The Post, which broke the story after a month-long investigation that included corroborating interviews with more than 30 people. On Monday, a fifth woman, Beverly Young Nelson, came forward with a detailed accusation of how Moore attempted to rape her in his car when she was 16. She claims Moore choked her and dumped her, crying, onto the pavement. He allegedly ordered her to keep quiet since no one would believe “just a child.” <br> Moore denies ever knowing Nelson, though this seems demonstrably false. Nelson produced her 1977 high school yearbook featuring an inscription by Moore. Apparently smitten by his inner muse, he wrote: “To a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas.” Could you maybe have said, “Congratulations and best of luck in the future”? <br> Moore’s pearls seem rather personal for someone unremembered. Then again, would-be poets in the South, especially those who favor themselves “ladies’ men,” have been known to indulge in inflated flattery. Had Moore been elderly at the time, one might have thought him merely dotty — a harmless hybrid of Don Juan and Don Quixote, tilting at maidens in a trance of romantic chivalry. <br> But Moore wasn’t elderly or dotty. And five women who didn’t know each other have shared similarly sickening memories. The Post stands by its exhaustively researched story. And anyone with common sense stands next to McConnell, whose words must have fallen like musical notes on the ears of the silenced. <br> We’ll never know with certainty what happened some 40 years ago. But in the future, McConnell’s stand surely will make a difference for other women who fear they will not be believed in similar circumstances. In the meantime, here’s an inscription for Moore’s yearbook: I have two words for you, and they’re not Merry Christmas. <br> Read more from Kathleen Parker’s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Mitch McConnell believes the women.

 The Paradise Papers — the trove of 13.4 million documents leaked largely from the files of Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm — detail the many ways the biggest corporations and richest individuals use tax havens to avoid taxes, obscure ownership and hide financial transactions. Reporters have only just begun to comb through the documents, but two things are already clear: First, Leona Helmsley was right when she famously said, “Only the little people pay taxes.” Second, the Republican tax bills are built around a very big and shameless lie. <br> The revelations show once again that the very wealthy of many countries — particularly the United States — and the largest global corporations don’t pay taxes like the rest of us. They use sophisticated law firms and accountants to set up shell companies, private trusts and other dodges to avoid high taxes. Millionaires and billionaires of all ideological stripes — reactionaries like the Koch brothers and Robert Mercer, major Republican donors like Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson, liberal donors like George Soros and Penny Pritzker, Trump officials like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and economic adviser Gary Cohn, Russian oligarchs like Leonid Mikhelson, celebrities like Bono and Madonna and even Queen Elizabeth II — use offshore companies, obscure ownership arrangements and elaborate trusts to avoid taxes. Global companies like Apple, Nike, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Uber avoid literally billions in taxes. <br> Accountability is a joke. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross misled Congress about his divestments while using a chain of Cayman Islands offshore fronts that obscured investments in Navigator Holdings, which invests in a shipping company with ties to a Russian oligarch under U.S. sanctions and with Vladi­mir Putin’s son-in law. Chief Executive Tim Cook told Congress that Apple doesn’t “stash money on a Caribbean island” even as the company was creating a new tax haven in an island in the English Channel. <br> The lost revenue is enormous. The largest corporations have booked an estimated $2.6 trillion — yes, trillion with a “t” — as if it were earned abroad, avoiding an estimated $752 billion in taxes. The FACT Coalition estimates that wealthy individuals avoid some $35 billion to $70 billion in taxes annually. “Little people” — largely the middle class and small businesses — are forced to make up the difference, either in higher taxes and fees or in reduced services. “Little people” drive over aged bridges and on potholed streets, take on debt to pay for college, endure aging water and sewage systems and more as the wealthy stash assets abroad to avoid high taxation. <br> What is unconscionable is that most of the tax dodges are legal. “Nothing here is necessarily illegal,” H. David Rosenbloom, an international tax lawyer at Caplin Drysdale and a former senior Treasury tax official, told Bloomberg News. “There’s nothing illegal about Americans having either an offshore account or an interest in an offshore company.” <br> Of course there isn’t. As the wealthy and the big corporations grow ever wealthier, they spend the money needed to change the rules. It’s a much better return on investment to write the laws to fit your needs than to have to risk breaking them. The dodges work. UBS reports that the wealth of billionaires grew 17 percent in 2016, from $5.1 trillion to $6 trillion. <br> As Thomas Frank wrote in the Guardian, these “tax havens are not a sideshow” to the global economy; “they are a central reality.” And that reality makes a mockery of the Republican case for their tax cuts. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reports that the most recent data from the IRS in 2012 shows that more than half of the foreign profits reported by all U.S. multinationals were booked in tax havens. Republicans insist that cutting taxes on the corporations and the wealthy will lead to more investment, more growth and more jobs. But the reality is that the rich and corporations already pay far less in taxes than anyone understands. There is nothing trickling down but more inequality and more burdens on the “little people.” <br> Not surprisingly, the Republican tax bills will foster, not shut down, tax havens. They would set up a territorial system under which it’s mostly money made in the United States that is subject to taxation. That will encourage any company that can afford an accountant and a post-office box in Bermuda to report their profits as earned abroad. In 2014, U.S.-controlled subsidiaries shamelessly reported earning profits of $96 billion in Bermuda, a country with a total GDP of $6 billion. While Republicans have called for a special tax on some companies that report excess profits abroad, the initial versions of that exempt the fossil fuel industry (e.g. the Koch brothers) and the financial services industry (e.g. Goldman Sachs and the big banks). There is also the thought of imposing a 10 percent tax rate on foreign profits going forward — providing a continued incentive to move jobs and report profits abroad, but even that is already under assault from the business lobby. <br> Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, has sensibly called on Congress to investigate before it legislates. Reform should start by exposing the various scams and dodges, rousing public ire to counter the lobbying weight of big business. Legislation could focus on shutting down the loopholes and cracking down on tax havens abroad. The first step would be to end “deferral” of taxes on profits reported abroad. <br> Instead, Republican plans give the biggest tax cuts to the already wealthy and expand the scope for corporate tax dodging abroad. Will the Paradise Papers lead legislators to pause and investigate? Not a chance. They are pushing ahead full tilt. Not for the economy, or for President Trump’s “forgotten” people. But because, as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) candidly stated last week, “The financial contributions will stop” if tax reform fails. Americans may have voted to “drain the swamp” in 2016, but neither the Trump administration nor the Republican-led Congress got the message. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 As David Von Drehle wrote in his Nov. 12 op-ed, “Democrats, cut the cheer,” Democrats should not let these most recent election results give them a false sense of inevitable success in next year’s very consequential midterm elections. In many ways, congressional Democrats have become even more passive bystanders over the past year. In both the health-care debate and now with Republicans’ push for tax cuts, Democrats have been quick with criticism but lacking in substantive alternative proposals to improve these flawed systems. I have even asked my Democratic congressman for specifics about tax reform he would propose or support but have yet to hear back. Are they really just defending a status quo about which many Americans are rightfully frustrated? <br> Remaining publicly devoid of solid alternatives and seemingly content to watch while Republicans squabble among themselves will not engender the type of voter support that Democrats will need to regain majority status in either the House or Senate. <br> Ken Pilkenton, Alexandria 
 Regarding the Oct. 30 front-page article “Setback clouds tax bill’s release”: <br> Where were the editors when the reporters slipped in a description of Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) as “bare-pated”? What did that have to do with Brady’s role in the Republican tax overhaul? Wasn’t this a sexist statement, a pompous word choice and needlessly offensive? <br> Edward Tabor, Bethesda 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> THE HOUSE Ways and Means Committee held a hearing to kick off Republican tax- reform efforts Thursday. There are many things that could go well — or not so well — now that the overhaul has begun. One thing Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) did right was to emphasize corporate reform; achieving a more efficient system of business taxation is both more feasible politically, and more necessary economically, than redoing the individual code. Witnesses from large and small corporations testified to the myriad competitive harms of dealing with a much higher tax rate than their international counterparts. <br> The two big things that could go wrong, however, have hardly been ruled out. The first would be lessened progressivity in the system; and Republicans seem bent on doing at least one big thing, eliminating the estate tax, that would shift more of the government-finance burden from the top of the wealth and income scale downward, for little or no economic-growth payoff. The second potential mistake would be to slash tax rates with no offsetting revenue enhancement, worsening the federal government’s already dire long-run fiscal imbalance. <br> That is the cardinal sin of President Trump’s one-page proposal, released last month, which also would worsen after-tax income distribution. In an interview with the Economist published May 11, Mr. Trump doubled down, breezily asserting that his unpaid-for tax cuts, mostly for the well-to-do and corporations, would “prime the pump” for greater economic growth. The day of the Ways and Means hearing, Vice President Pence promised that Mr. Trump would sign “the most consequential tax cut in American history.” <br> Fortunately, Republicans on Capitol Hill have not yet wavered on their view, first articulated by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s policy blueprint last year, that tax reform be “revenue-neutral,” meaning that any reductions in tax rates would have to be offset by the closing of loopholes, with no net increase in the deficit. This was the principle that governed the last successful comprehensive tax reform, under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, and adherence to it is one of the few ways this reform could retain any hope of being bipartisan like that one was. Even party-line passage in the Senate probably depends on it, given the arcana of reconciliation rules. Any tax-reform plan adopted in the current Congress will “have to be revenue-neutral,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. On CNBC on Thursday, Mr. Brady also insisted on a plan that can “break even” in the first 10 years. <br> Caveats apply. “Revenue-neutral” in GOP-speak still allows for a certain amount of “dynamic scoring” to take account of the estimated economic growth any legislation would supposedly generate. Still, coming as it did so soon after Mr. Trump’s comments to the Economist, GOP leaders’ restatement of the principle amounted to pushback against the president’s plan. This is one area, among many, where congressional Republicans must put distance between themselves and Mr. Trump if their legislative agenda is to be taken seriously. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jeffrey H.

 Invest more in people, not stuff. <br> That’s not a tip for achieving personal happiness. It’s a statement about economic growth. <br> Right now, much of the Republican tax agenda is geared toward incentivizing investments in physical capital. But that’s not where the country’s real deficit lies. What’s sorely lacking is human capital. <br> And if the Republican plan passes, that human capital deficit is likely to worsen. <br> Republicans in the House, Senate and White House argue that we need major corporate tax cuts to promote economic and employment growth. The mechanism goes something like this: If we lower taxes on returns to capital (i.e., corporate profits), then shareholders will make more capital available to businesses. With more capital available, businesses will be able to invest in more factories, robots, equipment, stores. And through that additional investment, more workers will get hired and wages will rise. <br> Huzzah, trickle-down at last! <br> Yeah. So here’s the thing. By many metrics, capital is already readily available. <br> Interest rates remain low by historical standards. In the most recent National Federation of Independent Business survey of small- and medium-size businesses, only 2 percent of firms said their borrowing needs aren’t being met. That’s tied with the all-time low. Long-term price-to-earnings ratios are at their highest level since the dot-com bubble, meaning equity financing is also quite cheap. And companies are sitting on mountains of cash. <br> None of this suggests that a lack of access to capital is holding back our economy. It suggests instead that Republicans’ proposed ginormous corporate tax cuts are a way to provide a windfall to investors and shareholders without changing any economic fundamentals. Or spurring hiring, for that matter. <br> What, then, might actually help grow the economy, and help workers in the process? <br> Skills, skills, skills. <br> Employers say they can’t find workers with the right skills. The average job vacancy now takes 30 business days to fill, according to a metric based on Labor Department data. That’s close to a record high. The National Federation of Independent Business survey likewise found that in October, more than half (52 percent) of companies reported few or no qualified applicants for positions they’re trying to fill. That’s also nearly an all-time high. <br> Worldwide comparisons also show that our workforce leaves something to be desired. <br> The United States is falling behind the rest of the developed world in education, and particularly postsecondary education. In 2000, we ranked among the top five countries in share of 25- to 34-year-olds who had completed postsecondary schooling, which covers anything from vocational programs to doctorates in advanced research. <br> Today, we’re 10th, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We also don’t seem to be building up skills in the right things. Less than a quarter of Americans age 25 to 64 with a bachelor’s degree or higher studied in a STEM field. That places us in 19th place among the 28 developed countries for which the OECD publishes data.  <br> In a recent report on skills, the OECD noted that the United States now specializes in “technologically advanced industries, particularly more complex business services and high-tech manufacturing.” But it emphasized that maintaining this success will be challenging given growing global competition and the fact that the “skills mix” of our population doesn’t match the requirements of these industries.  <br> The lesson here is that we need more Americans getting postsecondary education, not fewer. We need more Americans studying STEM, not fewer. And we need those Americans to go to high-quality postsecondary programs, not scammy ones. <br> There are policies available to help American workers invest in the right kinds of human capital. Unfortunately, they are virtually the opposite of everything that Republicans are pushing. <br> Take the House tax proposal. It contains a slew of provisions that would make going to college more expensive. It would end student loan interest deductions, for example. It would also require grad students to pay taxes on waived tuition, which would likely devastate the finances of thousands of STEM students living on meager stipends. <br> Their ability to remain in school or training is also unlikely to be helped by Republicans’ proposed cuts to, say, the National Science Foundation, whose grants help fund their graduate education and postdocs in the first place. <br> And budgets aside, the Trump administration is also making it easier for Americans to get hoodwinked into enrolling at educational institutions that sell inferior or even fraudulent products. The Education Department has done this by delaying or repealing regulations designed to promote quality and transparency in higher education, such as the gainful employment rule. <br> Republicans have shown a lot of love for business investment. Time to show a little more love for investment in the skills that are necessary to work, and grow the economy, in the 21st century. <br> Read more here: <br> Dana Milbank: Welcome to the new gilded age <br> Gladriel Shobe: GOP gets a big part of its tax plan backward <br> Elizabeth Warren: Plan puts rich donors ahead of working families <br> Lawrence H.

 Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, served as senior adviser for policy and strategy in the Clinton White House. Bruce Reed was assistant to President Bill Clinton for domestic policy. <br> When Bill Clinton won the White House 25 years ago this month, he rescued his party from its worst electoral drought in more than a century. Today, as Democrats wonder how we lost the heartland and Republicans wonder how their base lost its mind, both sides could look to Clinton’s 1992 playbook for clues on how to revive a flagging party’s fortunes. <br> Before turning to Clinton in 1992, Democrats had lost five of six presidential elections, twice in 49-state wipeouts. The party was left for dead after back-to-back-to-back landslide defeats in the 1980s. “There are three things Democrats must do to take back the White House,” Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) joked. “Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.” <br> Fortunately for Democrats, Clinton knew what to do. While both parties face different challenges a quarter-century later, those three things are still the road back: <br> Fix your party’s problems or you’ll never fix the country’s. Every party’s greatest enemy is denial. After a loss, party leaders rush to blame a candidate or circumstance, rather than owning up to more fundamental problems. Clinton knew that if Americans had rejected us in three straight landslides, we had only ourselves to blame. His agenda of welfare reform, community policing and tax relief for the forgotten middle class confronted head-on the problems that Democrats for too long had avoided — and Republicans had done nothing to solve. <br> The GOP has now lost the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections. Republicans control Congress and the White House but can’t govern because instead of confronting their party’s demons, they nominated an even bigger one. The GOP’s own postmortem of the 2012 election warned there was no future in bashing minorities and favoring corporations over the middle class. Donald Trump took that autopsy and turned the party into a walking corpse. Repealing Obamacare, ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and passing tax reform are such a struggle because they expose, rather than confront, Republicans’ Achilles heel. <br> Democrats had a good night Tuesday, but there is a lot of work yet to be done. If we want to be a majority party again, we must avoid our own forms of denial. Too often, our party succumbs to a recurring fallacy that voter turnout matters more than persuasion. Clinton knew that winning and governing required both. In 1992, he forged a personal connection with his base and a philosophical connection with undecided voters. When Ross Perot made 1992 a three-way race, some Clinton advisers urged a “34 percent solution” focused on Democratic turnout. Clinton chose instead to compete with Perot for swing voters and cruised to victory. Now, as then, sophisticated turnout models are no substitute for winning the argument. <br> Show Americans what you’re for. Clinton understood that ideas are the most underrated weapon in politics and the best chance a party has to change minds. He ran the wonkiest campaign in memory and made real solutions to real problems — sending young people to college in return for national service, rewarding work with the earned-income tax credit, steering capital to poor neighborhoods through community development banks — the test for his opponents. Attacking “the brain-dead politics of both parties,” he declared: “Americans know what we’re against. Let’s show them what we’re for.” <br> A quarter-century later, President Trump seems to be against everyone and everything. Republicans need to remember that whatever Americans may feel about how many National Football League players take a knee, they care far more whether their children can afford college or their employer will give them a raise. <br> In the Trump era of fake policy and fun-house mirrors, Democrats must be more focused than ever on real answers. Opposition parties talk about problems. A majority party has to make clear how it will solve them. <br> Leave no vote unturned. Clinton’s most remarkable political achievement was to transform America’s electoral map. He carried 32 states in 1992, more than the 31 states Democrats in the previous two decades had carried in five presidential defeats combined. He swept nine states no Democrat had won since 1964 and eight no Democrat has won since he left office. He prevailed in every age group and even split the rural vote, a breadth of support no Democrat since has matched. <br> Today, neither party may have the stomach for the long, hard grind of winning back the voters, states and regions it has lost. The party of Trump has retreated to its own private Alamo, with a base that doesn’t look like America and a strategy that depends on division, not addition. As a result, thoughtful Republicans and independents pine for a reasonable alternative. Yet instead of reaching out to the nearly 60 percent of Americans who disapprove of the president and may be looking for a new political home, Democrats are once again fighting over whether to purge one wing or frustrate the other. <br> Bill Clinton showed there is no such thing as an electoral lock: Candidates and parties choose whether to let themselves in or lock themselves out. Successful presidents and parties build enduring majorities, not energized minorities. That may seem a distant memory in these dark, polarized times, but like Clinton, both parties would be wise to believe America can still be a place called Hope. <br> Read more here: <br> E.J.

 We Americans are having the wrong debate. Almost all the arguing over the Trump administration’s proposed tax cut centers on two issues: Will the tax reduction stimulate faster economic growth? And is the proposal too generous toward the wealthy and too stingy toward the middle class and poor? <br> Interesting questions, to be sure — but mostly irrelevant to the nation’s long-term well-being. <br> The truth is that we can’t afford any tax reduction. We need higher, not lower, taxes. What we should be debating is the nature of new taxes (my choice: a carbon tax), how quickly (or slowly) they should be introduced and how much prudent spending cuts could shrink the magnitude of tax increases. <br> To put this slightly differently: Americans are under-taxed. We are under-taxed not in some principled and philosophical sense that there is an ideal level of taxation that we haven’t yet reached. We are under-taxed in a pragmatic and expedient way. For half a century, we haven’t covered our spending with revenue from taxes. <br> Of course, there are times when borrowing (that is, budget deficits) is unavoidable and desirable. Wars. Economic downturns. National emergencies. But our addiction to debt extends well beyond these exceptions. We have run deficits with strong economies and weak, with low inflation and high, and with favorable and unfavorable productivity gains. <br> Since 1961 — and I admit to having reported this fact before — federal budgets have been in surplus in only five years. And these surpluses have invariably coincided with long economic booms that swelled government tax revenue: 1969, following the long boom of the 1960s; and 1998 through 2001, reflecting the “tech boom” of the 1990s. <br> Otherwise, deficits have dominated. From 1990 to 2016, borrowing represented nearly 14 percent of annual federal spending, according to calculations made by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That’s one dollar of every seven. <br> Based on present policies, it’s doubtful that things will get much better. Aging baby boomers are inflating Social Security and Medicare spending. Pressures for more defense spending have probably been underestimated. The same may be true for many domestic discretionary programs. Even with these optimistic assumptions, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the budget deficit ($666 billion in 2017) will grow as a share of the economy. <br> We resist the discipline of balancing the budget, which is inherently unpopular. It’s what Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute calls “take-away politics.” Some programs would be cut; some taxes would be raised. Americans like big government. They just don’t like paying for it. <br> Borrowing is easier. It’s largely invisible to most Americans, creating the illusion of “something for nothing.” This liberates Republicans to peddle more tax cuts. Their tax cut would add $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years. A more realistic figure is $2.1 trillion, claims the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. <br> Democrats are little better. They advocate more entitlement spending, despite CBO’s estimate of $10 trillion in deficits under existing policies over the next decade. <br> The unspoken assumption that justifies big and continuous deficits is that — rhetoric to the contrary — they pose no serious danger to the economy. We can run deficits forever without suffering ill effects. <br> Excessive federal borrowing poses three theoretical dangers. First, it could raise interest rates and “crowd out” the private investment essential for higher living standards. Second, it could trigger a financial panic, if private investors would no longer buy Treasury securities except at exceptionally high interest rates. And finally, a large national debt could make it harder for the government to borrow heavily during a true crisis. <br> But none of these imagined calamities has yet occurred. Perhaps they never will. There is a theory that suggests just that. Global investors want so-called safe financial assets, it’s said, and U.S. Treasury securities are deemed “safe.” This global demand for Treasurys could sustain budget deficits (which produce more Treasurys) for years. <br> But this is a very dangerous gamble to make, because if it’s lost, the consequences could be catastrophic. At some point, the demand for safe assets may weaken. Or too many large deficits may make safe assets seem less safe. A responsible society would not test the limits of what’s doable and what isn’t. <br> But that’s not us. By now, it must be obvious: We are no longer responsible. The urgent need is to plug the huge gap between government spending and tax revenue.

 Republicans have one idea and one idea only: That we should cut taxes for the rich. The only thing that changes is the sales pitch. <br> And the latest pitch, offered by President Trump on Wednesday, is a bit of a doozy. <br> Back around 2012, when Mitt Romney was running for president, the pitch was that we wanted to encourage “job creators” (i.e., rich people) to work harder. Their taxes were so high that it simply wasn’t worth it for them to put in that marginal hour at the office, or to build that additional business. <br> The payoff would be too low, particularly relative to how much money they’d already accumulated. Why bother putting in the extra effort, even if that extra effort might create a job or higher wages for someone else? <br> Romney was a suitable spokesperson for this argument. He was, after all, a successful businessman who had built and grown lots of companies. He could make a credible case that if people like him were given the choice between working an extra hour and spending that hour golfing, the economy might benefit if he chose the office. <br> Today, of course, Trump can’t make the same argument with a straight face. <br> He and his plutocratic entourage have illustrated how many rich people add somewhere between zero and negative value to the world around them when they spend additional time “working.” <br> The more hours Betsy DeVos, Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr. devote to golfing and vacationing, the better. They’d do less damage that way. If anything, their working lives thus far make the case for higher marginal tax rates. <br> A slightly different trickle-down pitch (one Romney, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and other prominent Republicans have also made) has to do with capital formation. <br> If corporate income taxes and capital gains taxes fell, then shareholders would get to keep a higher portion of corporate profits. That means investors might be willing to offer more capital to businesses, and thereby help them expand — which could grow jobs and wages. <br> This, too, is a difficult argument to swallow, at least in the current economy. By nearly every available metric, firms are not exactly starved for capital. <br> Long-term price-to-earnings ratios are high. Corporations are sitting on mountains of cash that they can’t find good uses for. <br> Debt remains cheap, and businesses generally say they don’t need more of it. The most recent National Federation of Independent Business economic trends survey found that only 3 percent of small-business owners said they could not satisfy all their borrowing needs. That’s close to an all-time low. <br> Allowing a repatriation of profits held abroad through a tax holiday or a new, ultra-low corporate tax rate would likewise do little to stimulate corporate investment (or hiring). Last time we did that, the cash went mainly into stock buybacks. <br> Trump nonetheless alluded to this pitch in his Wednesday tax speech, which was, as expected, all bluster and few specifics. (An actual plan, like Godot, is always just around the corner.) <br> The bulk of Trump’s tax-cut speech, though, involved a relatively new pitch: an incoherent screed about trade. <br> “We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America, the America we love,” he proclaimed. <br> Trump essentially argued that U.S. taxes — and not, say, wages or other input costs — are driving firms to invest and hire abroad rather than here. But that argument would make sense only if the United States didn’t tax worldwide earnings, as we currently do. <br> If you’re an American company, it doesn’t matter if you manufacture here or in China; your worldwide profits are still taxed in America, at least at the point when you try to return money to shareholders. <br> Trump clearly knows this because he also complained about worldwide taxation in his speech. <br> Granted, there’s a lot of uninvested cash sitting abroad, not yet returned to shareholders, that corporations are not currently paying taxes on. But if those corporations brought that money home today to build a factory or hire more American workers, they could already deduct those costs and ultimately wipe out the tax bills on the income they brought back in. Regardless of what the tax rate is. <br> Every quarter Apple could always send less money to Ireland and build more facilities in the United States. U.S. corporate income-tax rates don’t change that calculation. <br> Not that any of this matters a whit to our Marketer in Chief. He’s seen the other sales pitches fall flat, so naturally he’d try to shoehorn an amorphous tax plan into his usual, all-purpose policy pitch: America good, foreigners bad, now give me what I want. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: The Trump administration’s magical thinking on taxes would bust the budget <br> The Post’s View: The Republican tax-reform plan isn’t reform at all <br> Charles Lane: This tax plan would throw Democrats into chaos <br> Robert J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Robert J. Samuelson’s Aug. 28 op-ed, “The truth about tax ‘reform,’ ” expressed concerns that the costs of today’s deficit spending by the government “would be transferred to future generations” and that increased government borrowing would lead to “crowding out of private investment.” <br> The public debt passed on to future generations will be offset by their holdings of Treasury securities issued to finance the debt. So the net burden will be zero. Future generations will owe the debt, but they also will own the debt. As Republican President Abraham Lincoln said in his 1864 message to Congress, “Men can readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves.” <br> While about one-third of our public debt  is owned by foreigners, that is a net benefit to the United States because such increased demand for Treasury securities raises their price and thus lowers the interest costs to the government and to the American taxpayer. If foreigners were to reduce their investment in Treasury securities, U.S. investors would increase their holdings, which we would owe to ourselves.  <br> “Crowding out” of private investment happens when government spending or taxing increases, regardless of whether the increases are financed by taxes or borrowing. <br> Francis X. Cavanaugh, Washington <br> The writer was chief executive of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board from 1986 to 1993 and an economist and federal debt manager at the Treasury Department from 1954 to 1986. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> REPUBLICANS ARGUE that they do not have to pay for the big tax cut they are proposing, because it will pay for itself. If they really believe that, they can prove their honesty and safeguard the nation’s financial health with one simple addition to their plan: a series of triggers that would automatically prevent it from busting the budget. <br> The tax scheme House Republicans released Thursday cuts corporate and individual taxes deeply without closing enough tax loopholes to offset the cost. The funding gap is a huge $1.5 trillion. For a party that has spent the better part of a decade ringing the alarm about big deficits, this is astonishingly hypocritical. For a nation with an already alarmingly high debt load, it is scary. <br> Republicans seek to absolve themselves by arguing that their plan actually would be fully paid for. It would jolt economic growth, they argue, which would result in a flood of new tax revenue. Independent analysts are rightly skeptical. No credible economic model and no reasonable reading of history suggests that such optimism is warranted. <br> If Republicans really believe that the experts are wrong, they can put their legislative language where their mouths are. They can allow their tax cuts to phase in only so long as the federal government meets revenue targets. If early cuts appear to produce economic growth and significant new federal tax income, more cuts could automatically kick in. Alternatively, most or all of the cuts could begin immediately, and some could be scaled back if the federal budget takes a big hit. The GOP plan calls for phasing out the estate tax over several years. At the least, that egregiously unnecessary measure could be canceled if the budget suffers from the rest of the tax plan. <br> Republicans might worry that uncertainty about future tax rates would blunt the boost cuts would give the economy. In this way, a trigger that would scale back tax cuts if they failed to produce results might essentially trigger itself. Yet such a trigger would only adjust a relatively small subset of the plan’s tax cuts, the remainder of which would be permanent; this effect, therefore, would not be large. Moreover, Republicans have yet another option: They could design a trigger that would close more unnecessary tax loopholes in case promised revenue does not appear, ensuring that the lower nominal tax rates they favor would not change. If the deficit rises under the GOP plan, additional limitations on tax subsidies that help wealthy people buy expensive houses could automatically phase in, for example. <br> If Republicans refuse to add this essential safeguard to their tax plan, it would be strong evidence they do not believe the story they are telling Americans about self-financing tax cuts. <br> Read more: <br> Ruth Marcus: Tax cuts are worse than unwarranted.

 Not since Philippe Petit stepped onto a wire surreptitiously rigged between the towers of the late, lamented World Trade Center in 1974 has there been a tightrope walk as perilous and as public as Ivanka Trump’s. <br> It’s hard enough trying to be Queen of Manhattan in the 21st century, when the fame factory of social media has scrambled the delicate balance of wealth, glamour and ambition required to wear the crown. Over the past year, Ivanka’s social climb has been further complicated by business woes, legal thickets and — most of all — her father’s snatching of the presidency, which has turned the Trump name to poison in chic society. <br> Those of us who don’t belong to Manhattan society (meaning nearly everyone) might wonder whether queens are necessary in the first place. But through reigns of terror and periods of grace, matriarchs have ruled for nearly 150 years over America’s island principality between the East River and the Hudson. Caroline Astor is often cited as the first Queen of Manhattan. The Gilded Age made overnight millionaires, but only Mrs. Astor could make a rich person into a socialite. Her guest list was law — at least until she met Alva Vanderbilt. <br> Alva, an Alabama native with the bearing of a linebacker, usurped Astor’s crown and raised the stakes for future queens. Where Astor reigned in passive silence from a divan raised above her ballroom floor, Vanderbilt was an activist monarch. She led suffrage rallies and organized pro-labor fundraising events (when she wasn’t summering at her Newport mansion, where even the driveway was Italian marble). But her greatest achievement may have been her daughter Consuelo, a slender beauty whom Alva forced to marry the Duke of Marlborough, forever infusing New York society with cosmopolitan worldliness and a bias in favor of the comely. <br> Since those days, presiding over Manhattan has been a balancing act: a queen must be famous and mysterious at the same time; scheming in private but serene in public; always busy but never tied down. The best of them — Babe Paley, Jackie Onassis — know everyone, yet remain somehow unknowable themselves. <br> All true of Ivanka, who appears to combine the grit of Vanderbilt with the swanlike elegance of Paley, of whom Truman Capote observed that her only flaw was her perfection. But perfection is a higher bar for a woman today than it was in Paley’s 1960s. Today’s Queen of Manhattan needs more than looks and money. She must be an entrepreneur, a TED-talker, a woke woman and a mother, climbing the best-dressed list even as she floats somehow above the world on a raised platform. <br> What this looks like in real time Trump demonstrated this week. A post to her Instagram feed (she has more than 4 million followers) showed her stretched out on a bed for story time, surrounded by her three perfect children. “I’m looking forward to visiting Japan, but sure will miss these three!” Queen Mommy chimed. The next we knew, she was smiling upon arrival halfway around the world, her sunglasses opaque, her bow-topped shoes entrancing. Then it was on to Toyko for a speech to the World Assembly for Women, where she dwelled on the importance of opening traditionally male-dominated occupations in science, technology, engineering and math. <br> “Female and minority participation in STEM fields is moving in the wrong direction,” the Visionary Queen observed, now clad in a pink suit that managed to be at once businesslike and flashy. Fashion websites and news websites tracked her moves with equal intensity — the former telling readers where to buy her outfits, the latter reporting that Ivanka would quickly return to the United States to take up the job of tax reform. <br> This is a long way from 1980s New York, with Nan Kempner and Pat Buckley trading sly jokes between graceful puffs on their cigarettes, and just as far from the glitz and ditz of a decade ago, starring Paris Hilton and Tinsley Mortimer. It’s a good fit for today’s Manhattan, except for one problem: The Trump name is like a curse throughout the realm. <br> Her apparel business has been buffeted by anti-Trump boycotts and scrutiny of her China ties. Her husband, Jared Kushner — the silent Ken to her Everything Barbie — is hampered by ethics watchdogs in his desperate attempt to bail out a family-owned skyscraper and at the same time under pressure from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. Adding insult to injury, her father is said to be blaming Kushner’s bad advice for some of his own worst decisions, egged on by Javanka-hating Svengali Stephen K. Bannon. <br> That’s a fine how-do-you-do from a father who knows, down deep, that he alone may keep Ivanka from the throne. “If she weren’t my daughter, it would be so much easier for her,” the president has said. That wasn’t always true, but it is now. <br> Read more from David Von Drehle’s archive. <br> Read more: <br> Catherine Rampell: Ivanka Trump has learned well from her father’s cons <br> Joe Scarborough: Ivanka and Jared, move back to New York <br> Dana Milbank: Ivanka Trump has noticed a new ‘level of viciousness’ <br> Eugene Robinson: Ivanka and Jared begin the plunge from grace <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Christine Emba is a Post opinions writer and editor. <br> “This story has been floating around on the Internet for a while” is a line that rarely inspires confidence. <br> Nevertheless, that’s how Sarah Huckabee Sanders kicked off Monday’s White House press briefing. The press secretary spent nearly five minutes reading from the lectern a lengthy and convoluted allegory about 10 reporters splitting a $100 bar tab, apparently to explain the logic behind the Republican tax plan. It was baffling. Later research by skeptical reporters revealed that the story has been circulating in and out of inboxes since at least 2003. It’s even been investigated by urban legend website Snopes.   <br> Not to be outdone in the “email forwards from an elderly uncle” department, Donald Trump Jr. the next day tweeted a picture of his 4-year-old daughter in a Halloween costume, ostensibly to illustrate the downsides of alternative economic systems. “I’m going to take half of Chloe’s candy tonight give it to some kid who sat at home. It’s never to [sic] early to teach her about socialism.” <br> That particular analogy has also been making its way around the Web for some time. Most recently, it appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s Prison Planet website the day before Trump Jr. tweeted his own version. Econ lessons from a Pizzagate truther’s viral video: trustworthy!  <br> And then, of course, there’s President Trump himself. The president appears to get all his news and policy advice from “Fox Friends,” a morning show that traffics in unsubstantiated rumor and echo-chamber thinking. On Twitter, he retweets bogus crime statistics and memes from alt-right message boards.   <br> We’re in the era of the chain-letter administration.  <br> Instead of justifying policy through facts and data (which are being deleted from government websites as we speak), the administration and its allies rely on viral stories and dubious parables to inform the public. And while allegory, anecdote and analogy can be useful in explaining complex policy issues, this administration uses them in all the worst ways.  <br> For one thing, the stories are often just wrong. In his tweet, Trump Jr. used the word “socialism” to describe being forced to share the fruits of your labor (broadly defined, considering how trick-or-treating works) with a stranger. Except, that’s not socialism. The term has a specific meaning: government control of the means of production and of the distribution of goods and services. It’s not the same thing as coerced sharing.   <br> Sanders’s bar tab analogy went similarly wide of the mark. Her tale was of a wealthy, generous beer drinker forced to abandon his nightly draft because of the loud complaints of his poor, overly entitled companions. But the story conveniently elided both the mathematics of income distribution and Trump’s original promise that tax reform would focus on helping the middle class rather than the wealthy.  <br> Of course, the point of these fables was never to provide an accurate explanation of policy issues. Rather, the Trump team uses chain-email fabulism to advance its own agenda and promote a skewed interpretation of reality.  <br> Trump Jr.’s socialism tweet is meant to darken the public perception of any sort of redistribution, associating it with stealing candy from babies rather than undergirding a functioning health insurance system or social-welfare programs to help the less fortunate. Sanders’s beer story was less an explanation of how taxation works than an attempt to garner sympathy for the wealthy. The end goal is to persuade anyone listening in from the middle class not to grumble when the tax cut for those in higher brackets is larger than for them.  <br> These stories would fall apart if anyone questioned their premise. The slightest bit of research would provide a more accurate explanation of how taxes and socialism work and poke holes in the misinformation issuing from the White House. But the success of these well-worn analogies relies upon and entrenches the lack of critical thinking that’s become all too common since Trump’s political career began.   <br> That’s what makes this brand of storytelling so pernicious — and what makes these tales seem more plausible than ever before.   <br> When all news is fake and all reporting is leaks and lies, people still need to be informed. That vacuum is filled by folk wisdom shared by family and friends, or rumors and information shortcuts circulated by those who seem as though they’re in the know. And there’s no reason to spend your own time searching for truth when you’ve been informed by a reputable-enough source who happens to confirm your biases perfectly.  <br> But the “wisdom” emanating from the White House these days comes from those who aren’t wise at all. That’s what your delete key is for. <br> Read more: <br> Susan Jacoby: In the Google age, knowledge (without clicking) still matters <br> Randall D.

 Regarding Harry Appelman’s Oct. 28 letter, “An unconstitutional tactic”: <br> Although the Supreme Court has upheld the right of boycott under the Constitution, it has not upheld this right in all circumstances. Thus, in the case of NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., the court upheld the right of African American citizens to boycott merchants in Port Gibson, Miss., who discriminated against them in violation of their 14th Amendment right to equal protection of the laws. However, this was a domestic case involving protection of constitutional rights where there was no valid countervailing law prohibiting such a boycott, and the court specifically noted that had there been such a law, its decision might have been different. <br> The Export Administration Act, which was amended in 1977 to prohibit boycotts against Israel, and the Ribicoff Amendment to the Tax Reform Act of 1976 have the same objective. <br> Congress made clear that it is the policy of the United States to make it unlawful for any U.S. company to participate in such boycotts. Congress created the Office of Antiboycott Compliance and provided for criminal and administrative penalties against any company violating these laws. <br> Because participation in an anti-Israel boycott is unlawful under federal law, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) executive order cooperates with the federal government and helps prevent Maryland companies from incurring penalties under federal law. People who oppose this law and its underlying policy are free to speak up against it and urge Congress to repeal it. <br> Norman D. Kline, Bethesda 
 President Trump has returned to the White House to be met by a tax-reform effort in crisis. He can get it back on track by embracing a solution that is obvious and equitable — and that ought to be easy. <br> “The boldest ideas for changing the nation’s tax code are either dead or on political life support,” the Wall Street Journal’s Richard Rubin reported Monday. “The clear winner, so far, is the status quo.” <br> That would be a disaster for the economy, of course. The nation’s high corporate tax rate leaves “stranded” abroad trillions of dollars in profits that could be repatriated and put to work here in business expansion or returned to shareholders via dividends or stock buybacks. A special repatriation window could be used to induce some of this money to return more quickly and create a revenue bump, but it would still be only a portion of what’s needed to finance tax reform and the investments in the military and infrastructure that Trump promised on the campaign trail. <br> One obvious answer is to raise the existing federal levy that makes the most sense to the most voters: the federal gas tax. Currently less than 19 cents a gallon (higher on diesel) and stuck there since 1993, the federal gas tax generates approximately $35 billion in revenue a year. This month, Trump told Bloomberg News that he is open to a tax reform package that hikes the federal gas tax. Good. In contrast to a “border adjustment tax” that few support and fewer understand, a hike in the federal gas tax could be easily explained to voters as the price of three distinct goals: infrastructure investments, the building of the Trump-promised 350-ship Navy and tax reform that ignites broad and sustained economic growth. <br> If a half-a-buck-a-gallon hike brought in $100 billion in revenue annually, it could be coupled with a cut in the corporate rate; repeal of the military-crippling sequester and a real increase in defense spending (especially on the Navy fleet); a dip in marginal income-tax rates; and, crucially, a boost in local infrastructure spending. <br> The naval buildup has to be devised and supervised by Congress and the president, just as federal tax policy must emerge from inside the Beltway. But there is no reason that, say, a third of any new gas tax revenue couldn’t immediately be returned to the counties of the United States on a per capita basis so local people could decide the local infrastructure needs that deserve priority. Enough of “shovel-ready” declarations from inside the Beltway. Send the infrastructure dollars to local people to spend. <br> Trump can sell a gas tax hike that does these things because it makes sense and because all drivers will pay it. A “rebuild the fleet” tax would have deep appeal even to those patriots who might otherwise reject raising any federal tax but who understand how damaging the Obama-era sequester has been to the ability of the United States to answer the calls upon it. <br> And, yes, it should be easy to do — if ideologues of both left and right are pushed aside for the common good. The corporate tax rate has to come down. The fleet has to expand. And everyone who drives anywhere in the United States knows that roads and bridges must be repaired, just as anyone who flies knows that some airports need work done yesterday. <br> Go with your gut, Mr. President, and push the GOP to get in the game. This isn’t that hard. Put some points on the domestic policy board and do so by kickoff of the NFL’s regular season (Sept. 7, for those who are wondering). If Congress has to stay in town and work through July and August, demand it do so. How many other Americans are doing exactly the same thing through the summer months? <br> Tax hikes are most accepted when they are understood by most and paid by all. With states such as California busy raising their marginal income-tax rates, there’s no risk of the U.S. tax system becoming regressive as a whole. The need to make sure everyone shoulders part of the lift to meet key national goals points to the gas tax. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Charles Krauthammer: Raise the gas tax.

 With President Trump flailing and even Republicans panning the GOP-controlled Congress, Democrats have begun a long-overdue debate about the party’s platform and strategy. Citizen movements and progressive political leaders such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are driving this debate. United in opposition to Trump’s reactionary agenda, they are calling on Democrats to embrace a bolder agenda for change. While many Beltway pundits warn against Democratic division, the party’s congressional leaders — Nancy Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer — understand that this has been a long time coming. <br> The “Better Deal” platform put forth by Senate Minority Leader Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Pelosi (Calif.) received justified gibes on its framing and language. But its premise was exactly right. As Schumer put it in the New York Times, “In the last two elections, Democrats, including in the Senate, failed to articulate a strong, bold economic program [and] failed to communicate our values to show that we were on the side of working people, not the special interests. We will not repeat the same mistake.” <br> The Better Deal essentially endorses the big debate about a reform agenda that has already begun inside and outside the Democratic Party. Democratic failure isn’t about Vladi­mir Putin or James B. Comey or Hillary Clinton’s emails. Since Barack Obama was elected in 2008, Democrats have lost the White House, both houses of Congress and about 1,000 state legislative seats. Republicans now have total control in a record 26 states. Clearly, a major debate about the party’s agenda, strategy and leadership is sorely needed. <br> Pelosi and Schumer are trying to corral this debate. Progressives such as Sanders (I-Vt.) and Warren (D-Mass.) and the Congressional Progressive Caucus are trying to expand it. But citizen movements are the ones truly driving it. <br> The first priority of these groups has been to stiffen the spines of Democrats and enforce unity in opposition to the right-wing agenda of Trump and the Republican Congress. The mobilization against the Republican health-care plan, which would have stripped millions of health care to pay for tax cuts for the few, included virtually the entire activist base of the party — unions, senior groups, women’s and civil rights groups, online activists such as MoveOn.org, grass-roots groups such as People’s Action, and more. They enforced Democratic unity while challenging Republicans in their offices and town-hall meetings. <br> The second priority has been to push Democrats and their agenda. Fight for $15 has pushed the plight of low-wage workers onto the national agenda. Black Lives Matter demonstrations forced Democrats to address police brutality and sentencing reform. Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice have led opposition to Republican efforts to roll back women’s right to control their bodies. The Rev. William Barber’s Moral Mondays movement in North Carolina provides a model of an interracial coalition fighting for political and economic reform. National Nurses United and former Sanders campaign activists have driven Medicare-for-all onto the national agenda. <br> The challenge hasn’t been limited to single-issue groups. The insurgent Sanders campaign has unleashed activist energy across the country. Sandernistas are running for party offices, challenging sitting legislators and pushing to rewrite state platforms. Warren, Sanders, Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) in the Senate and Keith Ellison (Minn.), Mark Pocan (Wis.), Raúl M. Grijalva (Ariz.) and Congressional Progressive Caucus members in the House have challenged the limits of the Democratic agenda on everything from antitrust policy to money in politics to breaking up Wall Street. <br> Now a broad collection of groups, the Millions of Jobs Coalition, has begun pushing Democrats to unite on a set of principles, detailed in House Concurrent Resolution 63 on how to rebuild America the right way. They demand public investment, not corporate giveaways, prioritize 21st-century clean-energy programs and jobs, want guarantees for racial and gender equity, would put the needs of disadvantaged rural and urban communities first, and call for enforcing “buy-American” and basic labor agreements to ensure that good American jobs are created. <br> Of course, Trump and Republicans still set the national agenda, with tax cuts and infrastructure being two possibilities. A broad coalition of more than 400 groups called Americans for Tax Fairness champions progressive tax reform that helps make the rich and corporations pay their fair share — a stance that enjoys overwhelming public approval. Similarly, activists will challenge Trump’s infrastructure plan, which appears to feature the worst forms of crony capitalism: “public private partnerships” that privatize highways and bridges and impose tolls on users; tax giveaways to companies stowing profits abroad. <br> Pelosi and Schumer have already embraced the $15 minimum wage, a $1 trillion public infrastructure agenda, an aggressive antitrust agenda and a balanced trade agenda that begins to unpack the corporate trade policies championed by Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama. But these battles on economic issues — as well as the continuing debate over social issues such as choice and money and politics — will continue to roil Democrats. Activists will fight to put Medicare for all, progressive tax reform and public infrastructure investment on that agenda. The debate about strategy, about money in politics, about the Wall Street wing of the party will grow ever more fierce. <br> Already Beltway voices are fretting about division, about Democrats shooting at one another, about the need for unity in order to win in 2018. But a fierce debate is unavoidable. The party establishment won’t change on its own, despite its remarkable record of consistent failure. The money wing of the party won’t cede its hold without a fight. Democratic leaders won’t see the light unless they feel the heat. <br> Establishment Democrats count on Trump’s grotesqueries to unify and mobilize Democrats. But if Hillary Clinton’s campaign taught us anything, it is that simple opposition or “resistance” to Trump is not enough. Democrats can’t even mobilize their own base to vote — particularly in off-year elections — unless they champion a bold program that offers a credible promise of change to the vast majority of Americans. Pelosi and Schumer have recognized that. The resulting debate is not only long-overdue, it is also utterly necessary if Democrats are to begin winning elections again. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Fareed Zakaria: The Democrats’ problem is not the economy, stupid <br> Jon Ossoff: Lessons for Democrats from the Georgia election <br> Joe Scarborough: Democrats will keep losing, unless they do this <br> Ronald A.

 It is a victory for Republicans that the political conversation — when it’s not being hijacked by President Trump’s assorted outbursts and outrages — is focused on tax cuts. No matter how critical the coverage gets, the sheer amount of attention risks sending a message that taxes are the most important issue confronting the country. <br> This is entirely wrong, and it’s essential to challenge the whole premise of the debate. The United States does not need tax cuts now. Reducing government revenue at this moment will do far more harm than good. Conservatives are proving definitively that they don’t care in the least about deficits. And their claims that tax cuts will unleash some sort of economic miracle have been proved false again and again and again. <br> But there is an even bigger objection: The opportunity costs of this obsession are enormous because it keeps us from grappling with the problems we really do need to solve. <br> Ever since Trump’s election, discussion of the vast divides in our nation between prosperous regions and those battered by economic change have filled our newspapers, websites and airwaves. There is simply no way that shoveling out $2.6 trillion in business tax cuts over 10 years (and in a largely undifferentiated fashion) does anything to help places that are ailing. <br> On the contrary, this farrago of corporate goodies — along with the absurd repeal of the estate tax and various other benefits showered on the well-off — would only aggravate existing inequalities. And by depleting the government’s coffers, it would make it much harder to finance public initiatives in education, job training and other spheres to promote mobility for Americans who are lagging behind. <br> This, by the way, is why ending the deductibility of state and local taxes is an especially bad idea. This provision punishes states with more progressive tax structures that ask their best-off citizens to ease the difficulties of their less fortunate neighbors. Shifting the incentives against states willing to spend money to remedy social ills is the not-so-hidden agenda of the anti-tax obsessives who support killing this deduction. They are trying to disable government at all levels by making it harder for states to call on their most affluent citizens to pay a little more of the common load. <br> There will be many other parts of this proposal to criticize, but that is not enough. It’s even more important to show how much damage this tax cut would do to programs we already have and initiatives we need. Democrats are already noting that the Republican budget pays for the tax cuts with, among other things, a $1 trillion reduction to Medicaid and nearly half that amount from Medicare. If Republicans can’t get their act together to destroy Obamacare, they will simply starve the health-care system, particularly for low-income Americans. <br> The tax cut shoves aside other priorities as well. Regional inequities are now so pervasive throughout the West that the Economist magazine — as friendly to lightly regulated capitalism as any publication — recently devoted its cover and a special report to steps we need to take to reduce the gap between rich and poor locales. “Opportunities are limited for those stuck in the wrong place,” the magazine wrote, “and the wider economy suffers.” All who care about saving liberal democracy should support a reformed market system that responds to the discontents of those now left out. <br> Meanwhile, as Dylan Matthews reported on Vox, Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) have introduced a bill that would dramatically expand the child tax credit to $3,600 a year per child for those age 0 to 5, and $3,000 a year for those 6 to 18. To direct the most assistance to the poor and the less affluent parts of the middle class, the credit begins gradually to phase out for incomes of single parents at $75,000 a year and married couples at $110,000. <br> The plan, Matthews writes, would cut child poverty in the country almost in half, from 16.1 to 8.9 percent. The cost: roughly $1 trillion over a decade, as against the $1.5 trillion Republicans claim would be the net price of their tax cuts after they are done shuffling the tax code around. <br> Which is the better expenditure? <br> That is the question that must be pressed relentlessly across a broad range of concerns. Just because the only thing Republicans know how to do is cut taxes doesn’t mean the rest of us have to pretend that this exercise makes any sense at all. <br> Read more from E.J.

 When Jeff Flake and Bob Corker turned their retirement announcements into fiery takedowns of the president, Democrats, Never Trumpers and pundits couldn’t get enough. <br> Alas, admiration is fickle thing. Just days later, many of those same cheerleaders have found cause to complain: that Corker is calculating, that Flake is giving up, that both should have taken action sooner. <br> The opprobrium should fall more heavily on Corker than on Flake. Donald Trump has been president for nine months, and he was flaunting his lack of character on the campaign trail for a year prior. The fact that Corker accompanied him for so long is troubling, to say the least. <br> Flake, in contrast, made his disapproval known early on. He publicized his anti-Trump stance enough to tank his own potential for reelection before withdrawing from the scene. <br> Even with that distinction drawn, some of the self-righteous disparagement could be put on hold. In fact, we should actually be celebrating something quite rare: a willingness to publicly rethink a position when it would be easier to just go along. <br> Doing so takes boldness, as a new book by Baylor University professor Alan Jacobs makes clear. In “How to Think,” Jacobs lays out the manifold reasons why it’s difficult — and these days quite unusual — for one to openly change one’s mind. The reasons for hesitation are genuine, even when the facts on the ground have undeniably changed. Or perhaps, in Corker’s case, when one’s understanding of the facts has finally caught up to what’s really going on. <br> An all-too-common reason for hesitation is the fallacy of sunk cost. In this case, both senators have given decades to the Republican Party — Corker first ran for Senate in 1994, and Flake started working for the Goldwater Institute, a conservative think tank, in 1992. Corker in particular has spent the past several months either defending or tacitly supporting Trump, simply by following the look-the-other-way script of his party’s leadership. <br> Allegiance is the price he paid for career advancement, or at least sustenance. But changing his mind and retiring now is like leaving money on the table. To those with noses upturned: It’s not as easy as it looks. <br> Another common reason for clinging to a bad stance is the threat of lost membership, the idea of alienation from a valued community. True, Flake now has a dependable excuse to skip what seems like an excruciating weekly policy lunch with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — congratulations, sir, on living your best life! But Flake’s slow-motion exile from the center to the outskirts has been sad to see. “There may not be a place for a Republican like me,” he wistfully told the Arizona Republic when announcing his plan not to run for reelection. Giving up the sense of identity, belonging and support that comes with being a senator and majority-party member of Washington’s elected elite must come at some psychic cost. <br> Yes, it may have taken standing down from reelection to liberate these two senators to speak their minds. But even if freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose, it’s still something worth celebrating. All but the most jaded critics should find something of value in Flake and Corker’s willingness to recognize and stand up for a greater good than the phantom prize of tax reform: that of a democracy with standards and an America with a conscience. <br> That said, these congratulations still remain conditional. Further lauding remains dependent on what the two senators choose to do next. Will Corker and Flake use the remaining months of their tenures for good? In a Senate chamber where the Republican majority remains knife-thin, well-considered conscience votes could prevent all manner of bad legislation. <br> But in the short term, demanding that the senators grovel and apologize for their past party alignment risks turning us into the closeminded, vengeful actors who brought our country to a stalling point in the first place. It is also a convenient way of forgetting our own mistaken beliefs. For months, Flake tried to speak to his party from within while Democrats derided him as hollow. And Corker wasn’t the only one who thought Trump might pivot, after all. <br> It’s time to extend at least a bit of credit: Flake and Corker are leading by example. In this polarized and mulishly unthinking period in our nation’s history, we should all be a little more open to changing our minds. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Michael Gerson: God bless all the anti-Trump Republicans <br> E.J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> WITH ALL the focus on health care, tax cuts and regulatory rollback, there has been little attention left for an idea of President Trump’s that might actually do some good: investing in the nation’s roads, bridges, rails and ports. As anyone who has sat in a traffic jam, languished on a delayed Metro train or struggled to navigate a crowded airport can tell you, more investment could enhance economic growth and Americans’ quality of life. Mr. Trump has signaled high ambitions, mentioning infrastructure in his otherwise dismal inaugural address and floating a $1 trillion building plan. <br> But promising everyone brand-new highways is easy. Paying for them is harder. The president’s plan would supposedly include $200 billion in public funding, with the balance coming from private funds. Even finding a couple hundred billion would be a tough lift. The country’s Highway Trust Fund should be adequately financed by the federal gasoline tax. Yet Congress has refused to raise the tax since 1993, and inflation erodes the value of the revenue it raises every year. Time after time, when the trust fund was in financial distress, Congress has used budget gimmicks and one-time money raisers to kick the problems down the road . <br> This is why it was surprising that Gary Cohn, one of Mr. Trump’s chief economic advisers, reportedly floated raising the gas tax in a recent meeting with members of Congress. The president himself expressed openness to increasing the tax in an April interview, saying he would consider an increase if the money went to highways. Apparently the idea is still on the table in the White House. <br> The news does not make a gas-tax hike likely. It would take a sustained, focused campaign from the Trump administration to make increasing the gas tax even a remote possibility in the GOP House. <br> This moment should not pass by, however, without noting that a gas-tax increase would be exactly the right policy. The gas tax has been a fairly efficient way of requiring that those who use the roads, particularly those who use them heavily, pay for them, rather than having society at large subsidize their way of life. Set high enough, the tax discourages excessive driving. People drive marginally fewer trips if their gasoline bills are a bit higher. They also tend to avoid buying larger cars and trucks, which take a bigger toll on public roads. As a side benefit, the gas tax can also account for and discourage some of the social costs associated with driving — traffic and air degradation, for example. Yet the tax has idled at 18.4 cents per gallon for a quarter-century. Faced with infrastructure spending needs, many states, including red ones, have recently upped their state-level gas taxes. A reasonable Congress would share their rationality. <br> Mr. Cohn’s openness on the gas tax may not amount to much. But it is nevertheless a refreshing dose of policy sanity in an otherwise dismal year. <br> Read more: <br> Paul Bledsoe: Five myths about gas taxes <br> The Post’s View: Congress should fix the gas tax <br> Charles Krauthammer: Raise the gas tax.

 Regarding George F. Will’s July 13 op-ed, “Fixing the ‘rotting carcass’ tax code”: <br> President Trump’s income-tax reform is a worthy effort. Anything that simplifies the U.S. tax code and lowers taxes is good for the country. Of course, lowering taxes has to be done in conjunction with lowering spending and recognizing the effect on the deficit. <br> One might think simplifying the tax code was something most people could agree on. However, any change is a plus for some and a negative for others. Mr. Trump is proposing eliminating all deductions except for mortgage interest and charitable donations. Why? Why not eliminate all deductions? <br> Why eliminate medical deductions when we are faced with high medical costs and when attempting to reform the Affordable Care Act is so difficult in part because of these costs? And why keep charitable deductions? High earners deducted $108 billion in charitable donations in 2014. <br> Mike Blivess, Ashburn 
 Douglas Holtz-Eakin is president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2003 to 2005. <br> President Trump is correct to press for tax reform, correct to argue that corporate rates should be reduced and correct to look for policies that boost the United States’ anemic economic growth rate. But the “rough draft” of Trump’s tax plan, rolled out at the White House on Wednesday, falls short of being a real tax reform suitable to tax-cutting conservatives such as me. <br> Proposing trillions of dollars in tax cuts and then casually asserting that such a plan would “pay for itself with growth,” as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, is detached from empirical reality. A real tax-reform plan would include specifics on how to broaden the tax base — not leave that hard work to Congress. A responsible tax plan would not ignore the threat of increasing a national debt that is already on an unsustainable course. <br> Accelerating the pace at which the federal budget bleeds red ink must be avoided, and building a tax plan based solely on the premise of future economic growth is dangerous. Sailing straight into a sovereign debt crisis is not a pro-growth strategy. What firm would want to headquarter in a country that is toying with financial meltdown accompanied by emergency austerity and tax hikes? <br> Of course, policymakers should factor economic growth into their tax-reform plans. Permanent, structural reforms — such as a territorial tax, neutral treatment of tangible and intangible capital, and others — could make it more desirable for companies to headquarter, innovate, invest and grow in the United States. This would be preferable to merely cutting tax rates in the existing failed system. <br> Typically, the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office analyze the economic growth potential of proposed policies through “dynamic scoring.” Every budget submitted by the Obama administration was dynamically scored. President Barack Obama was a dynamic scorer. President George W. Bush was a dynamic scorer. So were their predecessors. <br> But never has a dynamically scored analysis concluded that a proposal would “pay for itself with growth,” and no serious economist would make such a claim. At best, according to the prevailing consensus, the positive feedback effect from tax cuts would recoup in the range of 25 to 35 percent of the cost. <br> Consider, for example, the analysis done by the Joint Committee on Taxation on the tax-reform draft released by former Ways and Means Committee Chairman David Camp (R-Mich.). The plan, released in 2014, permanently lowered the corporate rate to 25 percent, included structural reforms and, importantly, was revenue neutral — it didn’t increase the deficit. This is precisely the type of reform that one would expect to have the largest impact, because of the drag on economic growth created by rising debt. Still, the JCT concluded that the growth feedbacks would only produce between $50 billion and $700 billion in additional revenue. That’s a far cry from the more than $2 trillion the treasury secretary would need to offset the costs of the latest plan. <br> More rapid economic growth is the central challenge in our economy, and tax reform is a powerful tool to improve the growth outlook. Real tax reform, however, takes on tough choices to broaden the base and is not built on implausible claims for the impact on growth. Congress has a rare opportunity to boost American competitiveness and productivity growth with a sensible tax-reform package. But that package must be built on realistic growth assumptions, not economic fairy tales. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: The Trump administration’s magical thinking on taxes would bust the budget <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s budget is utterly unrealistic <br> Ed Rogers: Trump is skillfully navigating Washington’s budget realities <br> Dana Milbank: Brace yourself, taxpayers: Trump’s plutocracy doesn’t come cheap <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 President Trump is promising “massive tax cuts,” “historic tax cuts,” the “largest tax cut in our country’s history.” So this might be a good time to point out: The country doesn’t need a tax cut. <br> Of course, we should have a saner tax system, one less riddled with needless complexities. Most immediately, we should have a saner corporate tax system, one that achieves lower tax rates without losing tax revenue, by broadening the base and eliminating loopholes. <br> But tax cuts — not to mention tax cuts of the magnitude Trump and fellow Republicans contemplate — are worse than unwarranted. They are dangerous. They would add trillions to the national debt at a point when it is already dangerously large as a share of the economy. <br> Consider: When Ronald Reagan cut taxes in 1981, the top individual rate was 70 percent; that was reduced to 50 percent. (The current top rate stands at 39.6 percent.) The national debt then amounted to 25 percent of the economy. <br> Flash forward to 2001. Implausible as this now sounds, the initial argument for a tax cut then was that massive projected surpluses counseled giving the American people a refund on the taxes they had paid. The worry among Serious People was that the debt would be paid off too quickly. It stood at 31 percent of the economy. <br> Of course, those surpluses proved illusory, and as the economy faltered, the argument for lowering taxes shifted to economic stimulus, in 2001 and again in 2003. <br> Where are we now? The Congressional Budget Office reports that in 2013, the most recent analysis available, average federal tax rates were below the 35-year average for all households, except those in the top 1 percent. <br> So if Americans aren’t staggering under an intolerable tax burden, do economic circumstances justify a tax cut? Trump himself keeps crowing about how magnificently the economy is performing under his supervision, with a stock market at record highs, unemployment low and economic growth strong. <br> Meanwhile, the national debt is 77 percent of the economy, the highest since the end of World War II. It is on track to exceed the entire gross domestic product by 2033. That is even without a $1.5 trillion tax cut, the amount envisioned in the just-passed budget resolutions. <br> Don’t think this is a problem? Trump himself has disagreed. Accepting the GOP nomination, he lambasted President Barack Obama for overseeing a doubling of the national debt. Issuing his first budget blueprint in May, Trump warned against “passing unsustainable levels of debt on to our children and grandchildren and causing serious economic damage.” <br> The reflexive Republican response — not a conservative response, because this argument is anything but conservative — is that tax cuts will somehow, magically, generate enough economic growth to pay for themselves. This is belied not only by economic theory but by history. <br> Could well-designed tax cuts promote economic growth? Sure. But not enough to pay for themselves. Responsible economic analysis ranges from a low of zero effect on growth (because higher debt constitutes a drag on the economy) to a high of 32 percent of the cost of the tax cuts. <br> The actual numbers don’t support tax cutters’ zeal. As economists William Gale and Andrew Samwick found, “U.S. historical data show huge shifts in taxes with virtually no observable shift in growth rates.” <br> Yes, the economy grew robustly after John F. Kennedy proposed and Lyndon B. Johnson signed a tax cut in 1964 (the top rate went from 91 percent to 70 percent) and after Reagan cut taxes in 1981 (he later raised them, because of fears of the ballooning deficit). But the economy also grew robustly after Bill Clinton raised taxes in 1993 and anemically after George W. Bush cut taxes in 2001 and 2003. <br> The Trump White House claims that its proposed corporate tax cuts could boost GDP by 3 percent to 5 percent. But its analysis doesn’t consider the impact of financing the tax cuts through deficit spending. <br> Indeed, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that increased growth would be counteracted within a few years by the drag of higher deficits; overall, the plan would increase deficits by $2.4 trillion during the first decade. <br> Trump wants tax cuts — the biggest ever! — because he promised them. Republicans take tax cuts as a matter of faith; they are desperate for a legislative win, any win, to take to voters next year. So deficit-financed tax cuts may be a political imperative. As an economic matter, they are simply reckless. <br> Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook. <br> Read more: <br> Kirk J.

 Roger C. Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary and founder and senior chairman of the investment banking firm Evercore, has worked on nine Democratic presidential campaigns, including Hillary Clinton’s in 2016. <br> The election of Donald Trump was, in many respects, the greatest presidential election upset in modern U.S. history. Now, with his presidency reeling amid a special-counsel probe, multiple resignations, an absence of legislative achievements and dismal approval ratings, many Americans already seem to view his victory as the equivalent of a hundred-year flood — in other words, the type of surprise that today’s voters won’t see again. <br> Except they will. The Trump election likely signals a new era of extreme voter discontent and improbable national election results. Why? Because the so-called American Dream — that each generation would live better than its predecessor — has ended for most of our citizens. Half of the young adults in this country will earn less over their lifetimes than their parents did. Indeed, the whole idea of rising living standards, which defined this country for so long, is a thing of the past for most Americans. More and more voters realize this and are angry about it. <br> Consider the economic data. One of the best measures of national economic progress, or lack of it, is the simplest: Are wages rising? Looking back over the past 40 years, the answer is no. According to the Hamilton Project, overall U.S. wages, adjusted for inflation, are essentially flat over this period — registering about 0.2 percent growth. Which means that purchasing power, a good proxy for living standards, is flat, too. <br> The trend in real median household income, a measure that incorporates increases in the number of family members who work, is similarly poor. This figure peaked right around $59,000 per household in 1999, after many years of rising female participation in the workforce. But it was also approximately $59,000 last year. This comes after a recent uptick in both wages and household income, an increase that furthermore probably reflects this late stage of the economic recovery, rather than any change in this long-term stagnation. <br> Then, there is the degree to which so many Americans now live on the edge of financial danger. The 2016 Federal Reserve Board survey of household well-being found that 46 percent of U.S. adults could not meet a $400 emergency expense without borrowing or selling something they owned. And a stunning one quarter of adults cannot pay their monthly bills in full. <br> These factors explain why income mobility has decreased so much. Profoundly important research, led by Raj Chetty of Stanford University, demonstrated this year that 50 percent of the children born in 1980, who are now well into the workforce, would not earn more than their parents. And that such mobility has been declining steadily for four decades. Which suggests, unfortunately, that it may continue downward. <br> A series of powerful, entrenched factors have brought the American Dream to an end. Economists generally cite globalization, accelerating technology, increased income inequality and the decline of unions. What’s noteworthy is that these are long-term pressures that show no signs of abating. <br> Yes, it is possible to imagine a bold policy agenda that might move wages up. It could involve elements of both the Republican and Democratic wish lists, like a huge federal infrastructure initiative; business tax reform; steps to increase college entrance and completion rates; expansion of the earned-income tax credit; and better protections against abuses in overtime pay, in work schedules and in the distinction between employees and independent contractors. But gridlock in Washington, reflecting all this voter anger, is worse than ever. And few of these policy changes are likely any time soon. <br> Finally, there continues to be a debate among political scientists and sociologists as to whether these income pressures or cultural factors such as a rebellion against the establishment contributed more to the Trump upset. But, in reality, the two factors are interrelated. Household financial troubles increase cultural resentment and the sense that there are two Americas. Especially with the share of national income going to the lower 80 percent of earners at a 100-year low. <br> There is no reason to think, with continued income weakness, that we will not see a similarly discontented electorate in upcoming elections — including because the Trump administration, like its recent predecessors, will not have delivered better household economics. Which suggests volatile voting behavior again. And with a right-wing candidate having won the presidency last year, and voters often seeking the opposite in the next election, don’t be surprised if a distinctly left-wing candidate takes the White House in 2020.

 The objections of some Trump critics to Republican politicians attempting to join them — they awakened too late, they are risking too little, their words are not direct enough, they are halfhearted hypocrites — are pure lunacy. Do Never Trumpers actually enjoy their righteous irrelevance? Do they fear being soiled by association with the complicit and compromised? <br> Some news for them. Nearly every elected Republican, with a few exceptions such as Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), has been complicit or silent in the face of President Trump’s crazed and cruel political rise. Which means that nearly every future recruit to Trump skepticism could be termed a hypocrite. And God bless them all. Any serious, successful political movement welcomes converts rather than identifying heretics. <br> The current elected voices of this movement — Flake and Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) — are heroes of sanity and principle. It is the substance of their critique, not the status of their careers, that matters. And their composite criticism is utterly damning: Americans have elected a president who is dangerously unstable, divisive, childish, nasty, deceptive, self-deluded, morally unfit, deeply unconservative and thus badly wrong on some of the largest issues of our time. Trump responded to this critique by coining another infantile nickname, feuding with a Gold Star widow and boasting about how smart he really is. In pressing the anti-Trump case, Trump is always the best witness. <br> “I will not be complicit or silent,” said Flake on the Senate floor. “When the next generation asks us, ‘Why didn’t you do something? Why didn’t you speak up?’ What are we going to say?” <br> Flake’s moral indictment of his colleagues stung, and it should have. Many Republican senators, as Corker has pointed out, share this view of Trump as a danger in need of containment. And there is something disgraceful in holding such an opinion and pretending otherwise in public. It treats voters — who deserve such information — with contempt and dishonors the political profession. <br> But here a little empathy is in order. The case against Trump may be obvious, but how and when to speak up are not always so clear. There are a number of Republicans on Capitol Hill — I have spoken to some of them — who are struggling to maintain their integrity along with their political viability. It is absurd to advise them (particularly pro-life members) to become Democrats, which would violate their deepest beliefs in a different way. If they don’t leave the GOP, their primary task is not to berate Trump but to win Republicans over to a different way of thinking. <br> This does require some line drawing. Conscience does not permit the normalization of deception, spite and bigotry. Vaclav Havel talked of how dissidents refused “to live within a lie.” When congressional leaders try to ignore Trump’s instability and prejudice in order to pass tax reform, they are living within a lie. When Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) says of his more principled colleagues, “Everyone shut up and do your job,” he is living within a lie. When called upon by events — such as the Charlottesville controversy — to speak the truth, a public official has a duty to do so. And future developments — the culmination of Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation, a serious primary challenge to Trump — may force this soon enough. <br> But the main task of a member of Congress in the meantime is to provide an alternative. And this requires a balance. Criticisms of what Trump has done — say, on Russia, or trade, or refugees — should be accompanied by a vision of what he should have done. Criticisms of what Trump has said should be accompanied by a description of what he should have said. The main theme should not be Trump’s depravity but the nation’s lost opportunity. Republicans need to gradually lay out a policy agenda that responds to the frustrations that led to Trump while rejecting his ideological incoherence and toxic penchant for bias and blame. <br> This may seem like an umbrella in a hurricane. But the other elements of an effective response to Trump and Trumpism — a sobering GOP loss of the House, a raft of criminal indictments, further evidence of presidential volatility and incompetence during crisis, the emergence of a charismatic Trump alternative in the GOP — are not within your average representative’s power to produce. Despair has its lachrymose attractions. But it is both a sin and a surrender. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more here: <br> Dana Milbank: Jeff Flake out, Roy Moore in.

 Alan Murray is Chief Content Officer of Time Inc., and coauthor with Jeffrey Birnbaum of “Showdown at Gucci Gulch: Lawmakers, Lobbyists and the Unlikely Triumph of Tax Reform.” <br> Any layman looking to understand the coming tax reform debate would do well to read T.R. Reid’s new book, “A Fine Mess.” Reid is a skilled journalist, with a knack for making sense of the most complicated subjects. And few subjects are more complicated than the U.S. tax system. <br> Reid’s method is similar to that of his 2009 book, “The Healing of America.” He believes that by looking at the policies of other industrialized countries, we can learn what works and what doesn’t. It turns out that in tax policy, as in health-care policy, the United States is notoriously ineffective and inefficient. As the world’s richest nation, the United States has more capacity to tax than any other country. But with an overly complex tax system riddled with loopholes, we rank near the bottom of industrialized nations in our effectiveness at doing so. <br> The worst manifestation is the corporate tax, which is nominally one of the highest in the world — at 35 percent — but subject to such massive game-playing that it brings in only a fraction of that. Reid details some of the outrageous, but perfectly legal, tax strategies employed by companies such as Caterpillar, Apple, Google and Microsoft to escape tens of billions of dollars in taxes each year. He also shines a harsh light on the practice of “inversion,” which has enabled many companies to reduce U.S. taxes by moving their headquarters offshore. The result is the worst of all worlds: a tax system whose high rates chase businesses and jobs offshore, while its massive loopholes drain government revenue. The only people who benefit are the accountants and lawyers who devise the complicated avoidance schemes. “The U.S. corporate income tax,” Reid concludes flatly, “is not working.” <br> [America’s taxes are the most progressive in the world. Its government is among the least] <br> Reid also devotes a chapter to the value-added tax, which he calls “the most successful taxation innovation of the last sixty years.” The value-added tax is a levy on consumption, not income, which means it maintains incentives to work and invest. And because it is charged at each stage of distribution, it turns out to be relatively easy to enforce. Buyers get to deduct taxes already paid, giving them an incentive to ensure that sellers actually pay the tax. Reid quotes former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan saying a VAT is the “least worst” way to raise taxes. “It has been adopted in every major nation on earth and in most small nations as well,” he says. <br> In the end, Reid comes up with a clear and simple road map to guide tax reform efforts. He would dramatically lower tax rates for all payers and make up for the lost revenue in three ways: eliminate the Swiss-cheese-like proliferation of deductions and credits in the current tax system; impose a value-added tax; and impose a financial activities tax, a tiny levy on individual securities transactions that could slow down excessive trading and raise significant resources. <br> [Why thousands of millionaires don’t pay federal income taxes] <br> In addition, he recommends empowering the IRS to use the mountains of data it already collects to prepopulate tax returns, allowing taxpayers to check them for accuracy but saving hours of unnecessary effort. Britain, the Netherlands, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and Portugal already do something similar, and it seems to work out just fine. <br> Critics of Reid’s plan, of course, won’t be hard to find. Universities, museums and other nonprofts will go on the warpath to preserve charitable deductions. High-tax states will cry foul over the loss of the state and local tax deduction. Real estate developers — perhaps even President Trump — will be in an uproar about eliminating the deductibility of interest payments. Conservatives will attack the value-added tax as a money machine that leads to bigger government. Wall Street will cry that the financial activities tax will stifle financial innovation. <br> But in the end, the real problem with Reid’s tax plan is not its substance. The nation would unquestionably benefit from taking his advice. <br> Rather, the real problem is that we’ve lost all ability to have a rational discussion of such policies. The United States did a pretty good job of cleaning up its tax system in 1986. But it was a massively complex effort that required complicated negotiation and coalition-building among lawmakers in both parties. In today’s badly fractured political environment, it’s hard to imagine a repeat of that process. Fixing our tax system — or for that matter, fixing our health-care system — is unlikely to happen until we first fix our politics. Maybe Reid should devote his next book to that. <br> By T.R.

 President Trump is giving outsiders and drain-the-swampers a bad name. <br> A president who comes to power with little dependence on either party and wins election by running against the special interests, could, in theory, do a lot of good work. He could use his popular support to push reforms that are in the national interest but have gotten stuck in Washington. Three examples come to mind — none of which has, at least so far, inspired the president to action. <br> The first, and in some ways most obvious, is a carbon tax linked to infrastructure modernization. <br> This would be a win-win-win for the country. The tax would encourage conservation, which would be good for the environment and for slowing climate change. Republicans would have reason to cheer a market-friendly approach, as opposed to government picking energy winners and losers; GOP luminaries such as James A. Baker III and George P. Shultz have endorsed such a tax. <br> Some of the proceeds could be used to augment the earned-income tax credit, to counter its regressive nature. That would give Democrats reason to cheer. <br> The rest of the revenue could be distributed to states to spend on infrastructure. The federalism would make Republicans happy. Blue states could spend more on mass transit, making Democrats happy. <br> This makes such sense that you might think it would pass even without a push from an above-the-fray president, but it won’t. Republicans are too bound to their no-tax ideology. Democrats might object to the loss of federal control. Special interests, deserving and otherwise, from Amtrak to windmill companies, would clamor for a piece of the pie. Presidential leadership would be needed to keep those interests in check and the deal on track. <br> Then there is immigration reform. This is another case where the shape of a compromise is well-known, but where neither side can say yes without a strong push. <br> A deal would offer undocumented immigrants a path to legalization, in theory cheering Democrats, while stepping up enforcement to block further illegal immigration, in theory cheering Republicans. Congress could then work out how many legal immigrants, and of what sort, the country should accept in the future. Easy, right? <br> Well, no. Most undocumented people would welcome such a deal to bring them out of the shadows, but their professional advocates, and therefore many Democrats, would object to anything short of citizenship. Republicans who clamor for strict enforcement would, in many cases, object to the most efficient method: holding employers accountable for hiring undocumented workers. <br> Again, therefore, you would need presidential leadership. Trump, strange as it may sound, would be well-positioned to push such a deal. Though he called for deporting the 11 million undocumented people in the United States, he also said that the “good” ones could quickly return. The makings of a deal are there — and could include some segments of his wall. <br> For tax reform, too, the outlines of a deal are in theory universally admired: cap or abolish the deductions that taxpayers can claim — the “loopholes” — and then lower the rates that everyone must pay. <br> The universal admiration quickly wanes, however, under special-interest assault. Realtors in every congressional district explain why the mortgage-interest deduction can’t be disturbed. Hospitals, churches and universities remind Congress that opposing the charitable deduction is un-American. Folks from financial services recount how the elderly will go hungry without tax-advantaged 401(k) accounts. <br> Realistically, the best hope would be not to abolish any of these deductions but to cap how much relatively wealthy people could claim in any given year. And to accomplish even such a cap would require the attention of an above-the-swamp president, making a case for the country at large. <br> You may think the president is on board for this one, because he talks a fair bit about tax reform. But so far, what he seems to have in mind is only tax cuts, which might be popular in the short term but would send the already sky-high national debt into outer space. The only tax benefit that Republicans seem to want to target is, conveniently, the one that blue states depend on: the deduction for state and local taxes. <br> Which is in keeping with the policy predilections Trump has shown, to the extent he has shown any so far: conventional, down-the-line Republican, from tax cuts for the rich to the far more difficult, and politically fraught, push to repeal, and possibly replace, Obamacare. Meanwhile he leaves on the table the opportunities his unconventional path to the presidency had opened for him. <br> Is this because he’s just not interested in policy? Or because he has a plutocrat’s natural inclination toward the Republican playbook? I don’t know. I do know he’s missing a chance to show the good that a leader unbeholden to party orthodoxy really could do in this town. <br> Read more from Fred Hiatt’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Ronald A.

 Theodore B. Olson, U.S. solicitor general from 2001 to 2004, is a partner at the D.C. office of the law firm Gibson, Dunn Crutcher. Olson serves as an adviser to Koch Industries regarding federal tax reform. <br> With the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare continuing to struggle in the House, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are understandably eager to notch a major policy win and fulfill a Trump campaign promise. Thus, congressional leaders are turning their attention to the great white whale of their policy agenda: tax reform. <br> Like Moby Dick, the opportunity to enact tax reform surfaces only rarely, and it has a penchant for turning on those who, like Captain Ahab, pursue it too closely. <br> In fact, a squall of serious dimensions is already appearing on the horizon. A centerpiece of the Republican leadership’s tax-reform plan is a new $1 trillion tax that proponents call a “border adjustment.” Not surprisingly, many members of Congress are hearing from constituents opposed to being “adjusted” to the tune of a $1 trillion, and Republicans in both houses of Congress are talking openly about a mutiny. The Republican leadership’s proposed “border adjustment” sounds a lot like what United Airlines might call a “re-accommodation.” <br> And, it would be unconstitutional. <br> The Constitution granted to Congress the power “to lay and collect Taxes.” But it also placed an important restriction on that power known as the apportionment clause: Any “direct” tax — which is to say, any tax on a person or their property, as opposed to a tax on a specific transaction — had to be “apportioned among the several States . . . according to their respective numbers.” <br> Because the Constitution also required that all bills concerning taxes originate in the House — the chamber in which representation is tied directly to population — the framers included the apportionment clause to ensure that the more populous states could not band together to enact taxes, such as a per-acre tax on land, that would fall disproportionately on less populous states. So, while the Constitution permitted Congress to raise whatever amount of money it wished through direct taxes, the apportionment clause mandated that each state would pay only that share corresponding to its percentage of the nation’s population as shown in the census. <br> If this sounds like something out of the past, it is. More than a century ago, after the Supreme Court struck down a federal income tax for violating the apportionment requirement, the states ratified the 16th Amendment, which empowered Congress “to lay and collect taxes on incomes . . . without apportionment among the several States.” Ever since, income taxes have been the lifeblood of the federal government, and the fact that those taxes now fall disproportionately on certain states has been no concern whatsoever to Congress. <br> The “border adjustment” plan will once again make it a concern. When businesses calculate their income for tax purposes, they subtract from their gross revenue the costs of goods sold; the net gain is their taxable income. Under the “border adjustment” proposal, however, while businesses still would be permitted to deduct from revenue the cost of raw materials or component parts purchased in the United States, they would be prohibited from deducting the costs of materials or parts acquired abroad. U.S. businesses that use imported materials or components thus effectively would pay two taxes: a tax on their U.S. income — their U.S. revenue minus their costs of goods sold — and a second tax on the cost of their imported materials and components. That is why the Wall Street Journal reported that border adjustment “would operate like a tax on the trade deficit.” And it is that second tax from which the plan’s proponents expect to raise $1 trillion. <br> The problem is that the border tax is not a tax on “income” and therefore would not be sheltered by the 16th Amendment. Courts repeatedly have held that, to qualify as an income tax, the tax must be on income — and must therefore allow taxpayers to deduct the full cost of goods sold so that the tax falls upon only the taxpayers’ gain. Indeed, so well established is this principle that courts have upheld even the right of drug dealers and illegal gamblers to deduct their costs of generating revenue. The reason is that the simple meaning of the word “income,” in its constitutional significance, refers to “gain,” or a net increase, and a tax on revenue without subtracting costs isn’t, in fact, a tax on “income.” “Border adjustment” denies this subtraction to businesses that use imported materials or components in their U.S. manufacturing. <br> And if it is not an income tax, “border adjustment” is in serious constitutional jeopardy. As currently described, the tax would be imposed on taxpayers themselves, rather than on a transaction or activity. That makes it a direct tax that should be subject to the long-dormant requirement of apportionment, which the “border adjustment” plan cannot possibly satisfy. <br> If retail politics does not sink “border adjustment,” the Supreme Court should. How pointless to pass an experimental and unfair tax only to have it struck down after all that political capital is spent getting it passed. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Will the grand Republican tax plan work? <br> Charles Koch: Trump’s policies must not benefit only big businesses like mine <br> Jennifer Rubin: How tax reform turns into another fiasco <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 In encouraging Congress to act decisively and cooperatively, the Aug. 6 editorial “Can Congress pivot?” flatly stated, “There is much to do.” Is there? If Congress doesn’t act on health care, the Affordable Care Act will remain the law of the land. No progress on immigration means no border wall will get built. Tax reform might be nice, but it’s simply not urgent. We can continue patching our infrastructure piecemeal. The federal government functions adequately on continuing resolutions without Congress having to do much to keep it going. <br> A bipartisan Congress working productively is ordinarily one of our nation’s blessings. But there are times when political paralysis is its own reward.  <br> David Sarokin, Washington 
 Ronald A. Klain served as a senior White House aide to Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. <br> The only three things certain in life are death, taxes . . . and Democrats losing the debate on taxes. But 2017 could be the year when Republicans are on the defensive on tax reform. <br> President Trump and congressional Republicans plan to follow their health-care debacle with a massive tax-reform package. It’s far from clear how they will pay for it: Trump has previously promised that his tax changes would not “add to our debt and deficit ” and was counting on $800 billion taken from Obamacare to pay for tax reductions; perhaps this is why he recently said he’s going to try to return to, and finish, repealing the Affordable Care Act before taking on tax reform. It’s also not clear why tax reform is so high on the agenda, when voters are more eager for the president to deliver on his promised infrastructure package than to reduce the corporate tax rate. But the donor class must be heeded, and nothing heals Republican rifts like a good tax cut — so tax reform is on deck. <br> What exactly will be in Trump’s tax plan is a mystery. During the campaign, Trump promised three headline ideas: tax cuts for individual taxpayers, which would largely benefit the wealthiest; tax cuts for corporations, to reduce rates to 15 percent; and a series of tax cuts and changes to discourage job losses overseas. So how should Democrats respond? <br> First, they should put less emphasis on their usual critique — that GOP tax plans favor the rich — and focus relentlessly on one theme: jobs. Yes, the Trump plan will offer massive largesse to those who need it the least, and that is an outrage. But this well-worn argument is unlikely to break through today’s media clamor. Better to put the Trump plan to a test of Trump’s own creation: Will it help create jobs? <br> If lowering corporate rates is supposed to create jobs, Democrats should hold Trump to that promise, requiring that at least half of any corporate tax savings be invested in increased hiring and pay. If companies don’t do that, they should have to pay the higher tax rate now in place. Likewise, Trump has said that lower corporate rates will result in jobs returning to the United States. Surely, then, he would be willing to make corporations forfeit any tax relief if they add more jobs abroad than at home? <br> Trump has said that corporations will create jobs by bringing home cash that has been stashed tax-free overseas; again, why not insist that companies document that the returned cash is going to add jobs and raise pay — or else pay taxes on it? Another option is Rep. John Delaney’s (D-Md.) bipartisan plan to tax a part of any cash coming home to fund job-creating infrastructure projects. If Republicans won’t agree that flimsy promises about job creation be matched with binding requirements and stinging penalties, Democrats must make the point that, whatever the GOP tax reform might be, a jobs plan it isn’t. <br> Second, although the job of the opposition party is generally to oppose, tax reform is one area where the opposition cannot beat something with nothing. Democrats need to have an alternative proposal to put up against the GOP plan. <br> A wonkish plan that gets rave reviews from think tanks but gains no traction among taxpayers — or voters — won’t do the trick. Save it for the first transition team meeting in November 2020. For now, Democrats need a straightforward, middle-class tax-cut plan, like those Maggie Hassan and Catherine Cortez Masto proposed during last year’s campaign: a tax cut of $1,000 per family, paid for by closing loopholes that benefit the wealthy and big corporations. <br> Some Democrats resist such broad middle-class tax cuts, worried about the impact on government revenue. They think they feel like giveaways. But Democrats cannot stand for the notion that middle-class families are pinched and they feel their pain if they aren’t prepared to come forward with a concrete way to address that. An extra $1,000 in each family’s pocket is specific and on target. <br> Finally, if Republicans need Democratic votes to get a plan passed, Democrats should unify behind one simple demand: requiring the president to release all of his tax returns before the first corporate tax cut takes effect. The recently disclosed Trump tax return for 2005 revealed that virtually all of the taxes he paid resulted from the alternative minimum tax — a provision that his tax plan would eliminate. If that return is typical, the Trump tax plan is an 86 percent tax cut for . . . Trump. Voters have a right to know exactly what he is getting out of all of this, and Democrats should insist on the release of Trump’s tax returns as a condition of any tax-reform package. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Catherine Rampell: Think tax reform will be easy for Trump?

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> PRESIDENT TRUMP appears close to deciding who will be the world’s most powerful economic official, the leader of the Federal Reserve, for the next four years. He should pick the person who already has a proven track record of competence and care in the conduct of the nation’s monetary policy: current Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen. <br> Mr. Trump is reportedly meeting with Ms. Yellen on Thursday, and he may announce his decision shortly after that. Under normal circumstances, she would be the obvious pick. Though President Barack Obama tapped her, reappointing Fed chairs has become a laudable, decades-long, bipartisan tradition. This would not matter if Ms. Yellen had done a poor job. But she has performed well. <br> Reputed to be a “dove” — that is, willing to keep interest rates low to encourage growth and employment, at the risk of stoking inflation and asset bubbles — when she assumed the Fed’s reins, Ms. Yellen maintained the loose money policies she inherited from recession-era Chair Ben Bernanke. But as employment and wage figures have improved, she has behaved more hawkishly than many doves prefer. The Fed has cautiously but steadily raised interest rates and recently announced the gradual unwinding of the asset purchasing program it undertook during the Great Recession. Ms. Yellen has also encouraged and defended the central bank’s moves to require new safeguards at financial institutions. Despite new regulations and tightening monetary policies, the economy appears to be chugging along. <br> Many of the alternatives to Ms. Yellen appear to be too inflexible. Stanford University economist John Taylor has the brains for the Fed’s top job, but he is also notable for developing a formula for pegging interest rates, suggesting he would be too mechanical in his judgments and too austere in interest-rate setting. Other options lack Ms. Yellen’s combination of deep understanding of monetary policy and political deftness. Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, began his campaign to be a GOP Fed nominee years ago, launching strong criticisms at the central bank’s quantitative-easing policies. His criticisms have proved wrong; quantitative easing helped cushion the Great Recession’s blow and bolstered the subsequent recovery. Gary Cohn, a senior Trump economic adviser, has no monetary-policy experience, and his performance developing a tax-reform framework for the Trump administration does not recommend him. <br> Jerome Powell, a current Fed governor and reportedly Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s preferred candidate, is more attractive than the other alternatives. A lawyer, he lacks Ms. Yellen’s formal training in economics, but he has substantial central-bank experience. In public appearances he has expressed a sensible amount of concern with preserving economic growth. He has also called for a balanced approach to regulating financial institutions. <br> What closes the case for Ms. Yellen is tradition. At a time when other executive appointments that should be insulated from politics, such as judicial picks, are being steadily politicized, it is crucial that the Federal Reserve’s independence be preserved. The national — and world — economy depends on allowing the Fed to make sometimes tough, unpopular decisions. With the economy improving but not roaring, the Fed will face some hard choices over the coming months. Reappointing Ms. Yellen would send a reassuring message of continuity. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Robert J.

 President Trump’s flailings are ever more terrifying. In the course of a few days, he tossed a grenade into the health-care markets that millions rely on, traduced the Iran nuclear deal, threatened to abandon American citizens ravaged by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, continued to sabotage action on climate change, tweeted about censoring the media, and so undermined Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) likened it to “castration.” Yet for all of that, Trump’s grotesqueries are exceeded by a Republican-led Congress intent on a course so ruinous as to be, one hopes, impossible to sustain. <br> This week, Senate Republicans will seek to push through a budget resolution for the current fiscal year. The resolution provides guidelines for spending and tax cuts, with projections for the next 10 years. It has the support of virtually all of the Republican caucus. Its provisions are destructive and absurd. <br> The resolution is designed to facilitate passage of tax cuts with Republican votes only. The final tax cut package hasn’t been written yet, but Republicans leaders have produced a “framework.” This bill will worsen the extreme inequality that already corrupts our democracy and impedes economic growth. The top 1 percent will pocket more than half of the tax cuts next year and an obscene 80 percent by year 10. This bill will also reward multinationals for booking profits as earned abroad to avoid taxes. The legislation offers a retroactive tax cut for the $2.6 trillion that has evaded taxation and would expand that tax dodge by eliminating taxes altogether on profits that they report as earned abroad. At a time when hedge-fund operators pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers, this bill would increase the outrage, with a massive tax break for real estate barons, hedge-fund managers and lawyers by taxing “pass-through” income at a reduced rate. Instead of closing loopholes, the bill adds to them. <br> The spending side has received less attention but may be even worse. The Senate bill proposes $5.8 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. At a time when baby boomers are retiring, it calls for cuts of $473 billion in Medicare, $1 trillion in Medicaid and another $300 billion in Obamacare subsidies to medium- and low-income workers. It cuts more than $650 billion in income security programs for low-income workers — primarily food stamps, the earned-income tax credit and child tax credit, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for disabled seniors and others in need. Another $200 billion is cut from Pell grants and student loans that help working families afford college. These decreases will leave millions without affordable health care and make millions of disabled and low-income Americans even more vulnerable. <br> The budget also projects stunning reductions in what is called non-defense discretionary spending, essentially everything the government does outside of the military, entitlements and interest payments on the national debt. These include programs that contribute to our safety — such as law enforcement, the Coast Guard, the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration — as well as services vital to our health — such as environmental protection, water and sewage systems. It also includes public investment vital to our economy and our future — in science and technology, medical research, modern infrastructure, education, advanced training and more. <br> These programs are already projected for deep cuts under the 2011 Budget Control Act, but the Senate bill decimates them. By 2019, it cuts this spending by 10 percent from 2017 levels, and by nearly 20 percent by 2027. As a share of the economy, spending on domestic services will be cut to levels not seen since Herbert Hoover. <br> In a society dealing with a growing population, rising global competition and pressing new challenges such as catastrophic climate change, the Republican-led Senate cashes in our future for top-end tax cuts. We will lag rather than lead the industrial world in education and training. We will squander our edge in innovation. We will suffer the rising perils and the costs of a decrepit and outmoded infrastructure. We witness all this already today, but the Senate budget course will accelerate the trends and make them worse. <br> This folly is, one hopes, too extreme to be sustained. Yet this week, all of the Republican senators — with perhaps one or two dissenters — will line up to vote for a budget that is truly a road to ruin. Why? Partly, of course, they will reward the wealthy and special interests that pay for their party. Part comes from fear of even more right-wing challengers if they don’t toe the line. Part may be purblind ideological conviction, although it is hard to imagine that any truly believe these measures would make things better. Part may be desperation — Republicans believe they have to get something done, even if it does more harm than good to most Americans in the long run. If Trump’s increasingly manic careening terrifies, the remorseless suicide mission of the Republican caucus in Congress should horrify. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more here: <br> George F.

 As a candidate, Donald Trump promised that the instincts and negotiating skills that landed him in the three-comma club would translate to managing the macroeconomy. He was uniquely well-suited to help the nation’s other job creators reach their full potential, he told voters. <br> Despite such declarations, now-President Trump is proving to be, in at least some crucial respects, unexpectedly anti-business. <br> As a businessman, he surely knows that one of the key things companies need to plan and make investments is a clear understanding of what the policy environment will look like going forward. And on almost every major policy front — tax reform, health care, immigration, even more bite-size regulations — his administration continues to inject huge amounts of uncertainty into the economy. <br> Most recently, Trump has decided to scrap the tax plan he released late last summer (which replaced yet another tax plan he’d previously scrapped) and go back to the drawing board, according to the Associated Press. <br> The latest plan, it must be said, was not exactly good. It was expensive, costing $7.2 trillion over its first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. It was top-heavy, with three-quarters of the cuts going to the top income quintile. And it was littered with broken promises, including that investment fund managers would no longer get a special tax break (in fact, his plan would have lowered their taxes). <br> But at least there was a plan, a set of core objectives, something on paper for congressmen to debate and companies to strategize around. <br> Now that’s going out the window, and the White House is reportedly considering dramatic revampings of the tax code that were completely absent from Trump’s earlier framework, such as eliminating the payroll taxes that fund Social Security. An overhaul that was supposed to be done by August now might get pushed off to next year. Rather than showing leadership, or laying out a set of principles and acceptable trade-offs, the White House has left both legislators and companies in limbo. <br> To be fair, tax reform is really, really hard — hence the three-decade lull since it was last achieved — and requires lots of complicated horse-trading. Of necessity, parts of it were bound to get negotiated away. But tax reform isn’t the only realm in which this administration is struggling to figure out its vision. <br> Health care, too, remains in the throes of great uncertainty. <br> Having suffered from too many mutually exclusive promises about coverage, affordability and government involvement, Republicans’ plan to repeal and replace Obamacare died an ignominious death in late March. Or so we thought. Now it’s back again, more heartless than before, with the White House’s wishy-washy, noncommittal statements about its future leaving great amounts of uncertainty for insurers, providers, employers that self-insure, and of course individual enrollees on Medicaid and the exchanges. <br> Even absent legislative repeal, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has pledged to do his best to destabilize and unravel the insurance market. In recent congressional testimony, he refused to say whether the administration will continue providing cost-sharing subsidies for insurers in the federal exchanges. No wonder more anxious insurers are dropping out, or are expected to submit higher proposed premium prices than they otherwise would. <br> On immigration, the Trump administration has also introduced additional ambiguities for employers regarding whom they can hire, and for how long. <br> Last month, for example, it announced it would stop allowing employers to pay an additional fee to ensure an H-1B skilled-immigrant visa application would be reviewed and given a thumbs-up or down within 15 days. Without such “premium processing,” employers can wait three to six months before finding out whether their chosen hires can ever start work. <br> The administration similarly punted last week on whether it will allow certain spouses of H-1B immigrants stuck in the green-card backlog to continue working or running their own businesses; for the time being, these immigrants will effectively be given a series of two-month extensions to continue work, making it challenging for their businesses to make long-term investments. <br> The administration has similarly delayed — but, importantly, not yet announced plans to rescind — implementation of other regulations, often without explanation. These cover areas as varied as energy-efficiency standards for consumer products, the kinds of advice that financial advisers may give their clients, and how much silica dust companies can expose construction workers to. <br> In many cases, companies are explicitly rooting for these rules to get repealed. Even so, the White House’s persistent indecision on such regulatory matters still forces firms to plan for every possible policy contingency. Which is expensive. <br> For the time being, markets remain relatively buoyant, counting on outcomes to eventually shake out their way; should the White House not be able to get its act together and offer a more coherent policy agenda, however, that Trump bump could soon deflate. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s proposed tax ‘reform’ is hardly reform at all <br> Jeffrey H.

 With eyes wide open, Mike Pence eagerly auditioned for the role as Donald Trump’s poodle. Now comfortably leashed, he deserves the degradations that he seems too sycophantic to recognize as such. He did Trump’s adolescent bidding with last Sunday’s preplanned virtue pageant of scripted indignation — his flight from the predictable sight of players kneeling during the national anthem at a football game. No unblinkered observer can still cling to the hope that Pence has the inclination, never mind the capacity, to restrain, never mind educate, the man who elevated him to his current glory. Pence is a reminder that no one can have sustained transactions with Trump without becoming too soiled for subsequent scrubbing. <br> A man who interviewed for the position Pence captured, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), is making amends for saying supportive things about Trump. In 2016, for example, he said he was “repulsed” by people trying to transform the Republican National Convention from a merely ratifying body into a deliberative body for the purpose of preventing what has come to pass. Until recently, Corker, an admirable man and talented legislator, has been, like many other people, prevented by his normality from fathoming Trump’s abnormality. Now Corker says what could have been said two years ago about Trump’s unfitness. <br> The axiom that “Hell is truth seen too late” is mistaken; damnation deservedly comes to those who tardily speak truth that has long been patent. Perhaps there shall be a bedraggled parade of repentant Republicans resembling those supine American communists who, after Stalin imposed totalitarianism, spawned the gulag, engineered the Ukraine famine, launched the Great Terror and orchestrated the show trials, were theatrically disillusioned by his collaboration with Hitler: You, sir, have gone too far. <br> Trump’s energy, unleavened by intellect and untethered to principle, serves only his sovereign instinct to pander to those who adore him as much as he does. Unshakably smitten, they are impervious to the Everest of evidence that he disdains them as a basket of gullibles. He understands that his unremitting coarseness satisfies their unpolitical agenda of smashing crockery, even though his self-indulgent floundering precludes fulfillment of the promises he flippantly made to assuage their sense of being disdained. He gives his gullibles not governance by tantrum, but tantrum as governance. <br> With Trump turning and turning in a widening gyre, his crusade to make America great again is increasingly dominated by people who explicitly repudiate America’s premises. The faux nationalists of the “alt-right” and their fellow travelers such as Stephen K. Bannon, although fixated on protecting the United States from imported goods, have imported the blood-and-soil ethno-tribalism that stains the continental European right. In “Answering the Alt-Right” in National Affairs quarterly, Ramon Lopez, a University of Chicago PhD candidate in political philosophy, demonstrates how Trump’s election has brought back to the public stage ideas that a post-Lincoln America had slowly but determinedly expunged. They were rejected because they are incompatible with an open society that takes its bearing from the Declaration of Independence’s doctrine of natural rights. <br> With their version of the identity politics practiced by progressives, alt-right theorists hold that the tribalism to which people are prone should not be transcended but celebrated. As Lopez explains, the alt-right sees society as inevitably “a zero-sum contest among fundamentally competing identity groups.” Hence the alt-right is explicitly an alternative to Lincoln’s affirmation of the Founders’ vision. They saw America as cohesive because of a shared creed. The alt-right must regard Lincoln as not merely mistaken but absurd in describing America as a creedal nation dedicated to a “proposition.” The alt-right insists that real nationhood requires cultural homogeneity rooted in durable ethnic identities. This is the alt-right’s alternative foundation for the nation Lincoln said was founded on the principle that all people are, by nature, equal. <br> Trump is, of course, innocent of this (or any other) systemic thinking. However, within the ambit of his vast, brutish carelessness are some people with sinister agendas and anti-constitutional impulses. Stephen Miller, Bannon’s White House residue and Trump’s enfant terrible, recently said that “in sending our [tax reform] proposal to the tax-writing committees, we will include instructions to ensure all low- and middle-income households are protected.” So, Congress will be instructed by Trump’s 32-year-old acolyte who also says the president’s national security powers “will not be questioned.” We await the response of congressional Republicans, who did so little to stop Trump’s ascent and then so much to normalize him. <br> Read more from George F.

 John Podesta, the chair of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, served as counselor to President Barack Obama and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. <br> One of the new constants in the Trump era has been the GOP’s complete and utter disdain for evidence-based, nonpartisan policy analysis. In the battle to repeal Obamacare, Republicans consistently tried to ignore, delay and finally belittle by labeling as “fake news” the Congressional Budget Office analysis that tens of millions would lose coverage. In their effort to gut environmental, health and safety, and financial regulation, the White House is using accounting tricks to exaggerate the costs and ignore the benefits of critical regulations. But President Trump’s dishonest pitch for his tax-cut proposals takes this tactic to a new level. <br> Fact checkers have already had a field day debunking claims by Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn 
 In the midst of a governing crisis, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has once again risen to his role as the voice of bland complacency. Concerning the open warfare between President Trump and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Ryan advises “these two gentlemen to sit down and just talk through their issues.” <br> But what are Corker’s “issues”? He has asserted that Trump requires constant handling to control his volatility: “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him.” Corker has accused Trump of lacking strategic thinking: “A lot of people think that there is some kind of ‘good cop, bad cop’ act underway, but that’s just not true.” Corker has called out Trump’s routine deceptions: “I don’t know why the president tweets out things that are not true.” Corker has talked of Trump’s vacuity: He acts “like he’s doing ‘The Apprentice’ or something.” Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has expressed the fear that Trump’s instability could lead to conflict: “We could be headed toward World War III with the kind of comments that he’s making.” <br> So how does Ryan imagine a Corker/Trump conversation might unfold? Over dinner, Corker accuses the president of being a chaotic, directionless, shallow liar who could start a nuclear war. Trump passes the peas and attacks Corker for being short. This is, after all, the way gentlemen resolve their differences. <br> GOP denial about Trump has generally taken Ryan’s form. The president may be eccentric and divisive, but Republicans need to keep their heads down and think of tax reform. This assumes that the main challenge is to avoid distraction from essential tasks. <br> But the real problem has always been Trump’s fundamental unfitness for high office. It is not Trump’s indiscipline and lack of leadership, which make carrying a legislative agenda forward nearly impossible. It is not his vulgarity and smallness, which have been the equivalent of spray-painting graffiti on the Washington Monument. It is not his nearly complete ignorance of policy and history, which condemns him to live in the eternal present of his own immediate desires. <br> No, Corker has given public permission to raise the most serious questions: Is Trump psychologically and morally equipped to be president? And could his unfitness cause permanent damage to the country? <br> It is no longer possible to safely ignore the leaked cries for help coming from within the administration. They reveal a president raging against enemies, obsessed by slights, deeply uninformed and incurious, unable to focus, and subject to destructive whims. A main task of the chief of staff seems to be to shield him from dinner guests and telephone calls that might set him off on a foolish or dangerous tangent. Much of the White House senior staff seems bound, not by loyalty to the president, but by a duty to protect the nation from the president. Trump, in turn, is reported to have said: “I hate everyone in the White House.” And also, presumably, in the State Department, headed by a secretary of state who apparently regards his boss as a “moron.” <br> It was once urged, “Let Reagan be Reagan.” Who, besides the oleaginous Sean Hannity, would say, “Let Trump be Trump”? The security of our country — and potentially the lives of millions of people abroad — depends on Trump being someone else entirely. It depends on the president being some wise, strategic, restrained leader he has never been. <br> The time for whispered criticisms and quiet snickering is over. The time for panic and decision is upon us. The thin line of sane, responsible advisers at the White House — such as Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — could break at any moment. Already, Trump’s protests of eternal love for Kelly are a bad sign for the general’s future. The American government now has a dangerous fragility at its very center. Its welfare is as thin as an eggshell — perhaps as thin as Donald Trump’s skin. <br> Any elected Republican who shares Corker’s concerns has a political and moral duty to state them in public. If Corker is correct, many of his colleagues do have such fears. Their silence is deafening and damning. <br> “Brave men are all vertebrates,” said G.K. Chesterton. “They have their softness on the surface and their toughness in the middle. But these modern cowards are all crustaceans; their hardness is all on the cover, and their softness is inside.” <br> More than anything else at this moment, the nation has need of Republican vertebrates. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more here: <br> Ruth Marcus: The GOP needs more men like this <br> Eugene Robinson: It’s time to talk about Trump’s mental healh <br> Josh Rogin: Why the Trump-Corker partnership could never work <br> Micahel Gerson: GOP leaders made a huge wager — and they’re losing <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The story behind the story is that “tax reform,” as we know it, is dying. During the 1980s, no major piece of legislation better symbolized bipartisan consensus than the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which was regarded by both liberal and conservative experts as the best tax law since World War II. The basic idea was simple: Reduce tax rates and recover lost revenue by ending (or limiting) tax breaks. The struggle between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner over the “fiscal cliff” indicates that this beneficial consensus has collapsed. <br> Just the opposite is occurring. President Obama insists not only that the rich pay more in taxes (a legitimate demand) but also that their tax rates go up (questionable). This turns traditional tax “reform” on its head. Boehner says the added revenues should come through closing loopholes. The two also disagree on the amount of tax increases: Boehner has offered $800 billion over a decade, about half of what Obama wants. But this difference is amendable to negotiation; the rates-versus-loopholes dispute is less so. <br> For Obama, the obsession with raising top rates (from today’s 33 percent and 35 percent to 36 percent and 39.6 percent) seems an exercise in political symbolism. He wants to be seen as vanquishing the rich — and Republicans. Otherwise, why not accept Boehner’s means (loophole closing) to achieve his policy ends (higher taxes on the rich)? <br> The White House claims that loophole closing can’t raise enough revenues. This is bogus. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has estimated that capping all itemized deductions at $17,000 for couples and $8,500 for singles would produce $1.7 trillion in added taxes over a decade. To be sure, there would be practical problems; some tax increases would fall on households under Obama’s income thresholds of $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for singles. But these could be managed with adequate political will. <br> Unfortunately, it’s missing. The itemized deductions most threatened would include those for charitable contributions, interest on home mortgages and state and local taxes. Howls would come from affected groups: churches, universities, hospitals (the charitable deduction); builders, real estate brokers and mortgage bankers (the mortgage interest deduction); and state and local governments (the tax deduction). Obama seems unwilling to spend his political capital opposing these groups. <br> The lower rates and broadened tax base of the 1986 law had explicit goals: to increase economic growth; to reduce the use of taxes to promote some activities and discourage others; to minimize lobbying for tax breaks; and to make the system simpler. With time, the appeal of these goals has faded. <br> Economists generally believe that taxes influence behavior and that low tax rates favor growth while high tax rates discourage it. But the overall effects are hard to measure and may be small. Several recent reports from the Congressional Research Service could find no clear relationship between changes in tax rates and economic growth rates. This is probably true, because other forces affecting the economy often overshadow the impact of taxes, for better or worse. <br> In the 1950s, tax rates were high but so was economic growth. The post-World War II boom, driven by pent-up demand in consumer goods and housing, dwarfed any ill effects from taxes. Asked about gains from the 1986 law, a group of economists guessed that it might have ultimately increased the economy’s annual growth rate by one percentage point, if “allowed to remain in force.” This would have been a sizeable gain, but the effect would have been gradual and invisible. <br> That’s not much of an advertisement. <br> As important, many politicians support tax breaks for favored groups (the elderly, the poor, small business) and causes (homeownership, attending college, “green” industries). This enhances their power. The man who really pronounced the death sentence for the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was Bill Clinton, who increased the top rate to 39.6 percent rather than broadening the base. As the top rate rose, so did the value of generating new tax breaks. Ironically, many of the people who complain the loudest about Washington influence-peddling and lobbying are the same people who support higher tax rates, which stimulate more influence-peddling and lobbying. <br> After the 1986 law, the top statutory rate was 28 percent and rates were the same on ordinary income and capital gains (profits on the sale of stocks and other assets). The preference for capital gains — they’re now taxed at no more than 15 percent and represent the biggest tax break for the wealthy — was reinstated only after the top rate rose. The 1986 law was better than what we have today and, almost certainly, better than what we will have tomorrow. It depended on bipartisan support and White House leadership. There is now little of either. <br> </i> <br> <br> Read more from The Washington Post: <br> Dana Milbank: Republicans wave the white flag <br> George Will: Bewitched by Obama <br> E.J.

 The Republican gospel of cutting taxes and government services to the bone doesn’t lead to economic growth; it leads to crisis and decline. Just ask the people of Kansas, who finally have seen the light. <br> If House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) don’t heed the Kansas lesson, they deserve to have their majorities stripped away in next year’s midterms. And they won’t be able to claim they weren’t warned. <br> The states are supposed to be laboratories for testing government policy. For five years, Kansas’s Republican governor, Sam Brownback, conducted the nation’s most radical exercise in trickle-down economics — a “real-live experiment,” he called it. He and the GOP-controlled legislature slashed the state’s already-low tax rates, eliminated state income tax for most owner-operated businesses and sharply reduced vital government services. These measures were supposed to deliver “a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy,” Brownback said. <br> It ended up being a shot of poison. Growth rates lagged behind those in neighboring states and the nation as a whole. Deficits mounted to unsustainable levels. Services withered. Brownback had set in motion a vicious cycle, not a virtuous one. <br> Last week, finally, the legislature — still controlled by Republicans — overrode Brownback’s veto of legislation restoring taxation to sane levels. The nightmare experiment is coming to an end. <br> The return to sane taxation will go a long way toward erasing a billion-dollar deficit. More revenue-raising measures may be needed, however, because education funding under Brownback was reduced to levels that the state Supreme Court recently ruled unconstitutional. It is unclear whether a $488 million increase for the schools over the next two years — which Brownback may still veto, or try to — is enough to satisfy the court. <br> Republican leaders in Congress will probably try to ignore the Kansas fiasco or say Brownback’s implementation was flawed. But that would be unfair. All Brownback did was apply what passes for mainstream Republican orthodoxy these days: Cut taxes, eliminate regulation, shrink government, then stand back and watch as economic growth soars. <br> It just didn’t work. <br> It never works. Republicans cannot point to an instance in which this prescription has led to the promised Valhalla of skyrocketing growth. Before Kansas, they could at least argue that the program had only been attempted partially and piecemeal, never in full and unadulterated form. After Kansas, that excuse is gone. <br> Eliminating business income taxes for owner-operated companies was supposed to induce entrepreneurs to move to Kansas from other states. It didn’t. It turned out that business owners take more than taxes into account when they decide where to locate. They want good health care and first-rate schools for themselves and their employees. They want modern, well-maintained infrastructure. In short, they want a healthy, functioning public sector. <br> It also turns out that business owners do not decide whether to expand capacity or add employees based solely on the tax rate they must pay. Much more important is whether there is enough demand to justify such growth. If there is not — and the Kansas economy under Brownback was woefully sluggish — then tax savings will not be put to productive use. <br> The Kansas Republicans who voted to abandon Brownback’s dead-end policies have been described in news stories as “moderate,” but many are actually quite conservative. They just decided to put reality before ideology. <br> President Trump and the Republican-led Congress, however, threaten to run Brownback’s experiment on a national scale, with predictably disastrous consequences. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney proposes amputational cuts to the social safety net and bureaus such as the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. And Trump’s “tax reform” plan proposes, among other cuts, to slash the top tax rate for “pass-through” businesses — basically, owner-operated firms such as the Trump Organization — from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. <br> Claims that such action will lead to a surge in economic growth never had much credibility. Now, after the Kansas experiment, they have zero. <br> It’s tempting to say fine, go for it, let the whole country see that the policy prescriptions championed by the Republican Party lead to nothing but a world of pain — except for the wealthy, who get to pad their bank accounts. But this is no academic exercise. Real people will suffer needlessly. <br> The GOP trembles before tax-cut guru Grover Norquist, who wants to reduce government “to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.” But it is failed trickle-down ideology that deserves to be snuffed out.

 There are many ways to evaluate the Trump presidency at the six-month mark. What I am struck by is the path not taken, the lost opportunity. During the campaign, it was clear that Donald Trump had many flaws, but he tapped into a real set of problems facing the United States and a deep frustration with the political system. Additionally, he embraced and expressed — somewhat inconsistently — a populism that went beyond the traditional left-right divide. What would things look like at this point if President Trump had governed in the manner of a pragmatic, jobs-oriented reformer relentlessly focused on the “forgotten” Americans of whom he often speaks? <br> We have an interesting template to assist our imagination. After Trump’s election, a small group of pro-Trump intellectuals, from both left and right, banded together to launch a journal, American Affairs, that promised “the discussion of new policies that are outside of the conventional dogmas.” It’s the best forum for the articulation of the ideology behind Trump’s rise, and there has been so much interest in the journal’s views on various subjects that the editors opened the second issue with a brief summary of their editorial stance. <br> On trade, immigration and foreign policy, the editors endorse modest changes to standard U.S. policies, some of which the administration is pursuing. But on the central questions of domestic economic policy, American Affairs seems markedly different and genuinely populist. Taking on the subject at the center of Republican ideology, taxes, the editors profess to be “quite skeptical of the conservative orthodoxy that reflexively prescribes tax cuts as the cure-all for every ill.” Although corporate tax reform is warranted, the editors say, “reducing upper-income tax rates is unlikely to address core economic challenges in any significant way.” Instead, they recommend eliminating mechanisms by which the rich evade taxation. In addition, the journal denounces financial deregulation and calls for higher taxes on hedge-fund and private-equity managers. It embraces large and direct government expenditures on infrastructure, warning against relying heavily on the private sector. On health care, the editors come out openly in favor of universal coverage and suggest two options, a single-payer system or a version of the Swiss system, which is basically Obamacare with a real mandate. <br> Needless to say, this has not been the Trump agenda. But reading these intelligent ideas raises the interesting question, why not? All of the policies proposed above would have helped the “forgotten” people whose cause Trump champions. <br> There have been two cardinal features of the Trump presidency so far. The first is that, far from being a populist breakout, it has followed a fairly traditional Republican agenda — repeal Obamacare, weaken Dodd-Frank, cut taxes, deregulate industry. Trump’s anemic infrastructure plan is little more than tax credits for private investors. The only real break with Republican tradition has been on foreign policy, where Trump is pursuing a truly bizarre and mercurial agenda that seems to be inspired by his own personal passions and peeves — instituting the travel ban, demanding payment from allies, embracing autocrats who flatter him and his family. <br> The second defining feature of the Trump administration has been incompetence. As many have pointed out, had Trump chosen to begin his presidency with a large infrastructure bill, he would have put the Democrats in a terrible bind. They would have had to support him, even though this would have enraged the party’s base. Instead, Trump chose health care, a complicated, difficult issue sure to unite his opposition and divide Republicans. Consequently, very little has actually been done. Obamacare has not been repealed, no money has been appropriated for the border wall, NAFTA is still standing, and there is no tax reform bill, nor an agreement to raise the debt ceiling. Even in deregulation, an area of broad presidential authority, little of substance has been accomplished. Many of Trump’s executive actions have been to “review” various measures. An environmental activist told me that he has tried to cheer up his staff by pointing out that the Trump administration’s words have rarely been followed by successful deeds. <br> Trump could have quickly begun reshaping American politics. He discerned voices that others didn’t, understood what those people wanted to hear and articulated much of it. But when it came time to deliver, it turned out that he had no serious idea or policies, nor even the desire to search for them. He just wanted to be president, meeting world leaders, having Oval Office photo ops and flying on Air Force One, while delegating the actual public policy to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) or Vice President Pence. So far, Trump has turned out to be something far less revolutionary than expected — a standard-issue, big-business Republican, albeit an incompetent one, wrapped in populist clothing. <br> Read more from Fareed Zakaria’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Eugene Robinson: This country deserves much better than Trump <br> Ronald A.

 The headline on Allan Sloan’s Sept. 29 Deals column, “How the GOP could repeal the ‘death tax’ — and rip off 99.8% of us,” was misleading. <br> The estate tax often is a second tax on people’s accumulated savings, which in many cases had already been taxed. <br> A more accurate headline would have been: “How the GOP could repeal the ‘death tax’ — and stop taxing for a second time the accumulated savings of married couples who leave an estate worth more than $11 million.” <br> Bill Miller, Rockville 
 Do President Trump’s Cabinet members have to call him “Dear Leader” when graced by his august presence? Must they enter the Oval Office on bended knee? Do they weep with joy when he reaches out a delicate hand and pats their bowed heads? <br> One of the most appalling aspects of the Trump presidency is the sycophancy he requires of the officials who serve him. Trump demands not just loyalty but flattery, too. He insists that his courtiers treat his pronouncements, however absurd or offensive, as infallible holy writ. Members of his Cabinet have made a humiliating bargain: humor him, suck up to him, and maybe — just maybe — he will leave you alone and let you make policy. <br> Or maybe not. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been working as best he knows how to address the issue of North Korea’s nuclear program through diplomacy. Trump undercut him with a tweet, saying Tillerson was “wasting his time.” <br> If Trump actually believes there is a viable military solution to the North Korea problem, he’s even crazier and more dangerous than I thought. More likely, in my view, is that Trump is annoyed at Tillerson for being insufficiently servile. I doubt the president has forgotten or forgiven Tillerson’s reaction to Trump’s deeply offensive “many sides” analysis of Charlottesville. “The president speaks for himself,” Tillerson coldly said. <br> And Trump clearly went ballistic Wednesday at the NBC News report that Tillerson, during a meeting with defense officials, had referred to him as a “moron.” The president loosed a flurry of tweets claiming the whole thing was “fake news,” culminating in a demand Thursday for a congressional investigation of news outlets whose reporting he does not like. <br> This is happening in the United States. <br> Tillerson is no diplomatic genius, but he is no flunky, either. He occupies an office established by the Constitution and once held by Thomas Jefferson. It was painful to see him have to call a news conference — which he never does — to deny that he actually called the president a moron. Except that he didn’t deny it. He later sent out a spokeswoman to say “the secretary does not use that type of language.” <br> Tillerson pushed back hard against the suggestion that he had considered resigning and been talked out of it by Vice President Pence. But widespread news reports tell a different story. Tillerson, whom Trump is said to sometimes deride as “Mr. Exxon,” never would have become chief executive of one of the biggest corporations in the world if he had valued blind loyalty over principled expertise in his subordinates. His business-world methodology has not translated well to government, but he approaches his duties in a sober and responsible way. <br> Trump does not. Retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, encouraged Tillerson to stay on because he, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly “are those people that help separate our country from chaos.” Corker said he hoped the secretary of state would be more “supported” in his diplomatic efforts. Fat chance. <br> It’s hard to imagine Tillerson being willing to take much more of this, but other Cabinet members have made their peace with the Sun King’s demand for unctuous deference. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin looked as if he were in physical pain as he went on the Sunday shows and defended Trump’s demand for NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to be fired. <br> Chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, who almost quit after Charlottesville, told reporters he stayed on for the “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to enact sweeping tax reform. Maybe the recently departed Tom Price stuck around so long at Health and Human Services for all the sweet travel perks. <br> What these officials don’t seem to fully grasp is that their policy initiatives can be undercut by the president at any time, and probably will. Look at budget director Mick Mulvaney, who has big ideas about shrinking government and the deficit. He didn’t anticipate having to wipe away Puerto Rico’s debt, which Trump offhandedly promised to do. <br> Someday we may look back and thank these officials for standing between our nation and the abyss. For now, I suppose they will continue telling Trump how strong he is, how wise, how special. Why, did you see him tossing those rolls of paper towels in Puerto Rico? Magnificent! The ungrateful NBA star Stephen Curry, who still is not invited to the White House, can only dream of such form! <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IF POLITICAL rhetoric alone killed tax rules, a favor to the rich known as the carried-interest loophole would have been dead and buried long ago. In a nutshell, this particular break enables hedge-fund managers and similarly situated wealthy investment professionals to pay only the 23.8 percent federal capital gains rate on much of their annual earnings, instead of the 39.6 percent ordinary income rate. Everyone in politics — from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the populist left to President Trump on the populist right — has denounced this giveaway, which costs the treasury roughly $2 billion per year. <br> Yet somehow it survives. President Barack Obama opposed it but balked at repealing it via executive order, though some legal experts think that’s possible; meanwhile, Congress has not enacted repeal, pending a broader tax-reform bill that would supposedly sweep out unjustifiable loopholes. <br> Of course, it is also possible to abolish carried interest in the process of making the tax code considerably less fair overall. That is the apparent approach of Mr. Trump’s recently floated proposal for a tax overhaul, albeit by implication. Mr. Trump would abolish the carried-interest loophole — then instantly render that irrelevant: His plan lowers the top tax rate on all businesses — those incorporated as shareholder-owned enterprises, which currently face a top rate of 35 percent, and so-called pass-through entities, whose profits are taxed at their owners’ ordinary income rate — to 15 percent. Obviously, hedge funds could simply reorganize as pass-through entities to pay the 15 percent rate, an even sweeter deal than the 23.8 percent they pay on carried interest now. <br> Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump’s treasury secretary, promised unspecified “rules” to prevent excessive tax avoidance, but they’d have to be strong rules indeed to overcome these incentives. House Republican tax plans would not cut the top business rate to 15 percent, but they could give rise to some pass-through mischief of their own. The GOP proposal unveiled last year would have cut the top individual rate on ordinary income to 33 percent, while capping the rate on pass-through businesses at 25 percent. In other words, it would create a new incentive — to the tune of an eight-percentage-point-lower tax rate — for taxpayers to recharacterize their earnings as business profits. If you think that won’t happen very often, think again: When Kansas created a similar differential in its state income taxes five years ago, nearly 400,000 filers took advantage of it, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The resulting loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue helped create the chronic fiscal crisis that has roiled that state in recent years. <br> In short, tax reform can be a good cause or a license for mischief — something to keep in mind the next time you hear the president trumpeting his opposition to carried interest. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: The dumbest part of Trump’s dumb tax plan <br> George F.

 Because the government refuses to pass serious gun-control legislation, there is a good solution for forcing it to do so. The international community should boycott all travel to the United States until serious gun-control action is taken that will convince the world it is reasonably safe to travel here. <br> I have friends in Europe who refuse to travel to the United States due to gun violence. We need all international travelers to do the same. It is the only answer. <br> Jim Coyle, Falls Church <br> I woke up Monday morning to the news of mass killings in Las Vegas. With a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, I tried to go about my business, with varied success. <br> I remember feeling this way on April 19, 1995; April 20, 1999 ; and Sept. 11, 2001. I worked then for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. One thing I learned during those years is that we can all have what Alexander calls a “terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.” This is why I refuse to own a gun. <br> As a former weapons-trained law enforcement officer, I have a healthy appreciation for guns. You can feel mighty powerful holding an M-16 assault weapon — especially after you just shot a round perfectly onto the target during annual training. But what happens if you take a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day and infuse it with a weapon and ammo stored in your home? Lots of terrible, horrible, no good, very bad things. <br> We can debate the Second Amendment together another time. Suffice it to say I’ve stood face to face with men like Stephen Paddock, and nothing is going to convince me that anyone needs to own dozens of guns. <br> Stacy Korbelak, Odenton <br> Legislators, have some empathy and put yourselves in the position of the survivors and the families of the dead. If you can’t conjure any empathy over gun violence, then get out of public office, because so many of us who do vote are sick and tired of your procrastination, refusing to take definitive action to make our surroundings and social venues safe. Show loyalty to the safety and interests of the American people instead of bowing to the National Rifle Association. <br> Be creative in coming up with solutions. Instead of working on tax reform, which may hurt many of us, introduce legislation that places inordinately high taxes on ammunition and bans certain types of it. <br> Carole Jennings, Silver Spring <br> After reading the Oct. 3 editorial “The worst kind of American exceptionalism,” I urge all Americans to study the reasonable and effective rules controlling gun ownership that Australia enacted under a right-wing prime minister, John Howard. There are extensive police checks, a written test and a waiting period before licenses are issued for a specific weapon. It works well. <br> As an American who spends a lot of time down under, I am heartbroken to see that it can be done and that thousands of American lives could be saved. <br> Nicholas Hammond, Washington <br> After Sunday’s shooting in Las Vegas, I want to ask our lawmakers, when will my rights be considered? When will they address my rights to feel safe, to allow my children to go to large gatherings or even go to school, to pray in church, to ride Metro without fearing that some evil person who has purchased guns legally will start firing his or her weapons at me or my loved ones? <br> The people of this country are tired of hearing that the National Rifle Association is invincible. I’m tired of hearing “prayers for the people who were injured.” Take action. Protect your constituents with stricter gun-control measures. <br> Martha Yates, Arlington <br> I am a gun rights advocate and firmly support the Second Amendment. I own handguns. I learned to shoot at an early age from my father, who was in law enforcement. I am an infantry combat veteran of the Korean War. I am absolutely opposed to civilians owning any form of assault weapons and multi-round magazines. The only reason for these weapons is to kill people, and they belong in law enforcement and the military. <br> My proposal: Let shooting ranges have these weapons and rent them to people to shoot on the premises. <br> Carroll Rueben, Montclair 
 Editor’s note: On Friday, The Post conducted an email debate between Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former congressman Tom Perriello, Democratic candidates in Virginia’s 2017 gubernatorial election. The questions were asked by Post editorial board member Lee Hockstader. The transcript has been edited for style and clarity. <br> [Meet the candidates running to become Virginia’s next governor] <br> Lee Hockstader: Polls suggest many primary voters are struggling to decide between the two of you, which might reflect the civility of your race or how narrow the policy differences are. <br> Dr. Northam, you’ve suggested you’d work better with the Republican-controlled legislature than your opponent, by dint of your experience and relationships in Richmond, but it seems a stretch to think GOP leaders in the General Assembly will allow any Democratic governor to claim a major victory. Mr. Perriello, you’ve made a case for yourself as a younger, very liberal candidate with what you call “bold” ideas, but a lot of those ideas — like soaking the rich with a tax hike to provide two years of debt-free community college for any Virginian — are simply non-starters for Republicans, no matter how much you campaign in conservative parts of Virginia. <br> What can each of you say to sharpen the distinctions between you so voters can understand how you would govern differently? Why are you a better bet than your opponent? <br> [GOP hopefuls for Va. governor debate Metro, the opioid epidemic, Confederate statues] <br> Ralph Northam: With over a decade of experience working in Richmond, I’ve developed relationships with leaders of both parties. In fact, one of my first experiences in the legislature [was] to lead the fight to pass a smoking ban in restaurants. While it failed the first time, I learned some lessons after taking a licking, brought Republicans to the table to talk about the benefits for Virginia. The very next year, we passed the ban and then-Gov. [Timothy M.] Kaine signed it into law. The way we got it done was to explain how much it was hurting our economy and costing our health care. We were able to succeed despite Big Tobacco’s efforts. <br> I led similar efforts to establish firm guidelines for dealing with concussions in Virginia’s student athletes. As a pediatric neurologist, I could leverage my expertise, and my colleagues respected that experience because of the relationships I established. <br> Having been a member of Kaine’s climate change commission, I led the charge to gather bipartisan support for resiliency to combat sea-level rise. I’ve continued that leadership under Gov. [Terry] McAuliffe’s administration. <br> Finally, I educated people on both sides of aisle on the transvaginal ultrasound bill, and because of my conversations, we were able to remove the transvaginal portion of the mandate. <br> So, I’ve got a proven record of bringing together bipartisan support and doing what’s in the best interest of Virginia, and I can do the same as governor. <br> Tom Perriello: The track record of solving problems within the confines of Richmond hasn’t worked. What I’ve done — both here and abroad — is bring people together, from the grass roots, to solve problems that pundits and observers said were impossible. I think that’s a useful skill set. The “Virginia Way” stopped working for average Virginians a long time ago; what we need is a new way that builds solutions directly among the people, across region and race. <br> That’s why in this campaign, I am the only candidate to offer a fully paid-for plan that guarantees universal pre-K and two years of truly free community college. I designed this plan not inside my own head; these are ideas I’ve heard at more than 350 public events across Virginia, including many in Trump country. I’m the only candidate from either party who’s rejected Dominion’s campaign contributions. I’m the only candidate clearly opposed to two fracked-gas pipelines that would cut across Virginia. I was the first candidate to call for a living wage of $15 an hour, to put fixing our criminal-justice system and ending the racial wealth gap on the table, to say Virginia should join an interstate climate alliance to confront climate change, and to call for enshrining the right to choose in our state constitution. This is about being bold and leading on the major issues affecting Virginia. I think leadership is about identifying the problem and solutions and building a political coalition to make them happen. I find voters across the political spectrum responding to our willingness to put policy details and real tough decisions on the table. <br> Hockstader: Dr. Northam, doesn’t Mr. Perriello also have a proven record as a leader? <br> Northam: I believe it’s a matter of experience in Richmond, a health-care provider and veteran versus experience in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. The politics of getting things done in Richmond can be very complicated, and it takes someone who has spent the time to know the issues and develop the relationships with key members of both parties to make progress. <br> Perriello: I bring executive experience from outside of Richmond and outside of politics to the table, like Govs. McAuliffe and [Mark R.] Warner did, and people have seen that leadership in this race where we’ve set both the tone and policy agenda. <br> Northam: While it’s easy to say that from someone who has not been in Richmond, I believe there are Democratic leaders across Virginia, including Sens. Kaine and Warner, and Gov. McAuliffe, who would say that we’ve made tremendous progress, and understand there is more to be done. <br> Hockstader: Mr. Perriello, hasn’t Dr. Northam, to use your words, also identified problems and solutions? <br> Perriello: We appreciate that Dr. Northam has agreed with many of the policy positions that we’ve led on and introduced into this campaign. I believe that our campaign, talking about both needing to be a firewall against the hate and bigotry of the Trump administration and enacting a bold agenda of turning a cycle of debt to a cycle of opportunity in Virginia, has been unique in this primary. I also am the only candidate who’s identified exactly how I will pay for my full agenda, and we find that voters across the political spectrum appreciate that a great deal. <br> Northam: Since he has not been in Richmond, he may not be aware that I have been fighting for things like gun safety reform, preventing offshore drilling, reproductive rights and pre-K for years. <br> My proposals, like my G3 program, will improve the economy, train the workforce, and are fiscally responsible. This can get done in Richmond. My total proposals equal $67 million and can be funded through comprehensive tax reform and economic growth, and are not reliant on a billion-dollar tax increase that will not pass the General Assembly. <br> Perriello: There is no scenario in which proposals like truly universal pre-K, raising teacher pay and paid leave cost only $67 million. A billion-dollar revenue plan did pass under a Republican governor with your support. So what is the distinction when this is for a progressive working-families agenda? To be clear: We don’t raise taxes by a billion dollars; the plan includes spending cuts, tax reform and closing loopholes for big corporations as well. <br> Hockstader: Dr. Northam, would you care to respond to your opponent’s skepticism regarding the cost of your program proposals? <br> Northam: I’m proud to have used all the tools available to Virginia, including securing a federal grant to fund the program. While there is more work to be done, we were able to open up 13,000 more new pre-K slots in Virginia last year. That’s a good start. <br> The only way to address these solutions is to have the relationships and bipartisan coalition necessary to get the job done. I took a key role in the transportation plan that was passed, and as governor I plan to be part of the solution to creating a floor in the gas tax with bipartisan support. We must make sure we adequately fund Virginia’s transportation system. <br> You have laid out policy proposals for well over a billion, and a tax increase of over a billion dollars; what’s left for transportation? <br> Perriello: My proposal is not a billion-dollar tax increase, and suggesting it is sounds more like something that would come out of Ed Gillespie’s mouth than a Democrat’s! It includes major spending cuts and closing loopholes that benefit corporations to level the playing field for small businesses and invest in education. <br> Northam: I think we can both agree that Ed Gillespie’s tax plan is a farce and nothing more than a giveaway to the rich. <br> According to your campaign, your plan increases revenue by more than $1.1 billion. <br> Hockstader: Would either of you support removing and relocating the statue of Robert E. Lee in the Old Hall of the Virginia House of Delegates? How about the statue of Stonewall Jackson on the grounds of the state Capitol? If so, why? If not, why not? <br> Northam: I believe these statues belong in a museum but that the decision belongs to local communities. In this instance, the power rests in the General Assembly, and it’s a worthy conversation for us to have. <br> In order to be a more inclusive society, we need to elevate the parts of our complicated history that have all too often been ignored. <br> This means memorializing people like Barbara Johns and Oliver Hill, but also men like Samuel Wilbert Tucker, who was the leading attorney for the NAACP in the state of Virginia in the ’50s and ’60s and coordinated the sit-in at the Alexandria library in 1939. Or Mozella Jordan Price , who became supervisor of African American schools in Appomattox County in 1919 and served until 1963. <br> We need to remember the painful aspects of history and not omit them simply because they are difficult to discuss. <br> It is why the 400th anniversary of the arrival of African slaves at Fort Monroe is so important to commemorate, and we must do so in a way that helps spur a conversation about the more painful parts of our history. <br> Perriello: I strongly support the valuable conversation we are having about how we memorialize, and frankly understand, our past. In my home town of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, a majority of human beings during the Civil War were black. And it is important that we not discount their lived experience by three-fifths. I have worked on truth and reconciliation commissions in other countries, and often it is the process of these decisions — the conversation — that is as important as the outcome. I have called for a commission on racial healing and transformation, building on tremendously valuable local initiatives to look systematically at these questions. <br> Growing up in Virginia, our textbooks gave Reconstruction less than a page, but it is one of the most profound moments of our history. We cannot understand today’s racial wealth gap — where the median net worth of an African American family is one-eleventh that of the median white family — but jumping from slavery to today with a brief stop at Jim Crow. We must understand that most of these memorials were put up not after the Civil War but during moments of racial progress for African Americans. This does not need to be seen as a zero-sum game but as a great puzzle that we ask all Virginians to solve about our past to form a fuller picture for our future. <br> Hockstader: Mr. Perriello: remove Stonewall and Lee from the Capitol or not? <br> Perriello: I personally believe the right outcome will be to move them, but I have learned as someone who has done transitional justice professionally that designing a truly inclusive process and addressing all these issues together, rather than one-off, is more effective for the ultimate goal of healing, transformation and a truly accurate history. <br> Hockstader: You’ve both proposed a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than double the state’s current rate. Some economists would say that’s at odds with each of your stated goals to juice Virginia’s growth rate, which currently stands at 48th among the states. Your responses? <br> Perriello: Actually, economic data clearly shows that raising the minimum wage is a growth strategy. One of the greatest barriers to real growth over the past two decades has been the myth of trickle-down economics. In dozens of past experiences of federal and state minimum-wage increases, job creation has risen and small business has benefited, including the restaurant and hospitality sectors that claim concern. This is because no successful business looks at only one side of their ledger sheet — costs — they look at the net between costs and revenue. When the working and middle class have more disposable income, it is our greatest indicator of real growth. <br> This is also about something our conservative allies can appreciate, which is that raising the minimum wage reduces welfare rolls. It moves more people off of public assistance and into taxpaying jobs. Over recent decades, welfare benefits have not gotten effectively better but the benefits of working have gotten far worse. Just keeping with inflation would have us at a $10-an-hour minimum wage, and if wages had kept with productivity, it would be at $22 an hour. What studies have shown repeatedly is that a mother going to work for less than $15 an hour will typically lose money by going to work, largely due to child-care costs, transportation costs and lost benefits. We need to make work pay to grow the economy, and that is something liberals and conservatives should agree on. <br> This is why a more conservative state like West Virginia has raised the minimum wage but a gerrymandered legislature here in Virginia has not. <br> Northam: Virginia’s minimum wage is pegged to the federal minimum wage, which right now is $7.25 an hour and hasn’t risen in nearly 10 years. That means that right now Virginia’s minimum wage provides less than 40 percent of a living wage for an adult, and one-fifth of a living wage for an adult Virginian with two children. <br> The facts are clear: Our economy can afford a $15 minimum wage if it’s phased in responsibly over time. Today, our low-wage workers earn less per hour than someone working at their level did 50 years ago. That’s just unacceptable, especially considering our economy has grown dramatically over the past 50 years. <br> Oftentimes, I hear critics tell me that a $15 minimum wage is not needed in rural Virginia. Yet they leave out the lack of transportation options available to them and the higher expense of driving in those areas. We should be mindful that folks across Virginia are consumers, and more money in their pockets means more money they can spend at our businesses. <br> Hockstader: Another question for both of you: As you know, there’s no legal definition of a sanctuary jurisdiction, but Arlington County seems to qualify: Its sheriff won’t honor ICE detainers to hold undocumented immigrants in jail past their release date unless ICE secures a warrant issued by a court. <br> Do you regard Arlington’s stance as admirable, and would you encourage other localities in Virginia to emulate it? <br> Northam: I believe Arlington’s stance has been defended by Attorney General [Mark R.] Herring in 2015. His opinion stated that detainer request are optional. This mirrored the decisions by other states and local governments, and President [Barack] Obama’s Department of Homeland Security. Arlington is well within their legal bounds to take this action. I should add that I was proud to break a tie when Republicans tried to scapegoat immigrants for political gain. They knew full well there are no sanctuary cities in Virginia, but they put up a bill to scare immigrant communities. That’s not right. I was glad to put a stop to it. <br> Perriello: We support Arlington and others using all options for non-cooperation with the unconstitutional and unconscionable directives of the Trump administration. Within the bounds of the law, I will ensure that Virginia uses all powers possible to remain an inclusive state that ensures the dignity and security of all who live here. This includes discouraging the 287(g) partnerships that blur the distinction between deportation agents and local law enforcement in ways that undermine public safety. The day President Trump threatened to cut off funding, I called this out as an empty threat at odds with the anti-commandeering jurisprudence of our Constitution. Circuit courts have now reached that same conclusion. We must ensure safe, dignified spaces — particularly our schools, houses of worship and clinics — and make sure families do not go to bed at night terrified they may be separated at any moment from their children. <br> Hockstader: Arguably, there are at least two sanctuary counties: Arlington and Chesterfield. Do you admire their policies and would you like to see them proliferate in the commonwealth? <br> Northam: There simply are no sanctuary cities in Virginia. Cities and counties have the authority to release prisoners who are eligible for release, and Arlington and Chesterfield are exercising that authority. The attorney general has ruled that federal detainer requests are optional, and I support his opinion. <br> Hockstader: In response to the opioid epidemic, from which three Virginians die daily, would you support Virginia bringing a lawsuit against drug manufacturers like the one Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced this week? <br> Perriello: Yes. I have repeatedly called out Big Pharma for their role in this crisis, including during multiple visits to clinics in Southwest Virginia. I showed my willingness to stand up to the drug lobby during the fight for Obamacare, including my vote for an early, stronger version that allowed Medicare to negotiate cheaper prescription drug rates. This is also why we support the use of medical marijuana as a more effective element of care that does not come from Big Pharma. <br> Northam: This is a multifaceted challenge. As a provider, I’ve been traveling around educating other providers, as well as those in training, to ensure proper management of both acute and chronic pain. As lieutenant governor, I’ve led Virginia’s effort to combat this crisis. This includes increasing funding for community service boards so that we now have same-day access, giving the public through the commissioner of health a blanket prescription for naloxone to reverse the deadly side effects, and working with Attorney General Herring to stop the influx of opioids, as those are now being laced with fentanyl and carfentanil. <br> Attorney General Herring has made some moves forward on this. I appreciate the spirit of Attorney General DeWine’s lawsuit, and if Attorney General Herring believes there is a case to be made, I would support his decision. <br> Hockstader: Turning to a local issue central to the concerns of many Northern Virginians, how would you fix Metro and help meet its anticipated need for at least $15 billion in additional capital funds over the coming decade? Specifically, would you support a regional sales tax in which Northern Virginia would be assessed in coordination with suburban Maryland and the District of Columbia? <br> Northam: I don’t think there is any question among leaders in Virginia, D.C. and Maryland that we need to fix Metro and find a dedicated revenue source for the system. It is an economic driver for the entire region, and one of the biggest economic drivers in Virginia. <br> However, as you well know, the complex political landscape across differing local and state governments makes this reality hard to achieve. So the first thing we need to do is create an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability for the governance and operation of the system. Restoring trust for riders, residents and policymakers is the only way we can change the current dynamic. <br> Second, as with tax reform, the legislature is going to reject any dedicated funding plan they feel is forced upon them. To prevent that, I will use the LaHood commission report to guide negotiations with Republicans in Richmond and Northern Virginia stakeholders to find a fair agreement on funding Metro, and to work with our neighbors in D.C. and Maryland. <br> I’ve long worked with Republicans and Democrats to ensure we have the necessary funding for transportation, even campaigning in 2007 that new revenue was needed to fix a transportation system that hadn’t seen investment since 1986. I wanted to break the gridlock in Richmond and on our roads. I think I’ve done a little of both by supporting bipartisan transportation packages. <br> I know this can’t be done without working together. There’s no one in the race better equipped than me to do that, because I have the record of delivering results for Virginia. <br> Perriello: WMATA has both governance and revenue problems that are being greatly exacerbated by the current safety problems and service disruptions that have substantially reduced ridership. I would support this or other initiatives that would produce the necessary investments in our regional public transportation options. I have lived for the past six years in Alexandria and understand these problems both as a consumer and as a manager. When I worked at the State Department, members of my team wouldn’t know on any given day if they were going to make it into work by 7 or 9 a.m., or make it home by 7 or 8:30 p.m. from work. When I oversaw the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review for President Obama, we looked at the transportation challenges in Northern Virginia as a national security threat, both because of the vulnerabilities it introduced and because it is getting harder to recruit and retain top national security personnel as costs rise and quality of life is eroded based on traffic. We have to ensure the region can tackle this problem. <br> Hockstader: So you would support a regional sales tax, Mr. Perriello? In your view, is any other means of raising substantial sums of new revenue preferable to a regional sales tax? And would you support scrapping binding arbitration — do you see that as part of the governance problem to which you refer? <br> Northam: Fair compensation and benefits for workers must be respected. Ultimately, we need to build a system of transparency and accountability within Metro. However, without out a dedicated revenue source, any other reforms will not be enough. <br> Perriello: Here, we disagree. I think the “solutions” coming out of Richmond on transportation have not come close to getting the job done. It has produced gridlock in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads and disastrous toll deals for tunnels. The “Virginia Way” approach stopped working with the radical gerrymandering years ago, and Virginians are paying a big price for it. Political change comes from building consensus and support across Virginia that we then take to Richmond. <br> To your question, Lee: As I said above, yes, I would support the regional sales tax. Our preference is for whatever revenue source and governance reforms can garner sufficient support to solve the problem. <br> Hockstader: Would you support a dedicated regional sales tax, Dr. Northam? <br> Northam: I agree with my friend [state] Sen. [George L.] Barker, who said, and I paraphrase, that we need a shared approach with states and localities, and localities having a big stake. The panel that recommended the regional sales tax made a mistake by not involving local political leaders. We need substantive discussion and debate in order to achieve consensus. In Virginia, the entire commonwealth needs to be on board, and they won’t be if they are dictated to. We can’t hamstring ourselves before we start the discussion in Richmond. It should be an option, but the discussion in Richmond and across Virginia needs to happen first. <br> Hockstader: Gov. McAuliffe released the outlines of a climate plan last month that calls for pricing carbon dioxide emissions and joining with other states to trade pollution credits. Do you support this idea, and is it appropriate to act on it without the legislature’s consent? How would you flesh out the plan? <br> Northam: Yes, I support it, and applauded him when it was announced. I think Gov.McAuliffe was well within his authority to make that decision. In light of Donald Trump’s idiotic and disastrous decision to leave the Paris agreement, it’s even more important for states to lead. This is why I announced today that I would bring Virginia into the United States Climate Alliance, and I would continue Gov. McAuliffe’s carbon reduction executive directive. <br> Perriello: We strongly support Gov. McAuliffe’s decision as vital for protecting our climate and for ensuring Virginia stops falling behind on the clean-energy jobs and businesses of today. Virginia has the second-most-vulnerable coastline in America, and the ecological treasure and economic driver of the Chesapeake Bay stands at risk. We must pursue strong measures under this new rule to make Virginia a leader on climate and clean energy. That’s why I was the first candidate to commit to the new interstate climate alliance and the only candidate to refuse donations from Dominion Power and oppose two fracked-gas pipelines in Virginia. These positions, interestingly enough, are widely popular among third-party and Republican voters we meet across the state, who see a monopoly approach to energy production as long out of date. <br> The private sector can help drive solutions, if we create a modern framework of incentives. I have spent much of my life advancing these common-sense reforms, including through the cap-and-trade bill in Congress and new energy business investments in Southside Virginia. We have fallen behind North Carolina on solar energy and risk losing the wind industry to Maryland because our utilities have too much power in Richmond. Dominion is full of good, smart people stuck in a very bad monopoly business model. We should be creating the space for farmers and small-business owners to take over the energy production of the future. It creates more jobs, more efficiency and more local business. <br> President Trump’s disastrous move to pull out of the Paris agreement only reinforces the importance of strong state leadership on fighting climate change. I will ensure that Virginia becomes a leader on climate sustainability, distributed energy production and smart-grid technology. <br> Hockstader: Final question: High-quality charter schools have proved to be a successful alternative for many students, particularly children at high risk. It is one reason that they were promoted by the Obama administration. So explain why you want to continue to keep them out of Virginia when there are schools in many communities that have so consistently failed their students — many of them in predominantly black and low-income areas — and when there is no hope of change or improvement. <br> Perriello: The only problem with this question as posed is, well, evidence. The performance of charter schools has simply not exceeded performance within the system, despite years of investments. There have also been many legitimate concerns raised in how these have proceeded. Vouchers are also a plan that often make policymakers feel good about the few cases they appear to help, instead of focusing us on how to fix the system as a whole. We need to recruit and retain good teachers, which is why I’m the only candidate who has put revenues on the table to improve teacher pay, increase counselors in schools and add universal pre-K. Early-childhood development is a far more effective investment in quality outcomes. We are also expanding options to restore career and technical training programs in high schools, and I’m the only candidate to provide two years of apprenticeship programs, trade school or community college education. <br> The evidence does, however, show one clear trend, which is that schools in areas of concentrated poverty are far more likely to be underperforming. Instead of blaming the teachers and principals, we should ask why we have not done more to reduce poverty. In Virginia, we pay poverty wages of $14,000 a year to countless struggling parents. I meet parents every week who work two full-time jobs for less than $30,000 and add another 10 hours of commute time to get to a community with quality schools where they can afford to live. Every one of them would rather be at home helping with homework and cooking a healthy meal. These are not bad parents. They are exceptional parents who are finding ways to keep the lights on for their kids in an economy that is crushing the poor and working class. Some of the solutions to our education performance must be found outside the classroom, in restoring the broken promise of social mobility and economic security for all Virginians. <br> Northam: I grew up on a small farm on the Eastern Shore. My opportunities began with my public school education. Knowing that, it’s one of the reasons I have been a big supporter of public education in Virginia. My wife, Pam, was a K-5 science teacher, so she has been a major influence on me as well. <br> It’s one of the reasons I was proud to support raising teacher pay in the state Senate and as lieutenant governor. But teacher pay in Virginia ranks 30th in the nation, while we rank 10th in per capita personal income. If we’re going to recruit and retain talented, good teachers, we have to step up to the plate and put our money where our mouth is and say we’re going to make K-12 education a priority. I’ve also been proud to work on reforming Standards of Learning so that we teach our children how to think creatively rather than multiple-choice tests. This will go a long way toward helping children and educators. <br> I have also been involved as part of the Children’s Cabinet modifying our high school curriculum to emphasize vocational and technical training, preparing our students for higher-paying, high-tech STEM-related 21st-century jobs. <br> With regards to charter schools or vouchers, we need to make sure that we fund K-12 first before we move on to other things like charter schools. <br> The fundamental reason charter schools have not moved forward on a wider scale in Virginia is because every proposal to come through the General Assembly would limit the local school board’s authority to grant the charter. Making sure these decisions are left to our local leaders and those closest to the communities is vital. Second, the charter proposals seen in Virginia would ultimately divert much-needed funding from school divisions, often those that are in the most need. <br> We’d be better off revising Standards of Quality formulas to better eliminate disparities among different regions across the commonwealth and so that every child in Virginia has the same opportunity to quality education regardless of where they live. <br> Finally, I am proud that we secured federal dollars to fund 13,000 pre-K slots for low-income children. With the goal of universal access to pre-K, tax dollars can be better spent expanding access to all Virginia children. <br> Hockstader: Thank you to you both.

 Psst. Hey, you. Wanna read something dangerous? <br> It’s a government document so incendiary that the feds have tried to suppress it. They’ve purged it from their websites and disavowed its claims. <br> But it’s not about Roswell, or who killed JFK. It’s not even about climate change. <br> It’s something far juicier: a 34-page technical paper about corporate income taxes. <br> And it’s a document that matters if you’re trying to game out whether (and how much) enormous corporate tax cuts will trickle down to workers. <br> See, prior to 2008, whenever Treasury crunched the numbers on this subject, staffers assumed that corporate income taxes were borne only by owners of capital. That is: shareholders. <br> But toward the end of the George W. Bush administration, the non-political career people in Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis, a sort of internal think tank, began developing a new model taking into account newer research. <br> In 2012, they released a paper explaining their latest findings: that 82 percent of corporate taxes were borne by capital owners, and 18 percent were borne by labor. Workers don’t literally write the check, of course, but corporate taxes may discourage investment, and therefore lead to lower wages. <br> Figuring out who actually bears the burden of taxes, and who therefore benefits from corporate tax cuts, is thorny. We have limited data available, after all, and no true controlled experiments for changes in federal tax policy. But the answers these Treasury staffers produced are not so far from those of most other major nonpartisan tax crunchers, including the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center.  <br> The Treasury paper was subsequently published in an elite academic journal. Outside of tax wonk circles, the numbers were generally ignored.  <br> Until now.  <br> That’s because Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been lately claiming that nearly all of the corporate tax burden is passed on to workers. It’s an argument that he has to make if he hopes to sell the administration’s tax cuts — which even a large share of Republicans opposes — as a helping hand for the Forgotten Man. <br> On Fox News, Mnuchin claimed that “most economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers.” At an event in Kentucky, he declared that “over 80 percent of business taxes is borne by the worker.” <br> Tax watchers and interviewers began pointing out that Mnuchin’s claims were at odds not only with most credible estimates but also with those of his own staff. <br> Which clearly annoyed Mnuchin. <br> So Treasury took the unusual — unprecedented? — step of quietly deleting the inconvenient findings from its website. <br> It’s not clear when this erasure happened. The paper’s disappearance was first reported last week by the Wall Street Journal’s ace tax reporter, Richard Rubin. When I requested an interview with Treasury about the deletion, a spokesperson emailed me that “the paper was a dated staff analysis from the previous administration. It does not represent our current thinking and analysis.” <br> Which is a peculiar excuse, and not only because the paper was produced by nonpolitical staffers who still work at Treasury. Office of Tax Analysis models get revised all the time; that’s why this paper was produced in the first place, after all. <br> Updates to methodology — if that’s really all this was — do not require deletion of older technical reports, which normally stay archived online for transparency reasons. Four decades’ worth of other Office of Tax Analysis working papers somehow remain online, even though many of those have been superseded by subsequent reports. <br> In removing the paper, Trump officials are making it easier to conceal what their tax plan does, and whom it helps. This is part of a broader GOP effort to duck accountability. <br> The Senate Budget Resolution, for example, includes language that could help sideline any CBO analysis of the tax bill. <br> Surrogates on the Hill and executive branch have also been (somewhat incompetently) smearing the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The center recently produced a preliminary analysis of the Republican tax framework. It estimated that by 2027 the proposal would increase deficits by $2.4 trillion, with about 80 percent of tax cuts going to the top 1 percent. <br> Asked about these numbers on ABC’s “This Week,” Mnuchin claimed that no one can credibly estimate the effect of the plan, given how many details are still up in the air. In virtually the same breath, he also asserted that the plan will reduce deficits by $1 trillion and primarily benefit the middle class. <br> Those two statements can’t both be true, at least not simultaneously.  <br> In other words, no matter how hard Trump officials try — and as this report disappearance demonstrates, they’re trying hard — they can’t keep their own lies straight. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Will Trump’s tax cuts profit Trump? <br> Robert J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IT WAS dispiriting that Roy Moore won the Republican nomination to the U.S. Senate the same week that Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) announced he would be leaving it. But the rot runs deeper than either event would suggest. When Senate leadership is content with the kind of process and dishonesty we witnessed with health-care and now tax “reform,” neither event should come as a big surprise. <br> Certainly Mr. Moore is unfit to be a senator. Over the course of his Alabama primary campaign to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s former Senate seat, he pulled out a gun in front of a crowd, falsely claimed that certain Midwestern towns had fallen under sharia law and suggested that “maybe Putin is right” for promoting repressive anti-gay policies. If Mr. Moore were to be seated in the Senate, he would do so after having been removed twice from his position as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court — once for his refusal to take down a monument to the Ten Commandments from the courthouse and once for defying the Supreme Court’s legalization of same-sex marriage. He has declared that the rule of God must reign supreme to that of law. In 2006, he demanded that Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), newly elected to Congress, be barred from taking federal office because Mr. Ellison is Muslim. <br> While President Trump campaigned against Mr. Moore at the recommendation of Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), it would be a mistake to disregard the similarities between Mr. Trump and the insurgent judge. Both have questioned Barack Obama’s citizenship and displayed disdain for the rule of law. Like the president, Mr. Moore is scornful of Mr. McConnell and the establishment wing of the Republican Party. He ran on opposition to the Senate majority leader, and his hard-line stances would likely create even more division within an already splintered Republican caucus. <br> Yet how much moral standing does the establishment wing have to object? Mr. McConnell ended the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations and scuttled normal procedures to push repeal of the Affordable Care Act — leading to Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) call for “regular order,” which Mr. Trump mocked on Twitter. Now the Republican establishment is gearing up to pass a tax cut, again likely by dismissing and disparaging the Congressional Budget Office and shunning any Democratic input. <br> To be sure, the GOP is not the only party guilty of leveraging dysfunction to its advantage: Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) chipped away at his share of Senate traditions, too. But if the Republican leadership is afraid of what Mr. Moore could bring to Washington, it may want to reconsider the wisdom of opening the door to his hate-filled appeals and disruptive behavior by backing Mr. Trump in the first place. Otherwise, fewer and fewer public servants in the mold of Mr. Corker, long a voice for responsible governance and bipartisan cooperation, will see any point in coming to Washington in the first place. <br> Read more: <br> Roy Moore’s deep devotion to the Gospel of Bannon <br> Ed Rogers: Roy Moore’s win is bad for Alabama, and even worse for the GOP <br> Kathleen Parker: So about that ‘sexual revolution in the Republican Party’. . . <br> John McCain: It’s time Congress returns to regular order <br> Ruth Marcus: The GOP needs more men like this <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Now that the latest GOP health-care bill is dead [“Lacking support, GOP drops its health-care bill,” front page, Sept. 27] — at least for the next six months or so — the Trump administration must stop its continuing sabotage of the Affordable Care Act by slashing funds to publicize open-enrollment and by shutting down the ACA website on most Sundays for weeks on end. Congress should switch to coming up with a bipartisan bill to fix the ACA instead of trying to repeal it because it is identified with President Barack Obama. <br> Barbara van Voorst, Arlington <br> It was wonderful seeing Congress unite in welcoming House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) back to the Capitol [“Scalise returns to Capitol Hill,” front page, Sept. 29]. I certainly hope he appreciates the value of good health insurance for all U.S. citizens, as well as the need for continued coverage of preexisting conditions, now that he has joined that group. <br> Ilene Barder, Rockville <br> It does appear that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can’t seem to deliver on the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare — this after many years of trying. For his part, President Trump hasn’t missed an opportunity lately to berate Mr. McConnell, and the rest of Congress for that matter, on this issue. But we should remember that it was Mr. Trump as a candidate who assured voters that were he to be elected, Obamacare would be replaced by what he said would be better and cheaper health insurance for all. He never gave us the details, just the assurance that it would be great. And that it would happen fast. Well, what just happened wasn’t great or fast, and he should be held accountable. “Don’t blame me, I was only in charge” won’t suffice. <br> 
 President Trump has been losing so much he surely is tired of losing. <br> Yet another attempt at repealing Obamacare failed again this week in the Senate. His candidate in Alabama lost a Senate primary. He walked away from his call for a private-public infrastructure plan. His lofty vision for tax reform is fast devolving into a budget-busting tax cut. He has made no progress on his border wall. At least two of his former aides are in big trouble in the Russia probe. He is mocked by the North Korean dictator as a dotard. <br> What to do? <br> Trump’s first instinct is to deny reality. That’s what he did this week when, after Luther Strange lost to Roy Moore in Alabama, Trump erased all his tweets in support of Strange — a Soviet-style airbrushing. When the health-care bill failed, he invented a narrative that it was because a GOP senator was in the hospital. <br> At the same time, Trump is retreating further into his information cocoon, safe from unwanted facts and contrary data points. Trump aide Stephen Miller has been helping to build this happy place for Trump. When the administration was debating a refugee cap, the New York Times reported recently, Miller intervened “to ensure that only the costs — not any fiscal benefit — of [admitting more refugees] were considered.” <br> Alas, such solutions are imperfect, for they do not sway those Americans who still reside in reality-based communities. A better fix is needed. And, happily, the Trump administration has already happened on one: moving the goal posts. <br> Take, for example, the pesky goal of getting broadband service to more Americans. The Trump-era Federal Communications Commission has discovered that it is not on target to reach broadband access goals set in 2015. So, as The Post’s Brian Fung reports, the FCC is considering a solution: Lower the definition of broadband from 25 megabits per second to, say, 10. Instantly, millions of Americans would have “broadband” — without Internet speeds changing. Problem solved. <br> At the Federal Aviation Administration, likewise, an advisory panel has decided it’s too hard for airlines to hit the requirement that pilots have 1,500 hours of training, so it wants to count classroom work toward that total rather than just flying experience. The industry gets more pilots, and the flying public can rest assured that if airline pilots no longer know enough about flying planes, they at least have read books on the subject. Problem solved. <br> The president seems to be warming to goal-post shifting. On the eve of the latest Obamacare-repeal failure, he told reporters: “Eventually we’ll win, whether it’s now or later.” A loss is just a victory that has not yet materialized. <br> Many such redefinitions are perfectly consistent with Trump’s promises for deregulation and shrinking government. <br> The State Department doesn’t need so many diplomats if it redefines its mission to remove such cumbersome goals as “democracy promotion.” Budget balancing becomes easier if you simply set projected annual growth at 3 percent rather than the 2 percent economists actually expect. And bankers can no longer be accused of favoring profits over a client’s best interests when there is no requirement that they do otherwise. <br> If you think about it broadly, there is no problem Trump can’t solve by redefinition. <br> Trump’s promise to rebuild the nation’s aging infrastructure, particularly bridges and airports (for one-third the regular price!), is not looking so good. But a simple redefinition could fix this. The American Society of Civil Engineers reports that the average American bridge is 43 years old. But if the Trump administration were to define “years” for infrastructure in Jupiter years rather than Earth years, those same bridges would only be 3.6 years old. Problem solved. <br> Trump promised to eliminate, or at least cut in half, the federal debt — but the debt, now $20 trillion, continues to grow. Here, too, a simple change would help. If Trump were to denominate the federal debt in bitcoins (worth $4,170 apiece) instead of dollars, he would instantly cut the debt from 20 trillion to a mere 5 billion. Promise kept. <br> Trump has pledged to deport 11 million people living illegally in the United States — but it appears his administration is actually deporting fewer people than before. Here, a simple word change would do: Strike the word “illegally.” About 15 million people in the United States self-deport each year (we come back when our vacation or business trip is over, but Trump can leave that part out). Goal met. <br> In a broader sense, Trump’s “Make America Great Again” goal won’t hold up well when his supporters realize that coal, steel and heavy manufacturing jobs aren’t coming back. But what if he redefines greatness, not by the number of jobs but by the number of people who stand for the national anthem at football games? <br> Greatness is within reach — if we define it down. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more: <br> Robert J.

 Last year, I proposed a handy rule of thumb for evaluating the economic proposals of politicians: The more growth they promise, the worse their plan probably is. <br> Why? Because the promise of bonkers growth usually means the politicians need that bonkers growth to paper over the ginormous deficits sure to follow — in the real world, under more realistic assumptions. <br> If you assume that the economy goes gangbusters and everyone gets a lot richer, then the tax base swells, spending on social-safety-net services falls, and hallelujah! That expensive thing you want no longer looks so expensive. Maybe it’s even free! <br> This rule of thumb was useful during the presidential campaign, when candidates promised that their infrastructure, health and tax proposals would “pay for themselves” through faster growth. It’s relevant again with the “Big Six’s” new tax “plan.” <br> I put “plan” in scare-quotes here because it’s not really a plan. At best it’s an outline, offering barely more detail than the bullet points the Trump administration released in April. It doesn’t even specify the thresholds for the individual income-tax rates it proposes. It also doesn’t identify a single individual tax preference it would kill, despite claiming to simplify the code and close lots of “loopholes.” Even the state and local tax deduction, which administration officials have talked about eliminating, isn’t explicitly mentioned. <br> [Trump’s tax plan is designed to help the little people] <br> The plan’s designers may not know what their proposal is, exactly, but they know it will turbocharge growth. <br> President Trump told a group of Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday that this tax framework could lead the economy to grow more than 6 percent a year, as my Post colleagues reported. <br> To give you a sense of how ridiculous that is, the Federal Reserve’s median forecast for long-term growth is 1.8 percent, thanks in part to demographic challenges facing the country. (What matters is the long-term number, as growth rates can bounce around a lot quarter to quarter and over the course of the business cycle.) The Congressional Budget Office, in scoring Trump’s budget this year, said it would add maybe a tenth of a percentage point to growth — bringing us to a whopping 1.9 percent. <br> Trump’s own economic advisers have said they think the sum total of all his tax and regulatory policies would get us to “only” 3 percent growth, a number that has been mocked by more or less the entire economics community. <br> National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is one of the administration officials who has been using that 3 percent benchmark, which he repeated on CNBC on Thursday while declaring that perhaps we might get even “substantially over 3 percent.” <br> “We think we can pay for the entire tax cut through growth over the cycle,” he explained. <br> A Tax Policy Center estimate of the fuzzy April framework found that it would lower revenue between $3.5 trillion and $7.8 trillion over a decade, depending on which loopholes you assume get closed. Its numbers don’t change much after accounting for economic growth effects. <br> A separate estimate of the more recent framework, released by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, put the cost at about $2.2 trillion. <br> Whatever the actual number is, we know it’s in the trillions. No realistic amount of growth is going to wipe that out. <br> In light of all these grand growth projections, I propose a corollary to my earlier rule. <br> Here it is: If you promise that your policy will “pay for itself” through faster economic growth, you must commit — in advance — to cutting the programs you love most if that growth doesn’t materialize. <br> [Trump’s tax ‘miracle’: Cowardice and dishonesty] <br> For Republicans, that means writing language into their tax bill lopping trillions off defense spending. Hey, if they truly believe their plan won’t cost a dime, surely there’s no risk to our national security. <br> Otherwise, the yawning deficits that would inevitably result from the Trump plan may turn into an excuse to decimate programs Republicans are already eyeing, such as Medicaid and food stamps. In fact, “starve the beast” Republicans may see this as a best-case scenario. <br> Kansas provides a cautionary tale here. The state passed sweeping tax cuts in 2012 on promises that they would unleash boundless economic growth. Instead, the state had below-average growth and huge budget shortfalls, which led to brutal cuts to services. School districts had to end the school year early because they literally ran out of money.  <br> Eventually, after coming to terms with the failure of their supply-side experiment, the state partially reversed its disastrous tax cuts. <br> Which may be where the country ends up in a few years, if this Trump tax framework passes. But as Kansas proves, a lot of damage — including, in the federal case, bigger debt — can be done in the meantime.  <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jennifer Rubin: Let’s stop taking Trump’s tax plan seriously <br> The Post’s View: So much for the party of fiscal responsibility <br> Catherine Rampell: This nifty GOP trick will punish the poor and increase the deficit — at the same time! <br> Jennifer Rubin: Paul Ryan tries selling tax reform — without details and with a daft president <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Let’s be clear: America is an undertaxed society. Our wants and needs from government — the two blur — exceed our willingness to be taxed. This has been true for decades, but it’s especially relevant now because the number of older Americans, who are the largest beneficiaries of federal spending, is rising rapidly. Unless we’re prepared to make sizable spending cuts (and there’s no evidence we are), we need higher taxes. <br> To the extent that President Trump’s proposed “tax reform” obscures or worsens this inconvenient reality, it is a dangerous distraction. We cannot afford large tax cuts, which are pleasing to propose (“something for nothing”) but involve long-term risks that are not understood by the president or, to be fair, by economists. Piling up massive peacetime deficits is something we haven’t done before. We cannot know the full consequences. <br> Of course, Trump proposes some good ideas. Tax rates would drop for businesses and individuals. Many deductions would end. Some tax relief would go to low- and middle-income households with children — a deserving group. There are also familiar complaints. Too many benefits, it’s said, go to the wealthy. (A similar plan by candidate Trump channeled nearly half the cuts to the richest 1 percent, said the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.) <br> But the plan’s fatal defect is its effect on the publicly held federal debt. In 2016, this was $14 trillion, or 77 percent of the economy (gross domestic product). “During only one other period of U.S. history — from 1944 through 1950, because of the surge in federal spending during World War II — has that debt exceeded 70 percent of GDP,” the Congressional Budget Office says. Under present policies and reflecting the older population, the CBO projects the debt to reach $25 trillion and 89 percent of GDP by 2027. <br> Just how much Trump’s tax plan would add to this is unclear. We don’t yet have sufficient detail to judge. But the amount could be considerable. Lower rates aren’t matched by revenue-raising provisions. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the likely 10-year cost at $5.5 trillion with a range from $3 trillion to $7 trillion. <br> Why is this bad? Three standard reasons are routinely given for avoiding large and escalating deficits. <br> First, the government’s extra borrowing might raise interest rates, crowding out productive private investment. This would reduce economic growth and undermine living standards. <br> Second, some national emergency (war, pandemic, a natural disaster) might compel large borrowings that would be difficult — except at onerous interest rates — because the government’s credit rating was impaired. <br> And third, too many dollars in the world — as cash, stocks, bonds and other securities — would lead to a crisis of confidence. Investors, banks and other financial institutions wouldn’t want to hold so many dollars. The panic to sell dollars and dollar securities would cause crashes in global stock, bond and commodities markets. <br> Truth be told, economists have been making these arguments for years. None has yet come true. It’s conceivable that they might never come true. The global demand for so-called “safe assets” — financial securities that investors can trust — might sustain a growing worldwide supply of U.S. Treasury securities that, despite our problems, are still regarded as highly reliable. If so, we could cut taxes and not worry about deficits. <br> But that’s a huge gamble on the future. Do we really want to bet that what seems true today will be true a decade and roughly $15 trillion more in government debt from now? Prudence suggests not. If we lose the bet, the outcome might make the 2008-2009 financial crisis and Great Recession look like a cakewalk. <br> Taxes will ultimately follow spending upward. Even if some programs are cut, the popularity of most programs — led by Social Security and Medicare — and an aging population ensure that government spending as a share of the economy will rise. <br> Not to worry, says Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Trump’s tax cuts “will grow the economy and will create . . . trillions of dollars in additional revenues.” It’s painless. <br> The reality is that there is no automatic and guaranteed relationship between major “tax reform” and economic growth. Although lower tax rates may stimulate the economy, the effect may be neutralized by other forces (higher interest rates, weaker foreign economies, cautious consumers). Studies by the U.S. Treasury and Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation project small gains in economic growth from tax reform. <br> There is a fundamental gap between what most Americans expect from government — from highways to defense to support for the elderly — and the corresponding tax burdens. The disconnect cannot be erased by massive tax cuts. There is no spending discipline. Sooner or later, we will face higher taxes, whatever happens to Trump’s present proposals. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Matt O’Brien: Trump’s new, one-page tax plan is the same as his old, one-page tax plan <br> Catherine Rampell: The dumbest part of Trump’s dumb tax plan <br> Douglas Holtz-Eakin: Trump’s tax plan is built on a fairy tale <br> Charles Koch: Trump’s policies must not benefit only big businesses like mine <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Regarding Carlos Lozada’s Sept. 24 Outlook essay “Is Trump mentally ill? Or is America?”: <br> It’s a pretty safe bet that we will one day learn that some of President Trump’s more thoughtful aides realized that he was potentially far more dangerous than most of the public suspected and alerted others to keep a watchful eye on him, especially the generals. <br> In his classic book “The Politics of Experience,” psychiatrist R.D. Laing tells the reader,“If I could drive you out of your wretched mind, if I could tell you I would let you know.” That is, he would drive us out of our present state of mind, insanity, into a sane state of mind. Yes, if he could have, he would have, but we are so deeply in denial about our own self-destructive and almost by definition truly insane behavior, including our choice of this president, that like prisoners in the allegory of Plato’s cave, we are literally blinded by the light and turn away from the truth. <br> Laing’s book is left-leaning and socialistic, but that doesn’t mean he was wrong. Our individual behavior is highly influenced by our collective behavior, and, leaving aside its legal definition, it is insane. <br> Bernard Wilder, Potomac 
 The May 13 editorial “Make-believe tax reform” rightly reminded readers that the debate around carried interest is driven by political rhetoric. However, it failed to separate this erroneous rhetoric from the truth that carried interest is a long-standing and sound tax policy. <br> Of most concern is that the editorial board did not make the simple distinction that carried interest for hedge funds is typically classified as short-term capital gains and taxed at the same rate as ordinary income. It is long-term investments, found in private equity, real estate and venture capital, that are incentivized by a lower rate because of their long-term entrepreneurial risk-taking. Far from a “giveaway,” this tax policy is rooted in the commitment for years-long investments in a capital asset, and carried interest is retained only if the asset is profitable. <br> Who wouldn’t want to encourage long-term investment in our economy? We can all agree that our tax code should be simplified, but disincentivizing what works in order to pacify “political rhetoric” is a step in the wrong direction. <br> Mike Sommers, Washington <br> The writer is president and chief executive officer of the American Investment Council. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IN 1943, with the nation mobilized for war against fascism, schoolchildren in West Virginia were required each morning to salute the American flag. The purpose, seemingly unexceptionable — and in fact not objected to by many — was “teaching, fostering and perpetuating the ideals, principles and spirit of Americanism.” <br> However, to Jehovah’s Witnesses the flag was an “image,” which, under their religious beliefs, their children were forbidden to salute. Students refused to do so and were expelled from school; parents were prosecuted; eventually, the case reached the Supreme Court. <br> There, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, Justice Robert Jackson wrote for a 6-to-3 majority that the state could not compel children to salute the flag. Reversing a court decision from just three years earlier, Jackson wrote, in the midst of war, what remains one of the enduring statements of confidence in what truly makes America great. “To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous, instead of a compulsory routine,” he wrote, “is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds.” <br> What brings this to mind, of course, is President Trump’s latest bilious eruption. The first inclination, when he starts calling people “sons of b-----s” and waxing nostalgic for days when more concussions were inflicted for the entertainment of football fans, is to look away. It’s embarrassing, after all, to have to explain to the children that we have a president who speaks so rudely. It’s playing into the diversion he may seek when he finds himself flummoxed by Kim Jong Un or Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). And shouldn’t we be worrying about more important things — health care, tax reform, the inundation of Puerto Rico, the dangers of nuclear war? <br> But then, when Mr. Trump tweets that players should “stop disrespecting our Flag Country,” it becomes clear: In some ways, there is nothing more important than his misguided understanding of how to truly respect the flag. Some NFL players have been participating in a fraught, challenging debate about race, policing and criminal justice, and Mr. Trump is offended by this. His response: fire the players who don’t share his views. Demand conformity and uniformity. <br> He’s not alone, of course. If he were, Colin Kaepernick would probably have a job by now. But the response to Mr. Trump’s ugly tweets and threats, from players and team owners, reflects an encouraging consensus that the real way to respect the American flag is to respect the diversity of opinion it protects. As games began on Sunday, players, coaches and owners kneeled, linked arms and made statements in others ways. “Our players have exercised their rights as United States citizens in order to spark conversation and action to address social injustice,” San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York said Saturday. “We will continue to support them in their peaceful pursuit of positive change in our country and around the world.” <br> What’s offensive here is not what Mr. Trump thinks about Mr. Kaepernick. At this point, honestly, who cares? But when the president uses his bully pulpit to declare some speech legitimate and some beyond the pale; when his response to protest is to question patriotism rather than engage on the issue of unequal policing — then it is Mr. Trump who “disrespects our Flag our Country.” <br> As Justice Jackson wrote three-quarters of a century ago, “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” <br> Read more: <br> John Feinstein: The NFL cowards who aren’t signing Colin Kaepernick <br> Letters to the Editor: The National Frightened League wilts in the face of Colin Kaepernick <br> Barton Swaim: Kaepernick’s symbolism misses the point <br> Alyssa Rosenberg: We tell ourselves sports are politically neutral.

 Regarding the Sept. 16 front-page article “GOP sway over its leader hits a low point”: <br> The fact that many Republicans are trying to play off President Trump’s dealings as something they have no control over or something that will be pointless just shows how much the Republican Party is collapsing in on itself. The people of the party are not working together, and many have no idea what is going on. Democrats are at a huge advantage because they have a banded alliance, and people will follow them. <br> If the Republicans want to keep seats this coming election, they need to learn how to work as a team, not just for their own interests. If the president wants a chance at staying in power, he needs to learn how to communicate with his team instead of ordering them around, and people will follow him. <br> Khushboo Rathore, North Potomac 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> “OBAMACARE IS dead next month if it doesn’t get that money,” President Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday in a barely veiled threat to defund a crucial part of the Affordable Care Act. The president delivered this threat even though he has no viable replacement plan. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the president said, “should be calling me and begging me to help him save Obamacare.” <br> No. Mr. Trump should be working to preserve the Affordable Care Act, which is delivering health insurance to millions of Americans. <br> The president’s comments came after he reanimated the drive to repeal and replace Obamacare on Fox Business earlier Wednesday: “We have to do health care first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform,” he said. “So we’re going to have a phenomenal tax reform, but I have to do health care first.” <br> More desperate than clever, Mr. Trump’s talk of annihilating Obamacare, for which he would be justly blamed, is unlikely to coerce Democrats into supporting anything like the House Republican repeal-and-replace plan he backed, which failed to attract enough GOP support to pass the House. The indecency of Mr. Trump taking millions of Americans’ health care hostage is compounded by his suggestion that repeal-and-replace is about freeing budgetary space for Republicans to tinker with the tax code rather than about fixing health care. Even posing his threat, meanwhile, is astonishingly reckless. <br> After House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) dropped a repeal-and-replace bill favored by Mr. Trump and GOP congressional leadership, the quixotic effort to end Obamacare seemed to be over. “We’re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,” Mr. Ryan admitted. With reform stalled, Republicans now in control of the government had no responsible choice but to administer a system that has provided health coverage to millions and requires competent stewardship. <br> But, weeks later, it remains unclear whether Republicans will sustain the law or sabotage it. Insurance companies are terrified that Republicans will pull money from subsidies that help Americans pay out-of-pocket health-care costs, subsidies that help keep health-care markets stable. Without them, insurers would have to hike individual market premiums by some 19 percent, likely leading to the market meltdown that Republicans have warned against. <br> Continuing these payments is only the first and most obvious step Mr. Trump must take to shore up the health-care system. The president should continue fighting a lawsuit charging that spending on these cost-sharing subsidies is illegal absent further congressional appropriations, and he should press lawmakers to make those appropriations. He should also direct his administration to enforce Obamacare’s individual mandate, which requires Americans to obtain health-care coverage, so long as the system depends on the mandate to keep markets viable. <br> Instead, the Trump administration has cultivated uncertainty, giving up on repeal-and-replace then putting it back on the agenda, signaling that it would continue funding Obamacare subsidies then threatening to end them. In a health-care system that relies on cooperation between private insurance companies and the federal government, uncertainty can be fatal. Insurers must soon decide whether to stay in Obamacare markets and how much to charge if they do. They cannot like what they are hearing. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Dana Milbank: Trump is now destroying a healthy health-care system <br> Charles Krauthammer: The real world of Obamacare repeal <br> Greg Sargent: In the battle over Obamacare’s future, Trump just blinked.

 Regarding the Sept. 17 news article “GOP looking to kill a popular blue-state deduction in tax overhaul plan”: <br> I’m baffled as to why the GOP wants to kill the deduction for state and local taxes. After all, it is a way of encouraging more state and local, rather than federal, decision-making. Isn’t that what Republicans have been pushing for a long time? The state and local tax deduction should be right up there with the charitable deduction, which is a way of encouraging people to give to their favorite causes, religious or otherwise, rather than having the federal government decide what is a worthy cause. <br> Ben Jones, Bowie 
 The “health-care bill” that Republicans are trying to pass in the Senate, like the one approved by the GOP majority in the House, isn’t really about health care at all. It’s the first step in a massive redistribution of wealth from struggling wage-earners to the rich — a theft of historic proportions. <br> Is the Senate version less “mean” than the House bill, to use President Trump’s description of that earlier effort? Not really. Does the new bill have the “heart” that Trump demanded? No, it doesn’t. The devil is not in the details, it’s in the big picture. <br> Fundamentally, what Republicans in both chambers want to do is cut nearly $1 trillion over the next decade from the Medicaid program, which serves almost 70 million people. Medicaid provides health care not just for the indigent and disabled but also for the working poor — low-wage employees who cannot afford health insurance, even the plans offered through their jobs. <br> Additionally, about 20 percent of Medicaid spending goes to provide nursing home care, including for middle-class seniors whose savings have been exhausted — a situation almost any of us might confront. Roughly two-thirds of those in nursing homes have their care paid by Medicaid. <br> Why would Republicans want to slash this vital program so severely? You will hear a lot of self-righteous huffing and puffing about the need for entitlement reform, but the GOP’s intention is not to use the savings to pay down the national debt. Instead, slashing Medicaid spending creates fiscal headroom for what is euphemistically being called “tax reform” — a soon-to-come package of huge tax cuts favoring the wealthy. <br> That’s the basic equation in both the House and Senate bills: Medicaid for tax cuts. Both bills start with various of the taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act, but those are mere appetizers. The main course is intended to be big cuts in individual and corporate tax rates that would benefit the rich. <br> There is no other point to this whole exercise. All the “Obamacare is in a death spiral” talk is Republican wishful thinking, aided and abetted by active sabotage. <br> The ACA is far from perfect, but recall that it was designed with input from the insurance industry. The main reason so many insurers are pulling out of the program is that Congress and GOP-dominated state governments refuse to live up to their end of the bargain. Congress will not commit to funding promised subsidies to cover treatment for the poor and those with expensive ailments, or to keeping in place the mandate forcing individuals to buy insurance or pay a penalty. Republican governors and state legislatures refused to set up exchanges that would make insurance more affordable and declined the opportunity to expand Medicaid coverage. <br> It’s actually a wonder that the ACA works as well as it does, given the GOP’s determination to make it fail. <br> Neither the House nor the Senate bill fully dismantles the scaffolding of Obamacare; rather, they allow the states to do most of the dirty work. Philosophically, Republican majorities in both chambers want to erase the central concept that the ACA established: that health care is a fundamental right, not a privilege depending on one’s income. <br> Like the House, the Senate wants to offer tax credits rather than subsidies to help the needy afford insurance. Like the House, the Senate wants to leave up to the states whether policies must cover such services as emergency, maternity and mental-health care. Like the House, the Senate wants to eliminate the requirement that large employers offer insurance plans to their workers. <br> There are a few distinctions, though I wouldn’t call them real differences. The Senate would determine who gets tax credits to help buy insurance by income, rather than age. And the Senate bill would take more time to phase out the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid coverage; despite claims that this represents “heart,” it may have less to do with compassion than skewing how the bill is scored by the Congressional Budget Office. This pig’s lipstick is being applied with a trowel. <br> Ultimately, however, the impact is the same: sacrificing Medicaid for tax cuts. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had the bill drafted in strict secrecy and hopes to ram it through as early as next week. The ACA, by contrast, was drafted over the course of a year, with more than 100 public hearings. <br> Does McConnell have the votes? Wavering senators should know that we’re not fooled. We see exactly what you’re doing — and you should expect to be held fully accountable. <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 Donald Trump promised to get Congress to repeal Obamacare, enact tax reform, pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, impose tariffs on outsourcers, subsidize child care and fund a border wall with Mexico — all in the first 100 days of his presidency. Not surprisingly, none of those things happened. What is surprising is that little of this agenda has even been submitted by the president to Congress: no tax bill, no infrastructure bill, no anti-outsourcing bill, no child-care bill and no legislation to build the wall. Why? <br> The explanation goes beyond the usual factors that bedevil any new president — overpromising on the pace of action, underpreparing for the challenges of office, trouble in staffing up. These do play some part in Trump’s achingly slow start. But Trump’s failure to get key agenda items to the starting line reflects more fundamental problems in policymaking — problems that will persist even after this administration is fully staffed and acclimated. <br> First, policymaking at the White House is hard and tedious work that involves digesting reams of paper, weighing difficult trade-offs and enduring hours of meetings. There is little evidence Trump has any interest in this sort of endeavor. The campaign anecdote that Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) was offered a vice presidency with control over domestic and foreign policy, in a White House where Trump would be responsible only for “making America great again,” speaks volumes. Even an “art of the deal” president cannot make policy if he is unaware of key parts of his proposals, as he was shown to be on the question of preexisting conditions in health-care reform or whether he had approved the Keystone XL pipeline without a requirement that it would be built using U.S. steel. In a constantly leaking White House, it is revealing that there have been no stories about Trump making, say, a hard choice on tax reform after a long review session. Trump’s most memorable comment about policy was revelatory: “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.” <br> Second, Trump’s career reflects an inconsistency and expediency about ideas that indicate he will never take policymaking seriously. Yes, all political leaders shift their views over time, some dramatically. But no major figure in either party ever has been as helter-skelter as Trump. He has embraced government-funded universal health care, supported late-term abortions and proposed the largest tax hike in history — and the exact opposite of all of these things, as well — to achieve his political objectives at a given moment. While running for president, Trump said that the minimum wage was “too high,” that it should not change and that it “has to go up.” On a single day of the 2016 campaign, he broadcast three stances on his core campaign issue — immigration policy. I say this not to relitigate a campaign charge about Trump and flip-flopping, but rather to suggest that, absent specific direction from the president at each juncture in the process, his team is probably hard-pressed to divine the Trump policy approach to any question, beyond political expediency. This doubtlessly lengthens the process as underlings wrestle over several possible approaches. Policymaking is hard if one cannot take the president literally; impossible if his ideas cannot be taken seriously. <br> Finally, the Trump policy process must surely be gridlocked because — to the extent there is any indication of what Trumpism is as a policy philosophy — it is a jumble of populist slogans and corporatist concessions totally at war with itself. The Trump plan includes a promise to raise taxes on corporations that outsource and a pledge to cut taxes on those same corporations to a record low. Trump has embraced a Democratic plan to restore limits on Wall Street that were removed 20 years ago — while advancing a Republican plan to strip away limits imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. He has called for $1 trillion in new infrastructure spending but proposed a budget without a penny of net new spending or borrowing. He promised voters they would get better health-care coverage, then held a party in the White House Rose Garden for a House bill that would allow insurance companies to slash benefits — a bill that he characterized as “mean” the following month. Every campaign agenda contains some half-zebras, half-elephants — but the Trump platform designed to appeal to disaffected manufacturing workers who resent globalization, and disaffected globalists who resent taxation and regulation, is especially problematic in implementation.  <br> When Trump hit the 100-day mark with no major legislative wins, his allies told the world to give him time. But time is not Trump’s trouble: His lack of interest in policymaking and an incoherent agenda are the obstacles. Congress can’t dispose of plans when the president can’t even get his act together to propose them. <br> Read more: <br> Michael Gerson: Why Trump can’t do what he said he’d do <br> John Podesta: Trump’s infrastructure plan is wholly inadequate.

 As Tax Day — April 18 this year — approaches, we are confronted once again with the apparently enduring reality that Americans hate to pay taxes. Few political generalizations seem so indestructible. Gallup has long asked Americans whether their federal income taxes are too high. About 50 to 60 percent regularly say “yes.” The federal income tax is deeply unpopular. So goes the conventional wisdom. <br> Except that it’s not true or, at any rate, is too simple and incomplete. The tax system is not just a divider; it’s a uniter, too. <br> “Americans almost universally agree that taxpaying is a civic duty,” writes political scientist Vanessa Williamson in her new book, “Read My Lips: Why Americans Are Proud to Pay Taxes.” To be a taxpayer is “a source of pride because it is evidence that one is an upstanding, contributing member of the community.” <br> Williamson studied existing surveys, conducted one of her own and interviewed 49 taxpayers in depth. What she concluded suggests a sizable revision of popular thinking, which emphasizes a profound dislike of taxes. <br> “Around four in five Americans . . . see taxpaying as a moral responsibility and tax evasion as morally wrong,” she writes of the various surveys. “This is a belief that is particularly strong in the United States” compared with many European countries, she finds. Americans have one of the world’s highest rates of tax compliance — an achievement aided by tax withholding. <br> In one of the interviews, Roy — a 61-year-old retired Republican postal worker from Ohio — puts it this way: “I feel like I am doing my part in supplying the needs and to help pay for things in this country that are needed. So, in a small way, I do feel like it’s my civic duty and that I’m responsible for paying taxes.” <br> Taxes are a bond as well as a burden. They’re a modern embrace of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.’s famous dictum: “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.” Interestingly, Republicans more than Democrats feel that tax evasion is morally wrong. “Republicans believe strongly in paying taxes,” Williamson writes. <br> One reason popular opinion misses the unifying aspects of taxes is that public surveys are skewed, she argues. “Public opinion polls commonly assume that the only attitude Americans hold about taxes is one of enraged opposition,” Williamson writes. “Negative questions carry a value judgment and predispose certain answers.” <br> Still, it’s possible to take tax revisionism too far, as Williamson herself notes. Taxes — and the government programs they support — remain highly contentious issues at both the state and national levels. Somebody has got to pay; conflict is unavoidable. <br> In her interviews, Williamson found widespread resentment that both the very rich and the very poor (particularly immigrants) don’t pay their “fair share” of taxes. The animus against the poor affects both Republicans and Democrats, though Republicans more so. <br> (It’s also a bum rap, Williamson argues. Thanks to the payroll and sales taxes, almost everyone is a taxpayer in some form. She estimates that the poorest fifth of earners make 3 percent of the income and account for 2 percent of all taxes. It’s also true that high taxable thresholds mean that 44 percent of tax filers in 2016 didn’t owe federal income taxes, reports the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.) <br> Even if all Americans were satisfied with their present tax situation — clearly not the case — it does not follow that everyone would be happy if their taxes were raised. President Trump has promised tax reform but has yet to present a concrete proposal. When he does, it is almost certain to trigger a congressional donnybrook, because some taxpayers will be hit with increases to finance tax cuts for other taxpayers. <br> Bigger problems loom in the future. Sooner or later, we will have to raise taxes, because there is a huge and growing gap between the government’s spending commitments and its tax revenues. Although we are now near full employment, meaning the economy is near its physical capacity, the deficit is roughly $500 billion. Under present policies and assuming unrealistically no future recession, it will continue to rise. <br> How long this can continue is anyone’s guess, although the answer is probably not forever. By all means, let’s acknowledge the benefits of taxes. But let’s not assume that higher taxes will make government more popular. This seems dubious. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Molly Michelmore: Why the income tax is worth celebrating <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump’s gift to Americans: Making it easier to cheat on their taxes <br> Lawrence Summers: On tax reform, take a page from Ronald Reagan <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Sebastian Mallaby, author of “The Man Who Knew: The Life Times of Alan Greenspan,” is the Paul A. Volcker senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and a contributing columnist for The Post. <br> Last year, in the wake of President Trump’s election, financial markets took off on a wild sprint, apparently believing his promise to make America great again. Ten months later, the financiers are wiser: The president’s immigration clampdown alarms them; his divisive response to Charlottesville appalls them. Despite the heady expectations of this past winter, there has been no sign of an infrastructure plan; few expect serious tax reform given the bungling of health-care legislation, not to mention the sidelining of Gary Cohn, the tax plan’s chief Sherpa. And yet, as if by a miracle of levitation, the Standard Poor’s 500-stock index is still about a fifth above its level on the day of the election. What’s happening? <br> The short answer is that foreign leaders have done a surprisingly good job of making foreign countries great again. From Xi Jinping’s China to Emmanuel Macron’s France, politicians are delivering policies that businesses want. As a result, the world economy is growing faster than at any time since the post-crisis bump of 2010. The yuan and the euro have risen sharply against the dollar. A more competitive greenback and the prospect of strong exports have supported U.S. stock prices. A Chinese communist and a French technocrat have done more for American business than Trump has. <br> Consider China’s recent performance. In 2015 and again in early 2016, China suffered acute financial turbulence. After averaging almost 10 percent growth between 2006 and 2014 and turbocharging the global economy, China suddenly emerged as the chief risk to the world. In its headlong drive to invest in coal mines and steel plants, it created a glut that was driving foreigners out of business. In its faltering experiments with financial modernization, it allowed cracks to appear in its currency controls: Well-to-do Chinese families were rushing to buy anti-dictator insurance in the form of real estate in Los Angeles or London. The government’s war chest of foreign currency reserves shrunk by about $1 trillion as it desperately bought back yuan to offset capital flight. <br> In the past 18 months, however, China has restored calm. Last year the government ordered coal mines to cap production at 276 days; steel output was also cut, and producers the world over have profited from recovering prices. Meanwhile, authorities have put a stop to capital flight, using dictatorial powers to crush purchases of anti-dictator insurance. The process has not been pretty, but capital flight has ended and the yuan has recovered. Any company connected to China’s global supply chains is breathing more freely. <br> Now consider the good news from Europe. Before France’s spring elections, half the electorate supported business-unfriendly candidates of the far right and left. That polarization allowed Macron to power through the middle and seize the prize of the presidency, which he is now using to advance much-needed liberalization of hiring and firing. The challenge of labor-market reform has defeated other French leaders, but Macron is determined. He means to push through the reforms by decree, and he has persuaded two of the three main labor unions to stay out of the street protests against him. France’s stock market index is up by nearly a fifth in dollar terms this year. <br> Meanwhile, Germany and Italy, the two other major euro zone economies, are also doing well. Angela Merkel, the calm anchor of the region, is cruising toward her fourth electoral mandate in the vote on Sept. 24. To ease the way for Macron’s difficult labor reforms, she seems likely to use her refreshed authority to relax Germany’s habitual enthusiasm for budget austerity. Italy, for its part, has emerged stronger from a recent round of bank bailouts, and its populist parties have scaled back their scary promises to quit the euro. If the European Central Bank is forced to dial back its extraordinary monetary stimulus — it is running out of German bonds to purchase — the combination of a less austere Merkel and healthier European banks should be enough to sustain recovery. <br> The one biggish economy that’s foundering is the one Trump has celebrated: Brexiting Britain. There, populists are proving politically incompetent and economically harmful. British growth, which sputtered in at an annualized rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter, is the lowest among the major economies. The pound is weak, even against the limping dollar. Inflation has jumped. Perhaps it is time for Trump to take stock of the world and ask himself: Who’s looking great — and who is not? <br> Read more: <br> Charles Lane: Trump isn’t hurting the economy.

 I find it difficult to argue against my conservative associates regarding bias in the media as a whole and The Post in particular when I read such transparently opinionated language as in the Sept. 6 news article “Trump punts to Congress, but issue will return to his desk.” <br> Whereas President Trump attracted legitimate criticism for proposing a unilateral termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order, the article characterized returning the issue to Congress for reconsideration as “shunting responsibility.” The article described the decision to defer to legislative process as underscoring “internal paralysis,” a “decision not to be the one who decides” and a “punt.” <br> The underlying thesis — that the White House decision-making process seems tortured and even turbulent — was fair, but putting the president in a no-win situation on the question of engaging Congress in an important immigration question was not. I expect this kind of snark in the opinion section, not news reporting. Such language only reinforces contentions by conservatives that members of the media bias their coverage of the president unfairly. <br> Paul Owen, Lorton <br> What’s with the media’s verbs these days? In particular, what’s with The Post’s infatuation with “lashed”? On Sept. 6, it was in the news headline “Putin lashes out at U.S. as rift widens.” It has appeared in many articles about politics, particularly those about President Trump. <br> But “lash” isn’t the only verb that seems wrong and overused. Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, in the “lashed” article, “swatted away” a question. I saw a video of Putin’s news conference, and while he indeed called that question “naive,” he didn’t seem very violent in his response. <br> Likewise, while I usually don’t care for Trump’s language — I think he disputes assertions and criticizes people — but, try as I might, I can’t really recall him lashing anyone or anything. <br> The Post should eliminate supposedly “colorful” language that is inappropriate and, more important, inaccurate. <br> Phil Jones, Montgomery  Village 
 I was dumbfounded and infuriated when I read the Sept. 12 editorial “It was best to prepare for the worst,” which noted that the governments of Britain, France and the Netherlands had taken criticism for their poor response to the devastation Hurricane Irma inflicted on their territories in the Caribbean. News flash: The United States also has territories there. The U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas and St. John got smashed when the eyewall of then- Category 5 Irma passed over them. The aerial footage finally coming out shows near-total destruction — buildings gutted, debris everywhere, no water, no power, nothing. <br> The Post isn’t the only entity to have forgotten about the U.S. citizens in the Virgin Islands. I was stunned to see a press release from the Interior Department — the agency responsible for U.S. territories — issued in the hours after Irma passed over the Virgin Islands. Secretary Ryan Zinke felt the need at that moment to tout President Trump’s tax-reform plans. <br> I still haven’t heard from several friends in the Virgin Islands. Others have posted that they are hunkered down in their damaged homes, running out of food and water. Looting is a problem in some areas. <br> Many people in the Virgin Islands are terrified and feel forgotten and abandoned. <br> Jim Day, Vienna 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> ONCE AGAIN, tax reform is on the agenda in Washington, and this time there’s a genuinely radical idea under discussion: the House Republicans’ plan for a new “border adjustment” corporate income tax. It would, they say, transform the sluggish United States into a much better place to invest and create jobs. Would it work? The answer depends, in part, on who’s right — economists or lobbyists. <br> The House GOP plan would sweep aside the corporate tax system with its 35 percent maximum marginal rate, the highest such rate in the industrialized world but one riddled with loopholes. In its place, there would be a new 20 percent flat rate levied only on income earned in the United States. To offset the huge loss of revenue, the plan eliminates the deductibility of imports as a business expense, as well as a few other large deductions. The net effect is a big reduction in the after-tax cost of doing business within the United States — paid for by foreign exporters. <br> Economists (at least those who like the idea) believe it creates fresh incentives to locate economic activity — and register ownership of intellectual property — within the United States, to export rather than import, and to finance businesses with equity rather than debt. Other things being equal, that could improve tax efficiency and domestic job creation. To those who fear a sudden hit to import-dependent businesses and their customers, advocates respond that the tax plan would trigger an offsetting rise in the dollar exchange rate. Yes, there would be short-term winners (agricultural exporters) and losers (big retailers of Chinese goods). But America as a whole would be better off, long term. <br> This is where the lobbyists for interests as varied as Koch Industries (major importers of crude oil), Walmart and the people who sell imported fish to grocery stores weigh in, with a hundred real-world arguments about how the economists’ happy scenario might go awry. What if our erstwhile trading partners do not go along with our attempt to get rich at the expense of their export industries, and sue at the World Trade Organization instead? Or what if they respond with retaliatory currency manipulation? Nice as it might be for the United States, a much stronger dollar would hammer developing countries such as Brazil, Chile and Indonesia, which owe hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S.-denominated debt. Yes, yes, we know: America First. But is it really in our national interest to put major emerging markets at sudden risk of bankruptcy? <br> In truth, neither economists, with their sweeping intellectual constructs, nor lobbyists, with their inherently self-interested takes on the issues, enjoy a reputation for infallible forecasting. Still, this may be one case in which the latter’s stake in the actual operation of the U.S. economy creates an advantage, in terms of practical realism. As it happens, there are already proposals to cut corporate rates and close loopholes less radically but also, quite possibly, less disruptively than the border-adjustment proposal. House Republicans and the Obama administration floated them in 2014 and 2012, respectively. Those plans deserve a second look before lawmakers take this leap. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Robert J.

 The Viard-Toder tax plan [“A tax reform worth Mr. Trump’s attention,” editorial, March 13] apparently supports the recommendation that individuals would be required to pay taxes on their investment’s paper profits at the end of each year and not just when the securities were sold. Every seasoned stockholder knows that what goes up one year is likely to come down the next. Such a rule would encourage all stockholders to sell any shares which were up in value by the end of the year before buying them back in the new year. This would cause absolute chaos in the market. <br> On the other hand, corporate taxes should be lowered to encourage companies to return their headquarters to the United States, among other reasons. <br> Jay Brown, Palymra, Va. <br> The editorial board presented the Viard-Toder tax-reform plan as “worth Mr. Trump’s attention.” Seriously? An element of that plan is “individuals would be taxed not just when they sold stocks, but on any annual increase in the market value.” So we ignore years of analysis on the impact of accumulated fees on retirement savings? The editorial acknowledged the “difficulty [in] quantifying and taxing the annual fluctuations in . . .investors’ stock holdings.” Yes, those issues would be complicated, but stocks are probably the easiest investment form to address. <br> A tax needs to work equally across classes of capital investment, unless part of its purpose is to favor or penalize some specific activity. Would we tax publicly traded stocks simply because the market makes an annual valuation easy? How about real estate? Would we require an appraisal and apply a tax on any gain every year? We would (continue to) tax income allocations in partnerships and limited-liability corporations at ordinary income rates, but are we to tax changes in entity value? These entities and nonpublic corporations are extremely hard to value, so would we punt and exempt them? <br> How many exemptions and disparate outcomes have we created so far? What effect would an annual repricing and tax have on the market for long-term bonds? And what about assets where the title isn’t registered, such as diamonds? <br> The Viard-Toder plan would have tremendous indirect consequences on retirement savings and elsewhere and would make devising ways to hide wealth the new national pastime. This is a potential nightmare that President Trump and everyone else should dismiss.   <br> Dana M. Warren, Washington 
 Derek Kaufman is a former member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee and is a trustee of the think tank Third Way. He is on Twitter at @EconDerek. <br> President Trump’s continued calls for a massive tax cut and infrastructure spending package couldn’t come at a worse moment in the business cycle. And congressional Republicans’ willingness to entertain it is even more confounding. <br> Only six years ago, congressional Republicans risked default to avoid new government spending. With the country still reeling from the 2008 financial crisis and unemployment at 9 percent, this brinkmanship resulted in the last-minute passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which raised the debt limit but only in exchange for significant austerity. Republicans primarily argued that the United States, having run up large deficits in the post-crisis years, was on a similar trajectory to Greece and therefore needed to cut spending to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. Additionally, some conservative economists felt that sizable deficits, combined with the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase program (a.k.a. quantitative easing), would debase the dollar and lead to an outbreak of inflation. <br> The real-world outcome of the austerity was quite different. Because, unlike Greece, the United States borrows in its own sovereign currency, the first analogy was never credible. And because, at the time, there was enormous excess capacity in the economy, near-term inflation fears were overblown. Within days, the GOP’s risk-taking cost the United States its prestigious AAA bond rating, and in the following weeks the market’s verdict was made painfully clear: Stocks and bond yields tumbled in tandem, as the expected adverse growth effects of the deal, amplified by uncertainty surrounding the downgrade, reverberated through the economy. <br> In 2011, rather than austerity, the economy still was ripe for more stimulus. In other words, the type of plan Trump is talking about now made sense six years ago. But today — with unemployment at 4.5 percent, inflation picking up and the United States’ ratio of debt to gross domestic product higher than it has been in more than 65 years — such a plan is foolish. And stunningly, these same congressional Republicans now seem open to Trump’s road map and ready to consider an even larger infrastructure program than the one they denied President Barack Obama, in combination with an irresponsible round of deficit-increasing tax cuts. <br> This could all be chalked up to politics — the desire to deny Obama a victory at all costs — rather than genuine concerns about debt sustainability and runaway inflation. But the Trump package is wrong for where we are in the business cycle and could eventually hurt the economy. <br> Already, the bond market’s reaction to the Trump plan has been swift, with long-term interest rates soaring about 40 basis points since the election on fears that fiscal expansion, undertaken in the current economic environment, may indeed result in inflation. Republicans in thrall to Trump should take note. <br> Given that the Federal Reserve is in the process of slowly raising short-term interest rates, and that the ratio of total debt held by the public to GDP stands at an elevated 77 percent , today’s economy is ready for a prescription of mild austerity rather than a double dose of stimulative tax cuts and infrastructure spending. A gently contractionary fiscal policy would ease the economy just enough to prevent inflation from accelerating, while enabling the Fed to keep rates low and allowing the debt-to-GDP ratio to steadily fall to more manageable levels. <br> While there are undoubtedly infrastructure projects worth pursuing — in particular those with a measurable positive net return on investment — there is no rush to fund them with borrowed money today. And while tax reform is sorely needed, it should be done in a base-broadening, revenue-neutral fashion. <br> No matter how badly members of Congress may want to simultaneously cut taxes and increase spending, they should push back against Trump’s proposals and advocate fiscal responsibility, at least until the next downturn begins. And Republicans should demonstrate that they favor fiscal restraint not solely when the Democrats occupy the White House, but rather when the economy is at or near full employment, no matter which party the president represents. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: The Trump team’s slapdash tax plan distracts from better ideas <br> Catherine Rampell: Think tax reform will be easy for Trump?

 Many modern presidents have proposed big tax cuts by wrapping those cuts in forecasts of new consumer spending and new business investment creating significant economic growth. Such claims have always been based on magical thinking, not studies of the actual effect of tax cuts. With decades of data available, we are able to assess the truth about the rosy rhetoric of tax cuts: No solid evidence exists to support the claims of unleashed economic growth. In fact, tax cuts sometimes lead to a ballooning federal deficit and a contracting economy. <br> President Trump is following a path well-trod by his predecessors. He is relying on the myopia and gullibility of millions of Americans — especially pundits, talk radio hosts and members of Congress — to build knee-jerk support for cutting taxes, even though there is little evidence to suggest that such cuts will help a sluggish economy. <br> Robert Tiller, Silver Spring <br> While American corporate tax rates have been decried as too high and a burden on competitiveness, economics class teaches that taxes are passed on to customers. Indeed, Verizon’s latest bill says it will begin in July to collect from their customers surcharges “to recover the cost of a state imposed gross receipts tax” and “a local business tax.” Big corporations have long been devising complex mechanisms to avoid high U.S. corporate taxes, and the proposed 15 percent rate would be an increase in what many of them currently pay. So who benefits? Gone are the days when savings were passed on to consumers in lower prices or as dividends to shareholders. <br> Kerry Abbott, Harrisonburg, Va. <br> Regarding the April 27 news article “Six ways Trump’s tax plan could affect ordinary taxpayers”: <br> After reading President Trump’s tax-reform plan, I was once again struck by how out of touch some government leaders are with the needs of seniors. Social Security benefits have been frozen for two years and have actually decreased because of increases in Medicare premiums. This is because the cost-of-living adjustment does not factor in medical costs, a major expense for retirees. <br> Now, Mr. Trump has floated a tax plan that will eliminate individual medical deductions, preserving only mortgage interest and charitable contribution deductions. Moderate-income seniors generally no longer have mortgages. They frequently have high medical costs. Seniors, or any other citizens for that matter, who incur a major medical expense will suffer under Mr. Trump’s plan since we all know that $15,000 doesn’t go very far in today’s medical world. <br> I have no hope that Mr. Trump will come to his senses, but maybe Congress will. <br> Karen Gelerter, Montgomery Village 
 Six weeks into a new administration, with unified Republican government for the first time in a decade, the GOP should be busy enacting a bold reform agenda. Instead, the party is wracked by internal divisions on key issues from health care to taxes. <br> After House Republicans released their long-awaited bill to repeal and replace Obamacare it was attacked from all sides of the GOP spectrum — with conservatives calling it “Obamacare lite” and moderates openly worrying it won’t do enough for the Obamacare Medicaid expansion population or those who will lose their Obamacare subsidies. The House GOP tax plan also faces intra-Republican disagreements over a proposed “border adjustment tax” (BAT) that would apply a reduced corporate tax to imports, while making U.S. exports tax free. <br> Democrats are refusing to cooperate with any GOP initiatives, which means all these reforms must be passed with Republican votes alone using an arcane process called “reconciliation.” So if Republicans can’t work out their differences nothing will get done. And to intimidate Republicans into inaction, the left is ramping up anti-GOP protests across the country, sending activists to disrupt town hall meetings and harass Republican lawmakers. <br> Sounds like a hopeless situation? Not to Scott Walker. For the Wisconsin governor, it seems like déjà vu all over again. In 2011, after winning the governorship and control to both houses of the Wisconsin legislature, Walker faced a divided Republican caucus and 100,000 protesters marching on and occupying his state capitol to protest his collective bargaining reform legislation. His polls were so low, he says, TIME magazine declared him “Dead Man Walker.” Yet he managed to unite his party and overcome Democratic obstruction (including 14 Democratic legislators who fled the state to prevent a quorum). (Disclosure: I have co-authored a book with Walker.) <br> Result? His legislation passed, and voters rewarded him at the polls. “We’ve now won three cycles in a row – ’12, ’14 and ’16 — where Republicans have gained seats in the legislature and have moved the state so far that we not only got Ron Johnson reelected, but, obviously, we for the first time since Reagan carried the state for a Republican presidential candidate,” he says. <br> Walker recently met with the House Republicans to share the lessons of his experience in Wisconsin. And he gave them a clear message: ignore the protests and do what you promised. If you do, voters will reward you as well. <br> Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are urging their leaders to slow down, but Walker says that is a mistake. “On Obamacare and tax reform, it’s a mistake to push it off until later this year or next year,” he says. This is for two reasons. First, Walker says, “the longer you wait, the more excuses there will be.” Squeamish legislators begin complaining “that it’s too close to the next election. We can’t do these things.” Members of Congress don’t get more courageous with time. <br> Second, he says, “You need time to show that it works.” If Republicans act now, the positive effects of their legislation will be felt before voters go to the polls in 2018 and Democrats won’t be able to demagogue their reforms. “All the protests in the world don’t have the kind of effect that the protesters want if people see their lives getting better,” Walker says. Tax reform will be “like pouring jet fuel into our economic engine. And then, no matter what people think about some of these other issues — building the wall, the travel issues and other things — suddenly people start seeing things that are having a positive impact in their life. And even if they don’t care as much about the other issues, they see progress, and that’s what people want. They want progress.” <br> Once Republicans pass health care and tax reform legislation, they need to keep reforming. “You don’t get political capital by hoarding it. You get it by reinvesting it. So every time you have a political victory and you get one reform done, instead of sitting back, you need to reinvest that to the next one you’ve got teed up and keep ahead of the curve.” If they do so, voters will say “these guys are leading. They are actually getting things done. They’re pushing reforms. I may not agree with every one of them, but they’re doing the things they said they’re going to do.” <br> The left will protest, but ultimately those protests will backfire, Walker says. “The trend we saw in Wisconsin, which appears to be happening nationwide, is they overreact ... because they’re just blinded by their rage. If opposition is just rage, I think everyday citizens see that. People start to look at them and say, that’s not who we are.” <br> The worst possible outcome will be for Republicans to break their word and do nothing. “Voters are sick and tired of people who they think talk a lot, but they don’t get anything done,” Walker says. If Republicans don’t deliver, he warns, then the protests will only grow bigger — because they will be populated not just by angry liberals, but angry conservatives furious that Republicans failed to keep their promises. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> Dana Milbank: Intraparty fratricide looms over the GOP <br> Avik Roy: GOP hard-liners’ Obamacare incoherence <br> Dana Milbank: The Republican health-care plan’s top critics?

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> IN THE run-up to the announcement of President Trump’s tax reform proposal last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke of simplifying the tax code to the point where Americans could fit their returns on “a large postcard.” The same should not be true of a major presidential policy rollout on such a complex topic — yet that is what Mr. Mnuchin, accompanied by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, produced. <br> What few details their slapdash one-pager did contain suggest that it would dramatically decrease taxes on those who are best able to afford them — necessitating trillions of dollars in new federal borrowing. Essentially, it is the revenue-side equivalent of Mr. Trump’s earlier plan for spending cuts, “the skinny budget”: an ultra-conservative Republican wish list with a good chance of exciting the GOP political faithful and almost no chance of becoming law. <br> Billed as “the biggest individual and corporate tax cut in American history,” the Trump plan rests on the faulty premise that the economy’s woes are somehow due to a crushing tax burden. In the first place, the economy is not doing too badly; despite a lackluster first-quarter growth number, the United States is functioning near full employment. A recent Gallup survey, in fact, found that only 8 percent of Americans fear being laid off, the lowest share since Gallup first asked the question in 1975. Moreover, 61 percent of the public consider their tax burden “fair,” a post-recession high. Mr. Trump’s massive tax cut is a solution in search of a problem. <br> What the U.S. economy needs most, at this stage of its recovery, are measures designed to boost productivity, which has been growing at well below historical rates. Productivity, in turn, could benefit from tax reform, one that did not reduce federal revenue, but enabled the government to collect it more efficiently. Reform of the corporate code, not individual taxes, is most urgent — in terms of boosting productivity. U.S. firms are subject to the highest top nominal tax rate in the industrialized world, 35 percent, a major reason that businesses shift overseas, or at least report their income abroad, beyond Uncle Sam’s reach. <br> The classic repair would be a lower rate, paid for by closing loopholes. Mr. Trump’s plan suggests a 15 percent rate, which would reduce federal revenues by at least $143 billion in 2018, according to a recent analysis by economists Eric Toder and Alan D. Viard; but the president offers no way to pay for it beyond a vague promise to “eliminate tax breaks for special interests.” The House GOP, by contrast, has a proposal to cut the corporate rate to 20 percent, offset by a massive tax on business imports; by omitting any mention of that approach, Mr. Trump seems to reject it. <br> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span>The House plan is but one of several original, if imperfect, ideas for corporate reform circulating in Washington. Mr. Toder and Mr. Viard, for example, have a plan to pay for a rate cut with higher taxes on individual dividend earnings. The Trump team’s mish-mash of weak ideas accomplishes little but to divert time, energy and political capital from stronger ones. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Matt O’Brien: Trump’s new, one-page tax plan is the same as his old, one-page tax plan <br> Catherine Rampell: The dumbest part of Trump’s dumb tax plan <br> Douglas Holtz-Eakin: Trump’s tax plan is built on a fairy tale <br> Charles Koch: Trump’s policies must not benefit only big businesses like mine <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Be wary of anyone who purports to understand the deep meaning of President Trump’s decision to side with the Democrats on short-term budget issues. Nobody knows what he’s up to, and this probably includes Trump himself. <br> Nonetheless, his recent foray into bipartisanship provides the occasion to explore the path he chose not to take at the beginning of his administration. He had the opportunity to put Democrats in a tight spot. Instead, he has spent his energies since Jan. 20 strengthening the hand of his opponents and weakening his own party. <br> If Trump had opened his presidency by detailing a major infrastructure plan, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and his colleagues would have had no choice but to cooperate, as Schumer himself signaled at the time. If Trump had also lived up to the promises of his campaign by proposing to make Obamacare better and not simply pushing for repeal, he might have fostered a similar spirit of bipartisan engagement. <br> He could have linked these Democratic-friendly ideas with an early call for tax cuts as part of tax reform, which would have made Republicans happy, as has his ongoing work to eviscerate Obama-era business regulations. <br> All this might have added to the deficit in a big way, but Trump has always lived on debt. This course would have been seen by some critics as philosophically muddled and by some conservatives as betrayal. But you can imagine that the prevailing wisdom in Washington would have praised him for breaking through “stale” political categories and “rising above” the old partisan fights. He could also have given himself more bargaining room by putting everyone, Democrats as well as Republicans, in play. <br> It could be that Trump’s latest move is a reach for this lost chance, although it seemed to be more impulse than strategy. It was also sudden. No one on either side was prepared for Trump’s embrace of Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) suggestion to pass hurricane relief now and to set up December as the time for serious haggling. Democrats are likely to have more leverage then. <br> Being who he is, Trump might have wanted to take a slap at his putative allies, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), both of whom he seems to dislike intensely. And perhaps he was looking for a few days of good headlines. Pelosi reported he reveled in the great media coverage he received, as good an indicator as any that this is a guy who operates day to day. <br> Trump’s problem with moving from a relatively small policy gesture to an entirely new approach is that the immediate past cannot be erased. <br> He is a far weaker figure today than he was when he was inaugurated. His poll numbers are terrible, the Russia story has ballooned in importance, and Democrats are in no mood to throw him any lifelines. His words and actions on race and deportations have erected new moral barriers to any pragmatic turn toward working with him. “All he’s done in eight months,” said a senior Senate Democratic aide, “is make the price of cooperation a lot higher.” <br> In the meantime, he has filled his Cabinet largely with conservative loyalists, further complicating any triangulation strategy involving Democrats. One member of his inner circle who might be best positioned to work with Democrats, Gary Cohn, his senior economic adviser, is apparently so on the outs that there are reports he may soon be gone. Trump might have run against GOP orthodoxy in the primaries, but so much of what he has done so far would have been in any right-wing Republican’s playbook. <br> He is still somewhat distinctive in his nativism, but this hardly bodes well for cooperation with progressives and moderates. And oddly enough, the departure of nationalist-in-chief Stephen K. Bannon removed one voice in his circle advocating positions on infrastructure, trade and taxes that had at least something in common with Democratic views. <br> Democrats will certainly try to press the temporary advantage they seem to have on behalf of immigrants endangered by Trump’s moves against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. They’ll also push for Obamacare funding, an end to the debt ceiling and a variety of budget concessions. <br> We should have learned long ago that looking for coherence from this president is a fool’s errand. He may have happened on a wiser political strategy too late to do himself much good but just in time to hurt his already ailing party even more. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Maya MacGuineas is president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. <br> As has happened more than 100 times before, Congress just raised the debt ceiling, the legal amount our government can borrow. <br> In the past, this act has occurred smoothly, and on many occasions, it has been used productively to spur fiscal efforts from budget deals to process reforms to the creation of a fiscal commission. But in recent years, the debt-ceiling-as-leverage strategy has been taken too far with absurd and damaging threats to actually allow a default. <br> In a surprising twist, President Trump and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) have reportedly come to an agreement to try to retire the debt ceiling once and for all. <br> On one hand, this is desirable; we should not weaponize the economy. On the other, debt remains a huge problem and is itself a threat to the economy, slowing growth and creating new risks. Given that the debt ceiling is the only real check on borrowing, tossing it out without any plan for restraint would continue the fiscal free fall we are already in. <br> So instead of repealing the debt ceiling, we should reform it. <br> One main problem with the debt ceiling is that it gets raised long after the tax and spending decisions that add to the debt are made, allowing policymakers to support adding to the debt while opposing the debt increase itself. You don’t rein in your family budget by going on a spending spree and then refusing to pay the bill. The restraint has to come earlier in the process. <br> To address this, Congress could tie the debt ceiling to budget resolutions or any major legislation that adds to the debt. Thus, Congress would have to vote in favor of lifting the debt ceiling when supporting the policy that necessitates it, which might give legislators more pause before adding to the debt. <br> A second problem is that the height of the debt ceiling is quite arbitrary. Some level of debt is perfectly fine and, in fact, desirable for a country to have. And the amount of debt we can support depends on the size of the economy. <br> Accordingly, it would make sense to shift measuring the debt ceiling from a specific dollar figure, as we currently measure it, to a share of the economy. Policymakers could set a glide path to reduce the debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio from today’s postwar-era high; the debt ceiling would only apply when our debt load breaches a set percentage of the economy. Such a reform would give Congress an incentive to enact fiscally responsible policies to avoid a politically difficult vote to increase the debt ceiling. <br> Yet another problem with the debt ceiling is that the hammer in this case is just too dangerous. Given our past flirtations with the nuclear option of default, it needs to come with an escape valve. <br> That could take the form of allowing the president to lift the debt ceiling while automatic tax and spending adjustments went into effect until Congress put together its own plan. Or it could take the form of a softer trigger in which the president and Congress submit plans to make improvements to the debt. <br> And a final recommendation for Congress and the president: Stop adding more to the debt. <br> Increases in the debt ceiling are always accompanied by rhetoric decrying the growing level of debt, even though politicians keep voting for more deficit-increasing policies. <br> With our national debt so high, we need a multitrillion-dollar debt-reduction plan that phases in savings from revenue and entitlement reforms. However, in today’s hyperpartisan environment, where politicians assume our fiscal policies come with free lunches, a serious debt deal seems pretty far off. <br> In the meantime, we can and should at the very least agree not to adopt new policies that add to the debt. It will require the old-fashioned notion of paying for things. Tax reform should be deficit-neutral. Spending plans should be fully paid for. And yes, even emergency spending, which should be passed swiftly, should be paired with plans to cover the costs. <br> Politicians need to stop claiming that their policies are too important to pay for or that they will magically pay for themselves; instead, our lawmakers should start identifying real solutions to offset new costs. <br> We shouldn’t depend on a debt ceiling in any form to replace politicians doing their jobs. They need to determine what spending is worthwhile — and then figure out how to pay for it. <br> Read more: <br> Robert J. Samuelson: What will Trump do about the debt ceiling? <br> Colbert I.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> WHEN THE best that can be said is that the nation can “breathe a sigh of relief,” as Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) put it Wednesday, that’s better than a dive over the cliff. The deal struck by President Trump and Congress to postpone until December a divisive battle over fiscal matters is hardly an ideal solution. Nonetheless, the president’s decision to reach out to Democrats to ensure against a disastrous default on the nation’s debts is encouraging, both as a matter of responsible governing and for its bipartisan character. <br> Surprising the GOP congressional leadership, Mr. Trump quickly agreed with a proposal by Mr. Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to extend the government’s borrowing capacity until December, fund the government until then and provide billions of dollars in hurricane relief. According to The Post, Mr. Trump and the Democratic leaders also reached a handshake deal to pursue a plan to permanently remove the requirement that Congress vote every time the nation needs to raise the debt ceiling. <br> Such a long-term fix is well worth pursuing. The all-too-frequent need for Congress to authorize fresh debt has become a destructive game of chicken for both parties. Without relinquishing its constitutional prerogatives, Congress should join the president in looking for a mechanism that is less likely to produce grandstanding — and threats to the nation’s financial stability. <br> The deal announced Wednesday, and Senate action that followed Thursday, would — with House concurrence — put off until December an anticipated congressional fight over the 2018 budget. Mr. Trump was clearly anxious about a contentious battle over fiscal issues in the weeks ahead, fearing it would shake financial markets or interfere with providing hurricane relief aid. His decision to reach out to Democrats for the first time in his administration suggested that frustration with congressional gridlock has led him toward a welcome openness to bipartisan coalitions. <br> If so, Democrats should be willing to respond constructively. They proposed the three-month reprieve in hope of gaining some leverage on important issues in the months ahead, including the extension of legal rights to the immigrants known as “dreamers,” whose protections are being rescinded on Mr. Trump’s orders earlier this week. This is politically clever but not very responsible in the long run. Linking immigration legislation to another extension of borrowing authority in December could trigger a game of brinkmanship. <br> If Mr. Trump and Congress really want Americans to breathe a sigh of relief, they should invest in genuine bipartisanship and make an early deal to tackle Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals legislation once and for all. Mr. Trump offered a nod in that direction Thursday by issuing a tweet, reportedly requested by Ms. Pelosi, assuring dreamers that they would not suffer harm for the next six months. But what’s needed is legislation affirming their rights to remain, study and work in the country. <br> Even better would be a serious bipartisan effort to come to grips with the nation’s long and deep fiscal disorder, including a long-term solution for the debt ceiling and passage of a responsible 2018 budget. Too much to hope for? Probably. But for now, at least, the worst has been avoided. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Time for the Trump administration to speak with one voice on the debt ceiling <br> Dana Milbank: Nobody knows what Trump is doing.

 The March 4 editorial “A gamble of a tax-reform plan,” discussing a “border adjustment” tax on the millions of products imported from overseas, missed the mark. Many of these “foreign exporters” are American multinational corporations that have moved their manufacturing operations overseas because of cheaper labor costs. Instead of simply taxing these corporations’ imported products, taxes should be based on the percentage of American citizens the businesses employ in the United States. Corporations employing a higher percentage of overseas workers in manufacturing their products would pay a higher tax. Conversely, corporations employing a very high percentage of American workers would pay dramatically lower taxes. <br> A progressive tax system based on the number of American workers might persuade corporations to bring factories home. By contrast, all foreign corporations would pay a uniform tariff on products they export to the United States. This uniform tariff would replace the current complex tariff scheme, which treats foreign-manufactured imports differently and unfairly. Motivating American corporations to create jobs in this country should be the primary consideration in any tax-reform plan. <br> Kevin Hluch, Frederick 
 What would you wish for if a genie appeared and offered you one wish? Even schoolchildren eventually stumble upon the right answer: “I would wish for 100 more wishes.” This playground wisdom explains why Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were smart to strike their debt-ceiling deal with President Trump. <br> With the arrival of the fall fiscal crisis, Schumer and Pelosi had leverage with Trump for the first time in his presidency: Because many Republicans were unwilling to vote to raise the federal debt ceiling, the president had no choice but to work with the Democrats on this must-pass legislation. In anticipation, congressional Democrats had lengthy debates over what they should “wish for” in return for giving Trump the 18-month debt-ceiling extension his Treasury Department wanted. Should they demand funding for key programs on the chopping block? Maybe an end to anti-Obamacare moves by the administration? <br> Of course, some Democrats believed that the party should stand by its Obama-era position and support a “clean” debt-ceiling bill — i.e., free of any extraneous provisions. Straying from that position, they worried, would mean that a future Democratic president might have to make unacceptable concessions to a future GOP Congress. Others believed (and still do) that the best deal would be to abolish the debt ceiling altogether. <br> In the midst of this mélange of opinions, Schumer and Pelosi had a powerful insight: Given that congressional Republicans are unwilling to check Trump’s worst excesses, Democrats need a special strategy to deal with a particularly reckless president. So the Democratic leaders negotiated for the legislative equivalent of “more wishes.” Rather than bargaining for specific concessions now in exchange for a long-term debt-ceiling extension, they sought an extension that was very short-term — about 90 days. In this way, they required Trump to come back to them soon for more negotiations. If, in future such showdowns, they continue to permit only short-term extensions, they will wind up with more opportunities to check Trump’s excesses and extract concessions from him. <br> As a result, the president would have to face — and win votes from — Democrats three or four more times before the 2018 elections. At each such juncture, Democrats would be needed to pass this legislation and would again have a device to force Trump to bargain. No wonder Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are so mad: They wanted to relegate congressional Democrats to irrelevancy for the remainder of the Congress and keep Trump talking only to Republicans. Schumer and Pelosi’s bargain denied the GOP congressional leaders this objective. <br> Of course, a wish for more wishes is not an end itself. Next time, Democrats have to find a way to move Trump on one or more key policy points. They also have to continue to keep this “legislative leash” short, and use their recurring “dates with Donald” to stop or roll back the worst of his actions if they cannot do so through other means (such as passing a stand-alone Dream Act). They have won a recurring seat at the table — no small feat given their minority status. Now, they have to show what they can do with it. (And near the end of Trump’s term, they should use this leverage to abolish the debt ceiling altogether: After using this weapon for the next 3½ years, they should eliminate it from ever being used again.) <br> The Schumer-Pelosi strategy is not without risks. Donald “Art of the Deal” Trump is a horrible negotiator but a superb spinner of negotiations: More times at the table with Trump means more times he may succeed at claiming victory. A pattern of regular and successful dealings could bolster Trump’s image as a “reasonable” president who is getting things done. <br> Moreover, by curtailing partisan strife over the debt limit, government funding and disaster relief this month, the deal does clear away some “must do” items in line before tax reform (though many others remain) — and may even create legislative calendar time for the GOP to take another run at repealing Obamacare this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The first job of the opposition party is to oppose: Winning leverage with Trump for future agreements is cold comfort if it facilitates other aspects of Trump’s agenda. <br> Ultimately, however, I know firsthand — having directed the Senate Democratic leadership staff after our drubbing in 1994 — that there can be no wins for the minority in Congress without taking some chances. When you cannot win with numbers, you need to win with guile and instinct. The Schumer-Pelosi strategy has risks. But in creating a mechanism to require Trump to repeatedly seek Democratic support for must-pass legislation, Schumer and Pelosi have gotten themselves previously unimaginable future leverage. That’s legislative genius, even without a genie. <br> Read more: <br> Greg Sargent: Trump just sided with Pelosi and Schumer.

 House Speaker Paul Ryan could not have been more clear. <br> After meeting with his Republican caucus Wednesday morning on the first day back from their long summer break, he declared at a news conference that Democrats’ call for a three-month extension of the government’s borrowing limit was “ridiculous.” <br> “That’s ridiculous and disgraceful, that they want to play politics with the debt ceiling at this moment,” he repeated. He called it “unworkable,” said it would jeopardize hurricane response and called out Democratic leaders by name for promoting what “I don’t think is a good idea.” <br> About an hour later, Ryan and other GOP leaders sat in the White House with President Trump, who told them he wants . . . a three-month increase of the debt ceiling, just as Democrats proposed. <br> Such chaos and confusion at the highest level of American government hadn’t been seen since, well, the day before. <br> On Tuesday, even as the administration announced that it was ending protection from deportation for the 800,000 “dreamers” — mostly young people who know no country but America — there were signs that Trump had no idea what he was doing. “As late as one hour before the decision was to be announced, administration officials privately expressed concern that Mr. Trump might not fully grasp the details of the steps he was about to take, and when he discovered their full impact, would change his mind,” Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis of the New York Times reported, citing an anonymous source. <br> Sure enough, Trump fired off a tweet Tuesday night that revised his position. He called on Congress to “legalize” the dreamers program and vowed to “revisit the issue” if Congress can’t. <br> Even Trump’s close advisers seem to have little knowledge of, much less control over, what he says and does. <br> Trump has signaled that he wants to end a free-trade deal with South Korea, even though his national security adviser, his defense secretary and the director of the National Economic Council all object. He and Defense Secretary James Mattis have contradicted each other about whether to talk with North Korea. Chief of Staff John Kelly’s attempts to tone down Trump’s antics have reportedly led Trump to escalate his attacks — on Kelly. Trump has publicly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions and repeatedly contradicted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner have let it leak that Trump ignored their advice on Charlottesville and other matters. <br> One imagines a future scene in the Situation Room: <br> The president: Why don’t we bomb Guam so the North Koreans can’t? <br> The secretary of state: That’s part of our country, sir. <br> The secretary of defense: We have thousands of troops there. <br> The national security adviser: And 150,000 innocent civilians. <br> The chief of staff: It would be a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe. <br> Ivanka Trump: Please don’t do this, Dad. <br> Jared Kushner: [Silence.] <br> The president: It’s settled. We begin bombing in five minutes. Let’s hit Hawaii, too. But not my hotel in Waikiki. <br> The unreliability of Trump has put an unusual burden on Congress, which is ill equipped to bear it. <br> Outside the House caucus gathering the morning after Trump’s immigration announcement, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), an immigration hard-liner, angrily opposed legislative action for the dreamers, saying they can “live in the shadows” and demanding GOP leaders not “divide our conference over an amnesty act.” <br> Minutes later, Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), took the opposite view, threatening to use a “discharge petition” with Democrats to force a vote on protecting the dreamers if the House doesn’t act. <br> Ryan put the responsibility right back on Trump for the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) legislation. “We will not be advancing legislation that does not have the support of President Trump, because we’re going to work with the president on how to do this legislation,” he said. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) urged Trump to lead. <br> But what does Trump support? <br> “We love the dreamers. . . . We think the dreamers are terrific,” Trump said last week, four days before putting them in jeopardy of deportation. <br> “I have a great heart for the folks we are talking about, a great love for them,” Trump said on the same day his administration announced the end of protection for the dreamers. <br> What does the president want? Nobody knows — not his advisers, not his fellow Republicans in Congress, and probably not Trump himself. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 As Congress returns from summer recess to a plate heaped with work — President Trump added a gooey serving of immigration reform Tuesday on top of the debt ceiling, the budget, hurricane relief and tax reform — another of America’s key institutions is marking 10 years that shook the world. <br> These simultaneous events have caused the strangest picture to form in my mind. I see Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, as the tonsured abbot of a Benedictine monastery in the middle of the 15th century. The abbot’s job is to oversee production of handwritten Bibles by monks in the abbey scriptorium. He and his predecessors have tended this vitally important labor for hundreds of years. <br> But now a goldsmith named Gutenberg, in a German town called Mainz, has devised a machine that can produce identical Bibles — or any other document, for that matter — quickly and cheaply using movable metal letters and oil-based ink. And the abbot is awakening to the realization that nothing will ever be same. <br> When Apple unveiled its first smartphone in 2007, the company sparked a communications revolution likely to be as transformative as Gutenberg’s. It’s the nature of such seismic change to shake the institutions of culture and society to the ground. <br> The explosive essence of the printing press was its ability to transmit information widely across space and time. Laypeople could own and read their own Bibles, and the result was the Reformation. Scientists could record their observations to share with other scientists, and inventors their innovations with other inventors, and the results were the Scientific and Industrial revolutions. Philosophers could spread their ideas to activists, and activists to more activists, and one result was that durable document that begins: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union . . . ” <br> If all of those changes could flow from oily ink on slugs of alloy, what earthquakes will follow from a technology that gives to nearly every human being the tools of worldwide mass communication? I find the question frankly mind-boggling. <br> But one thing is clear after the election of 2016 — the first American election truly dominated by mobile communication and the social networking it sparks: The future is cloudy for the likes of Mitch McConnell. The power of traditional party leaders flows from their ability to make, and control, connections that are otherwise extremely difficult. A well-run party controls the connection between a candidate and a line on the ballot. It controls access to key donors, who can open the gateway to television, the great persuader. Through these and other linkages, the party mediates the most important connection of all, between the candidate and the voters. <br> We saw last year that the power of the smartphone is vaporizing these functions. Donald Trump captured the Republican ballot line even though he had no appreciable connection to the Republican Party. Nothing like it had ever happened to an American political party. Trump had his own access to television after decades as a public performer and provocateur. More important, though, was the way he leveraged his celebrity via smartphone. His millions of followers on Twitter and Facebook became a rapidly growing Party of Trump. His supporters felt a personal and authentic connection that left no room for mediation by GOP elites. <br> Democratic bosses narrowly avoided a similar loss of control. Only their insider system of superdelegates cushioned them from the threat of a takeover by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Powered by smartphone connectivity, Sanders supporters were able to crowdfund a nearly $230 million primary challenge that almost ousted the choice of the party leaders, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. <br> In the cloisters of the Senate, Abbot McConnell’s scribes are his 51 fellow Republican senators, who, to one degree or another, must be asking themselves what this revolution means for them. If they fall into line behind their party leader on such difficult issues as debt, taxes and immigration, can he shield them from the critics who mobilize at the touch of a screen? Of course not — McConnell can’t even shield himself from the president’s tweets. <br> Perhaps Democrats could help him through his legislative minefield? That path is no easier. McConnell’s knack has always been discipline, not compromise. Reaching across party lines is unnatural for a man whose devotion to the Republican Party is as pure and permanent as a monk’s vow. <br> Moreover, it’s highly uncertain how much compromise is possible in this new age of direct connectivity. Any Democrat who votes for legislation that frees McConnell from a jam and gives the president an occasion to brag is likely to face a storm of Internet opposition. <br> In short, Pennsylvania Avenue is not the place to read the future of politics. Look instead toward Cupertino, Calif., where on Sept. 12 a new iPhone will remind us that change is the new normal. <br> Read more from David Von Drehle’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Christine Emba: Smartphones changed our lives.

 It has become axiomatic that when President Trump says or does something over the top or below the belt, beware the unseen. <br> His cunning use of distraction turns red herrings green with envy. <br> The template works like this: Trump says something outrageous that drives Washington’s Bubble Belt wild. The media leaps to outrage while bookers haul in “experts” to intone the obvious in exchange for makeup and a limo. <br> Next, the same talking heads, commentators and columnists lament the time wasted on such trivia as, say, first lady Melania Trump’s wearing stiletto heels to visit victims of Hurricane Harvey. Critics and the media itself lament that Important Issues are being ignored while attention is turned on, oh, whether Ivanka and Jared are being snubbed by the D.C. in-crowd, such as it is. The point is taken, but one should note that nothing is ever being ignored by everyone. Or, rather, everything of import is being monitored and commented upon by someone. <br> [History shows us how calamitous the North Korea crisis could become] <br> But then, broadcast and cable producers know — and Trump knows deeply — that most Americans don’t really care that much about what they insist they care about. A few headlines will get most through the morning. Twitter and Facebook keep the curious plied with updates, and by day’s end, who really wants to plunge into tax reform? <br> It is true, nonetheless, that when Trump needs time to fidget with something that actually matters, he tosses a dead fish into the Dasani tank and waits for the media herdlings to begin their march toward the trough. <br> Temporarily spared the spotlight, Trump fluffs the thatched nest atop his head and invites his brain to hatch some very bad ideas. Thus, we seem to be on the brink of a nuclear confrontation with North Korea. Remember when we used to worry about Trump having his finger on the nuclear launch button? Square that. When the other antagonist is North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, the nightmare can’t be dismissed as the twisted hankie of the persistently worried. <br> Never have two less qualified “leaders” been so endowed with such devastating power without the requisite impulse control upon which living civilizations depend. Not to mention that these two nuke hecklers are unmercifully coifed to resemble cartoon characters so that we, the soberly sane, are left to ponder our face-melting demise as a clown showdown between two renegade circus performers. The horror movie “It,” featuring a diabolical clown and opening this week, couldn’t pay for better timing. <br> Meanwhile, one seeks cooler comfort in the memory of the Cuban missile crisis between Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and President John F. Kennedy. At least these men were capable of finding an alternative to worst-case scenarios. There seems to be no such inclination on North Korea’s part or, frankly, on Trump’s. Unless our reality star-in-chief holds his sagacity in reserve for special occasions such as this, there’s little reason to assume or hope he’ll diplomatically temper his counterpart’s apparent need to demonstrate his manhood. <br> In July, Trump was typically eloquent in describing his approach to thwarting disaster: <br> “We’ll handle North Korea. We’ll be able to handle North Korea. It will be handled. We handle everything.” <br> Whew, that. <br> As further insult to reason, this isn’t even a conflict over something at least historically rational, such as the now nearly charming contest between communism and Americanism. No battle of wits, the U.S.-North Korea stare-down is more accurately a battle of nitwits who seem to think threatening nuclear holocaust and mutual destruction is a contest to see who has bigger hands. <br> [Inside Russia’s growing role in the North Korean nuclear crisis] <br> No one would suggest that Trump is responsible for all the nail biting these past few months or that Kim’s missile and nuclear tests aren’t deadly serious. But Trump surely has exacerbated matters with his “fire and fury” rhetoric. The goading language of ultimatum, more than a bluffing tactic, is an inflammatory agent such that the possible moves inexorably toward the inevitable. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the president’s toughest-talking Cabinet member, recently said: “We have kicked the can down the road long enough. There is no more road left.” <br> Perhaps Kim might argue the same. Meanwhile, a can-kicking strategy (i.e., containment and diplomacy) seems a not-irrational substitute for mutual annihilation. Have we reached a point of no return? Will the president of the United States fire Kim, or will he invent some new distraction (staffers: Watch your backs) while he becomes a stealth, wartime leader? <br> Stay tuned.

 What’s holding back the Republican agenda? <br> It’s not the toothless Democrats, despite what you may have heard from President Trump. Five months ago, when Trump moved into the White House, they lost their grip on their last lever of significant Washington power. <br> Likewise, it’s not Trump’s infernal nocturnal tweets, unhelpful though they may be. <br> Neither is it the distraction of nonstop news about Trump’s aides’ ties to Russia or the president’s own possible attempts to obstruct justice. <br> Nor is it leaky White House staffers, nor the operatives of the “deep state.” <br> So what’s actually obstructing the Republican agenda? It’s the fact that there is no Republican agenda. <br> For years Republicans, including and especially the party’s current standard-bearer, have promised magic bullets for nearly every social, economic and global ill, no matter how complex. But this was not a policy platform; this was a series of bluffs disguised as a policy platform. <br> The latest bluff arrives this week, as the White House promotes its grand plan to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure. This promotional effort comes despite an acknowledgment from National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn that no such grand plan exists. (A month earlier, Trump claimed his administration’s infrastructure proposal was already “largely completed.”) <br> On other domestic issues, Republicans have been touting the superiority of their woolly policy agenda for ages. Trump merely added a little color to the con. <br> Republican members of Congress voted dozens of times to repeal Obamacare, knowing full well that their ill-conceived bills would never become law. Eventually the pledge to “repeal” the law morphed into a vague promise to “repeal and replace” it. <br> With Trump helming the party, the fantastical achievements of this TBD replacement plan grew greater by the day. It would offer, Trump promised, more widespread insurance coverage, cheaper premiums, lower deductibles, superior care and no cuts to Medicaid. <br> “We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” Trump told The Post in January. Americans would be “beautifully covered.” <br> The plan that passed the House last month achieves none of this. And the proposal’s status in the Senate remains in limbo, given that Republican senators cannot agree on what a Republican health-care plan should actually do. <br> Tax reform, arguably the GOP’s top priority, is on hold as well. And again, not because Democrats are undermining it — but because Republicans can’t figure out what their priorities are, or how to achieve them. <br> They have promised to cut rates for everyone and somehow not cost the government a dime. Predictably, Republicans cannot agree how this magical revenue-neutral tax reform proposal would work. Proposed revenue sources, such as a “ border adjustment ” tax or the elimination of the state and local tax deduction, remain contentious, and even those would not fully cover the cost of steep rate cuts. <br> Sometimes the White House claims these tax cuts will pay for themselves through additional economic growth, and sometimes it says they won’t. The administration is so ambivalent about its own fiscal policies that last week Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, disavowed the tax portion of his own budget. <br> “I wouldn’t take what’s in the budget as indicative of what our proposals are,” he told the Washington Examiner. <br> This confusion about what the party — and the presidency — stands for extends to foreign matters as well. <br> Trump has declared that NAFTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris climate accord and even the NATO alliance are all “bad deals” for the United States and that he would negotiate better ones. He has yet to produce even a coherent explanation of what a “better deal” would look like. <br> Trump’s most brazen bluff, of course, dates back two years, when he bragged about his “secret” plan to defeat the Islamic State, a plan so potent and powerful that it would reveal he knew more than the generals. <br> “All I can tell you is that it is a foolproof way of winning, and I’m not talking about what some people would say, but it is a foolproof way of winning the war with ISIS,” he promised, declaring that his plan would achieve “total victory.” Secrecy was paramount, he insisted, not only because he didn’t want the Islamic State to find out but also because he didn’t want his political rivals to steal his brilliant scheme and claim credit. (America First, indeed.) <br> Two years later, there’s still no “foolproof” new plan, no “total victory” — on the Islamic State, health care, taxes, trade, infrastructure or any other major issue. Yet we keep being told a game-changing policy package is but a few weeks away. <br> This bluffing has gone on long enough.

 John McCain, a Republican, represents Arizona in the U.S. Senate. <br> Americans recoiled from the repugnant spectacle of white supremacists marching in Charlottesville to promote their un-American “blood and soil” ideology. There is nothing in their hate-driven racism that can match the strength of a nation conceived in liberty and comprising 323 million souls of different origins and opinions who are equal under the law. <br> Most of us share Heather Heyer’s values, not the depravity of the man who took her life. We are the country that led the free world to victory over fascism and dispatched communism to the ash heap of history. We are the superpower that organized not an empire, but an international order of free, independent nations that has liberated more people from poverty and tyranny than anyone thought possible in the age of colonies and autocracies. <br> Our shared values define us more than our differences. And acknowledging those shared values can see us through our challenges today if we have the wisdom to trust in them again. <br> Congress will return from recess next week facing continued gridlock as we lurch from one self-created crisis to another. We are proving inadequate not only to our most difficult problems but also to routine duties. Our national political campaigns never stop. We seem convinced that majorities exist to impose their will with few concessions and that minorities exist to prevent the party in power from doing anything important. <br> That’s not how we were meant to govern. Our entire system of government — with its checks and balances, its bicameral Congress, its protections of the rights of the minority — was designed for compromise. It seldom works smoothly or speedily. It was never expected to. <br> It requires pragmatic problem-solving from even the most passionate partisans. It relies on compromise between opposing sides to protect the interests we share. We can fight like hell for our ideas to prevail. But we have to respect each other or at least respect the fact that we need each other. <br> That has never been truer than today, when Congress must govern with a president who has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct. <br> We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don’t answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power. And we should value our identity as members of Congress more than our partisan affiliation. <br> I argued during the health-care debate for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts. <br> We won’t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions. And all of us in Congress have the duty, in this sharply polarized atmosphere, to defend the necessity of compromise before the American public. <br> Let’s try that approach on a budget that realistically meets the nation’s critical needs. We all know spending levels for defense and other urgent priorities have been woefully inadequate for years. But we haven’t found the will to work together to adjust them. The appropriators can’t complete their spending bills, and we’re stuck with threats of a government shutdown and continuing resolutions that underfund national security. A compromise that raises spending caps for both sides’ priorities is better than the abject failure that has been our achievement to date. <br> Let’s also try that approach on immigration. The president has promised greater border security. We can agree to that. A literal wall might not be the most effective means to that end, but we can provide the resources necessary to secure the border with smart and affordable measures. Let’s make it part of a comprehensive bill that members of both parties can get behind — one that values our security as well as the humanity of immigrants and their contributions to our economy and culture. <br> Let’s try it on tax reform and infrastructure improvement and all the other urgent priorities confronting us. These are all opportunities to show that ordinary, decent, free people can govern competently, respectfully and humbly, and to prove the value of the United States Congress to the great nation we serve. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Republicans, ignore Trump’s call to ‘let Obamacare fail.’ Do this instead. <br> Dana Milbank: How did Congress go from compromise one day to toxicity the next?

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD two responses to last week’s appointment of a special counsel to take over the Russia investigation — one unbecoming, the other somewhat reasonable. <br> “The entire thing has been a witch hunt,” Mr. Trump declared at a Thursday news conference, denying that there was any collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives seeking to disrupt the 2016 election. “I think it divides the country.” That is rich coming from a man who has exacerbated national divisions for political gain, and whose abrupt and unnecessary dismissal of FBI Director James B. Comey spurred the appointment of a special counsel. <br> But, the president later said, “we have to get back to running this country really, really well.” Putting aside that Mr. Trump has not yet run the country well, there is some wisdom there. <br> It will take time for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to conduct a fair investigation, particularly if he is to be appropriately thorough, examining any financial connections Mr. Trump has to Russia and any pressure the president put on the FBI to drop its investigation. Meanwhile, the revelations of the past two weeks demand that the House and Senate intensify their own Russia investigations. Congress has a new charge: considering whether the president committed obstruction of justice, which only lawmakers are empowered to decide. Yet they, too, will require time if they are to assess the issues Congress is uniquely suited to probe — any noncriminal misjudgments and ethical lapses by Mr. Trump and his circle, not to mention how to prepare the country for future Russian cyberattacks. <br> The country’s business cannot stagnate in the meantime. That means Mr. Trump must stop expressing and acting on his undeserved sense of self-pity. It means that Democrats will have to talk about something other than impeachment in the coming weeks. And it means that congressional Republicans will have to face the task at which they have so far failed: governing responsibly. <br> The country’s health-care system is on the verge of crisis, induced in large part by Republican refusal to administer the system properly. The availability of crucial federal subsidies the government promised to health insurers remains in doubt, because of administration and congressional bungling. Meanwhile, Republicans’ ham-handed effort to rewrite federal health policy — which requires tweaking, not a destabilizing overhaul — has only stoked more uncertainty among the insurers upon which the system relies. <br> Meanwhile, the world waits to see whether Mr. Trump will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, an unthinkably irrational move that would enrage allied governments for no material benefit — but that ideologues such as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt favor. <br> Come September, Congress will have to pass a new budget and raise the debt ceiling, facing the sorts of deadlines that have in the past resulted in messy, last-minute legislative fights. Tax reform that removes the underbrush of exceptions, loopholes and other complexities in the tax code would be worthwhile, but only if Republicans accept that such reform cannot come at the expense of defunding health-care programs and cannot result in higher deficits. <br> Abroad, North Korea continues to advance toward a capability to launch missiles with nuclear warheads that could reach the United States. Syria remains a charnel house and the Islamic State a serious threat. U.S. allies are concerned that chaos in Washington will invite Iran, Russia and other hostile powers to take advantage in ways they would not otherwise dare. <br> So yes, the president and Congress need to focus on running the country. And running it well, for a change. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Ronald A.

 William Cline is going against the grain. Cline, a well-known economist, isn’t convinced that the stock market is wildly overvalued. That’s an increasingly lonely view. <br> “Warning Signs Mount as Stocks Stumble,” the Wall Street Journal headlined this week. “Investors are running out of reasons to keep buying U.S. stocks, exposing a growing number of warning signs,” the Journal wrote. The most commonly cited are high P/E ratios, meaning the relationship between stocks’ prices (the P) and their profits or earnings (the E). A June survey of investment managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that 84 percent felt U.S. stocks were the most overvalued in the world. <br> Going back to 1936, the average P/E for the reported earnings of the Standard Poor’s 500 stocks has been about 17, notes Howard Silverblatt of SP. Recently, the P/E has been about 24. Some tech companies have especially high P/Es. <br> Not so fast, says Cline in a short paper for the Peterson Institute, the Washington think tank where he works. Statistical comparisons with the past, he argues, suggest the conventional wisdom is wrong. “Low inflation, low unemployment and low interest rates [create] considerable justification for the relatively high price-earnings ratios,” he writes. <br> The stakes in this dispute are substantial. A weakening stock market could hurt the “real economy” of production and jobs, as consumers feel less confident and spend less. A falling market would also compound the woes of President Trump, who has viewed climbing stocks as evidence that support for his policies is greater than media coverage indicates. <br> Even Cline says the market’s advance has been “robust.” From year-end 2011 to year-end 2016, the Standard Poor’s (SP) index of 500 stocks rose an impressive 78 percent. Still, he notes, the gain is much less than the increase in a similar five-year period that led to the dot-com bubble. From year-end 1994 to year-end 1999, the SP rose 220 percent. <br> From 2002 to 2012, Cline says, stocks mostly followed profits upward. This is relatively uncontroversial. Fundamentally, stocks are supposed to reflect companies’ present and expected future profits. But since 2012, stock prices have increased faster than profits, raising questions about whether the market is riding an unsustainable speculative wave. <br> One explanation, according to Cline, is optimism about future profits. He cites forecasts by investment analysts that profits will grow rapidly in the next few years, up 37 percent in 2018 from 2016 levels. The more investors believe upbeat expectations, the more they can justify today’s high stock prices. <br> Cline relies heavily on a statistical model that attributes stocks’ P/E ratios to three factors: the unemployment rate; the inflation rate; and interest rates as measured by the rate on 10-year Treasury notes. There’s a logic behind each. Low unemployment signifies strong profitability — good for stocks — while a higher jobless rate favors the opposite. Higher inflation fosters uncertainty and weaker profits. Higher interest rates draw money from stocks into bonds and certificates of deposit. <br> Cline likes the results. “During the past five years,” he writes, “the predicted P/E ratio has been relatively close to the actual level.” <br> All in all, he reasons that stocks aren’t trading far outside of what historical experience would suggest. The takeaway, if true, is that markets are acting mostly rationally and aren’t driven by speculation. Stocks are simply more attractive than most alternatives today. <br> But even Cline’s calculus rests on optimistic assumptions — strong gains in profits, muted inflation, and low unemployment and interest rates. Any of these favorable conditions could reverse. <br> Rising interest rates are the most obvious vulnerability. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is nudging rates higher to preempt worsening inflation and financial speculation. It’s also possible that the turmoil of the Trump administration could spill into financial markets, as investors conclude that many of the president’s proposals, including so-called tax reform, stand a scant chance of passage. <br> So: The stock market may not be crazy, but it’s certainly giddy. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Michael A. Needham is chief executive officer of Heritage Action for America. <br> President Trump’s young administration is not yet at a crossroads, but finger-pointing over the now-tabled Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — will only help the Democrats’ presidential nominee in 2020. Instead, conservatives should relish the opportunity to reset the debate. <br>  Last week’s episode offers a few lessons for the Republican Party: Conservative commentator Reihan Salam suggested the “mad dash” to draft the GOP health-care bill wound up “alienating Freedom Caucus members who wanted to play an active role in shaping it.” And despite the bill’s multitude of problems — Trump said there were things he “didn’t particularly like” in the bill — conservative health-care expert Avik Roy noted that the “GOP’s right wing came to a surprisingly pragmatic realization” and “reoriented their efforts toward repealing most, if not all, of Obamacare’s insurance regulations.” <br>  It was that pragmatic push that nearly resulted in a last-minute deal between congressional conservatives and the bill’s supporters. That the deal was so close suggests that House leaders could move quickly to bring the bill back to the floor with the inclusion of language that repeals more of Obamacare’s insurance regulations, such as federal mandates to cover comprehensive health benefits; actuarial values denoting different tiers of coverage; and community rating requirements preventing insurers from charging lower premiums for younger, healthier consumers. <br>  Two questions loom large. First, why was repeal of Obamacare’s insurance industry mandates so controversial within the Republican Party? And second, why are congressional leaders and the president so eager to move on to tax reform? <br>  Republican leaders insisted for weeks that the only roadblocks to deregulation were procedural, not political. But this claim came under scrutiny at the last minute, forcing Republicans to try to negotiate an overhaul of the essential benefits mandated under Obamacare. Moderates such as Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) in turn complained that party leaders had “pushed this bill too far to the right.” <br> Clearly, there is a policy divide that needs to be debated and negotiated. But there’s no reason to think Republicans wouldn’t be able to bridge that divide in the coming weeks — so long as they forgo their ultimatums for true deliberation. <br>  We all want to ensure that citizens with preexisting conditions and other needs are cared for. That can be done far better, however, outside of Obamacare’s regulatory architecture. A deregulated insurance market would allow Americans to buy inexpensive insurance when they are young and carry it with them throughout their lives. <br> Indeed, “repeal and replace” became a rallying cry that transformed into electoral victory in November because 10 million Americans in the individual market who don’t get Obamacare subsidies will see their premiums skyrocket</b>. The same is true for 15 million in the small-group market. In that light, deregulating insurance markets should not be viewed as a political minefield, but rather as an opportunity to provide citizens with coverage that makes far more sense for them than what government bureaucrats mandate. <br> The hard work of coalition-building, consensus-finding and implementing a legislative agenda to make America great again is exactly what our urgent times call for. It is also a far easier path to completing Trump’s ambitious legislative agenda than moving on to other priorities. <br>  Some characterize an immediate pivot to tax reform as easy. But if party leaders move on before resolving the Obamacare dispute, they will find that there is a massive trust deficit on all sides that will make the path harrowing. And the policy itself will be less ambitious because the revenue baseline will remain roughly $1 trillion higher with Obamacare as the law of the land, giving Republicans less room to work with under congressional budgeting rules. <br>  Already, concerns are emerging that unified Republican control of Washington will result in a permanent state of paralysis. That does not have to be the case, but progress requires a coherent governing vision that combines three elements: conservative principles, Trump’s brand of economic nationalism, and an understanding of the party’s significant and often intransigent moderate wing. <br>  There is too much at stake to jettison that vision for the expediency of “moving on” to other governing priorities that seem less daunting. If Trump and congressional Republicans aspire to do more than recite campaign slogans, they should rally around policies that will actually drive down the cost of health insurance in America. That would be both great policy and good politics. <br> Read more here: <br> Charles Krauthammer: The real world of Obamacare repeal <br> Catherine Rampell: The Republican health-care plan isn’t about health care at all <br> Dana Milbank: The Republican health-care plan’s top critics?

 Attorney General Jeff Sessions showed up unannounced in the White House briefing room to attempt something President Trump very much needed after Friday’s health-care debacle: a change of subject. <br> Sessions, accompanied by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, revived one of the reliable applause lines from the campaign, a crackdown on “sanctuary cities” harboring illegal immigrants. “DUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, gang rapes, crimes against children and murders,” the attorney general recited. “Countless Americans would be alive today and countless loved ones would not be grieving today if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended.” <br> But for all the sturm und drang, Sessions didn’t have much to announce. <br> “Sounds like you’re applying the standards and the policy that the Obama administration put forward,” CBS News’s Major Garrett observed when Sessions finished his statement. “Are you taking any additional steps?” <br> “Well, that’s a good question,” Sessions replied. And the answer, apparently, is “no.” Sessions said there could be additional requirements “in the future” beyond those the Obama administration had. But not just yet. <br> [How Trump can get his groove back] <br> Such policy anticlimaxes are becoming routine in Trump world. Tough rhetoric, big promises — and no substance. Trump looks more and more like a man without a plan. <br> He promised he would have a health-care plan that would be cheaper and better than Obamacare and would cover just as many. But when it came time to deliver, he had nothing. He left the policy to House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the resulting proposal would have meant 24 million fewer people with health coverage. The bill collapsed in spectacular fashion under opposition from Democrats, moderate Republicans and conservatives — and Trump is blaming everybody but himself. <br> During the campaign, he said he had a secret plan to defeat the Islamic State. He said he had a “foolproof” plan of “defeating them quickly and effectively and having total victory.” Now, it turns out, he has no plan. He has asked the Pentagon to create one. “We will figure something out,” he said last week. <br> Vowing to keep Americans safe at home, he originally promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” before tempering that campaign promise to the restricting of travelers from certain countries. But since administration lawyers tried to put that vague notion into an actual policy, his attempts at imposing a “travel ban” have been repeatedly shot down in court. <br> Next up after the health-care failure is Trump’s promise to enact “historic” tax reform. But now that it’s time to present a policy, the promise looks more histrionic than historic. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he wants to have legislation in August, but Spicer on Monday was backpedaling. <br> “I know that Secretary Mnuchin has talked about August as a target date, and I think it depends,” Spicer said in response to a question from Alexis Simendinger from RealClearPolitics. He added that “this is going to be dependent on whether, how, the degree to which we can come to consensus on a lot of big issues.” And he concluded, “So, you know, we’re not — we’re not there yet.” <br> During the campaign, Trump boldly vowed that he would eliminate the U.S. debt, now about $20 trillion, during his term. He then said he would cut the debt in half. But when CNBC’s Eamon Javers asked about whether Trump would allow tax reform to add to the deficit (and therefore the debt), Spicer said it was “really early” to be raising such questions. “You’re asking really early in the process to make that kind of analysis before we have a policy set forth,” he protested. <br> How presumptuous to expect Trump, after campaigning on historic tax reform, actually to have a proposal! <br> [Trump could learn a lot from his mistakes. He won’t.] <br> The emerging evidence that Trump doesn’t have a plan for much of anything isn’t entirely bad. No plan is better than a bad plan. In theory, at least, this means Trump could change course. <br> And Spicer, expanding on remarks Trump made after the health-care bill collapsed Friday, said the president was ready to work with Democrats. “There may be other opportunities to work with people across the aisle,” he said, later adding that “if Democrats want to join in, then that’s great and we’ll do that.” <br> ABC News’s Jonathan Karl noted that such behavior would “require a serious change of course for the president.” <br> “To some degree, sure,” Spicer readily replied. <br> But Trump has never demonstrated an ability to change, and even if he could, some of his top advisers would resist him, many Republicans in Congress would revolt, and Trump’s supporters would be furious. <br> Having actual policies may just not be part of this president’s plan. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 British politicians are familiar with the term “reshuffle,” when senior figures in the government switch portfolios or get tossed out or brought into the government. And they’re also very familiar with “coalition governments,” when ruling governments divide jobs and authorities between two or more parties. American politicians could find study of both concepts useful. The executive branch has completed a major reshuffle over the past month. If the White House can match that with a smart policy push, the coalition between the Trump White House and the Capitol Hill GOP, though battered, could come together again quickly out of shared self-interest. <br> I’ve been arguing for months that what we have in Washington is a coalition government between President Trump, his team and his core voters, and congressional Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.). The bridge between the coalition’s halves has often been kept open by the vice president, but the president himself has proven adept at quietly working with coalition’s many elements. Both the president and vice president can now spend some of the balance of the summer ensuring that it is indeed open and that there is traffic flowing in both directions. <br> As for the reshuffle, the exit of Stephen K. Bannon completes a restructuring of the West Wing that began almost as soon as the president took office and is now apparently complete. Like the physical renovation of the West Wing, it was noisy and not very attractive but necessary. The partnership between the executive- and legislative-branch Republicans simply could not have lasted without changes in the administration. <br> Six months in, the president has assembled the best national security team of my lifetime, led by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While his communications team remains somewhat in flux, interim communications director Hope Hicks has been at the president’s side since the beginning of his campaign and enjoys his confidence. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is growing in confidence and command of the press briefing room. Vice President Pence’s new chief of staff , Nick Ayers, a capable staffer liked by all sides of the GOP, will be an invaluable resource not just to the vice president but to the president’s entire senior executive team. <br> On the domestic policy front, senior economic adviser Gary Cohn and White House Counsel Don McGahn, along with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, are firmly in control of the domestic policy process. Committed reformers such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price are in strong and stable positions now as staffing of political appointees accelerates. (I leave out Rex Tillerson’s State Department, where there remains an extraordinarily high degree of instability.) <br> On the Hill, the congressional GOP is hungry for more success beyond the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. The Veterans Affairs reform bill and 14 Congressional Review Act laws , while enormously significant, were low-profile victories. The filling of dozens of additional federal court vacancies behind Gorsuch is getting organized and moving forward finally, and dozens of confirmations, particularly of the key circuit court openings, and perhaps the end of the anti-constitutional “blue slips” are crucial wins within reach too. But what is needed above all is either a tax bill or resurrection of a health-care fix. Slashing the corporate tax rate is probably the easiest (and perhaps most economically significant) bit of legislation to accomplish, but so too must arrive the repeal of the Budget Control Act, which has devastated national security via the “sequester” and hamstrung a key Trump promise — that of a 355-ship Navy. Both the corporate tax cut and repeal of the BCA are worth daring the Democrats to shutter the government over, as voters understand both are crucial to the well-being of the country. <br> A grand bipartisan agreement on infrastructure and immigration is within reach as well. Senators enjoying the president’s confidence such as Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) can team with reasonable senators across the aisle such as Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) and Angus King (I-Maine) to draft a genuine breakthrough bill: one that delivers much-needed sanity to legal immigration goals, a legal form of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and of course infrastructure funding, including a long, strong border fence — the visible expression of a genuine commitment to border security. Infrastructure funding — which is mostly block-granted to county governments — allows federalism’s beauty to work and puts Americans to work on needed projects quickly, and, if drafted the right way, won’t be as ineffective as 2009’s “stimulus.” <br> The last ingredient in a successful reset will be the president’s rhetoric. He gave great speeches in Saudi Arabia and Poland on crucial issues of Islamist extremism and the inherent goodness of the West. Now he needs to give some key addresses at home, about American equality and the essential demands of citizenship, including an iron commitment to the rule of law and respect for constitutional norms. He needs scribes who can help the president craft messages not in 140 characters but 40 or so minutes that raise the eyes of Americans to the wins for all Americans on the board and to shared goals of economic and national security for all Americans. There are already some talented writers in the Old Executive Office Building. Put them to work. <br> Trump’s strategic resolve must be to focus on a legislative agenda that does fit in 140 characters — a cut in the corporate tax rate, repeal of the defense sequester, a bigger Navy, a real border fence, a legal-immigration overhaul and originalist judges — combined with continued, reiterated strategic clarity toward the Islamic State, Iran, North Korea, Russia and China. If he works with his partners in Congress, these are all doable. And the team to help the president do it seems, finally, to be in place. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Bannon’s departure doesn’t fix everything — but it could help <br> Ed Rogers: Jeff Sessions is Trump’s MVP in the aftermath of Charlottesville <br> Jennifer Rubin: Don’t fall for the White House spin on Stephen Bannon’s ouster <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Evidence is piling up that Donald Trump does not really want to be president of the United States. <br> He certainly doesn’t look happy in the job. In his previous life, Trump met whomever he wanted to meet and said whatever he wanted to say. But like all presidents, he finds himself ever more isolated, and his displeasure shows on his face. The loneliness of the job — which so many of his predecessors have ruefully reported — is wearing on him. <br> And it’s more than that. Past presidents also tell us that no one can fully appreciate the dimensions of the job in advance. With no previous political experience, Trump’s learning curve has been even steeper than usual, and the more he sees of the job, the less he wants to do it. He balks at the briefings, the talking points, the follow-through. <br> He was drawn to the fame of it, as he once told me aboard his private jet. “It’s the ratings . . . that gives you power,” then-candidate Trump explained. “It’s not the polls. It’s the ratings.” He loves being the most talked-about man on Earth. <br> But unlike reality TV stars, presidents aren’t famous for being famous. They command the world’s attention because they are the temporary embodiments of America’s strength, aspirations and responsibilities. <br> It is a paradoxically self-effacing fame. The job demands that hugely competitive, driven, ambitious individuals — for that’s what it takes to win the job — inhabit a role that requires them to be something other than nakedly themselves. <br> As some Trump associates tell it, he never intended to be elected. But having won the part, he doesn’t want to play it, a fact irrefutable after Charlottesville. Rather than speak for the nation — the president’s job — he spoke for Trump. Rather than apply shared values, he apportioned blame. <br> The presidency calls for care and cunning. All successful presidents have known when to say less rather than more. George Washington’s second inaugural address was 135 words long. President Abraham Lincoln often disappointed clamoring crowds, telling them that the risk of a wrong word made it too dangerous for him to deliver a speech. President Ronald Reagan was famous for cupping his ear and shrugging as he pretended not to hear an untimely question. <br> Did these men ever itch to win an argument, as Trump did in his Tuesday news conference, with such disastrous results? Of course they did. But a president can’t indulge such impulses. <br> Discipline in thought and speech is the machinery by which a president leads a free people. He hasn’t the power to purge his enemies or censor the press. His strength rests on his ability to persuade. His power grows through a record of hard-won results. He seeks friends and respect, not enemies and outrage. Between fired aides (strategist Stephen K. Bannon got the boot Friday) and fleeing allies, Trump is losing friends faster than a bully at a birthday party. <br> Reflecting more and reacting less: That’s how a president gets through all seven days of a week supposedly focused on infrastructure without having his advisory council on infrastructure implode. With enough of that focus and discipline, a president might eventually foster an infrastructure bill — an actual law with real money behind it, something more than bluster — that creates jobs and feeds progress and raises spirits. <br> It’s hard work. As shareholders in this enterprise, Americans are asking what disciplined, focused labor Trump performed to pass a health-care bill. What hard ground has he plowed, what water has he carried, to grow the seeds of tax reform? <br> The president’s job is to understand that the world has plenty of troubles in store for this nation. His role is not to add to their number. There will be moments when the president must stir us up, so in the meantime, his task is to keep us calm. <br> If Trump were still in private business, he would have no trouble diagnosing this situation. A serial entrepreneur like Trump learns to recognize when a venture isn’t panning out. Over the years, he splashed, then crashed, in businesses as diverse as casinos, an airline and for-profit seminars. His willingness to fish has always been matched by a willingness to cut bait. <br> Or, as a veteran boss, he might see his predicament as a personnel move that hasn’t clicked. Trump has made many, many hires over his career, and some (as recently as Bannon’s) don’t work out. “Not a good fit,” the saying goes. <br> The presidency is not a good fit for Trump. It’s a scripted role; he’s an improviser. It’s an accountable position; he’s a free spirit. Yes, the employment contract normally runs four years. But at his age and station, what’s the point of staying in a job he doesn’t want? <br> Read more from David Von Drehle’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Michael Gerson: There is a shriveled emptiness where Trump’s soul once resided <br> Eugene Robinson: History will remember the Republicans who stick around <br> Fareed Zakaria: The mealy-mouthed cowardice of America’s elites after Charlottesville <br> Anne Applebaum: Beware: Trump may use the alt-right to turn himself into the center <br> Jonathan Capehart: Trump is a cancer on the presidency <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 President Trump has dropped all pretense and proudly raised the banner of white racial grievance. The time has come for Republicans in Congress to decide whether this is what they signed up for. <br> Business leaders decided Wednesday that they’d had enough, quitting two presidential advisory councils before Trump quickly dissolved the panels. Military leaders made their call as well, issuing statements — in the wake of Charlottesville — making clear that they embrace diversity and reject bigotry. <br> With only a few exceptions, however, GOP political leaders have been too timid to denounce the president and the reprehensible game of racial politics he’s playing. I think the corporate chief executives who bailed are making the right bet: History will remember who spoke out, who was complicit and who stood idly by. <br> On Twitter (where else?), Trump poured salt in the nation’s wounds Thursday by coming out firmly against the removal of public monuments to the Confederacy — the issue that brought white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to Charlottesville and led to the death of Heather Heyer. <br> “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,” he wrote. “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson — who’s next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!” <br> Some slippery-slope arguments are valid, but the one Trump makes is absurd. He can’t possibly be so dense that he doesn’t see a clear distinction between the men who founded this nation and those who tried to rip it apart. <br> Trump may indeed not know that most of those Confederate monuments were erected not in the years right after the Civil War but around the turn of the 20th century, when the Jim Crow system of state-enforced racial oppression was being established. They symbolize not history but the defiance of history; they celebrate not defeat on the battlefield but victory in putting uppity African Americans back in their place. <br> But even if someone explained all of this to Trump — perhaps in a one-page memo with lots of pictures — he wouldn’t care. For him, the important thing is to tell the white voters who constitute his base that they are being disrespected and dispossessed. It’s a cynical and dangerous ploy. <br> We know this is Trump’s game because White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon told us so. In an interview with journalist Robert Kuttner of the American Prospect, published Wednesday, Bannon is quoted as saying: “The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.” <br> But Trump’s base won’t identify with Nazis and the KKK. That’s why Trump maintained — falsely — that among the torch-bearing Charlottesville white supremacists there were also plenty of “very fine people.” And it’s why he now seeks to broaden the issue to encompass Confederate monuments nationwide, abandoning his earlier position that the question should be left to local jurisdictions. <br> That’s probably also why Bannon, in the interview with Kuttner, referred to the white-power clowns as, well, “clowns.” He’s smart enough to reassure Trump supporters that they’re not like those racists and that all the racial game-playing is on the other side. <br> Trump’s desperation is palpable. His approval ratings have slid perilously close to the danger zone where Republican officeholders no longer fear crossing him. <br> For titans of the business community, the tipping point came Wednesday. The chief executives of General Electric, Campbell Soup, Johnson Johnson and 3M decided they could no longer serve on Trump’s advisory Manufacturing Council or his Strategy Policy Forum. <br> Why stick around? Prospects that Trump can actually follow through on a business-friendly agenda, including tax reform, look increasingly dim. And Trump’s “many sides” reaction to Charlottesville wasn’t going over at all well with employees, customers or the executives themselves. <br> “Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country,” JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon wrote in a message to his employees. “It is a leader’s role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart.” <br> The chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and National Guard also publicly condemned hate groups in the wake of Charlottesville. They, of course, could not mention the commander in chief by name. <br> But politicians can. And they must. <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 Lawrence Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. <br> Corporate tax reform has rightly been identified by the president-elect and congressional majority as an immediate priority. There is no question that the status quo — with the United States having the highest statutory corporate-tax rate among major countries and companies holding huge cash hoards abroad while awaiting a break on repatriation — can be improved. Unfortunately, the potential reforms identified by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and President-elect Donald Trump appear likely to do significant damage to the tax base and to the U.S. and global economies. <br> The central concept put forward by Ryan — which appears to have Trump’s support — is to change the corporate income tax from a tax on the return to capital into one only on extraordinary profits and to accomplish this by taxing corporate cash flows. This would be done by changing the current corporate tax in three fundamental ways, in addition to a major reduction in the rate. <br> First, all investment outlays could be written off in the year they are undertaken, rather than over time according to a depreciation schedule. Second, interest payments to bondholders or banks that finance inventory, or to other creditors, would no longer be tax deductible. Third, to promote U.S. competitiveness, firms would be permitted to exclude receipts from exports in calculating their taxable income and would not be permitted to deduct from their income payments to foreign suppliers or affiliates. <br> Unlike some of the other economic ideas put forward by the president-elect, a corporate cash-flow tax is supported by some experts in both political parties. However, at least as the approach has been explained so far, it has four major flaws — each of which would likely be fatal. <br> First, the tax change would substantially exacerbate inequality, with more than half the benefits going to the top 1 percent of Americans. Eliminating the requirement that investments be depreciated over time and substantially scaling back the rate on extraordinary profits would be a radical step that might be defensible on grounds of eliminating double taxation in a world where capital returns are effectively taxed at the individual level. But it is hard to justify in the current world, where pensions, 401(k)s, life insurance, holdings by foreigners and the like render most individual capital income-tax free, where the remainder is taxed at highly preferential capital gains and dividend rates, and where the estate tax is easily avoided and likely to be eliminated. <br> Second, the tax change would capriciously redistribute income, increase uncertainty and place punitive burdens on some sectors. Think of a retailer who imports goods from abroad for 60 cents, incurs 30 cents in labor and interest costs and then earns a 5-cent margin. With a 20 percent tax, and no deductibility of import or interest costs, the taxes will substantially exceed 100 percent of profits, even if there is some offset from a stronger dollar. Businesses that invest heavily, hire extensively and export a large part of their product would have negative taxable income on a chronic basis; it is hard to imagine that the political process would allow annual multibillion-dollar refunds, and so these too may be victimized. Then there are the still unresolved questions of what the rules will be on interest deductibility for banks and of the treatment of businesses organized as partnerships that do not pay corporate taxes. <br> Third, the tax change would likely harm the global economy in ways that reverberate back to the United States. It would be seen by other countries and the World Trade Organization as a protectionist act that violates U.S. treaty obligations. While proponents argue that such an approach should be legal because it would be like a value-added tax, the WTO has been clear that income taxes cannot discriminate to favor exports. While the WTO process would grind on, protectionist responses by others would be licensed immediately. Moreover, proponents of the plan anticipate a rise in the dollar by an amount equal to the 15 to 20 percent tax rate. This would do huge damage to dollar debtors all over the world and provoke financial crises in some emerging markets. Because U.S. foreign assets are mostly held in foreign currencies whereas debts are largely in dollars, U.S. losses with even a partial appreciation would be in the trillions. Ironically, China, with its huge reserve hoard, would be a major winner. <br> Fourth, the cost over time of the tax change would force burdensome tax hikes or spending reductions on the federal government. The combination of a sharply lower rate, new opportunities for tax arbitrage created by the taxing of cash flows, the likely adverse effects of increased uncertainty and the fact that any revenue gains from bringing overseas cash home would be one-shots means that the reform would likely erode the federal revenue base. This would eventually mean reductions in entitlement payments, tax increases on individuals and reductions in government spending. All of this would slow economic growth and burden the middle class. <br> There is no need to reinvent the corporate tax wheel. Let’s fix the tax we have by reducing rates, closing shelters and broadening the base, and cracking down on profit shifting to tax havens. That would be an important step to making our economy grow faster and be fairer. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s proposed tax ‘reform’ is hardly reform at all <br> Lawrence Summers: On tax reform, take a page from Ronald Reagan <br> The Post’s View: The GOP’s radical tax plan <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Regarding Steven Pearlstein’s March 12 Business commentary, “Everyone agrees it’s high time for corporate tax reform”: <br> Let’s cut fraud, waste and abuse in U.S. public corporations by having them keep just one set of books. Their tax would be a percentage of the income they report to stockholders. Foreign taxes would be allowed as normal business expenses but not direct reductions of their U.S. taxes. <br> Their annual audits for their owners and creditors would also be their tax audits. They could shift to this simpler tax system the year after it is enacted or gradually over five years. After shifting, they would no longer have the costs of keeping separate books just for tax purposes. Their taxes would be linked directly to the numbers they use to make business decisions, so tax incentives would not lead them away from what makes the best business sense. There would be less incentive to shift operations to other countries and no incentive to seek foreign tax havens. <br> Thornton Parker, Rockingham, Va. 
 In this uncertain world, there are still a few unalterable facts of political life. For example, Republicans always do what Charles and David Koch, the billionaire bankrollers of right-wing politics nationwide, tell them. <br> Then again, maybe not. As it happens, the Koch brothers are dead set against the House Republicans’ business tax reform plan, yet GOP leaders are pushing it anyway. <br> At issue is the proposed destination-based cash flow tax (DBCFT), which despite its eye-glazing name is anything but a tepid idea. To the contrary, it could affect long-standing business models across Corporate America. <br> Here’s the plan: Instead of today’s corporate tax, which charges rates up to 35 percent on worldwide income, adjusted for deductions and loopholes, the DBCFT would impose a flat 20 percent tax only on earnings from sales of output consumed within the United States (with an immediate write-off on capital investment and no deduction for net interest). <br> It gets complicated, but the upshot is that the cost of imported supplies would no longer be deductible from taxable income, while all revenue from exports would be. <br> This would be a huge incentive to import less and export more, significant change indeed for an economy deeply dependent on global supply chains, and which routinely runs an overall merchandise trade deficit. <br> Meanwhile, the plan would discourage companies from shifting earnings to subsidiaries in low-tax countries and encourage American and foreign companies to operate within the United States. <br> Authors of the plan like the increased taxation of imports — “border adjustment” in tax-wonk argot — not only because of these new incentives, but also because, without border adjustment, the huge cut in the top rate would blow up the deficit. Indeed, the plan would cost $1.2 trillion more over 10 years but for border adjustment, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. <br> Et voila: finally a system of corporate taxation that raises revenue efficiently, discourages debt and promotes capital investment right here in the USA. Yes, in the short run, there would be winners — agricultural exporters, say — and losers — big retailers of imported consumer goods such as Walmart. <br> Overall, however, firms and consumers alike would be no worse off, advocates say: That’s because the dollar would eventually strengthen in response to short-term changes in the flow of trade, offsetting higher after-tax costs of imports and depriving exporters of any unearned windfall. <br> So what’s the Koch brothers’ beef? Their self-interest is a bit obscure: Koch Industries is privately held, and its financial data are not publicly disclosed. Still, the conglomerate is quite obviously a major player in chemicals and petroleum refining, sectors that import nearly half of their supplies and thus could take a short-term hit from the GOP tax plan, according to a JPMorgan Asset Management study. <br> Publicly, however, the Kochs maintain they would “greatly benefit,” as a recent statement from their top lobbyist put it. Their worry is that the plan “will distort the market, increase consumer prices and create an uneven playing field for companies and consumers,” with “devastating” long-term economic consequences. Koch Industries has funded a report by the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm, arguing that border adjustment would drive up gasoline and diesel prices. <br> They have a point, in the sense that the GOP plan depends on a lot of variables — dollar appreciation chief among them — that might not pan out under real-world conditions. <br> As the JPMorgan study notes, the greenback would have to rise 25 percent to offset what would be a new 20 percent tax on imported inputs — propelling the U.S. currency to its highest level on record. <br> The international consequences of that are unforeseeable, but unlikely to be totally benign for everyone. Bear in mind that many other countries — China comes to mind — can and will manipulate exchange rates to protect their own short-term interests. <br> Trading partners could also challenge the GOP plan as a discriminatory subsidy at the World Trade Organization. That’s because it includes a deduction for wages paid by U.S.-located firms, importers and exporters alike — a break that would obviously not be available to competitors abroad. <br> Neither President-elect Donald Trump nor tax-writers in the Republican Senate have embraced the House GOP plan yet; it may never come to fruition, in which case the surprising little debate between the Kochs and their presumed flunkies will have been academic. <br> Still, the tiff is interesting as a case study of internal GOP politics — and of the U.S. economy’s “path dependency.” <br> Theoretically free to reinvent our national business model, we are actually constrained by countless accumulated policy decisions of the past and all the accumulated investments and other commitments that were made in reliance on them. Change is scary, even for the richest men in the world. <br> Read more from Charles Lane’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s proposed tax ‘reform’ is hardly reform at all <br> The Post’s View: The GOP’s radical tax plan <br> Lawrence Summers: On tax reform, take a page from Ronald Reagan <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Blue America may fear President Trump and loathe him. But the president does not feel the same way toward blue America. <br> I say this because there is a clever, readily available and probably popular combination of policies that would sow instant chaos, financial and political, in the states that voted for Hillary Clinton last year, as well as in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party that governs them. <br> The fact that Trump has not suggested this plan — seemingly, it has not even occurred to him — is proof of his harmlessness. <br> The scheme would work as follows. Step One: Abandon Trump’s entire tax plan except for one proposed provision, the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes. This would boost federal revenue by a projected $74.1 billion in 2018 and similar amounts in succeeding years, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. <br> Step Two: Spend these proceeds on expanding the earned-income tax credit (EITC) for the working poor, coupled with modernizing Amtrak’s decrepit rail system in the Northeast Corridor and constructing a new high-speed rail system in California. <br> House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has a proposal for EITC expansion that costs $13.8 billion per year, according to the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. The rail stuff is a bit murkier, price-wise, but shortly before the Obama administration ended, the Transportation Department produced a $128 billion, multiyear plan to upgrade the Northeast Corridor. California’s latest cost estimate for its bullet train is $64 billion. So start with those numbers, and in the unlikely event there’s anything left over, use it to reduce the deficit. <br> Step Three: Stand back and watch Democrats go crazy. Their first problem will be trying to explain what’s wrong with ending a tax break for the relatively well-off to increase a tax-code benefit for lower-income folks — without seeming to special-plead on behalf of their own well-heeled constituents. <br> In 2016, 93 percent of the state-local deduction benefited people who earned more than $100,000 per year, according to data from the Joint Committee on Taxation; but 98 percent of the EITC benefited people who made less than $100,000. And the money from the state-local deduction went disproportionately to high-income taxpayers in blue states, which fund themselves via income and property taxes that are much higher than those in, say, Florida. Taxpayers in just two states — California and New York — claim roughly a third of the deduction’s aggregate value, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. <br> Democrats’ second problem would be turning down this dollop of federal money for pet infrastructure projects. <br> The policy rationale for the state and local tax deduction is that folks shouldn’t have to pay taxes on taxes. However, using upper-income blue staters’ money not only to help the poor but also for climate-change-fighting mass transportation, in their own regions, could be a strong counterargument. <br> In any case, there would certainly be an interesting, uh, debate between pro-Democratic teachers unions, which live on local tax revenue, and pro-Democratic construction unions, which would be salivating at years and years of high-paying infrastructure work. <br> As for Republicans, they would achieve all this discord in the enemy camp without much financial pain to their red-state voters, and without violating party doctrine, such as it is. Some might spin eliminating the state-local deduction as a tax increase. But you could just as easily characterize the EITC increase as a tax cut — and one with a record of incentivizing work effort to boot. <br> Many Republicans (though not Trump) revile wasteful infrastructure spending, or claim to, but at least this round wouldn’t increase the deficit, because it’s paid for — by the people most directly affected. <br> Of course, this fantasy — inspired by the rich-poor, blue-red divides that were exposed when it dawned on the public that Trump’s one-page tax plan eliminated the state-local deduction — is just that, a total never-happener. <br> One implication of this little thought experiment, though, is that Republicans prefer to pursue massive tax cuts for the rich, paid for with more borrowing, rather than mildly redistributive, but fiscally responsible and pro-work, policy innovation. <br> This is true even though trying the latter might crack a Democratic coalition of minorities, upscale white urbanites and hard-pressed unions who have a clear common enemy, Trump, but less-clear common interests. <br> The state-local tax deduction, which has helped entrench differential social policy in the red and blue states, is just one of many cost-shifting mechanisms woven into America’s convoluted federal-state system of public finance. <br> They have survived, not necessarily due to their merits, but because protective political coalitions have grown up around them. Sooner or later, something has to give — financially and politically. Probably later. <br> Read more from Charles Lane’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: The Trump administration’s magical thinking on taxes would bust the budget <br> The Post’s View: The reckless return to deficit spending <br> Catherine Rampell: The dumbest part of Trump’s dumb tax plan <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 You would think that the Trump administration, with so many émigrés from the business world, could at least perform simple arithmetic. Judging by the president’s looney-tunes tax plan, you would be wrong. <br> As usual for President Trump, he has offered few details. But the outlines of his proposal, released Wednesday, are nothing short of hallucinatory. Next door to the White House, in the Treasury Department, there are actual economists who take seriously the responsibility of safeguarding the world’s biggest national economy. They must be deeply embarrassed at now having to pretend that two plus two equals seven. <br> In his desperate quest to do something yooge, Trump proposes massive tax cuts for businesses and individuals, especially the wealthy. The impact, according to experts, would be to make federal budget deficits soar, adding as much as $4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. I’ve never thought of myself as a deficit hawk, but this kind of profligacy is ridiculous. <br> You will recall that Trump also wants to spend $1 trillion on upgrading our sagging infrastructure, which is a good idea; and he wants to vastly boost defense spending, which is a bad idea. Meanwhile, he has pledged not to touch entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. Although his promises typically don’t seem to mean much, all this would add up to fiscal insanity. <br> Trump’s plan is based on the idea that tax cuts stimulate the economy to grow, not a little but a lot — almost like a magic beanstalk that rises into the clouds, where we find a goose that lays golden eggs, allowing us to live happily ever after. I agree with the economists who find this scenario unlikely. <br> “The plan will pay for itself with growth,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. His rosy projection is that increased growth would produce $2 trillion in new revenue over 10 years. But the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, estimates that a version of the tax cuts would cost $6.2 trillion in revenue during that same period, leaving a $4 trillion gap even with Mnuchin’s projected growth. Even the conservative Tax Foundation, which has rarely seen a tax cut it didn’t like, foresees at least a $2 trillion gap. <br> Surely, leaving more money in the hands of middle-class and working-class consumers does stimulate the economy, because the money is quickly spent. But that’s not what Trump’s plan does. Instead, it gives massive tax relief to — I hope you’re sitting down — corporations and the rich. <br> The nominal corporate tax rate would be lowered from 35 percent to 15 percent. I say nominal because many, if not most, businesses find loopholes that allow them to pay less. Still, there is bipartisan agreement in Congress that the 35 percent rate is too high. If House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) cared less about ideology and more about results, a bill cutting the rate to, say, 25 percent could be on Trump’s desk for signature within a week. But 15 percent is too low, and fiscal conservatives are already balking. <br> Individual income taxes, meanwhile, would be simplified. Instead of the current seven tax brackets, there would be only three — 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. It is hard to gauge the precise impact, because Trump did not specify the income levels that define the three brackets. But it is clear that he and other wealthy individuals would get a huge tax cut, because he proposes to eliminate the alternative minimum tax — a provision basically meant to ensure that rich people with lots of deductions pay at least something in taxes. <br> The plan would also allow many wealthy individuals who own businesses to pay income tax not at the 35 percent individual rate but at the new 15 percent corporate rate. As I read the proposal, this would surely apply to the Trump Organization and its proprietor. What a coincidence. <br> Trump would keep the popular deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving but eliminate many others, including the deduction for state and local taxes. The standard deduction, for those who do not itemize, would be doubled. Depending how the brackets are structured, it looks to me as if many middle-class taxpayers might pay a little less while some pay a little more. <br> I don’t know whether this is the most cynical tax plan I’ve ever heard or the most ignorant. I guess those distinctions are not mutually exclusive. Anyone who supports this mess automatically forfeits the right to be a deficit scold ever again. <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 Correction: An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly reported that almost 80 percent of stocks are owned by just 8 percent of people. As of 2013, the 10 percent of households with the highest wealth owned 81 percent of stocks. This version has been corrected. <br> <br> Monday morning marks the start of the first full week of President Trump’s vacation. After the rockiest first six months of any modern presidency, a new chief of staff has offered a glimmer of hope — just in time for August to provide time to regroup. August: Washington’s quiet month for vacation, reflection and recuperation. <br> Or not. Veterans of George W. Bush’s and Barack Obama’s White Houses will tell you: August is the most dangerous month. For a White House such as President Trump’s, already under assault on many fronts, August could be the final straw. <br> The two most devastating mistakes of Bush’s presidency both came in August. On Aug. 6, 2001, Bush received the now-famous warning in his daily briefing, “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.”; Bush’s lack of response to that “vacation month” warning drove criticism of his handling of the 9/11 attacks for the rest of his presidency. Four years later, in late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and demolished Bush’s second term. <br> Ask Obama White House staffers about August, and you will get shell-shocked stares. It was August 2009 when the tea party opposition to health-care reform exploded and turned the Affordable Care Act into political kryptonite. August 2011 saw budget and fiscal talks collapse, cementing the “wasted year” of Obama’s tenure. In August 2014, Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson and the Islamic State wreaked havoc in Erbil and Mosul. During Obama’s final August, the president was slammed for not interrupting his vacation to visit flooded Louisiana. <br> For Trump, August 2017 is particularly perilous. <br> Republican senators and House members will get earfuls from constituents back home all month. Sure, Trump can continue to tweet that the stock market is high and the unemployment rate low. But when 81 percent of stocks are owned by just 10 percent of the people, and job creation in Trump’s first five months lags Obama’s last five months, presidential tweeting can hardly insulate these members from a blast of August political heat. <br> Trump’s Hill allies are heading home for August without delivering on health-care reform — and worse, having to defend votes for a failed, unpopular bill. Trump has not even put forward serious plans on tax reform, infrastructure, child care, outsourcing — all “first 100 days” promises, still far from filled. More voters are growing weary of the rising tide of scandals surrounding Trump. Congressional Republicans are going to find angry constituents and local leaders in August. Trump’s sagging fortunes in Congress will sink further. <br> In addition to this metaphorical tide of unrest, there is the danger of a literal August surge: a hurricane. The perpetual crises swirling around the White House to date have been entirely self-imposed; we have not seen how Team Trump will cope with outside challenge. The risk that the first such challenge will be a hurricane in August is not small. Four of the five most intense hurricanes to make landfall in U.S. history have struck over a 12-day span in late August; virtually every August the past decade has seen some sort of serious storm. <br> Would the Trump administration respond effectively? The president just stripped the Department of Homeland Security of its leader, was blasted by the outgoing head of hurricane forecasting for how his budget cuts could set back this work, and lacks any experience (as a senator or governor) with navigating a difficult disaster response. As a political matter, a botched hurricane response in the Gulf Coast or Florida would see Trump criticized — not by blue-state leaders he can mock or ignore — but by key members of his own coalition. <br> And as the administration confronts an array of August dangers — global, political, natural — it will have to do it short-handed. Even well-staffed, well-functioning administrations have trouble in August because key players take vacations, creating a “nobody home” dynamic when flash points erupt. For Trump, badly understaffed at the White House and terribly behind in filling key posts in federal agencies, this risk is intensified. About half the Cabinet departments lack a single Senate-confirmed official to take charge if the secretary is away. <br> Flashes of this challenge have already been evident. Trump’s health-care bill first floundered in the House when the Kushner family was off skiing for spring break, in March; it suffered serious damage when Jared and Ivanka skipped town during its Senate launch to rub elbows in Sun Valley. What will happen during August’s larger hiatus of high-level personnel, as troubles mount in North Korea, the Middle East and on yet-unknown domestic fronts? <br> April may be the cruelest month, as T.S. Eliot once claimed. But for Team Trump —  underachieving, underprepared and understaffed — August is the most dangerous. <br> Read more: <br> Eugene Robinson: Trump is delusional about his popularity <br> Dana Milbank: Trump’s golf game tells us an awful lot about Trump <br> Ruth Marcus: Will Trump make a real crisis worse? <br> Leon Panetta: How long can John Kelly survive? <br> Alexandra Petri: Notes for the president’s babysitter on John Kelly’s night off <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> PRESIDENT TRUMP is set to reveal the outlines of a tax reform plan Wednesday. The country will be improved if Mr. Trump leads the way toward lower rates, fewer loopholes and a simpler code. Where the plan could go dangerously astray is if the administration bases it on wishful thinking — specifically, that tax-cutting will pay for itself. <br> Specifics have been sketchy in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, in part because administration officials appear to be of different minds. But a few details emerged early in the week. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and the top tax rate on so-called pass-through companies from 39.6 percent also to 15 percent. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, slashing the corporate rate by such a large amount would reduce revenue by $2.4 trillion over a decade, which is half of everything the government will spend in fiscal 2017. Cutting the tax on pass-throughs, meanwhile, would boost tax avoidance by encouraging people to take wages in the form of lower-taxed pass-through income. <br> There are several honest ways out of the resulting budget hole: end or limit tax breaks such as the mortgage-interest deduction; raise the rates of other taxes; cut spending; or some combination. The dishonest way is to pretend the hole is shallower than the experts predict it will be — or even that the hole does not exist. That was the approach Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared to be taking last Thursday. “The plan will pay for itself with growth,” Mr. Mnuchin said, claiming that the Trump economic program could goose the economy so much that the government would recoup nearly $2 trillion over 10 years. He may be preparing some limits on deductions, but not nearly enough. <br> This is magical thinking. Of course cutting taxes or increasing federal spending affects the economy, but experience shows that tax cuts are almost never self-financing. If the Trump administration used optimistic economic growth assumptions to justify a deficit-enhancing tax cut, “I would start drinking earlier every day,” leading GOP economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin told The Post’s Damian Paletta and Max Ehrenfreund. <br> There is another dishonest way to ignore the budget arithmetic: pretend the hole doesn’t matter. The Journal reported that Mr. Trump may be taking this approach, ordering his staff to stick to the 15 percent corporate tax goal even if it would expand deficits. In fact, a deficit-raising tax cut would eventually harm economic growth by driving up government debt. As the population ages, the country is already on track to borrow more and squeeze spending for everything except interest on the debt, pensions and health care: national parks, the FBI, defense, schools and more. It would be the height of imprudence to worsen the problem, whether based on phony math or sheer heedlessness. <br> For eight years, Republicans mercilessly attacked President Barack Obama for doing too little to cut federal deficits. Will they really turn around now and approve a budget-busting tax cut? <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s budget is utterly unrealistic <br> The Post’s View: The reckless return to deficit spending <br> Catherine Rampell: The Trump White House is already cooking the books <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Despite the best efforts of the White House “PR apparatus” to sell the president’s first 100 days as a success, the New York Times declared in an editorial, the new administration has, in fact, been plagued by “many missteps” including a “bungled sales job” on his first major legislative initiative and a “snakebit” confirmation process, all of which have produced “a flurry of articles bemoaning the lack of focus in the White House.” The first 100 days, the Times declared, is a period the president “might prefer to forget.” <br> The president in question is not Donald Trump. This is how, in April 1993, the Times described the first 100 days of Bill Clinton’s presidency. But not to worry, the Times reassured its readers: “It’s still early, and a hundred days don’t really mean very much.” <br> The Times is right: The first 100 days really don’t mean very much at all. <br> Right now, the Trump White House appears to be in a panic over the approaching milestone, looking desperately for last-minute accomplishments. It is pushing the House to vote this week on repealing Obamacare, and it is risking a government shutdown in an effort to make Democrats pay for a border wall with Mexico, instead of just passing a straight extension of current funding levels. And the president announced (to the apparent surprise of his own staff) that he would unveil his tax reform plan on Wednesday, before it is fully baked. <br> To which I say: Mr. President, slow down. There’s no rush. Ignore the critics. You’re doing just fine. <br> Trump has accomplished something more significant in his first 100 days than any president in recent memory has done: the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Trump’s predecessors’ early achievements were fleeting. President Barack Obama’s stimulus (with its false promise of “shovel-ready” jobs) is long forgotten. George W. Bush’s tax cuts were not signed until June and were partially repealed by his successor. But Trump’s success in placing the 49-year-old Gorsuch on the Supreme Court will affect the direction of our country for a generation. Indeed, Trump can count every 5-4 decision over the next three decades that goes conservatives’ way as one of his “First 100 Days” accomplishments. No other modern president can claim to have had that kind of lasting impact in so short a time. <br> Trump also did something in his first 100 days that his predecessor could not bring himself to do in his entire second term: He enforced Obama’s red line against Syria’s use of chemical weapons. When the Assad regime apparently used a toxic nerve agent on innocent men, women and children, Trump didn’t wring his hands. He acted quickly and decisively, and in so doing restored our credibility on the world stage that Obama had squandered. He underscored the message by dropping the MOAB (a.k.a. “Mother of All Bombs”) on an Islamic State hideout in Afghanistan and by deploying the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group (after a brief detour off the coast of Australia) to the Korean Peninsula. And his decision to strike the Assad regime at the very moment he was meeting the Chinese president may have set Trump on a course to accomplish something three previous presidents failed to do: Enlist China in a real effort to pressure North Korea on its nuclear program. <br> Those things alone make Trump’s first 100 days a success. But he can also point to other accomplishments, such as signing into law an economic stimulus in the form of 13 resolutions of disapproval revoking regulations imposed by the Obama administration. Critics say undoing the actions of previous administration is not a legislative achievement. Yes, it is. Rolling back the wet blanket of regulations smothering our economy is critical to restoring job creation in the United States — and Trump is acting decisively to do so. <br> Of course, there is much more to do. And there is plenty of time to do it. History does not judge presidents by what they did in the first 100 days; it judges what they did during their presidencies. On tax reform, Trump should learn the lesson of the failed effort to repeal Obamacare: He has a better chance of success if he takes his time and does it right. George W. Bush did not sign the No Child Left Behind act until January 2002, nearly a year after taking office. Obama did not sign the Affordable Care Act into law until March 2010, about 14 months after taking office. <br> In other words, there is no hurry. So Trump should stop trying to throw Hail Marys before the 100-days clock runs out. Because when it does . . . nothing happens. He’s still president on Day 101. Republicans still control both houses of Congress. <br> He has done big things and has plenty of time to get more big things done. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 There is nothing novel, let alone heroic, about Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s call for Congress to pass an increase to the statutory debt limit with no strings attached. That has been the institutional position of every Treasury Department in both Democratic and Republican administrations for decades. <br> What stands out, however, is the Trump administration’s muddled and inept approach to an issue so critical to America’s financial security. President Trump has been largely missing in action, instead turning the job over to a Washington novice stretched thin with other workload requirements, including the daunting challenge of achieving tax reform in a politically fractious climate. White House abdication on the debt limit is risky business. <br> Failure to raise the ceiling has consequences. Think stock market crash. Think global financial chaos. Think rising interest rates and an economy going down the tubes. <br> Raising the debt ceiling, although essentially a ministerial legislative act, involves heavy lifting. It’s a lesson I learned all too well as a Treasury Department deputy assistant secretary for legislative affairs in my early days with Jimmy Carter’s administration. Our initial efforts in February 1979 to raise the ceiling were shot down in Congress by members eager to show folks back home that they were fiscally frugal. Not that the lawmakers didn’t know better. <br> The debt limit has nothing to do with new spending. Voting against the bill, however, was a cheap political “show” vote. The debt ceiling was eventually raised in 1979, as has always been the case, at least up until now. But getting it done required the president’s full attention at the plate — as Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found out during their times at bat. There was no cooling it in the dugout. (Sorry, baseball fans.) <br> Mnuchin is a beseecher. A commanding figure is needed on the scene. Where has the Trump administration been all this time? Getting clean debt-ceiling legislation requires a herculean effort, especially out of those congressional Republicans who believe sabotaging the government is good for the country. The greatest threat to raising the ceiling unconditionally is found within Trump’s own party. <br> It certainly doesn’t help to have a president who can’t tell the debt ceiling from ceiling tile, who is fixated on the Russia investigation and who cares more about making himself look good. <br> And it looks even worse when the president’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, has acted as a public cheerleader for tying a debt-limit increase to fiscal reforms favored by hawks in the House Freedom Caucus, where Mulvaney once held forth. That Trump was so cavalier about his treasury secretary getting stabbed in the back by his OMB director only underscores the magnitude of the problem caused by his inattention. Fortunately, after getting the word from the White House that Mnuchin “speaks for the administration” on the debt ceiling, Mulvaney this week saluted, silenced his foghorn and executed an about-face. At least in public. <br> Meanwhile, Mnuchin, late to the game and a stranger to the ways of Congress, plows on, bringing no special insights or arguments that haven’t been heard before. The treasury secretary wages forth with bureaucracy-supplied talking points doing what he is required to do. <br> I sang this tune in the Carter years, and sang it again about Obama’s go-round with Congress over raising the debt ceiling in 2011 (choir, in unison): Increasing the debt limit allows the country to meet its obligations — already authorized by Congress — to holders of U.S. debt, including foreign countries; to Social Security recipients; and to all other creditors. (Be seated.) <br> Even the most doltish, bird-brained legislator on either side of the Capitol knows that it is essential that the United States meet its legal obligations. Every member of Congress understands the danger of a U.S. debt default — I just gotta believe that. <br> Yet we are once again, as a country, about to be subjected to another “Perils of Pauline” debt-ceiling cliffhanger in which the financial system is placed at the point of death to only, I hope, escape at the end. That is, if this president, who takes apparent maniacal delight in pulling wings off butterflies in the form of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former chief of staff Reince Preibus and former press secretary Sean Spicer, awakes to his obligation to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, and gets to work. We live in hope. <br> Read more from Colbert King’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Time for the Trump administration to speak with one voice on the debt ceiling <br> Jonathan Capehart: Congress dances on the (debt) ceiling, and it’s not pretty <br> Philip Bump: Between now and the debt-limit deadline — Sept. 29 — the House is in session for only 12 days <br> Catherine Rampell: The most dangerous man in Washington <br> The Fact Checker’s guide to the debt ceiling <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 John F. Kelly, President Trump’s new chief of staff, is focused on ending chaos in the White House. Given that his boss is the self-disrupter in chief, good luck with that. <br> And Trump world’s vicious backstabbing is not, in any event, the administration’s most important problem. A devotion to lying is a far graver danger to this presidency, and military efficiency will not dispel it. <br> The Post’s report, essentially confirmed by the White House, that the president was the prime mover behind Donald Trump Jr.’s misleading statement about his meeting with a Russian lawyer peddling derogatory information about Hillary Clinton ratifies the pattern of deceit and misdirection on all matters Russian. Behaving as if you are guilty won’t convince others that you are innocent. <br> The president seems convinced that he can survive whatever comes his way as long as he keeps his much-celebrated political base with him. But this is not as easy as it sounds for either Trump or his party because his base is fundamentally divided. <br> Nothing illustrated this more dramatically than the health-care showdown. Trump’s rhetoric about the Affordable Care Act during last year’s campaign should have been a tipoff to the dilemma both he and conservative politicians confront now. On the one hand, he roundly denounced Obamacare, which made right-wing ideologues happy. But he also regularly promised an alternative that would be more, not less, generous in helping Americans of modest means. <br> His position was incoherent but very shrewd. To pull off his electoral college victory in 2016, Trump needed the votes of traditional Republican conservatives, but he also had to add on non-ideological working-class voters, many of whom found Mitt Romney unappealing in 2012. <br> For clues about the political turmoil and coalition-management challenges the president and the GOP face, consult “The Five Types of Trump Voters” by Emily Ekins, the director of polling at the Cato Institute. The bottom line of her research is that Trump and his party can’t win without the conservative faithful, but the conventional right alone cannot guarantee victory. <br> A narrow majority of Trump’s voters, Ekins found, fell into two traditionally Republican groups, “Staunch Conservatives,” who made up 31 percent of his backers, and “Free Marketeers,” who constituted 25 percent. She also identifies a smaller, less loyally Republican faction, “The Disengaged,” who amounted to 5 percent of his supporters. <br> But two other large Trump groups, whom Ekins labeled “American Preservationists” (20 percent of Trumpists) and “Anti-Elites” (19 percent), are quite different from regular conservatives. In particular, Ekins notes, both “lean economically progressive,” which is why the health-care issue is so problematic for Trump. <br> The preservationists might be seen as White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon’s people. They “have nativist immigration views, and a nativist and ethnocultural conception of American identity.” The Anti-Elites are more moderate on these issues and the “most likely” of the Trump supporters “to favor political compromise.” This group was never as strongly pro-Trump as the others, and seems most ripe for defection to the Democrats. <br> Trump is so hungry for “wins” that he is still pushing the Senate to pass any bill to repeal Obamacare. But enacting proposals along the lines of those that failed last week would be the worst possible outcome for Trump because they effectively break the promises he made to nearly 40 percent of his own sympathizers. <br> Senate Republicans who want to back away from repeal, at least for now, seem more attuned to how disruptive this issue is. But the looming battle over deep tax cuts tilted toward the wealthy will also split the alliance Trump is counting on for survival. <br> As Ekins concludes, Trump voters “hold different perceptions of justice in the political and economic systems.” <br> Trump’s coalition is by no means unique historically in bringing together constituencies with widely divergent views. Franklin D. Roosevelt, after all, won votes from Northern African Americans and Southern white segregationists. On the other hand, the New Deal alignment was shattered when civil rights became a driving national issue. <br> Still, political leaders trying to hold diverse groups together need to demonstrate finesse and both the appearance and reality of successful governance. Finesse, needless to say, is not a Trump long suit. And every day that brings a new Trump revelation, new questions about Russia or sheer craziness (the Mooch interlude or the president’s reported description of the White House as “a real dump”) puts increased pressure on a rickety alliance that can only bear so much. When Trump most needs that base of his, it may no longer be there. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Reporters in search of the heart of Trumpism often travel to places such as York, Pa., or Youngstown, Ohio. Unfortunately, the true ethos of the Trump White House is not found in the factory towns of the industrial Midwest, but in the see-and-be-seen power-lunch spots of Manhattan. “The Mooch” may have quickly come and gone, but Moochism remains a guiding force of Trump’s presidency — a New York-centric worldview that values deals over details, and equates wealth and celebrity with wisdom. <br> The ouster of Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci and the arrival of retired Marine Corps general John Kelly as chief of staff may obscure, at least temporarily, that fundamental reality. But the past six months have made clear that, in the Acela corridor’s balance of power, Manhattan’s Masters of the Universe have triumphed over Washington’s policy wonks and Boston’s academics. <br> And with all due respect to my friends in the 10022, therein lies many of President Trump’s troubles. Perhaps the worldview of the now-defunct Four Seasons Grill Room was suited for dominating New York’s media and real estate circles, but it is proving horrible for making things work in Washington. Three core views of the Midtown mind-set in the Trump White House illustrate the point. <br> ●Policy is for losers; winners do deals. The single biggest problem that the Trump administration has had in advancing its agenda is a disdain for policymaking and in-the-weeds expertise. Policymaking seems too nerdy, too wonky, too boring for the president and his “only the best” people. Team Trump loves dealmaking instead. <br> Thus, it’s no surprise that Trump’s inner circle is filled with dealmakers — Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross, Rex Tillerson and, most of all, Trump’s wheeler-dealer son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner’s overstuffed portfolio — which makes no sense to anyone experienced in government — can be understood only as a series of deals he is supposed to close: a Middle East peace agreement, a trade deal with Mexico, some sort of bargain with China. The fact that he knows virtually nothing about any of these things is irrelevant in Trumpworld: He’s a deal guy, and, hey, there are deals to be done. <br> The problem is that in government, policy actually matters. You can’t achieve the “art of the deal” unless you know the parts of the deal. Even presidents famous for not sweating the details — Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, for instance — knew their stuff on their key priorities (tax reform and education policy, respectively). No sentence will ever capture Trump’s “policy doesn’t matter” mind-set more than his iconic “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” Well, actually, Mr. President, every person who had ever studied it with any rigor did. <br> ● Only the “big guys” matter. This second Trump characteristic comes straight from the power-lunch crowd: If you aren’t a “name,” you don’t count. Virtually all of Trump’s in-depth interactions as president have been with corporate chief executives, four-star generals and celebrities. His economic policy has largely consisted of trying to get hiring promises out of some of the largest U.S. companies. <br> Successful presidents in both parties have learned, however, that there is wisdom outside the famous names. Look at Trump’s recent “big-name” job creation event in Wisconsin: Small businesses and entrepreneurs in that state will create four times as many jobs each year as a new Foxconn factory. But Trump has done virtually nothing to embrace such un-famous job creators or to explore ways to encourage their work. <br> ● If you aren’t rich, you aren’t smart. Trump has openly boasted that he trusts only the rich to formulate economic policy. And it’s obvious that Trump accords special respect for the wealthiest members of his team — Cohn, Mnuchin and Ross, in particular. It may explain why Trump has sloughed off the expertise of the men and women of the intelligence community, agency policy shops and the Congressional Budget Office. In the Trump mind-set, if public servants aren’t rich or famous, how could they really be smart? <br> Team Trump does not understand that public servants, community activists, nonprofit leaders and policy wonks have critical contributions to make in policy formation, even if they don’t have the biggest bank accounts or the fanciest threads. (If you’re still trying to puzzle out how the catastrophically unfit Scaramucci could temporarily be named White House communications director, there’s your answer.) Representatives and senators also have a lot of policy expertise and insights — and, if nothing else, more votes on a president’s legislative agenda than anyone in the Hamptons or Sun Valley. <br> This is not to say that New York’s finest cannot be great contributors in Washington: In both my stints in the White House, some of the savviest, most devoted, most effective senior officials came from New York’s elite. But what these successful White House aides all shared was an appreciation for how much policy details mattered and how important it was to bring diverse voices and experiences to the table — all sadly missing among Trump’s dealmaking coterie. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Kathleen Parker: Dealmaker in Chief?

 John Podesta, the chair of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, served as counselor to President Barack Obama and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. <br> As a former White House chief of staff, the best advice I could have given Gen. John F. Kelly has been overtaken by events: Don’t take the job. <br> Kelly, who has rendered extraordinary service and sacrifice to the nation, just signed up for what may truly be an impossible mission: bringing discipline, order and strategic focus to the chaos that is the Trump White House. <br> To have any chance of succeeding, he will have to accomplish three extraordinary tasks, all at odds with President Trump’s instincts. <br> First, discipline. There’s no doubt the decision to replace Reince Priebus with Kelly was based on the hope that a former four-star Marine general could get this menagerie in line. You don’t have to compare the Trump White House to no-drama Obama or the buttoned-down Bush operations to know there is simply no precedent in modern history for the current White House culture of factionalism, infighting and lack of respect among senior staff members. Of course, most of Trump’s team are simply modeling their behavior on that of the boss. His demeaning treatment of Priebus and Attorney General Jeff Sessions signals that there are no boundaries in Trumpland, leading to the unprofessional actions of now-former communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Indeed, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders informed the public that the president “encourages” such behavior. <br> Kelly is walking into a White House that looks more like a cock fight than an episode of “The West Wing.” (See Mooch, you can use that word without being profane.) The White House culture will have to be shaken to its core. Kelly must be able to fire anyone at will, including to enforce a no-tolerance policy for behavior unbecoming a senior government official. Scaramucci’s departure Monday is a good start, but Kelly will have to keep a tight rein on a White House staff that is used to few boundaries. And if there is going to be an exception for Trump’s relatives, Kelly should get an explicit commitment that even Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump report through him — no end arounds. <br> The most difficult discipline problem for Kelly, though, will not be the staff but Trump himself. Early signs are not auspicious. The day after appointing Kelly, Trump ranted on Twitter against Senate Republicans for failure to pass their horrific health-care bill, which would have denied care to millions of Americans and raised costs for millions more. I have no doubt that Kelly, unlike Priebus, can say no to power, but whether power will listen is another matter. <br> Kelly’s second task will be to restore strategic direction to Trump’s haphazard policy-making process. <br> In domestic affairs, that will mean reestablishing relationships with congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. Trump’s current strategy of partisan bullying has been disastrous, producing almost no significant legislation in what has generally been the most productive part of a new president’s time in office. Other than rolling back some Obama regulations on behalf of special interests, the only bill of significance that has passed is the Russia sanctions bill that the White House opposed. <br> Kelly cannot outsource the job of establishing a working relationship with congressional leaders to Vice President Pence or his congressional liaison. The new chief of staff is known as a man of his word, and he has to use that reputation to establish a rapport and find common ground with Republicans and Democrats on issues such as infrastructure, tax reform and, yes, even a bipartisan approach to improving the Affordable Care Act. <br> In international affairs, he has to help national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis focus on the clear priorities of Russia, the Middle East and North Korea. With respect to the last, he might start by asking why the White House has not even nominated an ambassador to South Korea or filled any of the senior regional posts for Asia at State or Defense. <br> </span>Kelly’s third task might be the hardest. <br> He has to protect the integrity and independence of the Justice Department and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation from constant interference by the president and the White House. He has to be resolute in defending our constitutional norms and the rule of law. While it may not endear him to the president, Kelly will actually be helping Trump stay out of even more trouble. <br> I began by noting that Kelly may have embarked on mission impossible, but the good news is that he does have a strong hand to play. The truth is that the president needs Kelly more than Kelly needs him. Trump simply cannot afford to have Kelly walk without disastrous consequences. The new chief of staff should use that power to restore discipline and dignity to a White House sorely in need of both. <br> Read more here: <br> George F.

 The Trump White House is imploding. The only real thing to debate in that sentence is the tense. “Has imploded” is certainly arguable. Still, as the events of the past few days have shown, implosion, in politics as in physics, is not a moment but a process. The damage continues. It builds on itself as the edifice collapses. <br> The temptation, of course, is to begin with Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci and his profane rant against soon-to-be-former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. <br> But the more powerful, more ominous evidence of implosion and its consequences is found in the collapse of congressional efforts to repeal/replace/do something, anything, with the Republican Party’s chief nemesis over the past seven years: the Affordable Care Act. <br> Who could have imagined, on the day after the election, or even on Inauguration Day, that this would end so ignominiously? <br> You might be asking why the Senate’s failure to move repeal forward, by a single vote in the early morning hours, signifies presidential weakness. Indeed, back in the days when Donald Trump’s election seemed fanciful even as the Republican Party prepared to award him the nomination, GOP lawmakers offered a soothing vision of a Trump presidency: They would navigate the policy differences and political chasms and emerge with legislation to be duly signed by the inexperienced, compliant president. Health care, check. Tax reform, check. And so on. <br> That it didn’t work out that way, or certainly hasn’t so far, is evidence, in part, of the unavoidable complexities of health-care reform and the ideological schisms within the party. <br> But it also illustrates a truism of modern American politics: Moving forward with a complicated or ambitious legislative agenda requires the propulsive force of presidential leadership. Troops do not perform effectively without a general at the helm, a leader they both respect and fear. <br> A master legislative tactician such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can get you only so far; the rules of the Senate make it easier for McConnell to block (see, for example, the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland) than to enact. A president distracted by infighting, inattentive to detail and sagging in the polls can announce all he wants that “I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand.” No wobbly lawmaker is going to rally to that cry. <br> While health-care reform fizzled, Trump burned. First over his “weak” and “beleaguered” attorney general, then over the hapless, doomed-from-the-start Priebus. Will the president’s new choice for chief of staff, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, fare much better? Don’t count on it. <br> Daily, the president’s boundless anger seems to find a new target: He is variously unhappy with his lawyer/his strategist/his press secretary. There is always someone else for Trump to blame, never himself. <br> He constructed, enabled, even encouraged an organization lacking clear lines of authority and ridden with factions. “The fish stinks from the head down,” Scaramucci told CNN’s Chris Cuomo, and while he meant to attack Priebus, he was more on target than he intended. As dogs have an uncanny tendency to resemble their owners, so Scaramucci channels Trump — bullying, vulgar, egotistical and undisciplined. In a week on the job, he has achieved the impossible: making us yearn for Sean Spicer. <br> Every new White House has its rocky moments and personnel readjustments, some more than others. Every White House suffers from factionalism and infighting, to some degree. But Washington and the country have never seen anything like this. The truest — and scariest thing — that Scaramucci said on CNN was that “there are people inside the administration that think it is their job to save America from this president.” <br> So a staff shake-up of the sort that Trump tweeted out Friday afternoon is the ordinary solution to a White House in trouble — but this is no ordinary White House problem. Even if Kelly is theoretically empowered in a way that Priebus never was — to have all staff report to him, control access to the Oval Office, above all to say “no” to Trump — it would be naive to expect some sudden transformation in the president himself. <br> Trump appears incapable of allowing his presidency to be saved, primarily because he is incapable of and unwilling to change. He will not allow himself to be governed; he cannot govern himself. Perhaps things will settle down, but that is hard to imagine. The past six months feel like prologue to even more turbulence. <br> For example, CNN describes national security adviser H.R. McMaster as “increasingly isolated” and at odds with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, worrying those of us calmed by the idea of an adult buffer against presidential pique. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, publicly undercut by Trump, took time off last week, generating rumors of a “Rexit” to come. <br> At this point, the remaining mystery is how, when and how badly this disaster of a presidency will end. <br> Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Eugene Robinson: The worst is yet to come <br> Kenneth Starr: Mr. President, please cut it out <br> Fareed Zakaria: Say hello to a post-America world <br> The Post’s View: This is not okay <br> Joe Scarborough: Trump is killing the Republican Party <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 John Delaney, a Democrat, represents Maryland’s 6th Congressional District in the House. <br> The American people are far greater than the sum of our political parties. It is time for us to rise above our broken politics and renew the spirit that enabled us to achieve the seemingly impossible. This is why I am running for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. <br> Our government is hamstrung by excessive partisanship. We are letting critical opportunities to improve the country pass us by. And we are not even talking about the most important thing: the future. The victims of this leadership failure are the good people we are sworn to serve, and we are leaving our country ill-prepared for dramatic changes ahead. The current administration is making us less prosperous and less secure. I’m running because I have an original approach to governing and an economic policy that can put us on a different course. <br> My vision for the country is based on my own American Dream. I was raised in a blue-collar family; my dad was a union electrician, and my parents didn’t attend college. Because of a great education and a helping hand from others, I was fortunate enough to become a successful entrepreneur. Before age 40, I founded and led as chief executive two publicly traded companies that created thousands of jobs and were admired in the community. I’ve been blessed with a great family and the opportunity to give back through philanthropy and public service. As a progressive businessman, I’ve made it a priority to be solutions-oriented and have been consistently recognized as one of the most innovative and bipartisan members of Congress. I’ve done this by simultaneously celebrating the power of our free-market economy while insisting that there is a role for government to set goals and rules of the road and take care of those who are left behind. <br> My focus is on preparing our country for the future. Technological innovation, automation and globalization are the most powerful forces in the world today. These forces have been enormously positive; they will continue to make life better, enhance productivity, solve some of the world’s most difficult problems and open societies. Sadly, these forces will also eliminate certain jobs and require workers to learn new skills more quickly. They will create security risks and strain our resources. We need to respond to these large-scale opportunities and challenges by thinking about policy from a fresh perspective. What are the resources we have, how do we compete and create jobs, how can we ensure that everyone has a fair chance, and how do we protect ourselves? <br> To do this, we need new infrastructure, which can be paid for using my bipartisan approach to infrastructure and international tax reform. We need to be smarter, fueled by more investment in science, education and research. We need new ideas on the future of jobs and work, one where we build a stronger and more vibrant middle class. We need to encourage a more just and inclusive form of capitalism and reduce barriers to small-business formation, start-ups, job creation, investment and growth. We need to strengthen our safety-net programs and create a new social contract. We need to reform the systems of education, health care and immigration, and encourage more volunteerism, impact investing and public service. And we need to take affirmative steps to reduce our security, fiscal and climate risks. This is what my campaign will be about. <br> I am optimistic about our future. A future where responsible businesses work with our government to lead the world not only in growth and innovation but also in positive societal change. <br> The Democratic Party cherishes opportunity over birthright; wants people to earn a good living; offers a helping hand to the poor, the immigrant and those left behind; wants all Americans to have health care; embraces diversity, equality and justice; understands the importance of global engagements; believes that government can do transformative things; and stands ready to provide for our common defense. This is why I’m a Democrat. But we have a lot of work to do, given our recent electoral failures, and we need a different approach — one that’s focused on the facts and the future. <br> To do this work with the commitment it deserves, I will not be running for reelection to the House of Representatives. No games, no cat-and-mouse, no backup plan at the 11th hour if a focus group goes badly. <br> My approach goes beyond party and partisanship; I am first and foremost an American. I believe in a common national identity. I love our ambition, our values, what we represent to the world and our ability to use our greatness for a good and noble purpose. It is my love of country that compels me to behave differently in politics — to work to do big things, seek solutions and compromise, respect the privilege of public service and be optimistic about the world. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 So much for Donald Trump, the “America First” populist champion of the forgotten working class. The president now sounds pretty much like a garden-variety globalist, defending the “rigged” system he denounced during the campaign. <br> Then again, who knows how he’ll sound next week? He hasn’t even been in office for three full months, and Trump may already be the most erratic president we’ve ever seen. We have no idea where he really stands because, well, neither does he. <br> Remember when Russia was good and President Vladimir Putin was a potential partner in fighting the Islamic State? Now Russia is bad because it continues to support Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who killed civilians, including “beautiful babies,” with chemical weapons. Russia’s support of Assad, of course, is nothing new. But Putin, who no longer compliments Trump, kept Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cooling his heels before deigning to meet with him. Horrible! <br> Remember when China was bad because it “eats our lunch” in trade deals? Now, after Trump established personal chemistry with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a summit last week at Mar-a-Lago, Trump declines to repeat his long-standing allegation that China manipulates its currency. And as for the North Korea threat, which Trump once said China could easily resolve, the president now realizes it’s complicated. There’s a historical context for the relationship between China and the Koreas. Who knew? <br> “We’re not going into Syria,” Trump told the New York Post. Those on the receiving end of the 59 cruise missiles launched last week might be puzzled. There are roughly 1,000 U.S. personnel inside the war-torn country, and the number is inching up. Trump used to believe in nonintervention. Now he’s being cheered by those who want the United States to take a much larger role in the Syrian civil war. <br> Similar confusion abounds in domestic policy. First it was vital that Congress tackle health care before moving on to tax reform and other initiatives. Then, after the debacle of the ill-fated American Health Care Act — which Trump decided to avidly support, despite the fact that it reneged on his promise of “insurance for everybody” — Trump was ready to move on to other issues. But now, maybe health care is back as a priority. <br> Both parties support corporate tax reform, so it wouldn’t require much “Art of the Deal” magic to make it happen. Why hasn’t Trump moved in this direction, which could give him an actual accomplishment to brag about? I have no idea, and I doubt Trump knows, either. <br> It was inevitable that a rookie president with no experience in government at any level, much less the highest, would have a ridiculously steep learning curve to climb. It was also inevitable that Trump’s lack of focus and his tendency to be distracted by whatever cable news is yammering about at any given moment would hamper his ability to get anything done. <br> A truly first-rate staff could help. Instead, however, Trump has populated his West Wing with warring factions that battle one another with a ruthlessness the characters in “Game of Thrones” might find excessive. Currently on the outs is Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, the “economic nationalist” who wants to sharply curtail immigration, erect trade barriers, reduce U.S. commitments overseas and destroy what he calls the “administrative state.” <br> Bannon, who used to run Breitbart News, would be the scariest character in the administration if he were better at bureaucratic infighting. He was seen as the motivating force behind the attempts to impose a Muslim travel ban, which were stalled by the courts. He urged all-out support of a health-care bill that Trump reportedly had doubts about — and went to Capitol Hill to order GOP House members to support the measure, which just stiffened their opposition. <br> Bannon was recently removed from the National Security Council, a position he never should have been given in the first place. Trump this week said that he actually serves as his own strategist, describing Bannon tepidly as “a guy who works for me.” Trump is reported to have said privately that Bannon “is not a team player.” If this were a slasher movie, the audience would be screaming at the screen, “Steve, don’t go into that basement!” <br> If Bannon is toast, that’s good for the nation and the world. But Trump still lacks a White House team capable of executing his vision, or any vision. The answer to Casey Stengel’s question — “Can’t anybody here play this game?” — is an unambiguous no. <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 Anthony Scaramucci’s rollout as President Trump’s new communications director received mainly good reviews. He is, as any White House job in the current administration requires, a skilled sycophant. His on-air abjection — including a televised apology for past disloyalty — smacks of self-criticism during China’s Cultural Revolution. But comrade Scaramucci does have a knack for being aggressive without being angry. And he is good on TV, which means he’ll play a starring role in Trump’s main obsession. <br> The president’s intention in choosing Scaramucci was clear from the announcement. “We have accomplished so much,” said Trump in his statement, “and we are being given credit for so little.” Scaramucci’s calling is to be a more effective harvester of credit. <br> This staff change is probably a good thing for the president. It also reveals a complete blindness about the true source of his administration’s current struggles. <br> Who can look at the wreck of the White House — bitterly divided, dysfunctional and hemorrhaging leaks — and think a better communications approach is the answer? Who can look at the wreck of Trump’s agenda — stymied in spite of Republican control of the House and Senate — and think the real problem is insufficient credit-taking on television? I could name half a dozen White House jobs that more urgently needed new blood — including the chief of staff — than communications director. Jobs in the press department are what the press and the president mainly see. But obvious problems are not always the most urgent. <br> To be fair, the idea that words are always the real problem is not unique to the Trump administration. I saw the same communications fallacy in my White House experience during George W. Bush’s presidency. It is typical for politicians and party officials to believe that the fault lies not in themselves, but in their flacks. As head of presidential speechwriting, I heard more than my share of “if only.” If only the administration would make such-and-such a point, the Katrina mess could be put behind us. If only the president said some magic words — suggested language attached — the erosion in support for the Iraq War would be reversed. If only the president were to give 60 speeches in 60 days on Social Security reform, Americans would finally understand the problem and our plan would pass. <br> We actually tried that last one in 2005. The trip was carefully designed to pressure gettable Democratic senators. Bush was loose, informed and effective. And the plan never even got out of committee. We did not have a communications problem. We had a reality problem — as we did with Katrina and Iraq. In such cases, hiring a new head of speechwriting would probably not have helped. <br> The Trump administration’s reality problem is a historically unpopular president, pushing historically unpopular legislation (at least on health care), in a historically divided party, to a historically polarized country. Hiring a new head of communications will not fundamentally alter this state of affairs. <br> Words generally cannot improve facts on the ground, but they do have the power to complicate them. Part of the reason Trump is, from his perspective, “given credit for so little” is that so little has been accomplished. But another part is the insanely high expectations that Trump’s own words have created. “You’re going to have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost,” he promised. “It’s going to be so easy.” Tax reform benefiting the middle class would come in the first 100 days. He would build an impenetrable physical wall across the continent and “the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall.” There would be a package spurring a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending. Middle East peace is “frankly maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years.” And further: “I will give you everything” and achieve “every dream you ever dreamed for your country.” <br> The president would probably not be politically comfortable fulfilling some of my dreams. But even more generally, this is what happens when a politician promises the world while knowing so little about how it actually works. <br> Trump’s greatest need is not someone who will defend him on cable television.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> PRESIDENT TRUMP has so far failed to supply a credible remedy to the economic ills that prompted so many of his followers to cast a ballot for him in 2016. Of course, many of Mr. Trump’s voters were expressing not only support for him but disenchantment with the Democratic alternative. Democrats have responded to this devastating defeat mostly by preaching “resistance” to Mr. Trump and the Republican majority on Capitol Hill. However, if they are to recover politically and — more important for the nation’s overall political health — turn our political tribal warfare into something more like a battle of ideas, the Democrats must declare what they are for. <br> In that sense, we give them credit for Monday’s rollout of a new message aimed at the struggling middle class; they have decided to start trying to articulate a new vision. The question is whether their “A Better Deal” offers an alternative to Trumpism that is both clear and well-calculated to cure what really ails the American economy. <br> We don’t envy the Democrats’ task: In many ways the U.S. economy is performing well, operating at nearly full employment and growing at a steady if modest pace. Its problems are not spectacular but structural: lagging productivity growth, subpar labor force participation, slow wage growth, income inequality. Over the horizon, even more potentially job-killing automation looms. No one has foolproof answers for these complex challenges, which affect not only the United States but also developed economies around the world. <br> Even allowing for the degree of difficulty, however, the Democratic response, as sketched so far, is less than compelling: Its declared premise, that the economy is “rigged” against middle-class people, has a basis in the reality of Washington special-interest politics but seems better calculated to placate the party’s ascendant left wing than to start a serious policy conversation. American capitalism needs reform, not delegitimization. The Democrats offer one interesting idea in this respect — beefed up antitrust efforts to help bring down prices of airline tickets and the like. Otherwise, they rehash ideas that Mr. Trump himself has embraced at least rhetorically (massive new infrastructure spending; tougher negotiations between Medicare and the pharmaceutical companies) or play small ball (a tax credit for business to do job training). <br> The Democratic message includes nothing, yet, on trade, a major omission, given Mr. Trump’s effective exploitation of the issue. Yet perhaps it was better to remain silent than to admit the contradiction between House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s (Calif.) promise that Democrats would confront “rising everyday costs” and the higher consumer prices that would result from the protectionism favored by both Mr. Trump and the Democratic left. Democrats also had nothing to say about tax reform, possibly because the clearest need is for a more internationally competitive (i.e., lower) corporate rate, which is what President Barack Obama correctly concluded, but populists abhor. Democrats are right that the United States hungers for a more equitable and effective alternative to GOP economics; obviously, though, they’re still working on it. <br> Read more here: <br> Nancy Pelosi: Americans deserve better than the GOP agenda, so we’re offering a better deal <br> Fareed Zakaria: The Democrats’ problem is not the economy, stupid <br> Dana Milbank: Democrats finally have an agenda.

 Nancy Pelosi, from California, is House Democratic leader. <br> Last week, our nation marked six months since President Trump’s inauguration. <br> For the first time in a decade, the GOP had the White House, Congress and complete control of the legislative process to advance its agenda. But instead of creating good-paying jobs, or rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, or advancing tax reform, Republicans have spent six months trying to raise Americans’ health costs to fund tax breaks for billionaires. <br> Democrats have a better approach — in fact, a better deal. On Monday, House and Senate Democrats are traveling to the town of Berryville, Va., to announce a fresh vision for “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” <br> What motivates us is that the costs of living keep rising, but families feel their incomes and wages aren’t keeping up. Special interests are given special treatment, while hard-working Americans are ignored. Working people from the heartland to the cities are struggling in a rigged economy and a system stacked against them. <br> Our agenda is focused on efforts to create jobs and raise incomes for American workers, to lower the cost of living for American families, and to build an economy that gives every American the tools to succeed in the 21st century. <br> It is an ambitious economic agenda that represents a renewed Democratic commitment to the hard-working men and women across the United States who have been left out and left behind for too long. As part of that commitment, Democrats are announcing three new proposals rooted in a bold approach to the challenges facing the United States. <br> First, Democrats are pledging ourselves to the goal of creating good-paying, full-time jobs for 10 million more Americans in the next five years. <br> It is time to ignite a new era of investment in America’s workers, empowering all Americans with the skills they need to compete in the modern economy. We are calling for a new tax credit for employers to train and hire workers at a good wage, and a massive new national commitment to expanding apprenticeships and paid on-the-job training that advances their skills and careers. <br> While we grow jobs, wages and the economy, Democrats know that a better deal for the American people demands strong action to tackle rising costs that are eating up families’ budgets. <br> Prescription drug prices are jacked up, and Americans have fewer options at increased costs. Large communications companies merge, and families see fewer options and higher bills. Agriculture giants consolidate, while farmers struggle and prices in Americans’ shopping carts rise. The price of gas goes down, but plane tickets become more expensive and airlines keep adding fees. <br> With this agenda, Democrats pledge ourselves to breaking the grip of the special interests and confronting the rising everyday costs that families have endured for too long. <br> That is the impetus behind our second proposal, to put economic power back into the hands of the American people, cracking down on the monopolies and big corporate mergers that harm consumers, workers and competition. We will demand that proposed mergers meet tough new standards to protect competition before approval, and will institute post-merger reviews to ensure that consolidated companies keep their promises to American consumers. <br> Third, Democrats will take unprecedented aggressive action to lower the cost of prescription drugs — the single largest factor driving increasing health costs in the United States today. We will leverage the power of Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, force drug manufacturers to open their books and justify cost increases, and create a strong, independent enforcement agency empowered to end outrageous and unjustified prescription drug price-gouging. <br> The past six months have exposed the toxic special-interest priorities at the core of the Republican agenda. The American people deserve better. With a Democratic Congress, a better deal is exactly what Democrats will give them. <br> Read more: <br> Dana Milbank: Democrats finally have an agenda.

 I was baffled by KK Ottesen’s decision to include Grover Norquist among her collection of 10 “activists” in the otherwise impressive and beautifully presented “ ‘I could use my voice ’ ” collection in the July 9 Washington Post Magazine. Perhaps Norquist’s persistent aversion to taxes is activism of a kind, but to invite comparisons to Dolores Huerta or Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) is insulting. Those two heroes sacrificed their safety to bring dignity and hope to oppressed people. Norquist, meanwhile, has sacrificed nothing to create a meaningless “pledge” for politicians to sign, promising that they won’t increase taxes. This one gesture has infected an entire political party with a juvenile, reflexive distrust of the common good, a rank selfishness that Norquist attempts to obscure with talk of “liberty.” <br> Tellingly, he sees his American compatriots as united in one simple desire: “All want to be left alone.” I wonder if, seeing those words presented next to Harry Belafonte’s powerful depiction of immigrant poverty and postwar racism, Norquist appreciated just how few people in American history have lived lives so sheltered that taxation, of all things, constituted the major threat to their autonomy. <br> John Lingan, Rockville 
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan face a very difficult choice as they survey the smoking ruins of their “unified GOP government” after nearly six months in office. They and their lieutenants could decide to pivot from health care to racking up small victories and awaiting reinforcements from the 2018 elections. Or they could go for a big deal with Democrats. It’s a tough choice for Ryan and McConnell, but I’m hoping they opt for the latter. <br> Putting off fixing the disaster that is Obamacare is risky, though not impossible. If Republicans score enough small victories between now and November 2018 — cutting corporate taxes and confirming all Court of Appeals judges and perhaps next summer another member of the Supreme Court — it may be possible to hold both houses of Congress. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) is a dead man walking for his role in pulling the first thread that led to the unraveling of “repeal and replace,” but McConnell (Ky.) might calculate that wins in Florida, Missouri and elsewhere may leave him in a stronger position in January 2019 than he was at the start of this year. <br> Ryan (Wis.) is in more dangerous terrain, as every member of his caucus “owns” the failure to repeal and replace — especially the Freedom Caucus, which threw the process into disarray only to retreat (too late) with a fig leaf — and as a result the carnage of the collapsing Obamacare experiment. Real people with real illnesses and deeply flawed Medicaid insurance will discover in increasing numbers that paper insurance doesn’t deliver real health care when their children are sick. A “watch it fail” approach to Obamacare, when the crisis is real and the consequences for poor children are so enormous, is not just bad politics; it is also immoral. <br> The alternative to waiting for 2019 is a bipartisan approach — if Democrats will have it. A health-care deal could be done, leaving the fringes of both party caucuses on the outside looking in. Devolution of authority over Medicaid to the states, and repeal of the insurance mandate and absurd taxes such as the medical device tax, are the GOP must-haves. The Democrats will have their list. <br> Odds of success increase if the parties go big at the start by removing the sequester’s limits on defense spending and adding immigration reform to the deal: appropriations for President Trump’s wall paired with legalization of the law-abiding, undocumented population but no path to citizenship. A truly ambitious “go big” option could also include a settlement of the judicial confirmation wars, because the more moving parts, the better the chances of success. McConnell, Ryan and Democratic leaders Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) could get together with a half-dozen of the smartest members from both parties to work on an expedited basis and go big. <br> The GOP Congress has failed. Unless there’s a Lazarus-like resurrection of the health-care bill, the session is effectively over. Tax reform isn’t likely going to do any better than health-care reform, especially with Wall Street Journal ideologues demanding the end of the state and local income-tax deduction and the capping of the mortgage-interest deduction. (F.A. Hayek doesn’t vote in large numbers. Blue-state voters with Republican congressmen do.) The GOP must get its appelate court nominees through the Senate, or the party wipeout could expand to seats previously thought safe. <br> The 2018 prospects look bad for both parties: The GOP lacks policy victories, thanks to imprudent Freedom Caucus members and scared moderates. The Democrats are lost in Trump hatred to the point where a large part of the country thinks that they and the mainstream media are deranged. Both parties have cause for concern. We are at a crisis point where citizens are giving up on representative government en masse. So why not swing for the fences? <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Marc A.

 The pulling of the GOP health-care bill this week was a big loss, and perhaps significant beyond its own costs, as it may signal that the “Area 51” sub-caucus within the Freedom Caucus is made up not so much of conservative Republicans as parties of one with no interest in an agenda shared beyond whatever exists in the space between their own ears. <br> But it was still, the record must show, a very good week for the conservative cause generally and President Trump specifically. He promised a worthy successor to Justice Antonin Scalia, and Judge Neil Gorsuch proved to be that in his hearings. Gorsuch also seems to have triggered the return of the now-Charles E. Schumer-led political madness of the Harry Reid era. Schumer, the Senate minority leader, has promised a filibuster of Gorsuch, which will oblige Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to invoke the “Reid Rule” — which allows the Senate’s rules and precedents to be changed by a simple majority vote. The first application of the Reid Rule allowed Democrats to avoid supermajority confirmation of life-tenured federal appellate and district court judges and executive branch nominees. The second application would break the rule about supermajority confirmation of Supreme Court justices. Originalists have long wanted this result. Now we will get it, along with a great originalist justice in Neil Gorsuch. <br> So Trump had good reason to shake off the rebuff from the Freedom Caucus and the pulling of the health-care bill, and despite his Oval Office aside about being surprised by the lack of loyalty in the caucus, he was loyal to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, as was Ryan to Trump. This bodes well for the party and for governing over the next 18 months. <br> What doesn’t bode well is the shared decision of president and speaker to advance next on tax reform, with the twin political death traps of abolition of the home mortgage interest deduction and the state and local taxes deduction. I expect (and hope) for a loss on those Beltway Holy Grails not sought by many, if any, outside of it. A corporate tax cut, yes, and tax simplification, yes, but not two big intraparty squabbles and crackups in a row. <br> Better to go for infrastructure, including the border wall, and best of all, the fulfillment of the promise of a 350-ship Navy and the general defense buildup that needs to surround that Trump goal. <br> To that end, though, there needs to be a nomination rush, and soon, in both the Defense and State departments. And those nominees need to be Republicans. <br> This is the good week that could have been much better. Putting a 30-year-plus originalist on the court would be a history-maker. A legislative loss is an inevitability. The latter is disappointing, but the lessons learned along the way are invaluable to everyone, even the Republican members who will be punished in ways large and small in the weeks, months and years ahead. <br> I would have preferred the best of weeks. But I’d take a likely SCOTUS confirmation over a one-house-of-Congress win any day. The real pain millions will continue to feel from the accelerating collapse of Obamacare could have been avoided, but as the president and others have noted, “collapse and replace” may have political advantages over “repeal and replace.” I’d prefer real reform, but the political benefits are not bad consolation prizes. <br> The GOP leadership team needs to keep planning and keep pressing, and the 2018 cycle has to adjust for some casualties from among the inside-the-caucus wreckers who will draw primary challengers and thus be bled before the general. But on the Senate side, where Democrats facing the 2018 midterms were probably hoping for some health-care theatrics in their chamber to wipe away the memory of Gorsuch, the smiles are forced. <br> A good week for the GOP. It could have been a great one. <br> Now, though, with Aetna’s president voicing what everyone blessed with behind-closed-doors objectivity understands — that the Obamacare “death cycle” is real — the opportunity for legislation shifts to the Senate, where the doors of Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Finance Committee, must be open to ranking Democrats Patty Murray (Wash.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.) should the latter want to approach the former with reform proposals. Democrats face a potential disaster with 25 of their seats up in 2018 and only eight of the GOP incumbents campaigning. The urgency to find a fix to Obamacare’s collapse should be on Senate Democrats. If they can find a way to gracefully exit the nightmare of Obamacare without calling it a repudiation of the former president, the Senate GOP should listen and consult with Trump and Ryan about genuine bipartisan compromises. Those could include immigration regularization, targeted infrastructure, tax reform and, of course, the defense buildup via an end to the sequester. A big deal would have to come out of the Senate, and it would have to be mostly — though not exclusively — the GOP’s agenda, and it might keep Democratic losses down to a handful of seats in 2018. <br> That way, of course, votes the Area 51 sub-caucus of the Freedom Caucus off the island. But that’s what they asked for. They prefer their late-night meetings and cold-pizza breakfasts to legislation that addresses the country’s many deep problems. If Alexander and Hatch start meeting with Murray and Wyden, good — not great, but good — things could happen. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Okay, you lost. Now don’t sabotage Obamacare.

 Regarding the July 11 front-page article “White House defends Trump Jr.”: <br> Russian President Vladimir Putin must be ebullient now with the state of the West in general and the United States in particular. Russia has managed to take advantage of a reasonably cohesive but slightly dysfunctional society, exploit minor fissures and transform them into enormous chasms with the latest brouhaha about Donald Trump Jr.  <br> We have devolved into a bunch of squabbling nincompoops because we’ve been so artfully played. Ideally, the media and politicians would remind us that we’re on the same team. That is a tall order because so much of our collective discourse has become personal, and it’s extremely difficult to admit fault. But it must be done.  <br> Bill Marriott, Springfield <br> President Trump famously stated that he could shoot someone on New York’s Fifth Avenue and he wouldn’t lose supporters. It appears he was right. Thanks to Donald Trump Jr., we have direct evidence of intentional contact with a hostile foreign power to gain domestic political advantage, yet the president’s support among Republicans remains steady. <br> GOP leaders’ silence is disturbing. I refuse to believe that the GOP has sold its soul and our future to a man who respects neither them nor our institutions. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) will always be my hero. Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and others are patriots who love this country every bit as much as I do. They have seen the information on the suspicious and highly questionable activities of Trump associates. Many of them have probably seen even more. Yet most remain remarkably mum. The ends do not justify the means. No tax reform bill or health-care legislation is worth it. <br> In a few weeks, my son will take the oath and join the military. He will be promising to risk his life to support and defend the country from all enemies foreign and domestic. My son! I am asking GOP leaders to remember the oaths they took and set limits on where politics ends and patriotism begins. <br> Kevin Brady, Olney 
 CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS have a big new idea on corporate taxation that could nudge U.S. economic policy in a positive direction, if GOP lawmakers get certain details right, which is a big if. <br> First, the proposal, which Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), labels “a key part of our built-for-growth” tax reform plan: Companies based in the United States would be taxed at a flat 20 percent, as opposed to brackets up to 35 percent (riddled with deductions) under current law. The tax would be levied only on net income earned within this country — revenue from exports would be effectively tax free. Also, companies would write off new investment immediately, but lose the deduction for interest expenses they currently enjoy. When you put these changes together, they create fresh incentives to locate economic activity — and register ownership of intellectual property — within the United States, to export rather than import, and to finance businesses with equity rather than debt. Other things being equal, that could improve tax efficiency and domestic job creation. <br> Like any major tax change, this one would create winners and losers. Perhaps hardest hit would be the real estate and financial industries, whose business models depend heavily on the current deduction for interest expenses. The best response to this concern is that recent experience suggests the U.S. economy might be just a bit over-dependent on real estate and finance. Major retailers, for their part, fret that the after-tax cost of importing the products they sell would go up; refiners of imported crude oil could also face higher costs, which may be why a spokesman for Koch Industries, of Charles and David Koch fame, threw cold water on the idea. Supporters of the plan respond, plausibly, that changes in currency exchange rates could offset any initial impact on import costs. <br> Now, alas, for those worrisome details. The GOP plan should add nothing to the deficit; it would be self-defeating, in economic terms, to have a debt-discouraging tax system for corporations that was debt-increasing for the government. Perhaps even more important, the Republicans are going to have to figure out how to make such a huge de facto shift in the U.S. tax treatment of imports compliant with international trade law. In its current iteration, the proposal would allow corporations to deduct the costs of wages paid within this country — a nice reward for hiring Americans and paying them well, which for complex reasons could be construed as a discriminatory subsidy under existing World Trade Organization doctrine. <br> No doubt President-elect Donald Trump’s instinct would be to dare other countries to sue us at the WTO and then resist a contrary ruling if and when it comes. A more intelligent strategy would be to devise an alternative that accomplishes the economic purpose of the wage-expense deduction without running the same legal risk. To be sure, history suggests that the biggest danger of all is that lobbyists will gut the GOP proposal of everything except the new, reduced flat rate. As a conversation-starter about the future of corporate taxation, though, the plan has already done some good. <br> Read more here: <br> Lawrence Summers: On tax reform, take a page from Ronald Reagan <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s proposed tax ‘reform’ is hardly reform at all <br> George F.

 WE OPPOSED Donald Trump’s election and supported his opponent , Hillary Clinton, because we thought she offered better policy solutions and was better-suited by experience and temperament for the job. Since Nov. 8, Mr. Trump has stoked doubts regarding policy, by issuing apologetics for Russia and tariff threats against automakers, American and foreign, among other instances. In a series of outbursts on Twitter, he also has intensified many Americans’ concern about his temperament. <br> Nevertheless, his election was legitimate, and his inauguration is inevitable. All of us have a duty to oppose Mr. Trump when he is wrong, but also to remain open to supporting him when he and the Republican-majority Congress make worthy proposals. <br> How often might that be? Well, not never: We can identify a number of areas in which Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans have ideas worth taking seriously. <br> One would be tax reform, specifically of the corporate code. Mr. Trump’s campaign proposals on both the corporate and individual side were unjustifiably generous to the well-to-do and destabilizing to federal finances. Nevertheless, he appropriately seeks to encourage corporations to bring billions back to the United States and to discourage them from offshoring income in the first place. Emerging Republican plans in Congress offer intriguing possibilities for accomplishing those objectives — if appropriately designed not to blow up the deficit or unduly exacerbate inequality. <br> Then there is education. Mr. Trump’s nomination of Michigan school choice advocate Betsy DeVos to be education secretary signals that the incoming administration will be more sympathetic than any in recent memory to giving parents alternatives to traditional public schools, whether publicly funded charter schools or vouchers to help pay private-school tuition. If reform is targeted to poor families currently with no options other than a failing neighborhood school, it would be a boon. <br> Mr. Trump and the Republicans are right to emphasize a stronger military defense, after years of budgetary uncertainty exacerbated by the ill-advised sequestration limits. Again, much depends on how they go about boosting military spending and how they propose to pay for it, if at all. Yet the basic principle seems sound, given multiple threats: terrorism, China and, yes, Russia. Mr. Trump’s insistence that the government get a better deal from defense contractors — as from drug manufacturers — also isn’t crazy. <br> Mr. Trump has expressed interest in expanding infrastructure and deregulating business, and on both counts he has a point — with caveats. If Mr. Trump’s idea for the former issue is like that of adviser Stephen K. Bannon — who has said, apropos construction spending, “We’re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks” — the results could be disastrous. If Mr. Trump wants to fund a long-term program to maintain and upgrade existing facilities, the productivity enhancements could justify paying for it with borrowed funds. As for regulation, there must be simpler, less costly ways to achieve widely shared goals such as fuel efficiency and financial stability. If Mr. Trump genuinely pursues them, as opposed to abandoning the goals, he’ll deserve a fair hearing. <br> As full of risk for our democracy as the Trump presidency is, it would be folly to ignore any opportunities for progress it presents, if and when it does. <br> Read more: <br> The Post’s View: President Trump <br> Letters to the Editor: When to support, and when to oppose, Trump’s policies <br> Robert J.

 Sen. Mitch McConnell has called off a vote this week on the Senate Republican health-care bill. That’s a good thing. Because if Republicans want to confirm every liberal caricature of conservatism in a single piece of legislation, they could do no better than vote on the GOP bill in its current form. <br> Here is the summary of the bill that Democrats will take to the American people in 2018: Republicans voted to cut $701 billion in taxes for corporations and the wealthy, and pay for it with $772 billion taken from Medicaid for the poor — all while pushing 22 million Americans off health care. <br> And Senate Republicans are writing the script for them. Have they lost their minds? <br> Let’s be clear: The investment tax and Medicare surcharge in Obamacare are a drag on economic growth. But if Republicans want to eliminate them, they should do so as part of broader tax reform and pay for it with other changes in the tax code — anything but Medicaid cuts for the poor. Paying for a massive tax cut for the wealthy with cuts to health care for the most vulnerable Americans is morally reprehensible. <br> It is also politically suicidal. If Republicans bring this bill to the floor, under reconciliation rules (which allow the GOP to pass the bill by a simple majority) there will up to 20 hours of debate and unlimited amendments. Senate Democrats will force Republicans to cast one vote after another designed to make them look like monsters come Election Day. They will make Republicans vote “no” on eliminating tax cuts for the rich and using that money for opioid treatment, services for the disabled, nursing home residents, children’s health — you name it. <br> Even better for Democrats, the bill will disproportionately impact states President Trump won which are the epicenter of the opioid crisis. According to one Harvard University/New York University estimate, about 1 million people are receiving substance abuse and mental-health treatment under the Medicaid expansion — with more than 400,000 in just two states Trump won, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Other states heavily impacted included Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Nevada, Tennessee and West Virginia. Nationally, spending on substance abuse treatment in the Medicaid expansion population is estimated to be $4.5 billion per year. The GOP bill includes a measly $2 billion for opioid treatment in 2018. That’s chump change. <br> Conservatives are right to reform Medicaid. There is nothing wrong with entitlement reform that moves to a per capita cap system, so long as the caps are designed to rise with the costs of medical inflation (which they don’t in the Senate bill). But the savings need to be used to help people get coverage on the private market — not used for tax cuts for the wealthy. Conservatives should not trap people in poverty because the only way they can get adequate health care — including appropriate help for substance abuse and mental health — is through Medicaid. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the increase in out-of-pocket costs in the Senate bill would contribute “significantly” to a reduction in the number of lower-income people who obtain coverage. Even if they are eligible for premium tax credits, as a result of the high deductibles few low-income people would purchase any plan. That is unacceptable. <br> It’s also politically insane for the GOP to pass a bill that will reduce the number of Americans with health coverage by 22 million. Our goal should be to expand the number of Americans buying health coverage, not reduce it. And there are good, conservative ways to do so. My American Enterprise Institute colleague Jim Capretta and Hoover Institution fellow Lanhee Chen have designed a plan to automatically enroll Americans who don’t get health insurance from their employers in high-deductible catastrophic care policies whose premiums equal the value of the federal tax credits. This would not be a mandate — they could withdraw from the plans if they wanted to. In this way, we could get virtually every American — including the young and healthy — into the insurance market, which would reduce costs for older and sicker Americans. This way, instead of fending off Democratic criticism for driving millions of Americans off their health plans, Republicans could claim credit for bringing the country closer to universal health coverage. Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) have adopted this approach in their alternative plan. <br> But instead of expanding coverage, Republicans seem intent on painting themselves as reverse Robin Hoods, who steal from the poor to give to the rich. That is not what Trump promised when he talked of a bill with a “heart.” <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Douglas Holtz-Eakin: The Senate health-care bill will give us better care and a better economy <br> Jennifer Rubin: McConnell throws in the towel — for now <br> Hugh Hewitt: If GOP senators blow this, say hello to single-payer health care <br> Drew Altman: Why the Senate’s health-care plan wouldn’t work in the real world <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Correction: An earlier version of this editorial said Ford Motor Company had decided not to build small cars in Mexico after President Trump’s election. Ford decided not to build a new small-car factory but plans to produce some at an existing plant. This version has been updated. <br> AS A candidate for the White House, Donald Trump blasted the Ford Motor Company for planning to shift production of its leading compact car, the Focus, to Mexico. He even went so far as to threaten a huge tariff on any and all U.S. cars formerly produced in this country that might be exported from Mexico back into the United States. After Mr. Trump’s election, Ford seemed to cave by announcing it would not be building the cars in Mexico after all. <br> So what are we to make of the surprising facts that Ford now plans to make the Focus in President Trump’s other trade nemesis — China — and that the Trump administration’s response is, essentially, “whatever”? Ford’s move just “shows how flexible multinational companies are in terms of geography,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross observed. You don’t say! <br> Lesson one: Economic reality is stubborn. Gas prices are plunging. Ergo, the American consumer can afford to indulge a preference for larger vehicles, to the detriment of smaller, fuel-efficient models such as the Focus, U.S. sales of which fell 31 percent between 2012 and 2016. Assembling these slow-selling vehicles in high-wage American factories is not profitable; even nonunion Japanese and Korean carmakers are de-emphasizing small-car production in the United States, in favor of SUVs and crossovers. Mr. Trump’s coercion was bound to fail, and while it’s not ideal to see any production shift overseas, kudos to Ford for calling Mr. Trump’s dictatorial bluff — especially because the company plans not to lay off workers but to redeploy them producing pickups and SUVs in Michigan. <br> A second lesson, though, is that government subsidy can’t overcome fundamental market dynamics either. Ford was the recipient of a $5.9 billion low-interest loan from the Energy Department, authorized under a bipartisan program signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007 but funded by the Obama administration in 2009, the purpose of which was to help Ford produce the next generation of fuel-efficient vehicles in the United States. “We have an historic opportunity to help ensure that the next generation of fuel-efficient cars and trucks are made in America,” President Barack Obama said . A declared purpose of the huge loan was to convert two truck factories to car production. The loan did, indeed, help Ford raise the fuel efficiency of its best-selling F-150 pickup (which it might have done anyway to meet stricter federal standards). But as Ford’s recent moves demonstrate, the dream of hot-selling gas sippers, made in the U.S.A., has apparently died, a victim of low gas prices and high U.S. production costs. <br> Is it too much to hope that the federal government will stop purporting to micromanage specific business-location decisions using either threats or bribes? The right approach is to enhance business conditions generally — especially through corporate tax reform — so that the United States remains competitive with all the other places in the world where capital may freely locate. Mr. Ross seemed to concede this, noting that after Ford’s move, German and Japanese automakers will be attracted to this country by Mr. Trump’s “reforms.” So we’re wondering: What was the point of all that protectionist fuss? <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Chuck Schumer: Trump railed against China while campaigning.

 The dyspeptic Henry Adams was not nice but not wrong when he described what now is named the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, as an “architectural infant asylum.” The granite pile, which once housed the State, War and Navy departments, was, Harry S. Truman said, “the greatest monstrosity in America.” Actually, today’s premier monstrosity is the federal budget, which is Mick Mulvaney’s headache as the new head of the Office of Management and Budget, which is housed in the EEOB. <br> If the dictionary had an entry for “deficit hawk,” it would have Mulvaney’s picture next to it: In 2011, he opposed raising the debt ceiling unless it was linked to deep spending cuts and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. He became a South Carolina congressman by defeating a 14-term Democrat who was chairman of the House Budget Committee. Now 49, Mulvaney was about to begin his fourth term when the new president nominated him to be budget director. This detonated Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who voted against Mulvaney, whose fiscal stringency extends to defense spending. <br> Mulvaney represented upstate South Carolina, where Andrew Jackson might or might not have been born (southern North Carolina also claims him) and where Jackson’s military spirit still lives. Mulvaney and McCain both oppose the budget slush fund used to evade spending caps by paying for some military operations outside the regular defense budget, known as Overseas Contingency Operations. McCain has derided Overseas Contingency Operations as a “gimmick.” In 2016, it was 10 percent of defense spending — bringing those operations into regular budgeting will further complicate Mulvaney’s task of solving this budgetary Rubik’s Cube: how to accommodate preserving the sequester’s spending caps, cutting tax revenues by upward of $6 trillion over a decade, reforming the tax code, substantially increasing defense spending, finding $1 trillion for infrastructure projects and leaving untouched entitlements while every day 10,000 more baby boomers become eligible for Social Security and Medicare. Today AARP is running television ads urging support for the new president’s promise to “protect and save” both programs. While Mulvaney stresses the guarantee that no one in or near retirement will ever be affected by entitlement reforms, he also insists that there must be changes if the two programs are to be protected and saved. <br> It is an old joke: Two people, an economist and a normal person, fall into a deep pit with steep, unscalable sides. “Don’t worry,” says the economist, “we’ll just assume a ladder.” It is an old budgeting practice: Assume rapid economic growth. What the OMB decides to assume will depend, Mulvaney says, on finding “the sweet spot” among various public- and private-sector growth projections. <br> Although since 2000 average gross domestic product growth has been an anemic 1.9 percent, and the United States just completed a decade without a single year of 3 percent growth, Steven Mnuchin, the new treasury secretary, has signaled what the administration will assume: He believes 3 percent growth can be normal. Never mind that growth was 1.8 percent last year, and the Federal Reserve sees 1.8 percent for many years, and the Congressional Budget Office projects 1.9 percent for five years. <br> Mulvaney notes that someone 35 years old has spent his or her entire working life experiencing nothing but economic sluggishness. The political rewards for delivering the novelty of economic dynamism could be transformative. He insists that “1.9 percent is not the ‘new normal’ ” and “230 years of American history are more indicative of what America is capable of.” Whatever his shop proposes will reflect “dynamic scoring,” which estimates the growth effects of tax reform and, even more, regulatory relief, which he thinks can have “two to three times” the growth effect of tax policy. <br> The list of prior budget directors includes many luminous names: George Shultz, Caspar Weinberger, Leon Panetta, Alice Rivlin, Mitch Daniels, Rob Portman. None faced a challenge as daunting as Mulvaney’s, with much depending on tax reform at a moment when Republicans are sharply divided about various proposals. <br> Confirmed later than any of his predecessors, Mulvaney is just getting organized in his ornate 19th-century office. The French writer Guy de Maupassant so loathed the Eiffel Tower that he frequently lunched in its restaurant because there he could not see the tower. As Mulvaney struggles to reconcile Americans’ appetite for government services and their aversion to paying for them, one consolation is that he cannot see the EEOB from his office in it. <br> Read more from George F.

 Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) threw himself off a political cliff last week when he declared full-throated opposition to the Senate version of the Obamacare repeal bill, and it remains to be seen if Heller is hanging by a limb out of sight and can climb back to electoral sanity or has hit rock bottom in his public career. <br> Individual Senate Republicans face different political realities, but the caucus must somehow get the votes necessary to return the revised Obamacare “repeal and replace” bill to the House. To fail to do so is to condemn not only Heller and Arizona’s Sen. Jeff Flake to certain doom but probably others among the eight GOP senators up for reelection. The grass roots’ disgust with this betrayal will be so deep as to endanger every senator, even in deep red states such as Mississippi, Texas and Utah. <br> The political crosswinds and upheavals in the country are already beyond predicting anything, so to add even more cause for grievance by betraying the central promise of the congressional GOP is beyond irresponsible. It is political insanity. Shut the door to the consultants, and throw out the polling senators. If the GOP defaults on its core promise, it is doomed as a party to minority status, probably as early as 2018 and certainly in 2020. <br> To fail this week almost certainly forfeits the House majority in next year’s midterm elections but perhaps also the Senate’s, and with the latter, the ability to confirm Supreme Court justices and lower court judges, pass budgets under reconciliation, have any chance at serious tax reform and of course approve the crucial repeal of the Defense Department sequestration. <br> This is of course an imperative vote on saving American health care. Next year, for example, there potentially will be at least 18 counties in Ohio without even a single option for an individuals seeking coverage. The swaths of America where there is only one provider are large and growing. “Choice for consumers” is a delusion, and soaring deductibles have made health care an illusion to millions more. <br> Obamacare is a catastrophe on its own terms, but the consequences of not passing its repeal are worse even beyond those awful health-care outcomes. It will forfeit every other Republican goal because failing to deliver on the central promise of eight years of debates and campaigns will shatter the credibility every Republican, not just those who block the bill. The party as a whole will be gravely wounded, perhaps beyond healing for a generation or more. <br> I don’t have to guess about this. I have been talking to the center-right of the country for three hours a day Monday through Friday for the past 17 years. I know the central argument of the conservative activists everywhere in the United States is that Beltway Republicans cannot be trusted to do anything hard. That argument was dented by the discipline with which the GOP put up with the mainstream media and Democrats’ slings and arrows in the fight over replacing Justice Antonin Scalia. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) rightly calculated that to surrender that hill would be to lose not just a political battle but the political war stretching long into the future. It was that big of a deal to the base. <br> The same is true of Obamacare. To vote “no” on whatever compromise arrives is to express contempt for the Republican Party as a whole – and its grass-roots activists and base voters — and for those ideas it stands for on all major matters, from a strong defense to low taxes to an originalist Supreme Court. <br> Thus Heller seemed to declare himself a hollow man when he said he could not vote for it, a man without any core beliefs because with his rambling statement he endangered all alleged core GOP beliefs, and thus the GOP will not support him. It isn’t about primaries; primary opponents need not materialize. It is about millions of conservatives who will simply give up on politics. <br> This is a make-or-break moment for Senate Republicans and the party itself. Sadly, for this conservative, the tone-deafness of Heller may not be unique. It may not even turn out to be particularly rare. We will know in a week. And not one GOP senator will be able to say he or she wasn’t warned. <br> Read more here: <br> Avik Roy: The Senate’s health-care bill could be one of the GOP’s greatest accomplishments <br> The Post’s View: Senate Republicans’ Obamacare replacement is bad for America’s health <br> John Kasich and John Hickenlooper: Another one-party health-care plan will be doomed to failure <br> Eugene Robinson: Republicans are accidentally paving the way for single-payer health care <br> Greg Sargent: Sorry, folks.

 David Cole is national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Marc Mauer is executive director of the Sentencing Project. <br> Attorney General Jeff Sessions is right to be concerned about recent increases in violent crime in some of our nation’s largest cities, as well as a tragic rise in drug overdoses nationwide [“Lax drug enforcement means more violence,” op-ed, June 18]. But there is little reason to believe that his response — reviving the failed “war on drugs” and imposing more mandatory minimums on nonviolent drug offenders — will do anything to solve the problem. His prescription contravenes a growing bipartisan consensus that the war on drugs has not worked. And it would exacerbate mass incarceration, the most pressing civil rights problem of the day. <br> Sessions’s first mistake is to conflate correlation and causation. He argues that the rise in murder rates in 2015 was somehow related to his predecessor Eric Holder’s August 2013 directive scaling back federal prosecutions in lower-level drug cases. That policy urged prosecutors to reserve the most serious charges for high-level offenses. Holder directed them to avoid unnecessarily harsh mandatory minimum sentences for defendants whose conduct involved no actual or threatened violence, and who had no leadership role in criminal enterprises or gangs, no substantial ties to drug trafficking organizations and no significant criminal history. (Mandatory minimums can lead to draconian sentences, as in the case of Ramona Brant, a first-time offender sentenced to life imprisonment for her part in distributing drugs at the direction of an abusive boyfriend). Individuals who met the stringent criteria of Holder’s policy would still be prosecuted, but they would be spared overly long mandatory minimums. Sessions offers no evidence that this policy caused the recent spikes in violent crime or drug overdoses. There are three reasons to doubt that there is any significant connection between the two. <br> First, federal prosecutors handle fewer than 10 percent of all criminal cases, so a modest change in their charging policy with respect to a subset of drug cases is unlikely to have a nationwide impact on crime. The other 90 percent of criminal prosecution is conducted by state prosecutors, who were not affected by Holder’s policy. <br> Second, the few individuals who benefited from Holder’s policy by definition lacked a sustained history of crime or violence or any connections to major drug traffickers. <br> Third, the increases in violent crime that Sessions cites are not nationally uniform, which one would expect if they were attributable to federal policy. In 2015, murder rates rose in Chicago, Cleveland and Baltimore, to be sure. But they declined in Boston and El Paso, and stayed relatively steady in New York, Las Vegas, Detroit and Atlanta. If federal drug policy were responsible for the changes, we would not see such dramatic variances from city to city. <br> Nor is there any evidence that increases in drug overdoses have anything to do with shorter sentences for a small subset of nonviolent drug offenders in federal courts. Again, the vast majority of drug prosecutions are in state court under state law and are unaffected by the attorney general’s policies. And the rise in drug overdoses is a direct result of the opioid and related heroin epidemics, which have been caused principally by increased access to prescription painkillers from doctors and pill mills. That tragic development calls for treatment of addicts and closer regulation of doctors, not mandatory minimums imposed on street-level drug sellers, who are easily replaced in communities that have few lawful job opportunities. <br> Most disturbing, Sessions seems to have no concern for the fact that the United States leads the world in incarceration; that its prison population is disproportionately black, Hispanic and poor; or that incarceration inflicts deep and long-lasting costs on the very communities most vulnerable to crime in the first place. As of 2001, 1 of every 3 black male babies born that year could expect to be imprisoned in his lifetime, and while racial disparities have been modestly reduced since then, African Americans are still a disproportionate share of the prison population. Mass incarceration has disrupted families, created even greater barriers to employment and increased the likelihood that the next generation of children will themselves be incarcerated. Advocates as diverse as the Koch brothers and George Soros, the Center for American Progress and Americans for Tax Reform, the American Civil Liberties Union and Right on Crime agree that we need to scale back the harshness of our criminal justice system. <br> Rather than expanding the drug war, Sessions would be smarter to examine local conditions that influence crime and violence, including policing strategies, availability of guns, community engagement and concentrated poverty. Responding to those underlying problems, and restoring trust through consent decrees that reduce police abuse, hold considerably more promise of producing public safety. Sessions’s revival of the failed policies of the past, by contrast, has little hope of reducing violent crime or drug overdoses. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Jeff Sessions: Being soft on sentencing means more violent crime.

 In his Dec. 18 Business column, “It’s not the economy, stupid, it’s politics,” Steven Pearlstein missed two important things that may help those below the upper end of the income scale. <br> First, the government could encourage individuals to update their skills and businesses to offer apprenticeship positions. Germany has instituted such policies with considerable success. This would help alleviate the structural labor problems in the economy, which cannot be addressed with general monetary or fiscal policy. <br> Second, the federal government could institute revenue-neutral tax reform on a current or static basis. Eliminating tax deductions (except for mortgages and charity) and tilting marginal tax reductions toward those below the upper end of the income scale could spur overall consumption without raising the deficit. <br> However, it is important to address the structural labor problems before undertaking such tax reform. If labor bottlenecks persist with a virtually full- employment economy, spurring consumption could lead to inflation rather than to real economic growth. <br> Lawrence Schwartz, Fairfax 
 I agree with Eugene Robinson’s June 13 op-ed, “Kansas’s shot of economic poison,” which described how damaging the conservative idea of “trickle-down economics” can be for everyone except the very rich. I also agree that the majority of the Republican/Trump base has no idea that jobs and income derive from the federal government and that the economy would crash without it. <br> We could allow the conservatives to shrink the federal government to providing for the common defense and insuring domestic tranquility between the states. Let’s shrink the federal income tax to 10 percent for everyone equally. Let the states tax their citizens and provide for everything else. No more federal grants to Alaska for the “Bridge to Nowhere” or to Maryland for the Purple Line. <br> Living in Maryland, I believe that my governor and legislature would be very fair in keeping the safety net for those who need it, and spend my tax dollars for the benefit of everyone, especially the middle class. States such as New York and California would take care of their people properly, with the voted consent of their citizens. States such as Alabama and Mississippi would find out that they are up the creek without a paddle without federal help. But those people can learn that their votes have consequences. <br> Burt J. Mazia, Rockville 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT has a new secretary, now that the Senate, voting along partisan lines, has confirmed Steve Mnuchin, albeit 18 days later than it voted yes on Timothy F. Geithner in 2009 — the last time a first-term president’s choice was under consideration. Mr. Mnuchin’s relatively tardy installation reflects Democratic resistance to all of President Trump’s choices, but in this case that resistance cannot be dismissed as pure partisanship. There were genuine concerns surrounding Mr. Mnuchin’s nomination, including his lack of public-sector experience and his belated disclosure to senators of some $100 million in personal wealth. Democrats were not wrong to ask whether Treasury is the best fit for a career financier who made a fortune engineering a controversial federally backed bailout of the failed IndyMac bank during the height of the foreclosure crisis. <br> To be sure, Mr. Mnuchin’s testimony at his confirmation hearing revealed him to be not only an expert on finance, but also well-versed in the federal policy issues, especially those involving housing, over which he will share responsibility. His challenge nevertheless will be to show that he can put that expertise and knowledge to work on behalf of the not-so-rich Americans whose interests Mr. Trump promised to protect. With respect to tax reform, likely a major focus of Mr. Mnuchin’s tenure, we’re skeptical. After the election, he said any tax reductions for the rich would be offset by “less deductions,” while there would “be a big tax cut for the middle class.” At his hearing, Mr. Mnuchin added that tax reform won’t add to the deficit. How all of those conditions are to be fulfilled simultaneously in practice, he has never said. That’s a problem, especially because the tax plan Mr. Trump laid out during the campaign bestowed huge cuts on the wealthy and corporate America, charged to the national credit card. <br> We’re somewhat more hopeful that Mr. Mnuchin might be able to work with Congress on a permanent fix to the housing finance system, still dominated by the unsustainably semi-nationalized giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The good news is that both houses of Congress and the Treasury Department under Mr. Geithner thoroughly reviewed the plausible options for a new system that — unlike the old one — does not encourage excessive private-sector risk-taking, with taxpayers on the hook for losses. There is thus no need for Mr. Mnuchin to reinvent the wheel; rather, what’s called for is the orchestration of consensus on the Hill, and between the executive and legislative branches, possibly along the same bipartisan lines that almost produced a bill in 2014. <br> Undoubtedly, the political environment is even more toxic now, but if there’s any issue on which the parties should be able to put their differences aside, rebooting this vital sector — there’s real estate in every congressional district! — would seem to be it. Being a part of the solution would be a worthy top priority for the Mnuchin Treasury Department. Indeed, we can’t think of a better way for the new secretary to prove he’s serious about putting his financial smarts to work in the public interest. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s pick for treasury secretary has his pluses, and his minuses <br> Ruth Marcus: Can Trump’s Cabinet save him from himself? <br> Jennifer Rubin: Why Rick Perry does better than Steven Mnuchin <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The Feb. 9 article “GOP statesmen propose replacing Obama climate policies with carbon tax” failed to remind readers of a compelling reason — highly relevant to the current debate over tax reform — that a carbon tax is the most workable approach to addressing carbon emissions. Any regime we adopt must have a means to impose our “carbon price” on imports. If not, we can expect major producers of climate gases (e.g., steel furnaces) to be replaced by plants in low-carbon-cost countries (long known as “leakage”). <br> A carbon tax is considered by many experts to be slam-dunk legal as a classic “indirect tax” for which border adjustment is allowed under international law. It is the best means by which carbon emissions can be curtailed here without sending our key industrial production there.  <br> Thomas M. Sneeringer, Washington <br> The writer is the president of the Committee to Support U.S. Trade Laws. <br> The Feb. 9 news article on a proposed carbon tax made me look twice. First, to make sure “GOP” did not refer to the current administration. Then I came to the part about giving each family a $2,000 dividend from the proposed carbon tax! Who couldn’t use $2,000? Wait. Wasn’t the tax supposed to go into developing alternative energy sources that would reduce carbon emissions? Thus the “dividend” would have little or no effect on air pollution. <br> I guess it’s a choice between being wealthy or healthy. As someone once said, “Aye, there’s the rub.” <br> Terry C. Smith, Arnold 
 Monday was the first anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando that left 49 dead. Saturday will be the second anniversary of the church shooting in Charleston, S.C., where nine were murdered at Bible study. <br> In between these two somber remembrances, House Republicans will be commemorating the occasion in their own way: They will begin work relaxing restrictions on firearm silencers — thereby making it easier for shooters to shoot without being noticed. <br> To this injury, the legislators add insult with the bill’s name: a provision of the “Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act” called the “Hearing Protection Act” — as if it were subsidizing earplugs. That’s like calling legislation that expands the availability of machine guns the “Carpal Tunnel Protection Act” because it spares would-be shooters the repetitive motion of trigger pulling. <br> With all the hullabaloo over Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Russia scandal and President Trump’s latest tweets, few are likely to notice when the bill gets a hearing Wednesday before a House natural resources subcommittee. And that’s the point. Trump, as candidate and president, has been a weapon of mass distraction. <br> Admittedly, nobody would wish on himself the kind of distractions Trump has been generating lately. The inquiries into his and his aides’ Russia ties and his firing of FBI Director James B. Comey could ultimately end his presidency. But though these are consequential and necessary matters — and though there’s no way to avoid attention going to the many other bizarre happenings in Trump world, such as the televised hosannas showered on him at Monday’s Cabinet meeting — these inevitably distract from serious matters that, in any normal time, would dominate headlines. <br> As the Comey craze and Sessions obsession entertain the nation, Senate Republican leaders have used the diversion to advance Trumpcare legislation in the shadows. <br> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) invoked “Rule XIV,” a procedure that allows legislation to skip committees and go directly to the floor. McConnell is hoping to rush the health-care bill to a vote before the July 4 recess, and GOP senators working on the Senate legislation aren’t even sharing the specifics with their Republican colleagues. <br> The news outlet Axios this week reported that Senate Republicans don’t plan to divulge the details of their legislation publicly. “We aren’t stupid,” one senior GOP aide told Axios. No, they aren’t. And their subterfuge is working. Unnoticed by most, Senate Republicans believe they have cobbled together the 50 votes necessary to repeal Obamacare. <br> On the very day that Comey testified before the Senate, the House passed legislation largely repealing the Dodd-Frank financial reforms implemented after the 2008 crash. The bill would, among other things, remove the requirement that retirement advisers put their customers’ interests before their own. The House on Tuesday afternoon took up another controversial matter under cover of the Sessions distraction: As the attorney general testified in the Senate, the House voted along party lines to require a Social Security number for people to get Obamacare benefits. It is meant to block illegal immigrants from accessing health-care benefits. Opponents say it would also deny medical care for many newborn babies who are citizens. <br> The Comey contretemps has also obscured splits between mainstream and conservative Republicans that have made a budget resolution unlikely. House Republicans are moving on with appropriations legislation for 2018 without a budget. This split could jeopardize tax reform and increase the likelihood of a government shutdown or default later this year. <br> It’s difficult to focus on budget nuances, though, when Trump has turned the White House into a circus. In addition to the Comey and Sessions performances, there is also the clown show: At this week’s Cabinet meeting, nearly all of Trump’s Cabinet members offered praise for their boss. There were, in all, 46 occurrences of “thank you,” 32 of “great,” 15 of “honor” and seven of “privilege” as they extolled Trump and his virtues: “Just the greatest privilege of my life. . . . My hat’s off to you. . . . What an incredible honor . . . I can’t thank you enough for the privileges you’ve given me. . . . Thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda.” <br> As we gape in astonishment at a president receiving tributes from his coterie — like a strongman from his junta — Americans might find it difficult to concentrate on an equally astonishing thing happening this week: that House “hearing protection” bill, which would end nearly a century of strict regulation of silencers and thwart the new gunfire-detection technology cities use to fight crime. <br> It’s no small irony that those trying to make silencers more available are relying on noise — the din of Trump’s antics and the clatter of the Russia probes — so that most Americans don’t hear what’s happening until it’s too late. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Andy Slavitt: The Senate’s three tools on health care: Sabotage, speed and secrecy <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: The GOP is working stealthily to shred health and financial protections for ordinary Americans <br> The Post’s View: Congress should turn a deaf ear to the NRA’s campaign against silencers <br> Alexandra Petri: ‘I love you more, Mr. President’: A Cabinet competition <br> George F.

 Gary Abernathy is publisher and editor of the (Hillsboro, Ohio) Times-Gazette, a Civitas Media newspaper. <br> HILLSBORO, Ohio <br> As publisher and editor of the Times-Gazette, a small daily newspaper in this southwest Ohio town (pop. 6,600), I thought our endorsement of Donald Trump for president last year seemed innocuous enough. Then someone said to me, “Did you see that Rachel Maddow mentioned the Times-Gazette last night?” <br> Seriously? <br> Next Politico called. I soon discovered that our two-sentence endorsement was being reported — and often ridiculed — far and wide. The nearby Cincinnati Enquirer produced a post headlined “This Ohio paper is one of only six to endorse Donald Trump.” Not one of six in Ohio — one of six in the entire nation. <br> Hillsboro is the seat of Highland County, which has voted for the Republican candidate for president for decades but was particularly enthusiastic about Trump. He ended up winning 75 percent of the vote here, compared with 64 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012. <br> Interestingly, the conservatives I speak with do not really consider Trump one of them. Rank-and-file Republicans tend to view Trump more as an independent who ran under the Republican banner. <br> But for the most part they’re still with him. They appreciate Trump’s “America first” agenda, not because they believe in isolationism, but because they believe the United States and its citizens should be the government’s top priority. <br> The president’s tweets can be as annoying to his supporters as to his opponents, and if there is a common criticism, it is that he should tweet less. But his inability so far to overhaul health care, enact tax reform, destroy the Islamic State or “drain the swamp” is largely blamed on overreaching courts and the open “resistance” that appears dedicated to opposing anything Trump wants. <br> What Trump’s supporters also appreciate about him are the very attributes for which he is relentlessly criticized in the media. People here — a farming community supplemented by modest-paying retail jobs and a few factory opportunities — are frank and plain-spoken. They’re weary of politicians whose every statement seems carefully crafted to say nothing and offend no one. <br> I understand that. Years ago, I took a break from journalism to work in politics. I know what candidates and politicians are supposed to say and how they are supposed to say it. I sometimes find myself cringing at things Trump says, wishing he would behave more like a typical politician. But then I remind myself that if he did, he would likely lose the support of the grass-roots movement that put him where he is. <br> The negativity that permeates Trump coverage is a frequent subject of conversation here. Matters that are not frequently discussed: James B. Comey, tax returns, the Paris climate accord and the Russians. Instead, we talk about the heroin overdose epidemic ravaging our community. <br> Yes, Hillsboro is a rural setting with a majority-white population. But that doesn’t equate to its citizens or its Trump supporters being racist, homophobic or Islamaphobic. <br> Last weekend I covered the opening of an exhibit at our historical society that pays tribute to a school desegregation saga that unfolded here in the 1950s; the event honored surviving members of the African American community who lived through a chapter in local history too long ignored. A big crowd, white and black, was on hand. Steps toward racial harmony happen even in Trump country. <br> While Trump carried Highland County heavily, there are people here who did not vote for him and who do not care for him. But overall, despite the avalanche of negative news stories, Trump’s support remains firm. Hillsboro’s mayor mentioned recently that he has noticed Trump yard signs popping up again, either in a show of support or a sign of defiance. <br> I’m an editor who happens to be a conservative on most issues. But I’m not a conservative editor. I strive to practice and teach solid, unbiased reporting regardless of what we are covering, doing our best to demonstrate respect, accuracy and fairness to all sides. Our political leanings are reserved for the opinion page. I wish more of my liberal colleagues would acquit themselves similarly. <br> I’m still astounded that our brief endorsement of Trump garnered such attention. In the end, Trump won the state by a solid eight-point margin. Consider the fact that Trump won the popular vote in 30 states, but in most of those states not a single newspaper endorsed him. Could there be better evidence of the gulf that exists between what is called the “mainstream media” and millions of Americans? <br> After the election, some news media leaders pledged to reexamine their approach. If they are even slightly successful in retooling political coverage, perhaps by 2020 a small southern Ohio newspaper’s endorsement of a major-party candidate for president won’t qualify as national news, no matter which candidate it chooses. <br> Read more: <br> Daniel Lee: What the other Washington thinks of President Trump <br> Erik Wemple: Dear Mainstream Media: Why so liberal? <br> Garrison Keillor: Trump voters — it’s not me, it’s you <br> Richard Cohen: ‘Real America’ is its own bubble <br> Michael Gerson: How to pop the political bubbles keeping Americans apart <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Hugh Hewitt was right on target in his May 31 op-ed, “Trump should raise this tax,” about boosting the federal gas tax to address our nation’s crumbling roads and bridges. The federal gas tax of 18.4 cents a gallon has not been increased in 24 years. Imagine living today on the same salary you made in 1993. That’s the dire situation facing our infrastructure: We’re supporting our roads and bridges using outdated budgets that fail to meet the demands of 2017. <br> On this important issue, Congress must look to the 22 states that have raised their gas taxes since 2013. States leading the way are “red” states such as Wyoming, Georgia and Idaho and “blue” states such as California, Maryland and Vermont. The list also includes New Jersey, with a Republican governor and Democratic-controlled legislature. Infrastructure is a bipartisan issue. It’s time our federal government takes the action for which Republicans and Democrats have been tirelessly advocating. <br> Over the years, gridlock and finger-pointing have prevented real action on addressing our infrastructure challenges. All the while, traffic congestion has worsened, potholes have multiplied, and our roads and bridges have further deteriorated. <br> Governing is about making the tough decisions. It’s time for Washington to step up to the plate. <br> Ray LaHood, Washington <br> The writer, a former U.S. transportation secretary, is co-chair of Building America’s Future. <br> Hugh Hewitt argued for a hefty increase in the gas tax, perhaps 50 cents per gallon, and using the funds for infrastructure investments, increased defense spending and tax reform. He argued that President Trump could “sell a gas tax that does these things because it makes sense.” I agree that a hefty gas tax makes sense, but it would be a lot easier to sell the idea if the tax were used for its original purpose: transportation-infrastructure improvements. The only deviation from this purpose should be to make the tax hike sufficient to also significantly subsidize public transportation. Even drivers who would never use public transportation might support such a move if it resulted in fewer cars on our congested roads.  <br> Robert F. Benson, Silver Spring 
 Elections produce winners and losers. There are no bonus points for participation. Democrats have been frustrated by losses in high-profile congressional races — Rob Quist bested by Greg Gianforte in Montana and James Thompson falling short to Ron Estes in deep-red Kansas. In both elections, the Democratic nominees outperformed previous Democratic showings but came up short. In the nationally publicized special election in Georgia to fill the seat of Republican Tom Price, the Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, is still locked in a dead heat. This leads pundits and many Democrats to wonder: Is the “resistance” to President Trump a dud at the polling booth? <br> Before the garment-rending and hand-wringing go too far, Democrats and pundits would do well to focus their eyes a little lower on the ballot. In special elections for state and local offices, progressive insurgents aren’t just coming close — they are winning and sending a message to the establishment of both parties. <br> In the 9th state assembly district of Long Island, Christine Pellegrino — a schoolteacher, union activist, Bernie Sanders delegate and Working Families Party Democrat — dispatched her Republican opponent by a stunning 58 percent to 42 percent. As Newsday reported, this is usually a district where Democrats hardly compete. Trump swamped Hillary Clinton here by 23 percentage points. The veteran Republican state legislator who held the seat was reelected by a 37-point margin over a Democratic challenger. But when he stepped down, Pellegrino — a first-time candidate — swept to victory. <br> In New Hampshire, Edith DesMarais pulled a similar upset in a state legislative race. “Republicans should absolutely be concerned,” William F.B. O’Reilly, a Republican partner in the November Team, a political consulting firm, told the New York Times. “Two Republican canaries died in the coal mine yesterday.” <br> Progressive candidates are rising in Democratic primaries in Democratic areas as well. In the primary for Philadelphia district attorney, civil rights attorney Larry Krasner, who has defended Occupy Philadelphia and Black Lives Matter protesters, won on a platform calling for an end to mass incarceration, police reform and more. Supported by Sanders and a range of progressive groups, his candidacy was also bolstered by the money of George Soros. “This changes the game across the country,” William Cobb of the American Civil Liberties Union told Philadelphia Magazine. <br> In the Democratic primary for mayor in Jackson, Miss., victory went to Chokwe Antar Lumumba, running on a bold program calling for a “people’s administration” that would feature police reform and a locally grounded, cooperative strategy for economic development. Lumumba marched in solidarity with black auto-plant workers at the March on Mississippi with Sanders and the UAW and helped to found the Mississippi Human Rights Collective that led efforts to remove the Confederate insignia from the state’s flag. His victory was one of many for progressives in Democratic primaries. <br> Clearly the populist energy generated by the Sanders campaign and the Trump resistance has electoral power. Democrats — particularly the so-called Obama Coalition — have been notorious no-shows in by-elections and special elections. Now they are turning out in larger numbers, while Republican turnout is at question. As Republican consultant O’Reilly put it: “Special elections are a great measure of voter intensity. These are low-turnout affairs where the most motivated voters turn out. Trump voters and other Republicans simply didn’t show up, and voters from the left did.” In the high-visibility races with national attention, Republican and Democratic money floods in, turning the elections into high-stakes showdowns. Special elections outside that spotlight may well be a more accurate gauge of voter intensity. <br> Also notable in these victories is the growing infrastructure of progressive groups engaged in supporting transformative candidates. Our Revolution, an offshoot of the Sanders campaign, isn’t alone in the field. Working Families Party, MoveOn.org and many other groups all raise money, volunteers and attention for progressive champions. <br> These candidates are not your standard Democrats. Like Sanders, they are campaigning for bold change. They pledge an end to corruption. They support aggressive public action for working people — $15 minimum wage, investment in infrastructure, renewal of public education and making public college tuition free. This is now increasingly reflected at the national level as well, with Democratic legislators coming out for a $15 minimum wage, a major infrastructure jobs agenda and progressive tax reform. <br> To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the insurgency’s death are premature. In reality, it has just begun to build. Activists continue to flood Republican town meetings. GOP health-care and budget plans generate ever-greater opposition. Democrats’ victories at the state and local level may well augur what is yet to come. <br> Democrats start from a very deep hole, having lost more than 900 state legislative seats over the past eight years, leaving Republicans in complete control of 23 states. With Trump in the White House and the right dominating Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, capital-D and small-d democrats have every reason to despair. The Democratic Party apparatus still seems hidebound and timid. But the resistance is real. And the demand for fundamental change sparked by the Sanders insurgency is still building inside and outside the Democratic Party. Republicans are entrenched, backed by big money and a sophisticated right-wing infrastructure. But progressives are mobilized and just may be turning from protest to power. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 This morning, as I watch Donald Trump standing on the steps of the Capitol taking the oath of office as the next president of the United States, one thought will be going through my mind: <br> There, but for the grace of God, goes Hillary Rodham Clinton. <br> Yes, there are many reasons to be wary of President Trump. But there are also many reasons for conservatives to be hopeful. <br> First and foremost is that Trump will restore the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Had Clinton been the one to fill the seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia, she would have shifted the court leftward for a generation — with disastrous consequences for human life, religious liberty, the Second Amendment and limited government. Instead, Trump will replace Scalia, and Democrats are powerless to stop him. Should Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) follow through on his threat to stonewall Trump’s pick, Republicans can simply follow the precedent that Democrats set in 2013, when they changed Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for lifetime judicial appointments to the federal circuit courts.  <br> Second, Trump has picked perhaps the most conservative Cabinet of any president in modern history — from Tom Price at Health and Human Services to Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency, Jeff Sessions at Justice and Betsy DeVos at Education. Because Democrats eliminated the filibuster for most presidential nominations, Republicans don’t need Democratic votes to confirm Trump’s appointments. If the axiom that “staff is policy” is true, this will be a deeply conservative administration. <br> Third, Trump is an outsider who intends to break the mold of governance in Washington. He is not here to make incremental changes. He plans to go big. That holds both promise and peril. If he goes big in the wrong direction (isolationism, protectionism), the results could be disastrous. But Trump has promised to go big on a lot of important conservative priorities. Liberals had better hold on tight. <br> Look for Trump to usher in a golden age of conservative education reform. Millions of children trapped in failing public schools will soon get the chance to attend private, charter, magnet, religious or home schools of their parents’ choice. Choice will make traditional public schools better, too, as they are forced to reform to attract students. States will be free to innovate, as Trump dramatically expands their ability to use federal K-12 funds without federal pressure or coercion. The prospects for change and innovation in education have never been brighter. <br> Trump will roll back the wet blanket of regulations smothering our economy. President Obama set a land speed record for major regulations (“major” defined as costing the economy at least $100 million a year ), imposing more than 600 since taking office. Trump will begin paring back regulations on Day One and halt the regulatory machine that is stifling entrepreneurship and job creation in America. <br> On tax reform, Trump will not simply tinker with rates, but also will seek to fundamentally transform the tax code, making it simpler for families and individuals, and finally giving U.S. businesses globally competitive rates. That will happen either with bipartisan cooperation, which is more lasting and preferable, or through the budget reconciliation process, which can be done with just the Republican majority. But either way, fundamental tax reform is coming. <br> Trump will unleash a new age of energy exploration that will put the United States on a path toward energy independence. Obama’s restrictions on responsible offshore exploration will be reversed, and his war on coal will end. Some $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil and natural gas reserves — according to Trump — plus hundreds of years in coal reserves, will finally be tapped. Jobs will be created, and the United States will dramatically reduce its dependence on energy from regimes hostile to U.S. interests. <br> I predict Trump will surprise many and become a champion of policies that help the poor and vulnerable. He got no credit for it, but Trump spoke more about fighting poverty than any Republican presidential candidate in recent memory, even promising that “at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African American vote. . . . Because I will produce.” If he wants to produce for struggling Americans, conservatives have developed a robust agenda of innovative proposals for reducing poverty and dependency that he can tap into.    <br> On national defense, Obama’s defense cuts have left the country effectively a “one war” power. Trump has promised to increase the size of our Army, Navy and Air Force, strengthening and expanding our nuclear deterrent and building ballistic missile defenses. Trump will also unleash the U.S. military to win the fight against the Islamic State, paring back the restrictive rules of engagement Obama imposed. And the United States will begin capturing and interrogating terrorists again, instead of vaporizing them all with drones.  <br> None of this would be remotely possible if it were Hillary Clinton taking the oath of office today.  So yes, Donald Trump is less than perfect. If he tries to take the country in the wrong direction, he should be challenged. But if he fulfills even a fraction of these promises, he would be what Obama hoped to be: a transformational president. <br> That’s why today is a day of hope. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Josh Rogin: Trump could cause ‘the death of think tanks as we know them’ <br> E.J.

 On Sept. 7, 2016, Donald Trump made a specific promise to an audience at the Philadelphia shipyards: “to build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines.” On March 2, Trump, now president, added to the specificity of that pledge by promising to increase the number of aircraft carriers to 12. The White House budget unveiled Monday breaks both of these promises. It’s a big deal to walk on this pledge, which is why, if the president does not correct his error, Congress should reject the budget and substitute its own plan. <br> A 350-ship fleet is key for both national security and international stability. China is rapidly growing its navy to fill the gaps left by Obama-era cutbacks to the current level of 274 ships. Reversing those cuts is crucial to preserving American supremacy at sea and supporting allies around the world. And Navy shipbuilding also can be a great jobs program: real jobs in real shipyards producing real ships to meet real threats.  <br> The president’s budget has forgotten these benefits. Breaking Defense’s Sydney J. Freedberg Jr. summed up the details: “Despite his campaign pledge of a 350-ship fleet, President Trump’s first budget cuts Navy shipbuilding and aircraft procurement below what was enacted in 2017, documents released [Monday] reveal. Despite Trump’s criticism of President Obama’s defense plans, this budget sticks with Obama’s shipbuilding plan for 2018: eight ships. And it actually buys eight fewer aircraft than Obama planned.” <br> The budget includes a few excuses for Trump breaking his pledge: The Pentagon has to do a strategic assessment first, and readiness funds were more critical. It’s true that the readiness funding was needed, as were the missile defense funding and personnel expenditures, but these explanations still barely reach fig-leaf status. <br> But Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney was always a skeptic on defense spending, and now he’s undercut the president’s crucial promises. With this budget there is no way to get the 350 ships the president promised by 2024, and it is very unlikely that a 12th carrier — if it remains authorized and is fully funded — will be in the fleet by 2027, long after the president leaves office even if he wins a second term. <br> There are plenty of superb plans on how to reach 350 ships by 2024, including one laid out in April by Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain, and Robert C. O’Brien, a foreign policy adviser to multiple GOP candidates and a once and perhaps future candidate for Navy secretary. Both are friends and O’Brien a law partner of mine, but what matters most are the details proving that getting to 350 can be done — and done quickly. <br> Of course, neither the president nor the Navy needs to buy into the Hendrix-O’Brien plan, but a presidential promise needs a presidential plan, one Trump has reviewed and initialed, with the mix of ships specified, shipyards identified and construction schedules detailed. The president is above all a developer; developers understand critical paths and why every successful project depends on one. There is currently no plan for reaching 350 ships, eight months after Trump made that promise.  <br> There isn’t a new secretary of the Navy either, which is perhaps one of the reasons the Navy got rolled in both the omnibus spending bill that kept the government going and the 2018 budget sent to Congress. The Navy needs a cheerleader. It needs another John Lehman, who helped make President Ronald Reagan’s goal of a 600-ship Navy a reality. And if Trump needed any incentive beside national security and his commitment to keeping campaign promises, he should realize that Teddy Roosevelt and Reagan are both known for the navies they built.  <br> This budget betrays both the promise and the reality of a rebuilt fleet. And for what? And against what background? No political or policy goals are advanced by this skulduggery, and  much is damaged thereby. Trump made six core promises in the campaign: A Supreme Court nominee in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia (check), a border wall (on hold), repeal and replacement of Obamacare and tax reform (in progress), an infrastructure program and a 350-ship Navy (both abandoned by this budget). Many if not most of the “reluctant Trump” voters came home to him because of these promises. To break any one of them is taking a grave risk. <br> Further, to “provide for the common defense” is one of the very few specific purposes laid out in the Constitution’s preamble. This budget breaks the president’s commitment to do that in full, a breach from which recovery of credibility of defense spending promises will be difficult to recover. <br> When the president returns from his very successful trip abroad, he needs to nominate a Navy secretary and send Congress an addendum to his budget, one with a plan to keep his promises, and the funding to make that plan a reality. If he doesn’t, then the House and the Senate will have to save the president from his own OMB director and fund the 350-ship fleet the country needs. <br> Read more here: <br> Catherine Rampell: The dumbest part of Trump’s dumb tax plan <br> The Post’s View: The Trump administration’s magical thinking on taxes would bust the budget <br> The Post’s View: The reckless return to deficit spending <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 So much for the notion that the second 100 days would be calmer or more reassuring. <br> As April drew to a close, and with it the artificial marker of the first 100 days of the Trump presidency, it was possible to conjure a relatively comforting scenario: It could have been worse. <br> After all, President Trump launched his administration with the dangerous duo of Michael Flynn as national security adviser and Stephen K. Bannon ascendant. The 100-day period ended with Flynn fired, Bannon diminished and the new national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, joining forces with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to provide a protective buffer against presidential impulsiveness. <br> Meantime, notwithstanding atrocities such as the immigration orders and the House health-care plan, Trump backed away from some of his most jarring and irresponsible campaign-trail promises and rhetoric, from declaring NATO “obsolete” to labeling China a currency manipulator to moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. <br> A 70-year-old man does not change his character or basic approach. Still, the immense responsibility of the presidency molds its inhabitant. Thus, it was possible to detect some glimmers of maturation and even learning. Health care turned out to be more complicated than anyone knew. Heartbreaking photos of dead Syrian children killed by chemical weapons managed to evoke previously unseen empathy. <br> Not that the first 100 days had been even in the exurbs of normal, with the inaugural invocation of “American carnage”; the flood of ego-boosting untruths, from the inflated crowd size to the purportedly fraudulent popular vote; and the reflexive assault on enemies, including a “so-called judge” and the Obama administration for its supposed wiretapping plot. <br> Still, in resolutely optimistic moments, you could imagine a White House whose learning curve would continue an upward climb, however gradual and episodic, in which the New York moderates — Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, et al. — would elbow aside the America Firsters. <br> No longer. <br> True, the institutions of U.S. government and society have proved relatively robust. The courts and the media have risen to the constitutional occasion; Congress not so much, and intramural GOP dysfunction has so far prevented the worst from being legislated. <br> But Trump himself is turning out to be the full-fledged disaster of our worst fears. He understands nothing and is uninterested in learning anything — not just the dreary substance of things such as tax reform but constitutional values, governing norms and the United States’ unique role in the world. <br> He sees things only through the distorting prism of an all-consuming ego. There is only one Trump instinct — “fight, fight, fight,” he said at the Coast Guard Academy — and one Trumpian dichotomy: friend or foe. He is impervious to embarrassment, no matter how blatant his falsehood. The stain of his behavior spreads to taint anyone within range. <br> The past few weeks have presented an alarming parade of proof. Authoritarianism? Trump summarily fired his FBI director over “this Russia thing” — after, according to reports, James B. Comey resisted Trump’s demand that he pledge loyalty and declined Trump’s importunings to drop the Flynn probe. <br> Trump met unapologetically with yet another dictatorial thug, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and remained shamefully silent as Erdogan’s security goons beat up protesters on U.S. soil. No surprise there, from the candidate who urged his crowds to “knock the crap out of” protesters and as president reportedly pressed Comey to jail reporters for obtaining leaks. <br> Overweening egotism laced with self-pity? Trump used the occasion of the Coast Guard graduation to lament his treatment — “No politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly.” <br> Similarly, in the Trumpiverse, the Russia inquiry and the newly named special counsel represent “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.” In fact, Trump has only himself to blame — Comey’s firing made the appointment inevitable, and the episode demonstrates the justice system working to allay public fears of political interference. <br> Dangerous ignorance and lack of preparedness for his post? Without evident forethought, heedless of consideration of the consequences, classically boastful, Trump blurted out code-word information about the Islamic State to the Russians at his Oval Office yuk-fest — and, according to the New York Times, derided Comey as a “nut job” whose firing relieved “great pressure” on him. <br> The national security and diplomatic establishment shudders at the thought of this man at loose abroad. <br> It is impossible to know how this disastrous episode in our history will conclude, or how grave the damage will be. But an adage from conservative economist Herb Stein comes to mind: If something cannot go on forever, it will stop. This situation does not feel sustainable for a full four years. <br> Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Eugene Robinson: Trump thinks he’s under attack.

 We’re all playing a guessing game. During the campaign, Donald Trump made many promises. But whether friend or foe, we don’t know what he will actually do. The result is a deluge of predictions from politicians, pundits, think tanks, lobbyists, economists and others. Here, for example, is the outlook of economists at Nomura Securities. <br> Conceding enormous “uncertainty,” the economists predict that large tax cuts, costing $3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, will be the centerpiece of Trump’s economic program. Coupled with the tax cuts would be $500 billion in added spending, mostly for infrastructure and defense. These amounts enlarge budget deficits, already estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be $8.6 trillion over the decade. <br> The Republican Congress is expected to repeal the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), but the timing and the availability of a replacement are unknown and, possibly, unsettled. Similarly, the economists anticipate “significant regulatory changes” — cutbacks — and more deportations of illegal immigrants. Again, details are unknown and perhaps nonexistent. Trade policy is the same; there have been unconfirmed reports that Trump will slap a temporary 5 percent to 10 percent tariff on all imports. <br> What’s the effect on the economy? Less than you might expect, say the Nomura economists. The tax cuts and regulatory cutbacks are assumed to increase economic growth initially (beginning in late summer), but then contradictory forces erode the effect. Faster economic growth and fear of more inflation cause long-term interest rates to rise; slower immigration puts upward pressure on wages. The Federal Reserve, also fearful of inflation, tightens credit by raising short-term interest rates. <br> “We expect the Fed will raise rates twice in 2017 and three times in 2018,” say the economists. (In December, the Fed raised short-term interest rates to a range from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. If future increases were the same amount, then the Fed funds rate would reach 1.75 percent to 2 percent sometime in 2018. From late 2008 to December 2015, it had been close to zero.) <br> Put all this together, and the economy’s growth — according to Nomura’s projections — doesn’t change much. Bigger deficits spur growth; higher interest rates restrain it. Gross domestic product is expected to grow 1.9 percent in 2017 and 1.8 percent in 2018. Since 2010, GDP growth has been roughly 2 percent a year. <br> The Nomura economists are skeptical of the claim, made by some Trump nominees, that lower taxes and fewer regulations can raise annual economic growth to a range of 3 percent to 4 percent. If this happened, federal budget deficits would be lower than expected, because a stronger economy would produce more tax revenue. <br> But, say the economists, lower tax rates and deregulation were tried in the 1980s. Airlines, interstate trucking, railroads and some energy markets were deregulated; the Tax Reform Act of 1986 cut tax rates sharply. “There is little evidence that deregulation and tax reform increased productivity during this period,” write the Nomura economists. <br> All this is informative — up to a point. It reflects what standard economic models produce when they’re fed plausible assumptions about Trump’s policies. But it’s possible that the full range of Trump’s proposals will combine to change how the economy operates in ways that, for good or ill, defy the assumptions in existing models. <br> Since World War II, the United States has had a “mixed economy,” with power shared between markets and government policy. In general, the drift has been toward more government. Moreover, for most of this period, the United States has been an “open” economy, emphasizing free trade and liberal immigration, both legal and illegal. <br> Trump seems to embrace a different model, albeit one awash in inconsistencies. Though he urges less government, he bullies major corporations to locate their plants in the United States, not in Mexico, China or anywhere else abroad. Similarly, he deplores the rising federal debt but has pledged not to touch two of the largest programs — Social Security and Medicare — that contribute to the debt. <br> All these changes collectively may alter the way the economy operates — to repeat, for good or ill. It may become more dynamic and productive; or it might become more protectionist and inflexible, as companies and consumers adapt cautiously to a more uncertain world. In either case, or many in between, the past is not prologue. Not even Trump may really know what comes next. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump is being handed a great economy.

 Perspective Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> I’m often asked if I think President Trump will make it through all four years of his term. <br> My stock reply: The better question is whether we will survive the next four years. <br> It wouldn’t surprise me at all if he does make it to 2020 without impeachment, or the 25th Amendment, blocking his path. Trump has a long history of walking out of disasters unscathed. It’s those around him — the Sean Spicers of the world — who are destroyed. <br> Alas, poor Spicer! I knew him well. <br> He was one of the top Republican flacks in town, affable and quick-witted, always happy to dish with reporters off the record. I liked him. I still like him — or at least that Spicer I knew before he answered Donald Trump’s call. <br> The Spicer who strode into the White House briefing room Monday afternoon I did not recognize. He scanned the room, unsmiling. He furtively checked his watch. He recited a long opening statement carefully and flatly, as if reading from a science textbook. And he had absolutely nothing to say. <br> President Trump’s hint that he taped conversations with Jim Comey? “I was very clear that the president would have nothing further on that last week.” <br> The Russia probe generally? “The president’s position’s been very clear.” <br> And everything else: “I think I’ve made it very clear. . . . He made it very clear. . . . It’s been made very clear. . . . I made it clear. . . . The FBI director and others have made it very clear.” <br> Spicer was studiously dour and clearly wasn’t enjoying himself. He was puffy, pinched and pale. And little wonder: Trump has sucked the lifeblood out of him. <br> The president turned him into a national punchline on his first day on the job, forcing him to provide “alternative facts” about the inauguration. On Friday morning, Trump confirmed for the world what was widely suspected: Spicer doesn’t really know what’s going on. “As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!” Trump proclaimed. <br> The next day, “Saturday Night Live” did its latest sendup of the hapless spokesman. This time Melissa McCarthy’s Spicer hid in the bushes, attacked reporters and rode his motorized podium in search of Trump, vainly seeking assurance that he hadn’t been lied to. Alec Baldwin’s Trump tried to grope and kiss McCarthy’s Spicer. <br> “Is this like ‘The Godfather’ when you kiss me and no one ever sees me again?” the Spicer character asked. <br> “Yes,” the Trump character answered. <br> It’s a matter of time until life imitates sketch. Washington is abuzz with speculation about when Spicer will be shown the door, but it doesn’t really matter. His credibility, and his dignity, have already been defenestrated. <br> He will soon be added to the heap of unhappy people who cast their lots with Trump and were repaid with misery. <br> Trump entities have filed for bankruptcy protection six times. Investors, lenders and workers took hits — and Trump moved on. Trump was caught on tape boasting to Billy Bush about sexually assaulting women — and Billy Bush lost his job. Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort poured themselves into Trump’s campaign and were unceremoniously dumped. <br> The carnage has increased since Trump came to Washington. National security adviser Michael Flynn is out and potentially in legal trouble. The FBI’s Comey arguably handed Trump the election — and learned of his dismissal from TV. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein tarnished his sterling reputation in just two weeks. <br> As my Post colleague Abby Phillip documented, Vice President Pence has been “unflagging in his loyalty,” only to be made “the public face of official narratives that turn out to be misleading or false.” Trump humiliated Steve Bannon by publicly downplaying their association. Trump repaid House Speaker Paul Ryan’s loyalty by winking at calls for Ryan’s ouster. Attempts to defend Trump by aides Reince Priebus and Kellyanne Conway and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have left them sounding clownish. <br> Trump takes what he can from each of his aides and allies and then moves on. It would seem that time is near for Spicer, who started Monday’s briefing 45 minutes late and, in the minutes that followed, avoided answering questions by saying no fewer than 22 times how very “clear” he or Trump had been about this or that. NATO: “Very clear.” Tax reform: “His plan has been pretty clear.” Secret tapes: “The president’s made it clear.” Where there was confusion, Spicer pretended to see clarity, in Afghanistan (“He’ll have an opportunity to make his position very clear”) and Syria (“The president’s always been clear that he’s not going to telegraph actions”). <br> At the end of the lifeless performance by the beleaguered spokesman, what was clear is this: Spicer’s utility to Trump has diminished. And, as many a Trump loyalist has discovered, you are useful to Trump until you are not — and then you are cast aside. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Many of the people I have spoken to in the aftermath of the presidential election describe a deep sense of sadness. In the wake of troubling appointments to the new administration, some have turned to philanthropy as a way to support what the government is likely to defund. They want to help those who are likely to come under attack — or simply to stand up for what they believe in. <br> I propose a related but different solution. If billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett can sign a Giving Pledge and promise to donate more than half their wealth to charity, then let those who are likely to benefit from the incoming administration’s proposed tax cuts — generally speaking, those who need it the least — donate to charitable causes the difference between the taxes they would have paid and those that they will pay if the much-discussed new rates take effect. Let them — let us — pledge the difference. <br> There is good reason to do this. Take, for example, President-elect Donald Trump’s so-called penny plan, which calls for a cut of 1 percent each year on key social welfare (and other) programs to balance out deep tax cuts. This seemingly simple and painless reduction is neither simple nor painless. A penny on the dollar of a program such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children is $65 million; a penny on the dollar of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is $165 million. And that’s just in year one. <br> In my work with the Catalogue for Philanthropy: Greater Washington, every day I see programs that are helping women, children, the elderly, the poor, the homeless — people who would be seriously affected by the proposed cuts. In one neighborhood in the District, a stone’s throw from the White House, average annual income is $9,300 a year, putting these families in the bottom fifth of all earners in the District. (The top 5 percent, who would benefit greatly from the Trump tax cuts, already make 52 times what the bottom 20 percent earn.) <br> Families living in this community will take a direct hit if these cuts go through. Nonprofits such as Horton’s Kids in Ward 8, which provides tutoring, mentoring and educational enrichment to the children of Wellington Park, will face even tougher challenges than they do already. A nonprofit in Montgomery County named A Wider Circle, which provides furniture and employment-training programs for families that lack the most basic needs — mattresses and bureaus and other basic household items that human dignity requires — will deal with an influx of families that have lost assistance. <br> From food to housing to education, from programs for newly arrived immigrants and refugees to arts programs for kids who have so little access to the things that middle- and upper-middle-class families take for granted — all of these will face cuts to their own budgets, increased demand for their services that cuts to other programs will generate or both. <br> Here is my personal pledge: I will donate to charitable causes the difference between the income tax I now pay and the income tax that I would pay under Trump’s proposals. I will pledge the difference. And if others take the pledge, that difference could be significant. These are dollars that could be designated for those most likely to suffer under a new administration: people who are poor, gay, female, undocumented, uninsured. <br> So, those who are able to do so, take this new pledge — a different pledge, one you don’t have to be a billionaire to sign. Pledge to make our country a better place to live for everyone. <br> The writer is founder and president of the Catalogue for Philanthropy: Greater Washington. <br> Read more about this issue: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s proposed tax ‘reform’ is hardly reform at all <br> The Post’s View: The GOP’s radical tax plan <br> Lawrence Summers: On tax reform, take a page from Ronald Reagan <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 With the House’s passage of the American Health Care Act, House Republican leaders have handed their Senate counterparts the biggest legislative weapon they have held in their entire careers. At this point, Senate Republicans should learn from a bit of wisdom often attributed to one of the wittiest and most clear-eyed Founders, Ben Franklin: “We must, indeed, all hang together,” he supposedly told the Continental Congress in 1776, “or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.” If the 52 GOP senators agree to stay together and maneuver through the next month together, they could bring about a huge breakthrough for the country and a rejection of the gridlock that has consumed the Senate for years. <br> The Senate GOP should begin their part of the legislative process with a sort of Republican Hippocratic Oath: “First, do no damage in your statements and press appearances.” Stake out no must-haves, demand no specific changes, stash the posturing at the town halls. Duck all questions on specifics. Smile and say “no comment.” Just stick to a message of “We are working together as a caucus toward a common goal of saving American health care from Obamacare and advancing other critical goals.” Ask Senate leaders to keep you in the loop, but to avoid leaks don’t loop in anyone from your staff. Shut up and sit down, in other words — unnatural acts for senators, I know, but crucial right now. Save us your wisdom until after the deal is done or falls apart. <br> Of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Majority Whip John Cornyn (Tex.) and Republican Conference Chair John Thune (S.D.), the other 49 GOP senators should demand that they bring back from negotiations with Democrats a “majority keeper and majority builder”: a bill or a group of bills that addresses Obamacare’s many deficiencies as well as a reversal of the sequester’s limits on defense spending, a commitment on moving judicial nominees forward, and tax reform. This would both do good for the country and lay the groundwork for expanding the GOP majority in the 2018 midterms. <br> Republicans will need both a carrot and a stick to get Democrats to the table. To keep Democrats from dragging their feet, Republicans can threaten straight-line approval of the AHCA via the reconciliation process, which prohibits filibusters. A pledge from all 52 GOP senators to go that route if necessary is the hammer that should make the Democrats step up to the table to negotiate the numerous problems facing the country and left behind by President Barack Obama. <br> For Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) to sit down and deal with McConnell, though, the Democratic leader needs more than just threats. He needs some genuine wins for his base. There are several options here: tweaks to the new health-care regime, immigration reform that allows the “dreamers” and millions more who haven’t broken any laws since illegally entering the country to stay and work (but not to vote), and of course infrastructure spending. With the last option in particular, there is mutual interest that can mean dollars for every state (and every imperiled Democratic senator standing in 2018). Republicans can score a win by requiring that those dollars be spent by the state and local governments — preferably the local governments — and not by Washington. Loading the agreement with a good bit of spending — with ending the defense sequester as top priority — will make it all go much easier for all concerned. <br> If the 52 Republicans can sign a letter to Schumer threatening speedy approval of the House’s bill absent serious negotiations and an agreed-upon comprehensive “big deal,” then those Republican senators with qualms about the AHCA can get their fixes embedded in the final health-care bill, and those with needs outside of the AHCA can work through the leader to obtain them, and the bill or bills can pass with bipartisan support. What can’t work is 52 Republicans demanding 52 amendments. House Republicans realized the consequences of their earlier failure to stay united on this issue and got most of the Freedom Caucus’s most intractable members back on board to work out a deal. Now the Senate GOP needs to do the same. It has to work together, and through its leadership, or it will be back to the minority despite the very unlevel playing field of the 2018 elections. If the 52 senators stick together now, so much is possible. Don’t blow it, Republicans. <br> Read more: <br> Jennifer Rubin: Did Republicans just score a win on health care — or lose? <br> Stephen Stromberg: Stop singing, Democrats.

 Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, is chair of the New Democrat Coalition in the House. Charlie Dent, a Republican from Pennsylvania, is co-chair of the House’s Tuesday Group. <br> On this 100th day of the Trump administration, partisan prisms will predictably provide audiences with radically different images: One side will paint a picture of a strong and decisive administration “Making America Great Again,” another of a flip-flopping and divisive group of neophytes who aren’t up to the job. <br> As centrist leaders in the House of Representatives leading the New Democrat Coalition and Tuesday Group caucus, and legislators dedicated to the core principles of governing, we’d rather propose a forward-looking vision for the next 100 days. Let’s stop looking in the rearview mirror and focus ahead on the ideas we can all agree would be good for the United States. <br> Nearly every substantial piece of legislation passed since 2011, including the USA Freedom Act, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, disaster relief, Medicare physician payment reform and all of the budget agreements and appropriations legislation that have mostly kept federal government shutdowns at bay, has been the product of coalitions between pragmatic Republicans and Democrats willing to put partisanship aside. <br> [We asked you to describe President Trump’s first 100 days. Here’s what you said.] <br> Now, conditions are right for this formula to become the norm rather than the last resort. The unfolding drama of the long-promised repeal of the Affordable Care Act gave the administration and Congress a bracing lesson in the dramatic difference between campaigning and governing. <br> Most Democrats, while emboldened by grass-roots demonstrations, continue to hope for bipartisan progress and seek cooperation, not just obstructionism, to advance shared interests. But, deep in the minority, they can’t launch successful initiatives on their own. <br> President Trump has consistently offered new tactics to get Democrats to come to the table. None has worked. Maybe he could try the old-fashioned way: Invite those Democrats willing to listen to come help shape legislation that majorities in both parties can support. This approach may not provide red meat for either party’s base, but it will produce lasting legislative achievements to benefit our country for generations to come. <br> So, on this 100th day, let’s dispense with the point-scoring and cut to the chase. As a start, and consistent with the president’s priorities, we have a unique opportunity to make progress on a desperately needed national infrastructure program and an overhaul of our uncompetitive and byzantine tax code. <br> We are prepared to acknowledge that a meaningful infrastructure program will have room for tax incentives and public-private partnerships and could include innovations such as a national infrastructure bank, but it will certainly require new sources of funding for direct investment in highways, railways and airports. We know that successful tax reform will be challenging, as the deductions, exclusions and credits that pack the tax code like chocolates in a box are shrunk or eliminated in favor of lower rates. <br> [President Trump’s first 100 days: In his words and ours] <br> Success on those two issues could open the door to working on solutions to a number of issues, such as job-training and skills-development programs to help displaced workers, initiatives to streamline and right-size regulation, and maybe even a more honest and constructive look at our budget and its deficits. That’s where our focus should be now. <br> Compromise may not be glamorous and may not play well on cable television, but it is an absolutely necessary component of successful legislation. Ideological purity is a recipe for continued bitterness, a divided nation and stalemate. We know that these common -sense, nonpartisan initiatives will summon Americans to do what they do best: Rise to the challenge of innovation, creativity, fairness and service. Failure to seek commonality or accept incremental progress will threaten more than our congressional seats and reputations. It puts our systems of government at risk. We owe it to our country to do better. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s first 100 days were alarming — and relieving <br> Hugh Hewitt: Trump’s first 100 days give conservatives a lot to celebrate <br> Charles Koch: Trump’s policies must not benefit only big businesses like mine <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Francis Fukuyama is a senior fellow at Stanford University and Mosbacher Director of Stanford’s Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law. <br> President Trump’s election provoked extraordinary fears that he would become an American strongman in the mold of authoritarian leaders he admires such as Vladimir Putin of Russia or Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Unlike those countries, however, the United States has a very robust set of institutional checks and balances that are supposed to prevent any one individual from acquiring excessive power. The empirical question, then, is whether that system would successfully contain a president who displayed little respect for legal or ethical constraints. <br> At the 100-day mark, it seems clear that the system is working properly and that Trump is more likely to go down in history as a weak and ineffective president than as an American tyrant. Apart from the appointment of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, he has failed to carry through on any of his major campaign promises such as stopping Muslim immigration or building his “big, beautiful” wall. His most abject failure was the effort to replace Obamacare with the American Health Care Act, which had to be withdrawn for lack of votes. This absence of winning (is it called “losing”?) unfolded even as the Republican Party controls both houses of Congress and the presidency. <br> There are multiple sources of this weakness. Most immediate is Trump’s own ignorance of the workings of the U.S. government and the inexperience of the advisers he chose to surround himself with. He seems to have come into office believing he could run the country the way he ran his family business, through executive orders. But the American system puts Congress in the driver’s seat for any major initiatives, and presidents are powerful only to the extent that they can build legislative coalitions. Trump failed to do this on health care, and he is no more likely to succeed with tax reform or infrastructure. <br> Trump’s second weakness is structural. To be a powerful president, he would have had to reach out beyond the narrow base that brought him victory in the electoral college, just as President Ronald Reagan succeeded in doing. Trump has sought the opposite, doubling down on his core supporters while doing everything possible to undermine trust on the part of Democrats and independents. In theory, he could create a bipartisan coalition on an issue popular with Democrats such as infrastructure, but at this point they are unlikely to want to rescue what looks like a failing presidency. <br> This does not mean, however, that Trump will be an inconsequential president. His main legacy will be a highly negative one: the first president to undermine a whole series of informal norms about American government. He and his family have not even pretended to avoid conflicts of interest after taking office. Meanwhile, the administration is rolling back transparency laws as it loads its staff with former lobbyists, despite its “drain the swamp” slogan. <br> The second negative legacy has to do with government service. The Trump administration has done nothing but express contempt for the public servants who run the government. Administration officials have shown no particular urgency in appointing the hundreds of mid-level officials needed to run the government, declared a hiring freeze and pay cap, and solicited ideas for which government agencies to eliminate entirely. The administration seems not to realize that the federal government actually has fewer full-time workers than it did in the 1960s, despite the fact that it is processing five times the amount of money (the gap being made up by contractors). What bright young person is going to want to go to work for the State Department when the secretary of state has abetted its marginalization? <br> Third, Trump is the first president in living memory who has not paid even lip service to the importance of democracy or human rights around the world. His embrace of Abdel Fatah al-Sissi of Egypt and his congratulations to Erdogan after the Turkish strongman consolidated his presidential powers send powerful signals that the world’s leading democracy no longer cares about democracy elsewhere. <br> The one area in which the president has authority to act on his own is foreign policy. While recent moves regarding Syria, China and Russia suggest he is moving back into the Washington foreign policy mainstream, the more important legacy may be the administration’s uncanny ability to undermine its own credibility. The recent miscue on whether the USS Carl Vinson was sailing toward North Korea is only the latest example. <br> Is a presidential tweet the same thing as U.S. policy? Neither our friends nor our enemies know, and credibility is the coin of the realm in foreign policy. How this legacy will play out in the real crises we face in Asia, Europe and the Middle East is unknowable at this juncture, but the danger that the United States will abate rather than enhance global stability is all too real. <br> Read more here: <br> William J.

 Attempting comprehensive tax reform is like trying to tug many bones from the clamped jaws of many mastiffs. Every provision of the code — now approaching 4 million words — was put there to placate a clamorous faction, or to create a grateful group that will fund its congressional defenders. Still, Washington will take another stab at comprehensiveness, undeterred by the misadventures of comprehensive immigration and health-care reforms. Consider just one tax change that should be made and certainly will not be. <br> The deductibility of mortgage interest payments, by which the government will forgo collecting nearly $1 trillion in the next decade, is treated as a categorical imperative graven on the heart of humanity by the finger of God because it is a pleasure enjoyed primarily by the wealthy. About 75 percent of American earners pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes, and only around 30 percent of taxpayers itemize their deductions. Ike Brannon, of the Cato Institute and Capital Policy Analytics in Washington, argues that, given America’s homeownership rate of about 63 percent, not even half of all homeowners use the deduction. Its principal beneficiaries are affluent (also attentive and argumentative) homeowners, and its benefits, as Brannon says, “scale up” regressively: The larger the mortgage and the higher the tax bracket, the more valuable the deduction is. <br> Perhaps the deduction’s net effect is a higher rate of homeownership, which can benefit society by encouraging respect for property rights, the thrift necessary for a substantial investment and a sense of having a stake in the community. But the unpleasantness of 2008 demonstrated the downside of encouraging too much homeownership. Furthermore, the deduction might actually suppress homeownership by being priced into rising housing costs. Besides, Australia, Canada and Britain, which have no mortgage interest deductions, have homeownership rates comparable to that of the United States. <br> Homeownership is, Brannon argues, a way for people to hold their wealth; it is not an investment because “it does not improve the productive capacity of the economy.” Indeed, the more money that flows into housing, the less flows into stocks, bonds or banks. <br> Government policy is like a Calder mobile — touch something here and things jiggle over there. For example, the president has acted to discourage the use of Canadian wood when making planks for the rising edifice of American greatness. A 20 percent tariff on softwood imports from Canada — about 30 percent of the softwood lumber used in U.S. residential housing construction — is retaliation for Canada’s government supposedly charging Canadian lumber interests too little for trees harvested in government forests. The tariff will raise the price of flooring and siding and therefore of houses. <br> Dismayed U.S. homebuilders foresee a 6.4 percent increase; U.S. lumber interests say that is an exaggeration. Even allowing for theatricality on both sides, lumber protectionism will certainly deepen two problems: Because the mortgage interest deduction enables higher housing prices, Americans will continue to pour too much wealth into housing. And inequality will be exacerbated. Homeownership is crucial to the accumulation of wealth. But as social scientist Joel Kotkin writes, millennials are caught in a pincer of low incomes — the Census Bureau estimates that even those with a full-time job earn $2,000 less in real dollars than the same age cohort did in 1980 — and high housing prices. Kotkin says “homeownership rates for people under 35 have dropped 21 percent” since 2004. <br> And there is this: The percentage of persons ages 25 to 34 who have never been married has risen from 12 in 1960 to 47 today. There are cultural as well as economic reasons for this delay in two powerful economic multipliers — family formation and house-buying — but certainly, the rising cost of housing is a factor. This is just one of the unseen costs of protectionism’s seen benefit of a small number of domestic jobs protected. <br> Elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would have to be grandfathered to accommodate those who budgeted for their home purchases with the deduction in mind. Even so, it will not happen. Neither will limiting the deduction by denying it to a tiny top sliver of the largest mortgages — say, portions of mortgages over $500,000. People are loss-averse — they resist surrendering any benefit, even if they would reap bigger benefits from increased economic growth that would result from a more sensible allocation of society’s resources. And the political class is risk-averse, unwilling to challenge the affluent, or 1 million organized Realtors. The sound you hear is of mastiffs growling. <br> Read more from George F.

 Yesterday’s conventional wisdom: A wave of insurgent populism is sweeping the West, threatening its foundational institutions — the European Union, the Western alliance, even liberal democracy itself. <br> Today’s conventional wisdom (post-first-round French presidential election): The populist wave has crested, soon to abate. <br> Chances are that both verdicts are wrong. The anti-establishment sentiment that gave us Brexit, then Donald Trump, then seemed poised to give us Marine Le Pen, has indeed plateaued. But although she will likely be defeated in the second round, victory by the leading centrist, Emmanuel Macron, would hardly constitute an establishment triumph. <br> Macron barely edged out a Cro-Magnon communist (Jean-Luc Mélenchon), a blood-and-soil nationalist (Le Pen) and a center-right candidate brought low by charges of nepotism and corruption (François Fillon). And the candidate for the ruling Socialist Party came in fifth, garnering a pathetic 6 percent of the vote. <br> On the other hand, the populists can hardly be encouraged by what has followed Brexit and Trump: Dutch elections, where the nationalist Geert Wilders faded toward the end and came nowhere near power; Austrian elections, where another nationalist challenge was turned back; and upcoming German elections, where polls indicate that the far-right nationalists are at barely 10 percent and slipping . And, of course, France. <br> In retrospect, the populist panic may have been overblown. Regarding Brexit, for example, the shock exaggerated its meaning. Because it was so unexpected, it became a sensation. But in the longer view, Britain has always been deeply ambivalent about Europe, going back at least to Henry VIII and his break with Rome. In the intervening 500 years, Britain has generally seen itself as less a part of Europe than an offshore island. <br> The true historical anomaly was Britain’s E.U. membership with all the attendant transfer of sovereignty from Westminster to Brussels. Brexit was a rather brutal return to the extra-European norm, but the norm it is. <br> The other notable populist victory, the triumph of Trump, has also turned out to be less than meets the eye. He certainly ran as a populist and won as a populist but, a mere 100 days in, he is governing as a traditionalist. <br> The Obamacare replacement proposals are traditional small-government fixes. His tax reform is a follow-on to Reagan’s from 1986. His Supreme Court pick is a straight-laced, constitutional conservative out of central casting. And his more notable executive orders read as a wish list of traditional business-oriented conservatism from regulatory reform to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. <br> I happen to support all of these moves, but they don’t qualify as insurrectionist populism. The one exception may be trade policy. As of now, however, it remains ad hoc and idiosyncratic. Trump has made gestures and threats to those cunning Mexicans, Chinese and now Canadians. But it’s not yet clear if he is serious about, say, withdrawing from NAFTA or just engaging in a series of opening negotiating gambits. <br> The softwood-timber dispute with Canada is hardly new. It dates back 35 years. Every intervening administration has contested the terms of trade in various forums. A full-scale trade war with our leading trading partner would indeed break new ground. Anything short of that, however, is the art of the deal. <br> The normalization of Trump is one indicator that there may be less to the populist insurrection than imagined. The key, however, is Europe, where the stakes are infinitely higher. There the issue is the future of the nation-state itself, as centuries of sovereignty dissolve within an expanding superstate. It influences every aspect of daily life — from the ethnic makeup of neighborhoods to the currency that changes hands at the grocery. <br> The news from France, where Macron is openly, indeed ostentatiously, pro-European (his campaign headquarters flies the E.U. flag ) is that France is not quite prepared to give up on the great experiment. But the Europeanist elites had better not imagine this to be an enduring verdict. The populist revolt was a reaction to their reckless and anti-democratic push for even greater integration. The task today is to address the sources of Europe’s economic stagnation and social alienation rather than blindly pursue the very drive that led to this precarious moment. <br> If the populist threat turns out to have frightened the existing powers out of their arrogant complacency, it should be deemed a success. But make no mistake: The French election wasn’t a victory for the status quo. It was a reprieve. For now, the populist wave is not in retreat. It’s on pause. <br> Read more from Charles Krauthammer’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> George F.

 Ronald A. Klain, a Post contributing columnist, served as a senior White House aide to Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. <br> The 100-day milestone for a presidency is overblown: In what other endeavor is so much emphasis placed on the score just 7 percent of the way into a contest? What does actually matter at this early stage in Donald Trump’s presidency is which of the flashpoints from this action-packed start will recede in significance as the rest of his presidency unfolds — and which events from the first 100 days are of enduring consequence? <br> At the outset, as a harsh critic of the president, I must acknowledge that for some constituencies, Trump’s first 100 days have been a success. For those who backed him to wrestle a Supreme Court vacancy from the Democrats, he delivered the most conservative nominee in a quarter-century. For those who want to reverse the increasing diversity of our country, Trump put out an unmistakable “not welcome here” sign. For those who craved fiercer firepower in the Middle East, Trump rained Tomahawks on Syria and the “mother of all bombs” on Afghanistan. <br> However, these hardcore Trumpers are not an electoral majority. So it is through the lens of other voters that the lasting impact of Trump’s first 100 days should be considered. This includes those who were dubious about him but who nonetheless took a chance on him to create jobs, “drain the swamp” and get results — and those who didn’t vote for him but were willing to give him a chance. From that perspective, three gigantic failures of the early Trump presidency will haunt the rest of his tenure. <br> First, as the candidate least beholden to a major political party to win the White House in decades, Trump chose — surprisingly — to eschew bipartisanship and tightly align himself with partisan Republican leaders. He ran a campaign opposed to both parties’ establishments. On primary nights, he devoted large chunks of victory speeches to describing how he would bring together Democrats and Republicans to hammer out compromise job-creating plans. Immediately after the election, a caravan of Democrats was invited to Trump Tower. And during the transition, some Democrats, even liberals, sent out feelers on infrastructure spending. <br> But in his first 100 days, Trump has governed as a hard-baked partisan. Unlike George W. Bush or Barack Obama, Trump did not choose any elected official from the opposing party for his Cabinet. He openly belittled Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and fired racial epithets at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Bipartisan infrastructure spending was delayed in favor of a direct assault on Obamacare. While Trump has displayed a penchant for golf , the only member of Congress invited to play with him has been conservative Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). He offered negotiations to Republicans on health care, but only threats to Democrats. <br> Second, Trump badly erred by putting fights about immigration, health care and cultural issues on the front burner — while neglecting and betraying the economic populist message that propelled his victory. True, he began his transition with a high-profile announcement about jobs at Carrier, and recently issued a largely hortatory “Buy American” executive order, but otherwise he’s largely been AWOL from (or affirmatively hostile to) his own campaign’s economic agenda since taking office. <br> Candidate Trump promised to declare China a currency manipulator on Day One — and then President Trump balked. He said he’d stick it to Wall Street — but hired more Goldman Sachs executives than any president in history. Candidate Trump said that he would “fight to pass” within the first 100 days a cornucopia of economic legislation: the End Offshoring Act, middle-class tax reform, affordable child care and elder care, a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, an educational opportunity act. Not one of these bills has been put forward, let alone fought for, and certainly not passed. No president meets all of his ambitious promises for action in the first 100 days — but no president has done less to even try to deliver on his economic promises than Trump. <br> Third, Trump has been stunningly blasé about staffing his administration. His victory was a surprise, so his transition was understandably less prepared. Republicans may be less easily enticed than Democrats into taking government jobs. But no president has done so little to staff so much of the government so far into his term as Trump. <br> This failure presents a long-term problem for Trump. Delays in filling higher-level jobs mean delays in filling mid-level jobs, and so on. Luckily for Trump, his administration has not had to face a major crisis. That string will break at some point. A hurricane will devastate a city, an offshore oil well will explode, an epidemic will threaten our shores. And a government without appointees in key posts will be woefully ill-equipped to cope. The inevitably inadequate response will have a lasting impact, not least for Trump. <br> Anyone who has underestimated Trump has learned a painful lesson. So the fate of his presidency is far from sealed. But in his first 100 days, the new president has dug a deep hole from which he will have to extricate himself in the next 1,361. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Henry Olsen: This failure may doom Trump’s presidency before it really begins <br> Danielle Allen: Trump’s presidency is teaching elites like me a lesson <br> Dana Milbank: Trump is looking more and more like a man without a plan <br> Eugene Robinson: Trump’s cake and golf presidency <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Charles Koch is chairman and chief executive of Koch Industries. <br> Like Alexis de Tocqueville nearly 200 years ago, I believe American society thrives when people act out of an enlightened regard for themselves that constantly prompts them to assist each other. I remain optimistic that our nation can unify around policies that promote a system of mutual benefit for people from all walks of life. <br> As President Trump nears 100 days in office, we are moving closer to that ideal in some respects, but not in others. But no president can — or should — be expected to solve every problem alone. To be successful, leaders in any field must listen to everyone, even those with whom they disagree. <br> On the plus side, the president has taken a thoughtful approach to regulatory reform. He has appointed a strong team capable of acting on the best ideas to remove unnecessary regulations that undermine innovation, competition and opportunities for those who need them most. I also applaud the president’s selection of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. With a career of prioritizing the Constitution over political gamesmanship, the new justice will be a critical voice of properly applied constitutional law. <br> At the same time, I view some actions of this administration as counterproductive. These include broad travel bans, discouraging free trade and a tendency toward rhetoric that too easily divides Americans instead of uniting them. <br> [President Trump’s first 100 days: In his words and ours] <br> But rather than spending too much time looking back — even if only for 100 days — we need to look forward. The president and lawmakers have an excellent opportunity to take bold steps here and now to reverse the United States’ trajectory toward a two-tiered system: one that benefits the wealthy and well-connected (including big businesses such as Koch Industries) at the expense of everyone else. <br> In addressing the United States’ challenges, I encourage the president to evaluate every policy on its potential to help people improve their lives. No piece of legislation will ever be perfect, and allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good only further accentuates our country’s divisions. Good policy moves us closer to this ideal, even if by small steps. <br> With this principle in mind, here are a few policy changes I believe are vital — and genuinely achievable, by this president, at this moment — to improving well-being and opportunity for all Americans: <br> Comprehensive tax reform is long overdue. Americans deserve much, much better. The president’s newly offered plan to reduce rates and simplify the code is a step in the right direction. I am also encouraged by the absence of Congress’ proposed border adjustment tax (or any tax) that would increase the profits of industrial companies such as Koch by raising the price on goods that Americans rely on every day. <br> This administration should instead make room for tax cuts by encouraging Congress to rein in wasteful spending and reduce corporate welfare provisions that benefit big business at the expense of families. A tax code that champions Main Street is vital for economic growth and innovation. On these issues, the president is well-positioned to lead. <br> The health-care debate has been a mess, but I’m hopeful the president can get it on track. Let’s start by laying the foundation for innovation; this will reduce costs and improve quality for everyone. This can’t happen without new legislation, but there are actions the administration can take in the meantime, such as reforming the Food and Drug Administration and granting discretion to states to innovate within the constructs of Obamacare and Medicaid. While not perfect, such actions can move us closer to a system where all individuals can choose the affordable care that is best for them. <br> [We asked you to describe President Trump’s first 100 days. Here’s what you said.] <br> As a candidate, the president spoke passionately about the need to reduce crime rates and improve safety, particularly in urban areas. I agree. When criminal sentences are just and fit the offense, and when those who have committed nonviolent crimes learn from their mistakes and get a second chance, we all benefit. Instead, what we have today is an epidemic of over-incarceration that breeds distrust and increases violence between the police and the communities they serve. The president can break this cycle by working with lawmakers who stand ready to reform our criminal-justice system. <br> I do not see eye to eye with the president (or anyone) on all issues; however, as with all administrations, I stand ready to help him do right, wherever I can. <br> I believe President Trump has a tremendous opportunity to pave the way — in the next 100 days and beyond — for long-term economic success and greater prosperity for all. I wish him the best and look forward to collaborating with him and anyone — regardless of political party or ideology — who is passionate about advancing a free, open and flourishing society. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Eric Liu: Trump’s most striking accomplishment so far <br> Jonathan Alter: Trump says his first 100 days have been a historic success.

 Henry Olsen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and author of the forthcoming book “The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism.” <br> For nearly a century, American presidents have played an important, if informal, role in our politics as the leader of their parties. But nearly 100 days into his term, President Trump not only has failed to provide Republicans with skilled leadership, but also seems unaware that he’s even supposed to do so. This failure could doom his presidency before it even really begins. <br> Franklin D. Roosevelt led the way in defining this role. By setting forth a clear thematic and legislative agenda, Roosevelt gave congressional Democrats direction as they set forth to combat the Great Depression. Their successes established the “100 days” benchmark that has now become the standard by which new presidents are judged. <br> By contrast, Trump has provided neither clear direction nor a firm legislative agenda for his party. Congressional Republicans and neutral observers alike ask: “What does the president really want?” No one should expect modern presidents to meet Roosevelt’s level of achievement, but Trump isn’t even close. We don’t know what form health-care reform will take; we have only a hastily prepared outline of tax reform; and his pronouncements on other policy issues seem to change as often as the Washington weather. <br> [We asked you to describe President Trump’s first 100 days. Here’s what you said.] <br> This lack of leadership was on full display as the Obamacare-repeal debacle played out in March. The president allowed House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to offer up a bill without his apparent direct involvement. Trump provided no clear direction as to which provisions of the bill he was committed to and which he was willing to discard or amend. This, predictably, meant that every faction of Republicans was encouraged to ask for more, which predictably led to different factions asking for incompatible things. Moderates in swing states and Freedom Caucus members in tea party strongholds inevitably have different no-fly zones. Only clear, principled leadership from the Oval Office could have brought these odd bedfellows into accord. A week or two of lobbying was not enough to accomplish this, and even the White House’s current efforts seem to focus only on the House Freedom Caucus to the exclusion of House moderates or senators. <br> Absence of political leadership is particularly damaging to the modern Republican Party because of the intense and deep fissures running through it. The GOP was bitterly divided into at least four factions prior to Trump’s emergence, and their civil war had waged since at least the 2010 primaries. None of the existing party leaders has the stature, power or credibility to unite this group into a cohesive majority. The president’s failure to step into this fray simply makes the divisions harder to heal. <br> This state of affairs is compounded by the way Trump won the White House. He mobilized millions of non-Republicans, mainly whites without college degrees, and brought them behind him in historically high numbers. These voters tend to be more economically liberal than any faction of GOP conservatives and less interested in historic Republican unifying themes such as traditional morality or activism overseas. Their priorities — jobs and rising wages, immigration restriction and focusing our military on fighting terrorism — are all out of step with at least one powerful GOP faction. Unless they are integrated into a new Republican majority, the votes that elected Trump and gave the GOP control of the Senate, House and many big state governorships will vanish as quickly as they arrived. <br> Fortunately for the administration, the 100-day mark is wholly artificial, so Trump has time to step up. In doing so, he need look no farther than the example of President Ronald Reagan. Reagan also led a party wracked by years of infighting, in his case between moderates, business conservatives and movement conservatives. He also saw many traditional Republicans desert him for a third-party candidate, Rep. John Anderson, in his general election campaign. And like Trump, he prevailed because he attracted millions of traditional Democrats and independents who thought the former movie actor cared more about them than traditional Republicans or Democratic leaders did. <br> [President Trump’s first 100 days: In his words and ours] <br> Reagan started his presidency by establishing clear priorities in his opening speeches and followed those pronouncements up with specific legislative proposals. Despite holding only a narrow majority in the Senate and having to lure at least 26 Democratic votes in the House, and despite a brush with death on March 30 after John Hinckley Jr.’s failed assassination attempt, Reagan’s priorities moved quickly through Congress. By May 7 his budget cuts passed the House, and by August his tax cuts were signed into law, both with nearly unanimous Republican backing and significant Democratic support. There is no reason why a determined and dedicated Trump can’t get similar results. <br> Trump was elected to change Washington and “drain the swamp.” Our modern system won’t allow him to do that without first wading deep into the murky waters himself to corral the alligators. If the president does that by the summer months, he might yet begin to fulfill his promises and move the nation in a new direction. But if he doesn’t, he may find the swamp will have drained his power and authority by the time Congress reconvenes in the fall. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Danielle Allen: Trump’s presidency is teaching elites like me a lesson <br> Eric Liu: Trump’s most striking accomplishment so far <br> Stephen Skowronek: Is Donald Trump the Great Disrupter?

 The last thing President Trump now needs is for the stock market to go south on him. After all, he’s got worries aplenty: abroad, North Korea, Syria, Russia and Brexit; at home, the stalled effort to repeal Obamacare and uncertainty surrounding “tax reform.” Compared with this tapestry of troubles, the stock market has been a splendid blessing. <br> It’s called the Trump Rally or the Trump Trade. By whatever name, it has been impressive. On Election Day, Nov. 8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 18,332.74, not much different from a year earlier. By March 1, the Dow hit 21,115.55, a gain of 15 percent. Although stocks are slightly off this peak, the market increase remains about 11 percent and represents roughly $2.7 trillion of paper wealth, reports Wilshire Associates. <br> To Trump, this must be immensely gratifying. Among other roles, the stock market serves as a general barometer of confidence that is independent of — and can’t by manipulated by — Trump’s nemesis, the detestable “mainstream media.” One message from the market, he doubtlessly thinks, is that he’s doing much better than his vocal critics acknowledge. <br> The theory of the Trump Rally is simple: He has brightened the economic outlook. Big business and personal tax cuts, combined with relief from over-regulation and higher infrastructure spending (roads, ports), will boost economic growth. Faster growth will raise profits — and higher profits tomorrow justify higher stock prices today. In theory, stocks represent the present value of (estimated) future profits. <br> But there’s the rub. What if those profits don’t materialize? <br> Immediately after the election, it was possible (though naive) to think that Trump could quickly convince the Republican Congress to pass his economic agenda. Now, that optimism seems unrealistic. The difficulty of repealing the Affordable Care Act showed the limits of the White House’s power. Similarly, big tax cuts may be doomed by budget deficits. Progress on infrastructure and regulation is also grudging. <br> So: If the main reason for the Trump Rally is missing, what’s holding stock prices up? Good question. <br> Let’s be clear: Stock prices are historically high by many traditional measures. Consider the price-earnings ratio, or P/E. It shows the relation between stock prices and underlying earnings (profits). Since 1936, the P/E ratio of the Standard Poor’s 500 stocks has averaged 17 based on the latest profits and stock prices, says Howard Silverblatt of SP Dow Jones Indices. Now, the P/E is almost 24. <br> Stock prices have outrun profits’ growth. According to Silverblatt, either added profits will materialize or, if they don’t, stocks will decline. “The P/E is high,” he says. “We are paying [in today’s stock prices] for future and expected earnings. At some point, we need to see them.” <br> Stock valuations are tricky. With hindsight, the market can stay above or below levels reflecting economic fundamentals for long stretches. Whatever the case today, stocks are nowhere near the absurd heights of the “tech bubble” at the turn of the century. It’s possible that a general improvement in the global economy justifies higher stock prices. The International Monetary Fund and some private economists have recently raised their forecasts. <br> “Compared with a month ago,” says Global Insight, a major forecasting firm, “[our predictions for economic growth] in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, India and Russia have all been marked up a little.” <br> But the Trump Rally could be an exercise in over-optimism. Hefty expectations of tax cuts, regulatory savings and higher government spending may be disappointed, writes Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics. Or the rally could succumb to a foreign policy crisis. Take your pick: North Korea, the Middle East or others. <br> If so, the rally could backfire. Rising stocks cause consumers to spend more; falling stocks curb their spending. Zandi figures this so-called “wealth effect” at about 5 percent: A $1 change in stock-market wealth prompts consumers to alter spending by about 5 cents. If the entire $2.8 trillion rally were erased, that would imply a $140 billion loss in consumer spending. <br> Indeed, Zandi thinks the effect could be greater, because many heavily invested baby boomers — in or near retirement — “would be very sensitive to a decline in stock prices.” <br> What may be holding up stocks is inertia, herd behavior or wishful thinking. One test comes this week when, says Silverblatt, nearly 200 major companies report profits for 2017’s first quarter. Strong profits would vindicate the rally. For Trump and everyone else, the question is whether the rally rests on illusion or reality. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Sebastian Mallaby: The Federal Reserve should give Wall Street a shock <br> David Ignatius: The Trump bubble bursts in Moscow’s markets <br> Robert J.

 House Republicans are apparently ready for yet another attempt to snatch health insurance away from constituents who need it. Someone should remind Speaker Paul Ryan of a saying often attributed to his legendary predecessor Sam Rayburn: “There’s no education in the second kick of the mule.” <br> Having failed miserably to win passage of an abomination of a bill — the American Health Care Act — Ryan (R-Wis.) and his minions are back with something even worse. A draft framework being circulated this week would pretend to keep the parts of Obamacare that people like, but allow states to take these benefits away. We see what you’re doing, folks. <br> This is getting silly. What part of “forget it” do Republicans not understand? <br> I realize there is great pressure to follow through on the GOP promise to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act. And I realize that President Trump, nearing the 100-day mark, sorely needs a legislative victory to tweet about. King Pyrrhus needed a win, too, but that didn’t work out too well for him. <br> Republicans don’t talk much about the practical reason for moving urgently on health care, which is to set the stage for tax reform: They want to take money now used to subsidize health care for low-income Americans and give it to the wealthy in the form of big tax cuts. Again, we can see you. <br> I’m sure the crowds at GOP town halls will be understanding. Just be sure to check attendees at the door for tar and feathers. <br> The new proposal — brokered by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), of the moderate Tuesday Group, and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), of the far-right Freedom Caucus — is like a parody, as if life-or-death access to health care were fodder for a “Saturday Night Live” sketch. <br> Nominally, the MacArthur amendment would retain the Essential Health Benefits standard imposed by the ACA, which requires insurance policies to cover eventualities such as hospitalization, maternity and emergency care — basically, all the things you’d ever need health insurance for. <br> The amendment would also appear to maintain the ACA’s guarantees that anyone could buy health insurance, including those with preexisting conditions, and that parents could keep adult children on their policies until age 26. That all looks fine — but it’s an illusion. <br> After specifying that these popular provisions will stay, the amendment then gives states the right to snatch them away. States would be able to obtain waivers exempting them from the Essential Health Benefits standards. They would also be able to obtain waivers from the preexisting conditions requirement by creating a “high-risk pool” to provide coverage for those who are unwell. <br> There would no longer be a prohibition, however, against charging “high-risk” individuals more — so much more, in fact, that they would potentially be priced out of the market. We would go back to the pre-ACA situation in which serious illness could mean losing a home or filing for bankruptcy. <br> This may satisfy GOP ideological imperatives — Ayn Rand would be so proud — but it is atrocious policy, even if you put aside considerations such as compassion and community. <br> We live at a time of enormous economic dislocation. The manufacturing sector has shrunk dramatically, and now retail may be starting down the same path; long-lost jobs in industries such as coal mining are not coming back, no matter what Trump says. Workers need to be able to move to where jobs are being created — which means that health insurance should ideally be portable. But Republicans are heading in the other direction by trying to set up a system with radically different health-insurance rules in different states. In today’s world, how does that make sense? <br> Unchanged from last month’s failed bill are provisions that would strip massive amounts of money out of Medicaid, by far the nation’s biggest source of payment for nursing-home care. So Republicans might not want to show their faces anywhere near retirement communities. <br> The Affordable Care Act changed the way most people in this country think about health care. It did not, however, change the thinking of many House Republicans, who continue to believe individuals should be held financially liable for a genetic predisposition toward diabetes or a random cellular mutation that leads to cancer. <br> Another abject failure to repeal the ACA would be a terrible political outcome for Republicans. But far worse, looking ahead to the 2018 midterms, would be for Trump to sign this latest monstrosity into law. <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 In the past week or so, Donald Trump has decided not to be totally Donald Trump. He has changed his positions on many issues, often by simply contradicting himself and sometimes by repudiating what he once said. However he does it, it comes down to this: If policies were gender identities, Trump wouldn’t know which bathroom to use. <br> The president has reversed himself on NATO. Where just recently he pronounced it “obsolete,” he now has changed his position by cleverly reimagining it. He gave NATO a role in fighting terrorism, which it has been doing all along. <br> Similar feats of mental prestidigitation got Trump to change his mind on China, Russia and Syria, where the one which was once almost a buddy (Russia) is now a foe and the one which was once a foe (China) is going to help contain North Korea and the one for which he had no policy (Syria) has been whacked by Tomahawk missiles. And for the moment, the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv is not moving to Jerusalem. <br> These reversals represent nothing less than a retreat to the status quo ante — that halcyon era before Trump and his cast of mental munchkins started messing with foreign policy. The policies that now seem to be in place are ones that even former president Barack Obama might support. In fact, with the exception of hitting Syria, he did. <br> But before we start celebrating Trump as a drunk who has suddenly gone sober, additional reversals are in order. The president might want to declare that it is wrong to mock persons with disabilities. He might want to say something nice about Mexicans, and he might want to retract his belittling of John McCain’s heroism — acknowledge how the man suffered as a prisoner of war, choosing to undergo torture and confinement rather than accept freedom without pride. <br> Trump might also want to praise the Khans, the couple who lost a son in Iraq and whose sacrifice he mocked by likening it to what it cost him to build his business. He might also want to say he was wrong to suggest a certain judge could not fairly preside over a case involving Trump University because he was of Hispanic ancestry. Trump was wrong, too, to turn the presidential race into one of schoolyard taunts — “Little Marco,” “Crooked Hillary” and the rest. In short, Trump might want to institute a policy of acting presidential. Now, that would be a reversal. <br> His foreign policy 180s are welcome, but those were not what won the hearts of his ardent supporters. They wanted something more — jobs, affordable health care and a general sense that Washington would once again be their capital. But NAFTA remains in place, Obamacare is still the law of the land, tax reform ain’t coming soon, and the swamp that was supposed to be drained has been replenished with, among others, former Goldman Sachs executives — most prominently Gary Cohn, once No. 2 at Goldman and now, for much lower pay, apparently No. 2 at the White House. <br> That’s fine and dandy with me. I do not demonize Goldman Sachs. But Trump did. During the campaign, he lambasted both Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton for their relationship with the bank. “I know the guys at Goldman Sachs,” Trump said. “They have total, total control over [Cruz]. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.” Now, though, the total controllers are prominent in the administration — Steven Mnuchin at Treasury and, in the White House itself, Dina Powell, the aforementioned Cohn and even the odd-man-out, Stephen K. Bannon. <br> This reversal by personnel was not triggered by unforeseen events — Syria’s use of a nerve agent, for instance. It is, instead, a strong indication that Trump’s campaign was a lie. His wooing of the American working class was insincere. For instance, he put more effort into denouncing Obamacare than he did in preparing legislation to replace it. Those who thought Trump was somehow going to pay their doctors’ bills simply got taken. They were — as were the students of Trump University — suckered. <br> Sooner or later, Trump’s supporters will realize they have been seduced and abandoned. The easy solutions he promised — the return of manufacturing to the Midwest, the restoration of King Coal to its traditional throne — will not materialize. Maybe then these voters will seek an accounting and they will turn, with appropriate fury, not just on Trump but on the coterie of the craven who jumped on his bandwagon. Trump is not the only one who can reverse his actions. So can the voters. <br> Read more from Richard Cohen’s archive. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Trump is crippling his own administration <br> Paul Waldman: Donald Trump, a ‘populist’?

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> “WE HAD promised everything to everybody and were doing practically nothing for anyone. There’s only so much you as a city can do to solve all the world’s problems.” Those words of caution from former mayor Anthony Williams about the trouble the District got into with its profligate spending in the 1990s need to be stressed as the D.C. Council begins its deliberations on the budget proposed for next year by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). <br> The $13.8 billion proposal would be the largest in the District’s history, with spending increases in areas such as schools, affordable housing, child care, emergency services and bridge and road repair. It is a responsible document that addresses the major challenges facing the District with affordable investments and innovative programs. But to critics, the proposal does not do enough to help the neediest D.C. residents; they argue that a city government so flush with money should spend more on social services. Why not, they ask, tap the city’s reserves or — even better — delay $100 million earmarked by the mayor for tax relief to residents? <br> Council members should resist both suggestions. No question the city currently has no financial worries, but fiscal prudence and uncertainty about what President Trump and the Republican Congress have in store for cities argue against spending surplus monies. It also would not be in the best interest of residents and businesses to put off tax reform that was the result of painstaking work by a Tax Revision Commission, which Mr. Williams helped lead. Most of the benefits — $60 million — will benefit low- and moderate-income families, a fact that we hope will not be lost on the council in its upcoming deliberations. <br> Clearly the council should not just rubber stamp Ms. Bowser’s proposed budget, which deserves careful scrutiny. But we would urge legislators — in light of a series of reports from the D.C. auditor finding fault with the performance of some government programs — to question the efficiency and effectiveness of how tax dollars are already being spent. As Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) aptly pointed out, “spending more money doesn’t necessarily get you more results. We celebrate the spending . . . not the end results.” <br> The deliberations will occur at a time when speculation has already started over who on the council might challenge Ms. Bowser in her expected bid for reelection. So expect political posturing and grandstanding. Let’s just hope it doesn’t result in promises the city won’t be able to keep. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Colbert I.

 So which is it? <br> Does the $13.8 billion 2018 budget submitted to the D.C. Council by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) reflect, as she asserts, the ideas and priorities of D.C. residents? <br> A good question. The final answer rests with the D.C. Council, which, in the budget-making process, is always a crapshoot. <br> As to the question: The city’s robust financial health is being fueled by the largesse of residents and businesses. As Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. DeWitt noted in his budget transmittal letter to Bowser, population growth has been a major factor in the increase of the city’s income- and sales-tax bases and a driving force behind rising home values. <br> Want some numbers? <br> DeWitt said that in the past five years (2011 to 2016), the city’s population grew by nearly 61,000 residents, or 10 percent — more than 1,000 net new residents per month, he noted. They, along with other homeowners and businesses, are filling the tax coffers. <br> Keep those figures in mind as this budget tale unfolds. <br> Also recognize that this budget proposal would be the city’s 22nd consecutive balanced budget. For those of us who lived through the 1990s nightmare of D.C. government insolvency, a Clinton administration-engineered federal bailout and a congressionally imposed financial control board, the city’s finances have reached the fiscal promised land. <br> Bowser maintains that her spending plan provides a road map to inclusive prosperity for every resident. She cites millions of dollars to be spent on education and making the District safer. Her budget includes more money for affordable housing, and more spending on the homeless and families in need of care and supportive programs. On top of that, she promises a budget that will deliver a streamlined D.C. government. <br> Others, predictably, don’t see it that way. <br> Bowser’s budget “offers not prosperity, but austerity” (George Jones, Bread for the City); “falls so short of what’s needed to accelerate progress . . . people are dying of preventable and manageable diseases” (Lara Pukatch, Miriam’s Kitchen); ignores calls from community leaders who say “as a city we should be spending on those who have almost nothing before we spend on tax give-backs to those who have almost everything” (Jacob Feinspan, Jews United for Justice). <br> “People are dying . . . .” Gonna lay that also at Bowser’s feet? <br> The D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute’s Ed Lazere charged that Bowser’s budget “isn’t living up to its rhetoric of building ‘inclusive prosperity’ ” and called on the council to do more. <br> What’s a D.C. taxpayer to think? <br> Bowser claims her budget makes the largest investment in public education in D.C. history — more than $2 billion, including $105 million to increase the per-student spending rate, an increase for the University of the District of Columbia and the University of the District of Columbia Community College of nearly $6 million, and $1.3 billion for school modernization over six years. <br> But that’s not enough, says the Fiscal Policy Institute, supported by organizations such as Bread for the City, the Children’s Law Center, DC Alliance of Youth Advocates, Jews United for Justice and Miriam’s Kitchen. They take the position, expressed in a news release, that “funding schools at a level deemed fully adequate would require a 14 percent increase” — not Bowser’s proposed 1.5 percent. <br> Who’s right? <br> A budget that devotes $1.9 billion to human services and $1.1 billion to public safety is pooh-poohed and scorned by the advocate community “for leaving significant funding gaps” and spending at levels below what it considers adequate. <br> As for the automatic tax cuts for businesses and middle- and low-income residents that the council approved in 2014 as part of a tax-reform package, the advocates argue that the money should go to the homeless, education and housing, despite the $100 million Bowser is directing to the Housing Production Trust Fund. <br> Now to reality. <br> More than 30 years of observing D.C. budget-making leads to two immutable findings: No mayor’s proposed budget has ever received universal acclaim, and grand D.C. social programs often fall short of expectations. <br> Which brings us to the D.C. Council. <br> The budget oversight process that begins this month will have plenty of political grandstanding and playing to a vast gallery of special interests and a TV audience. Showing up the mayor will be part of the game. <br> If the council’s history is any guide, expect few hard questions about actual government performance, accountability and wise use of tax dollars. Also, expect to not hear a critical word about $20 million in the budget to begin implementing the District’s paid family leave program — one of the most generous in the United States. <br> Notable exceptions are Ward 7 council member Vincent C. Gray’s (D) substantive critique of city spending programs and his recommendations for budget changes, and Ward 2 council member Jack Evans’s (D) more restrained call for “funding programs that work and will benefit from continued investment and adjusting or eliminating programs that aren’t effective at making our city better for our residents.” <br> Watch the numbers unfold, but also keep an eye on the lawmakers.

 John Klotsche is a partner and former chairman of the executive committee of the law firm Baker McKenzie. He was a senior adviser to the IRS Commissioner from 2003 to 2008. <br> French philosopher Blaise Pascal’s satirical line on verbosity, “The letter I have written today is longer than usual because I lacked the time to make it shorter,” is a timely reminder that the dreaded tax season is upon us. Millions of individuals and families are making their annual pilgrimage through Form 1040 and its 13 schedules, accompanied by the 106-page instruction booklet loaded with gobbledygook. <br> Meanwhile, House Republicans have laid down a marker for tax simplification, proposing to lower tax rates, increase the standard deduction and end a host of special-interest provisions. They estimate that these changes would reduce the share of taxpayers who itemize their deductions from about one-third under current law to 5 percent. <br> Their ultimate goal: “The revised tax filings for most Americans will be simple enough to fit on a postcard.” <br> Yet this falls one crucial step short of achieving the ultimate goal of tax simplification: shifting the burden of preparing returns from taxpayers to the government. <br> After all, the IRS has all the information it needs to do what many taxpayers toil over annually, except it can complete the task more efficiently and accurately. Employers and financial institutions feed variable inputs such as wages and salaries (the W-2) and interest and dividend income (the 1099) directly into the IRS database. The IRS uses this information to cross-check the accuracy of filed returns. <br> Why require taxpayers to spend time gathering documents and information and struggle to decode the forms and instructions? Why push 56 percent of taxpayers to pay professional preparers and 34 percent to purchase tax-preparation software? <br> The tax code contains 2.4 million words , plus 7.7 million in “interpretative” regulations. The Tax Foundation reports staggering tax compliance numbers: Individual taxpayers toil 2.6 billion hours each year gathering information and preparing the 1040 alone. <br> This idea for the tax agency to do the heavy-lifting computations is not new. California launched just such a program, ReadyReturn, in 2004 and recently took its best features and folded them into CalFile, the state’s easy-to-use service offering free e-filing. European countries, Scandinavian in particular, call it a tax agency reconciliation system. Most taxpayers in Denmark (87 percent) and Sweden (74 percent) participate. This is much more than a theoretical idea. <br> Congress even thought such a system meritorious when it mandated in 1998 that the Treasury Department develop “procedures for the implementation of a return-free tax system” for 2008 and beyond. The 2008 launch-year deadline has, of course, long come and gone. <br> How would it work? The IRS would determine eligibility for something that could be called “EZReturn,” based on a taxpayer’s prior return, and prepare a “draft” 1040. It would notify taxpayers of their eligibility and establish a secure online mechanism for reviewing drafts or mailing addresses for the returns to be sent. A given taxpayer would then review the return and (a) agree to the content and file it electronically or by mail, (b) make appropriate changes and file it, or (c) toss it in the trash and start from scratch. EZReturn would be entirely voluntary. <br> What’s the downside? The most obvious is Armageddon for the powerful tax-preparation industry, a $9 billion business employing 300,000 bean counters. Case in point: Intuit (maker of TurboTax) spent $3 million lobbying (unsuccessfully) to torpedo California’s ReadyReturn program. <br> And the industry maneuvered the Treasury Department into sidestepping its 1998 congressional mandate by allowing the IRS to contractually agree not to develop a return-free filing system. This came about in 2002 with the launch of the IRS Free File program for low-income participants, which an industry alliance agreed to fund and manage and for which it extracted the IRS non-competition agreement. <br> What has the industry delivered? For the most recent 2015 filing season, only 2.8 million taxpayers used the Free File program — a puny 2 percent of those eligible. A Treasury Department inspector general unabashedly stated as early as 2006 that the “primary goal” of the Free File Alliance was not to assist low-income taxpayers but “to keep the Federal Government from entering the tax preparation business.” <br> “Drain the swamp” is a popular mantra of the president and his surrogates, and here it seems appropriate that the interests of the tens of millions of taxpayers annually dragged into the 1040 swamp should trump those of the tax-preparation industry. EZReturn could also help drain another swamp: growing industry fraud and predatory practices aimed at lower-income households; tax refund fraud alone is estimated to hit $21 billion this year. <br> Albert Einstein famously said, “The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.” Let’s have Congress instruct (again) and fund the IRS to develop and implement a comprehensive program to assume the role of the nation’s tax-return preparer and make things as simple as possible for millions of taxpayers. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Robert J.

 The central promise of the Trump administration — the repeal and replacement of Obamacare — has failed. The central premise of the Trump administration — that Donald Trump is a brilliant negotiator — has been discredited. In the process of losing a legislative battle, Trump has lost the theory of his presidency. <br> It was a profoundly personal rejection. Trump’s ignorance of policy details alienated legislators. His ill-timed threats backfired. His bonhomie fell flat. <br> The lessons, however, run deeper. Like other politicians before him, Trump ran for office arguing, in essence: Just give my party control of the elected branches of the federal government and massive change will quickly follow. Many Americans believed in this promise of winner-take-all government. <br> The American system of government — with its constipated Senate rules and its complicated House coalitions — is designed to frustrate such plans. But the closeness of recent national elections has encouraged partisan dreams of political dominance. Republicans had control of the House, Senate and presidency in the 108th Congress. Democrats had the same in the 111th Congress. Now Republicans have it all in the 115th Congress. <br> Total control is intoxicating. The winners feel like they have a mandate, even a mission. But the losers know, if they maintain partisan discipline and prevent achievements by the other side, they have a realistic chance of winning it all back. This leads to a cycle of hubris and obstructionism. <br> How can this cycle be broken? There is only one way. Someone must engage in genuine outreach, involving the credible promise of compromise, from a position of strength. It is the winners who must act first, taking the risk of offering a hand that may be slapped away. Then it is the political losers who have the responsibility to reward good faith. <br> Obamacare — passed in a partisan quick march and viewed by some Republicans as the focus of evil in the modern world — may not be the most promising ground for agreement. The same may be true of tax reform, which involves a thousand well-funded special interests. But genuine negotiation might be possible on an infrastructure bill. The same might be true of legislation designed to increase the skills — and deal with the dislocation — of the 38 percent of American workers whose jobs are threatened by automation. And at least one culture-war issue belongs on the list: religious liberty. <br> Many religious conservatives imagined they would, at this point, be in a defensive crouch. The Obama administration had required the Little Sisters of the Poor to provide insurance coverage for sterilizations and the emergency contraceptive Plan B. Religious conservatives expected the Hillary Clinton administration to require the distribution of condoms at Mass (I exaggerate, but only a little). <br> Instead, unexpectedly, religious conservatives find themselves in a position of relative strength, as one of the main contributors to Trump’s victory. It is possible they will squander their standing on repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which restricts political endorsements from the pulpit — a change that few have demanded and none really need. Instead, they could use their influence to encourage genuine pluralism, with benefits that are shared and nonsectarian. <br> What would the elements of a legislative compromise look like? It would need to allow institutions motivated by a religious mission — including religious schools and charities — to maintain their identity. Religious liberty involves not just the freedom of individual belief but the freedom to create institutions that reflect a shared belief. <br> But any realistic agreement would also need to include broad anti-discrimination protections in employment and services — including for gay people — outside of the strong carve-out for religious nonprofits. Religious conservatives would need to accept sexual orientation as a protected group in economic interactions. <br> This is consistent with what Jonathan Rauch calls “the obvious compromise: protections for gay people plus exemptions for religious objectors.” In practice, this would allow religious people to organize colleges, hospitals and charities according to their beliefs. But the cake baker would need to bake for everyone. The florist would need to sell to everyone. <br> The strongest advocates on both sides of this issue will find any compromise abhorrent. But it could be powerful for religious conservatives to attempt outreach from a position of political strength. And Trump, oddly, may be the leader to get this kind of deal. He broke ground among Republicans in recognizing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in his Republican National Convention speech. But he is also close to religious conservative leaders. <br> And just about now, Trump needs a way to reconstitute the meaning of his presidency. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more here: <br> Fred Hiatt: The health-care debacle isn’t Trump’s biggest failure <br> Dana Milbank: The GOP masterminds behind the Obamacare sabotage <br> Catherine Rampell: The Republican health-care plan isn’t about health care at all <br> Letters to the Editor: Who put a ‘big gray cloud’ over the Trump administration? <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Last week’s health-care fiasco could end up being a positive experience for President Trump if he learns a few obvious lessons. Spoiler alert: He won’t. <br> The first thing that should dawn on Trump is that the warring Republican factions in Congress have multiple agendas, none of which remotely resembles his own. This is why the bill that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was forced to withdraw on Friday — the abominable American Health Care Act — made such a cruel mockery of Trump’s expansive campaign promises. <br> A “populist” president who promised health insurance “for everybody” ended up supporting legislation that would have taken away coverage from 24 million people. Many, if not most, of the victims would have been working-class voters — the “forgotten Americans” Trump claimed to champion. Now that he has time, maybe he will actually read the bill (or have someone summarize it for him) and realize how truly awful it was. <br> You don’t have to be a policy wonk to recognize that replacing income-based subsidies with less generous across-the-board tax credits would mean a net transfer of resources from poorer people to wealthier people. That’s just fine with Ryan and the “mainstream” House Republicans who hung in there with legislation that Ronald Reagan or even Barry Goldwater would have considered extreme. <br> For members of the Freedom Caucus, however, the bill didn’t go nearly far enough. They wanted to strip away the requirement that health insurance policies cover eventualities such as maternity, hospitalization, emergency care, mental illness — basically, all the reasons anyone would need insurance in the first place. These ultra-radicals believe health care is like any other product and the free market should be allowed to work its magic. To them, it’s irrelevant that the question is not who buys the latest flat-screen television and who doesn’t, but who lives and who dies. <br> As Trump lobbied House Republicans to support the AHCA, according to The Post, he kept asking aides, “Is this really a good bill?” They assured him it was, but on some level, he must have known the truth was an emphatic no. What happened to those fabled Trumpian instincts? <br> The president let himself be convinced by Ryan that health care would be an easy win. That should make him wary of going down another garden path with a speaker who can’t even marshal his own chamber, let alone produce important legislation with a chance of making it through the Senate. Yet Trump seems ready to make the same mistake with tax reform. <br> Note to the president: If Ryan is saying “trust me on this one,” don’t. <br> The same dynamic is shaping up. House Republicans will all agree on tax cuts, just as they all agreed that the Affordable Care Act should be repealed. The Freedom Caucus, which can only be emboldened by its recent triumph, will make extreme demands. Ryan will accommodate many of them. The end result will be legislation that is more about ideology than policy. The wealthy will benefit enormously, the middle class hardly at all, and the working class will suffer. <br> Such a bill could never win 60 votes in the Senate. Only more modest changes that don’t balloon the deficit qualify for the “reconciliation” process under which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can pass legislation by simple majority — and if just three Republicans balk, even such a limited bill would fail. <br> Trump should wonder why someone on his staff isn’t explaining all of this to him and trying to come up with an appropriate strategy. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and budget director Mick Mulvaney were supposed to know how to get things done in Washington. White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon reportedly tried to bully Freedom Caucus members, who instead seem to have stiffened their resolve. Advisers Jared Kushner and his wife, Trump’s daughter Ivanka, went skiing. <br> Meanwhile, Trump’s approval, as measured by Gallup, stood Monday at 36 percent — a stunning new low. The financial markets seem a bit shaky as investors worry about the administration’s competence. If this were a business, the chief executive would be reading up on Chapter 11. <br> During the campaign, Trump was nothing if not headstrong. Yet in office he has let others lead — and is getting nowhere. He could still change course. He could get rid of the sycophantic aides who spend so much time blaming each other. He could focus on parts of his agenda, such as infrastructure, that have popular support, including among Democrats. <br> But that would mean acknowledging his mistakes thus far.

 Tom Davis, a Republican from Virginia, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2008 and twice chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of the Republican conference. <br> Two months does not make a presidency or define a Congress. But unless the current trajectory is reversed, the Trump administration faces a difficult midterm that could undo its agenda and put House gavels and subpoena power in Democratic hands. <br> It is no exaggeration to say that the 2018 midterm campaign has already begun, with disruptive town hall meetings, party advertising and aggressive fundraising all underway. Democratic candidate-recruiting efforts are in high gear, and two upcoming special House elections in districts President Trump won, in Georgia and Montana, will see millions of dollars spent by both sides in efforts to create the narrative and momentum for next year’s contests. <br> The collapse of House Republicans’ push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act not only exposes the long-standing fissures in the House GOP caucus but also emboldens Democrats to avoid any participation in legislative deliberations. It recalls the old adage: “If your opponents are committing suicide, don’t stand in their way.” <br> Midterm elections are relatively low-turnout affairs, and history shows that angry voters tend to dominate that turnout model. That is what happened in 2006 for Democrats and 2010 for Republicans. Right now, Democratic voters feel angry and aggrieved while Republicans are divided and dispirited. Republicans have proved they can be a potent opposition party but have, so far, failed in graduating to a governance party. Moreover, legislative stalemate will give the Democrats the ability to present themselves as the party of change, with a wider appeal to independent voters. <br> The collapse of the Republican health-care bill was a massive case of legislative malpractice. But playing the blame game and pointing fingers do little to advance the ball. The Republican conference has no Plan B. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) is the only member with the legislative gravitas and fundraising base to lead such a diverse group. The caucus should use this failure as a teachable moment. The American Health Care Act faced united opposition from such disparate groups as the American Medical Association, AARP, the American Hospital Association and the insurance industry, as well as the Koch brothers and the Club for Growth. Republican leaders badly lost the messaging war on a bill few had read and the public didn’t understand. The predictable Congressional Budget Office score didn’t help matters. <br> What is ironic about this situation is that the bill was never going to become law. It was merely the first step in a legislative process that may well have yielded a more popular measure. But as a branding exercise for Republicans, it was a disaster. Note that midterm elections now operate more in the parliamentary model, where voters opt for or against the party in power and where individual legislative votes matter less. Case in point: Half of the Democrats who ran in competitive districts in 2010 and had voted against the Affordable Care Act lost their reelections anyway, as their candidacies were viewed by voters as a chance to send a message for or against President Barack Obama. <br> With Trump’s approval numbers in the dangerously low 40 percent range and a restless Republican base, the GOP faces a treacherous path. Leaders must choose their next steps carefully. Tax reform, or even tax cuts, could be even more difficult to accomplish than health care in terms of pitting deficit hawks and special interests against any reform. <br> Infrastructure plans also require money that could otherwise be used to help finance tax reductions, although this area offers some opportunity for immediate job creation and Democratic support to offset intraparty GOP divisions. <br> Even such basic moves as passing spending measures to cover the remainder of this fiscal year and lifting the debt ceiling will require Democratic votes — and whatever Democrats agree to is unlikely to be acceptable to large swaths of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. <br> My advice to the House GOP is: Get your act together or face losing the majority. There is time to recover from a difficult start. This will entail compromise and, in some cases, working with Democrats to get half a loaf. But your fumbling of health care puts you in a weakened bargaining position, and your internecine fighting dispirits the party base. As James Bond’s nemesis liked to say , “Choose your next move carefully, Mr. Bond. It may be your last.” <br> Read more here: <br> Marc A.

 Carl Levin, a Democrat, represented Michigan in the U.S. Senate from 1979 to 2015. <br> Front and center in the presidential campaign is tax avoidance by very wealthy individuals such as Donald Trump and highly profitable corporations such as Apple. <br> Use of unjustified tax loopholes by individuals and tax havens by multinational corporations has been tolerated for too long. Trump’s tax-avoidance schemes will remain at least partially hidden as long as he gets away with keeping his tax returns secret. But Apple’s tax gimmicks are well known. <br> The profits from Apple’s overseas sales of products designed and developed in the United States should be taxed in the United States. But Apple has until now dodged such U.S. taxes by transferring the rights to its intellectual property to itself in Ireland, through shell “subsidiaries” with few employees and little physical presence or tangible economic activity. <br> Apple even had the chutzpah to claim those Irish subsidiaries had no obligation to pay taxes anywhere, other than the token less than 1 percent it paid to Ireland under a special arrangement. <br> After a bipartisan Senate investigation led by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and me exposed Apple’s tax dodging in 2013, it was not surprising that Europe went after the company. Harder to understand is why the Internal Revenue Service has failed to stake a claim to U.S. taxes on that revenue for more than a decade. It has remained passive, and Europe stepped in to fill the vacuum. <br> Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS and the U.S. treasury for failing to challenge Apple’s tax avoidance. <br> Now, Treasury is attacking the European Commission for shutting down Apple’s tax dodging, even though the commission openly invited the United States and other countries to seek collection of whatever share of the back taxes they think is theirs. Instead of accepting that offer, Treasury is threatening a tax war. <br> The next administration should chart a new course. Curbing tax havens such as Ireland directly serves U.S. interests by helping to limit powerful tax incentives for U.S. corporations to move revenue offshore. U.S. firms already hold an incredible $2.4 trillion in profits overseas, mostly in tax havens, dodging an estimated $700 billion in U.S. taxes. <br> Corporate tax dodging denies the U.S. Treasury and U.S. communities resources they desperately need. The water crisis in Flint, Mich., is a tragic example of public services grown dangerous from lack of investment. All across the United States, pipes deliver low-quality water, roads crumble, bridges sag. AAA says motorists spend $3 billion a year repairing the havoc caused by potholes. Civil engineers estimate we need $3.6 trillion to fix all the infrastructure that’s broken. <br> But rather than doing their part to support the nation that helps make their success possible — and where their products are designed, developed and supported in many ways, including through tax credits and patent protection — some big U.S. corporations duck their responsibilities. Apple alone has stashed $215 billion in profits offshore, avoiding almost $66 billion in U.S. taxes, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. <br> U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew charges the European Commission with trying to collect taxes it’s not entitled to from U.S. companies. The irony is that the United States allows U.S. corporations to indefinitely postpone paying U.S. taxes on overseas profits, thanks to a loophole called “deferral.” If we maintain that other countries can’t tax those profits, and we effectively won’t tax them, then what we’re really saying is that globe-spanning U.S. companies shouldn’t be taxed on those profits at all, even though most U.S. companies can’t avoid taxes that way. <br> Sixty-five years ago, $1 out of every $3 collected in federal taxes came from corporations — now it’s $1 in $9 . And when corporations dodge their taxes, the rest of us pick up the tab by paying higher taxes ourselves, suffering defective public services or taking on more public debt. <br> The IRS has been passive for too long. The next administration should reinvigorate tax enforcement aimed at profitable multinational corporations paying little or no tax. It should also revamp the regulations used by multinational companies in unintended ways to dodge U.S. taxes on their offshore profits. <br> Congress should also do its part by enacting legislation to stop some of the worst abuses. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and others are championing the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act. Another bill would charge corporations an “exit tax,” such as what Hillary Clinton has proposed, if they abandon the United States — collecting the deferred taxes on their offshore cash. Other bills would make it harder for tax-dodging multinational companies to access their overseas profits tax-free or deny them federal contracts. There’s also a bill to end the deferral tax loophole altogether. <br> The United States should act to end corporate tax dodging and start going after the $100 billion we lose each year due to profit shifting, instead of criticizing other countries willing to take on highly profitable and powerful multinational corporations. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Fareed Zakaria: How Trump exposed the corruption in the U.S. tax code <br> Catherine Rampell: Please don’t tell anyone, but tax cheating is about to rise in the U.S. <br> The Post’s View: Europe’s cash grab from Apple makes corporate tax reform more urgent <br> Jim Roumell: When it comes to taxes, there’s never been a better time to be a U.S. multinational <br> Robert J.

 As a conservative, I’m thrilled by the arrival of unified Republican government. But the politician I’m most grateful to in Washington today is not President Trump, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). <br> It’s Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). <br> That’s because the Senate minority leader is doing more than anyone in our nation’s capital to ensure the passage of the most conservative health-care and tax reform possible — while working overtime to make sure that Democrats who voted for Trump in 2016 stay in the GOP fold in 2018 and beyond. <br> The biggest fear many conservatives had after the 2016 election was that Trump would be too quick to cut deals with the Democrats. Trump holds heterodox positions on everything from spending, foreign policy and entitlements to the minimum wage, trade and health care. If Democrats were smart, they would have reached across the aisle to Trump and offered to work with him. Trump is a dealmaker, not an ideologue. He would have loved nothing better than to cut deals with Schumer. Indeed, Trump reportedly called Schumer the morning after the election offering to do just that. <br> Instead of accepting Trump’s outstretched hand, Schumer’s Democrats are opposing virtually everything that Trump does. They are attempting to block not only his Cabinet nominees (Schumer even voted against Elaine Chao, wife of the majority leader and paragon of the GOP establishment, for transportation secretary) but also his sub-Cabinet appointments. And they have expressed zero interest in working with him on bipartisan legislation. The battle cry of the Democratic Party is “Resist!” <br> This unrelenting resistance has pushed Trump to the right. Since Trump knows he can’t get Democratic votes for his health and tax plans, he does not need to make any concessions to win over Democrats. Conservatives criticizing the Trump-Ryan health-care plan as “Obamacare lite” should take a moment to consider how much worse the legislation would be if Schumer had decided to sit down with Trump at the bargaining table. <br> Imagine what might have happened if Schumer had greeted Trump’s post-inaugural outreach by publicly declaring: “I know Donald Trump well. He gave more money to me than to any other senator. We worked together for years. And I look more forward to working with him as president. We agree on a lot of things, and where we do agree I will be his strongest ally in Congress. Where we disagree, I will try to bring him over to our side, because Trump is nothing if not flexible. And where we can’t cut a deal, we will let the democratic process sort it out.” It would have been Schumer with Trump in the White House bowling alley, hammering out their differences on health care, instead of the members of the Freedom Caucus. Trump would have cut deal after deal with Schumer. <br> This would have been smart policy, and it would have been smart politics — allowing Schumer to sow divisions between Trump and the more conservative elements of the GOP caucus who would have bristled at his bipartisanship. But Democrats are in such a hysterical state right now that they are not interested in bipartisanship. They want to destroy Trump. As a result, Schumer is passing up golden opportunities to win policy victories and divide Republicans — all in an effort to placate his Trump-deranged, far-left base. <br> Conservatives should be thrilled by this. Schumer is not only pushing Trump to the right but also helping Republicans consolidate and grow their congressional majorities — by further alienating once-reliably Democratic blue-collar voters who abandoned the party in the last election. Last summer, Schumer dismissed these voters with the back of his hand, declaring that “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.” <br> It didn’t work out that way. While Democrats won Illinois, they lost Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and even Michigan. The Post reports that of the nearly 700 counties that twice voted for Obama, “a stunning one-third flipped to support Trump” in 2016. That means there are millions of Obama voters out there who were sick of Democrats such as Schumer dismissing their concerns and decided they wanted to give Trump a chance. <br> Now they see Democrats responding to their decision by digging in their heels and resisting and obstructing everything that Trump does — from staffing his administration to legislating on Capitol Hill. <br> The Democrats’ message to Middle America is: We don’t hear you. <br> There could be nothing better for the GOP — and nothing worse for the 10 Democratic senators who are up for reelection in 2018 in red states that voted for Trump. Republicans need to pick up only eight seats to win a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, in which case they won’t need Democrats for anything. <br> So thank you, Chuck Schumer! Let’s hope he continues to lead the resistance. Let’s hope he continues to block Trump’s agenda and forces vulnerable Senate Democrats to be Trump obstructionists. If Republicans don’t blow the opportunity, the result will be legislation that is more conservative — and expanded congressional majorities in 2018. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Sorry, poor people of America. Republicans are quietly sealing all the exits on the poverty trap. <br> It’s a four-part process, in which officials at all levels of government are taking part: <br> First, reduce poor women’s access to the reproductive services they need to prevent unintended pregnancies, so they have less control over when, and with whom, they have children. <br> Second, make it harder for any unexpectedly expecting women to have abortions. <br> Third, make the adoption process more expensive, reducing incentives for other families to adopt the babies resulting from these unplanned pregnancies. (Yes, amazingly, Republicans plan to do this.) <br> Finally, cut the services these involuntarily growing low-income families rely on to help support and care for their children, and to move up in the world. <br> Let’s take a walk through the policies that constitute this poverty-prolonging policy four-step, shall we? <br> It begins with House Republicans’ American Health Care Act, which would eliminate all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. <br> Federal dollars are already barred from being used for abortions; the AHCA would prevent federal funds from being used for any other Planned Parenthood service, too. This is unfortunate, given that Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of contraceptive care for poor women in the country. Some of its patients would be able to find other providers of reliable, effective contraception, but many wouldn’t. In more than 100 counties, Planned Parenthood is the only clinic providing publicly supported contraceptive services to poor women, according to the Guttmacher Institute. <br> In its analysis of the health-care bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that about 15 percent of people who live in areas without other clinics or medical practitioners serving low-income populations would lose access to care — leading to more unintended pregnancies. <br> Now consider that at the state level, Republican officials have been aggressively curbing access to abortion, by banning the procedure after 20 weeks, imposing impossible-to-meet regulatory and licensing requirements on providers, and implementing waiting periods. As a result — and by design, of course — the women who do get pregnant without planning to will be less likely to terminate their pregnancies, even if they are not interested in having a baby. (Incidentally, Medicaid would pay for many of these births; the CBO’s Trumpcare analysis estimated that eliminating Planned Parenthood funding for just a year would leave Medicaid on the hook for “several thousand” additional births.) <br> What options do these women have, then? <br> Pro-life conservatives often urge women seeking abortions to consider adoption instead. But under the House Republicans’ tax plan, adoptions would get more expensive. <br> You read that right. <br> The House leadership’s “A Better Way” blueprint calls for dramatically cutting tax rates, especially for the rich. It partly pays for these rate cuts by eliminating some credits and deductions. Among those set to go? The adoption tax credit. <br> Adopting a child can be enormously expensive, running into tens of thousands of dollars. This tax credit was designed to offset some of those costs, up to $13,460 per child, though the credit phases out for higher earners. In 2014, about 74,000 families claimed the credit, costing the government about $355 million, according to Internal Revenue Service data. <br> For context, the mortgage-interest deduction, which the Republican tax-reform plan would preserve, will cost the federal government about $69 billion this year — about 200 times as much. <br> I doubt Republicans have anything against adoptive parents; in fact, one of the architects of the House tax plan, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), is himself an adoptive parent (though at a recent speech, he noted that he did not qualify for the adoption tax credit because his family was in the “wrong tax bracket”). Promoting adoption is just not their priority, pro-life rhetoric to the contrary. <br> In any case, whatever Republicans’ intentions, the elimination of this tax credit would mean that at least on the margin, women who became pregnant accidentally would have fewer options. <br> Which leads us, finally, to President Trump’s newly released budget. <br> Trump’s budget would dramatically slash the social safety net, especially services for the poor, and especially services for poor families. It would cut housing and energy subsidies for low-income households, as well as after-school, before-school and summer programs that millions of parents depend on. Moreover, it would decimate many of the programs that low-income parents and children rely on to climb out of poverty, including job training, college assistance and community banking. <br> Thus the cumulative effect of Republicans’ family policies: force poor people to have more children than they want or believe they can afford, then tell them and their children that they’re on their own. <br> So much for family values.   <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Timothy Stoltzfus Jost: The GOP health-care bill is all about shortchanging the poor <br> Andy Slavitt: The House Republicans’ health-care bill is a thicket of bad incentives <br> E.J.

 In 2012, Barack Obama won Macomb County, Mich., by 16,000 votes. Four years later, Hillary Clinton lost the same county by three times that — a 64,000-vote swing in a state that Donald Trump won by only 10,000 votes overall. In February, Democracy Corps’s Stan Greenberg conducted a focus group in Macomb with Democrats and independents who shifted to Trump after voting at least once for Obama to see whether they might return to the Democrats in the future. What issue came up most? “The cost of health care dominated the discussion in these focus groups,” Greenberg writes. “They speak of the impossibly high costs and hope Trump will bring ‘affordable healthcare.’ ” <br> The GOP leadership’s disastrously designed replacement for Obamacare has only highlighted the fact that millions of Americans struggle with the rising costs of health care. Instead of offering their own plan to fix and build on Obamacare, though, Democrats have opted to simply let the Republicans fail. The strategy could cost them in the long run. <br> Even before the new president and Congress were sworn in, Democrats had settled on “stay quiet.” Politico reported in February that although Democrats will “publicly goad Trump on subjects he’s clearly sensitive about . . . on other issues, like Obamacare and tax reform, they’ll get out of the way and let Trump and House Republicans fall on their face.” With some exceptions, such as Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), most of the Democratic caucus has stuck to that plan. <br> There is a certain logic to this approach. In a debate, you don’t interrupt while your opponent is floundering. Creating a Democratic alternative would give the GOP something to unite against. It could also alienate health-care-industry interests — doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical lobbies and so on — that might otherwise rally to Democratic candidates. <br> But the cost of health care is not a news cycle to be won. It is a major, everyday problem that represents a key test for voters of whether a politician or party is serious about addressing their concerns. It’s not just Macomb voters who want answers: Two-thirds of Americans believe lowering health-care costs should be a “top priority” for lawmakers. <br> The Affordable Care Act’s defenders will point out that the main goal of the law was to reduce the number of uninsured, that the law probably slowed the rise of premiums and that most people with plans purchased on the ACA exchanges are happy with their premiums and deductibles (though that majority has shrunk since the exchanges opened). All these arguments are true. They are also cold comfort to people facing still-rising costs, with premiums for employee plans climbing 50 percent in the past eight years. This is reflected in the fact that, even as the ACA’s approval rating ticks into positive territory for the first time, few believe the law is perfect. In a February NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 4 percent of respondents said they thought the law was “working well the way it is.” In poll after poll, most who support the law still say it needs fixing. <br> This is where Democrats will shout: “Clinton did have a health-care policy!” That’s true, but her campaign didn’t make much use of it. A recent study found that more than 60 percent of the ads Clinton and her allies ran were focused solely on the candidates’ personalities, rather than policy, “a huge difference from every other presidential campaign” since 2000. (Yes, that includes Trump — 70 percent of his side’s ads had at least some mention of policy.) It should not be surprising that Clinton’s health-care plans didn’t move most voters. <br> Even some conservatives recognize that the GOP rollout leaves an opening. On Tuesday, Trump ally Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of the conservative media company Newsmax, wrote that Trump “should be sticking to his guns on healthcare reform” — i.e., his repeated support for universal coverage — instead of following the House GOP’s plan. Ruddy goes so far as to suggest that Trump back a Medicaid-for-all plan. After all, Ruddy points out, that position helped “him win Democratic states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.” <br> Rather than stay on the sidelines, Democrats in Congress should introduce and promote a new health-care plan. The outlines of such a plan are straightforward: expand Medicare and Medicaid, create a public option for everyone else that can use those programs’ pricing power, push regulatory reforms to lower drug prices, and give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices. Many progressives would prefer a Medicare-for-all system, but this plan would satisfy most of the party, and it has the political advantage of being closely tied to the extremely popular Medicare program. <br> More important, it’s a real policy solution that could appeal to millions of struggling Americans, regardless of whom they voted for in November. Voters want solutions, not silence. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Dana Milbank: The Republican health-care plan’s top critics?

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> WITH CHARACTERISTIC incoherence, the White House simultaneously boasted that leaked data from President Trump’s 2005 tax return demonstrates that Mr. Trump paid his fair share of taxes and denounced the “dishonest media” for publishing these flattering facts. But there would be no need for reporters to “illegally” publish such information, to quote the White House’s absurd accusation against MSNBC and investigative journalist David Cay Johnston, if Mr. Trump himself had simply honored the decades-old tradition of releasing his returns while still a candidate for the office he now holds. The bizarre response to the leak only deepens the mystery as to why he still refuses. <br> To be sure, the new information tends to refute a widely held theory: that Mr. Trump is loath to reveal how little tax he actually pays. In 2005, at least, he paid $38 million, or about a quarter of his taxable income, to the Internal Revenue Service. That’s a higher share than his predecessor atop the GOP ticket, Mitt Romney, reported. No scandal there, though it’s worth noting that this relatively high rate was due almost entirely to the alternative minimum tax, a device for canceling out tax avoidance by the rich that Mr. Trump has proposed eliminating. Keep that in mind when evaluating the White House’s promise that Mr. Trump is focused not on his past returns but on “tax reform that will benefit all Americans.” <br> Unless and until Mr. Trump releases his returns, including all supporting materials, we are entitled to assume that he has something to hide, whether it’s embarrassingly chintzy charitable contributions, chronic exaggerations of his wealth, business ties to Russia — or some combination of the three. Even tax returns would not constitute sufficient disclosure for a man whose business affairs stretch across states and around the world, as Mr. Trump’s do. The public is entitled to a detailed explanation of all that, as well. It’s true that, shortly before Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump pledged to separate himself from his business empire, which was a step in the right direction. But he did so without specifying the extent of his exposure before he signed away operations to his sons. We have no idea of the status quo prior to Mr. Trump’s claimed recusal. <br> For the first time in recent history, the presidency belongs to a man with extensive active business investments, creating the potential for conflicts of interest on a correspondingly unprecedented scale. Mr. Trump’s response demonstrates ethical cluelessness at best and contempt for this country’s long-standing democratic norms at worst. <br> Tax Day is April 18. Mr. Trump has an opportunity to mark the occasion by releasing his Form 1040 for 2016, just as his predecessors made their income tax returns public while serving. If he wants to engender public trust in his leadership, he’ll seize that chance. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: Trump’s gift to Americans: Making it easier to cheat on their taxes <br> The Post’s View: Trump can help Americans trust him by releasing his taxes <br> Mihir Desai and Edward Kleinbard: A win-win path to getting the Trump tax information that really matters <br> The Post’s View: The Trump team can’t even keep its own excuses straight on his broken tax promises <br> The Post’s View: Trump owes us his tax returns now more than ever <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Correction: This op-ed has been updated to correct the name of the Republican Senate leader who supported the Congressional Budget Office during the Reagan administration. The leader was Howard Baker of Tennessee. <br> Alice M. Rivlin was the founding director of the Congressional Budget Office and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget in the Clinton administration. She co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Debt Reduction Task Force and serves as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. <br> Congress faces a daunting legislative agenda: Health care is “complicated,” as President Trump recently discovered. So are tax reform and spending bills that reflect campaign promises without escalating debt. <br> There are deep divisions over many of the Trump administration’s proposals — including within the president’s own party — and there will be serious disputes about the costs of many proposals and their effects. Congress needs all the help it can get from the team of neutral experts it created for just these moments: the Congressional Budget Office. <br> Some members of Congress and the administration have recently questioned the need for CBO estimates, such as the assessment of the Republican health-care bill released Monday. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said last week that he would sooner accept an analysis from the Office of Management and Budget, whose director was appointed by Trump, than the CBO. <br> But these two offices have two very different jobs, as I discovered as both the first director of the CBO and later as the director of the OMB in the Clinton administration. The CBO serves Congress; the OMB serves the president. Given the constitutional separation of executive and legislative powers, both offices are needed. <br> Spicer’s view is not surprising. All presidents passionately favor their own proposals and are optimistic about what they will cost and how much good they will do. When I ran the OMB, we often thought our congressional counterpart did not appreciate how great our proposals were — especially the ill-fated Clinton health plan, which the CBO thought would have a much more negative impact on the budget than we alleged. <br> But Congress is an independent branch of government that needs its own team of neutral experts before it decides on legislation. Fortunately, the CBO has a strong team. It won’t get everything right — it originally overestimated the costs of the Affordable Care Act, primarily because it expected more people to sign up — but it will do its best to sort through the complexity of these proposals and give Congress the benefit of its best judgment. <br> For 42 years, the CBO has earned congressional and public respect by providing neutral, nonpartisan estimates of costs and effects of pending legislation, including analyses of alternative policy options. It has a long-established tradition of able leadership and highly qualified, hard-working staff. It is a valuable resource for Congress that both parties need. <br> Congress created the CBO during the constitutional crises that emerged when President Richard Nixon refused to spend funds that had been appropriated by Congress and signed by him. Outrage at executive overreach prompted Congress to pass the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974, which reestablished Congress as an equal partner with the executive branch in deciding the country’s fiscal and legislative policies. The new law strengthened the congressional budget process by creating two budget committees and a nonpartisan, independent Congressional Budget Office to provide estimates and budget analyses to both the House and the Senate — for Democrats, Republicans and independents alike. <br> This administration is not the first to misunderstand the role of the CBO. The supply-side economists in the nascent Reagan administration held extremely optimistic views about the big jump in economic growth anticipated by President Ronald Reagan’s proposed tax cuts. Because administration officials feared that the CBO might question their “rosy scenario,” they suggested ousting me as CBO director. But Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), supported by Republican leader Howard Baker (Tenn.), quickly informed the White House that the CBO worked for Congress — not the president — and that meddling with it was not appropriate. <br> Undermining the credibility of the CBO when policymakers need it most harms not only Congress’s ability to do its job, but also the long-term effectiveness of political parties in addressing the challenges that face our country’s future. <br> Republicans in Congress must make the transition from opposing to governing, as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has emphasized. Governing is hard, and it will be much harder if every member of Congress can pick and choose among estimates of the costs and consequences of the complex proposals under consideration. To address the daunting legislative agenda before them and legislate in the best interest of the country, Congress needs to use the great resource that it has in the CBO. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> The Post’s View: The GOP’s mind-blowing hypocrisy on the CBO <br> Douglas Holtz-Eakin: The American Health Care Act is a good start <br> Andy Slavitt: The House Republicans’ health-care bill is a thicket of bad incentives <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Michèle Flournoy, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, was undersecretary of defense for policy from 2009 to 2012. <br> In his address Tuesday to Congress, President Trump promised to make sure that the U.S. military gets what it needs to carry out its mission by securing “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” More funding would surely be a good thing, although the issues of how much and what for are complicated. No one should be under any illusions that a higher Defense Department top line guarantees a more capable armed forces. <br> Trump is reportedly seeking $54 billion over the sequester caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which would bring 2018 defense spending to $603 billion. While Trump may view this proposal as historic, it’s only 3 percent more than President Barack Obama’s final budget request. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee has called for a much larger increase — to nearly $640 billion. <br> And as the post-9/11 defense buildup taught us, throwing more money at the Pentagon is not a panacea. What matters is how the money is spent. So what should we look for in the president’s budget request? <br> First, how is spending allocated across readiness, force structure and modernization? <br> There is broad consensus in the Pentagon and Congress that the most urgent priority is addressing readiness shortfalls that affect the military’s ability to respond quickly to crises and other near-term demands. Every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has highlighted readiness problems — such as inadequate training time and maintenance and replacement of equipment — as a source of accumulating risk. While Congress’s willingness to provide war funding — “overseas contingency operations” funds — above baseline defense spending has helped, it has not solved the problem. <br> The larger challenge will be striking the right balance between building a bigger force and building a better one. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has rightly defined his priority as building a “larger, more capable, and more lethal joint force” to contend with a more challenging international security environment and increasingly capable adversaries. But there are tradeoffs between paying for additional personnel and force structure vs. investing in the technology and capabilities necessary to prevail in more contested air, land, maritime, cyber and space domains. Although some increases in force size may be warranted, such as a larger Navy fleet and modest increases elsewhere, the dramatic across-the-board hikes in force structure that Trump proposed during his campaign are both unaffordable and unwise. <br> The bulk of any additional defense investment must focus on maintaining and extending our technological and warfighting edge, including in cyber, electronic and anti-submarine arenas, unmanned systems, automation, long-range striking and protected communications. U.S. military leaders should moderate their appetite for a bigger force today to protect critical investments in cutting-edge capabilities that will determine whether we succeed on the battlefield tomorrow. <br> Second, are deterrence and alliance capabilities being strengthened? <br> Critical to the United States’ ability to deter aggression and prevent conflict in regions where we have vital interests is deploying U.S. military forces forward and helping allies and partners build their own defense capacity. Some of these costs, such as those associated with routinely deploying naval forces around the world, reside in the base defense budget. Others, such as the European Reassurance Initiative, will be covered by annual overseas contingency funding. Still others, such as helping Israel field more robust missile defense systems, are enabled by the State Department’s foreign military financing. These investments, although relatively small in dollars, are disproportionately important to reducing the risk of more costly U.S. military engagements. <br> Third, does the budget keep faith with the men and women who serve? Any budget that claims to strengthen the U.S. military must put people first. Doing so requires reform. For example, does the budget adopt sensible reforms to military health care to improve quality while reining in costs? Does it improve education and professional development? Does it enable more flexible career paths to retain the best and brightest? Does it include a round of Base Realignment and Closure to shed the 30 percent of infrastructure the service chiefs say they no longer need, enabling savings to be reinvested in better training and equipment for those we send into harm’s way? <br> Fourth, how will we pay for the increased defense spending? The Trump administration has promised dollar-for-dollar cuts in non-defense programs, reportedly targeting the State Department and USAID for cuts of 30percent or more. This would create an even more imbalanced national security toolkit, limiting our ability to prevent crises through diplomacy and development and result in an overreliance on the military. As Mattis said while head of the U.S. Central Command, “If you don’t fully fund the State Department, then I need to buy more ammunition.” This approach also is unlikely to fly in Congress. Absent a larger budget deal that includes tax reform and reins in non-discretionary spending on Social Security and Medicare, the most likely result is a larger deficit. <br> Finally, if this defense spending increase isn’t part of a larger budget deal providing predictable spending levels for the next several years, it won’t have the desired impact. If the Pentagon is forced to operate under the threat of sequestration, it will not have the predictability necessary to make smart multiyear investments in the capabilities on which our security will hinge. <br> Trump is right to raise the need for more defense dollars, but Congress should scrub his request carefully to ensure that the money is spent wisely and not at the expense of non-defense programs that are critical to U.S. national security. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s bad math on the budget <br> Ruth Marcus: Donald Trump’s utterly ridiculous budget plan <br> Catherine Rampell: The Trump White House is already cooking the books <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 A prime-time address to Congress is the most-watched speech a president delivers. About 52.4 million tuned in for President Barack Obama’s first address in 2009, more than any other he delivered during his eight years in office. So when President Trump steps up to the rostrum of the House of Representatives for the first time on Tuesday night, he will address what could very well be the biggest audience of his entire term. <br> How will Trump use that once-in-a-presidency opportunity? He should use it to make the Democrats own their strategy of obstruction by reaching out his hand in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation — and daring them to refuse it. <br> Since Trump took office, Democrats have adopted a single theme: Resist! They have refused to support the majority of his Cabinet nominees, much less cooperate with him on any legislative priorities. This is the Democrats’ Achilles heel. They are so blinded by hate that they cannot bring themselves to work with Trump even on the areas where they could forge agreement. <br> While this may make their base happy, it is only serving to further alienate millions of once-Democratic voters in middle America who abandoned the party in the last election. Of the nearly 700 counties that twice voted for Obama, The Post reports, “a stunning one-third flipped to support Trump” in 2016. The strategy of obstruction is sending a message to these Obama-Trump voters that national Democrats did not get the message they sent in the 2016 election. <br> [What ‘President Promise-Keeper’ should say on Tuesday night] <br> Trump should use his address on Tuesday to make this fact crystal clear for the American people. He should lay out a positive, hopeful vision for how he plans to “make America great again.” He should not shy away from the many areas where they will disagree but should point out that there are also many areas where they can work together to improve the lives of those forgotten Americans who sent him to Washington — and then challenge the seething Democrats before him to join him in that effort. <br> Trump should do so not out of some gauzy, false hope of reconciliation. Democrats are not interested in reconciliation. Rather, he should do it because it is tactically the smart thing to do. Trump should wrap the Democrats’ hate around their necks and use it to drive a wedge between their party and the vast center of the country that feels the Democratic coastal elites no longer represent them. If Democrats wake up, stop resisting everything and start cutting deals, that’s great. If not, let them pay a political price for it. <br> Trump should declare that he will repeal Obamacare, but he should also point out that the reason Obamacare failed was that it was pushed through Congress without any effort to win bipartisan support. He should say he wants to replace Obamacare with bipartisan reform that includes the best ideas from both parties. If Democrats refuse, it will expose the fact that they want Republicans to repeal Obamacare without a replacement so that they can win political points when the system collapses and millions lose their health-care coverage. Trump should call them on it by asking them to join him in a bipartisan effort to protect those Americans. Let the Democrats say no. <br> Trump should make clear that he can pass tax reform without Democrats but that it would be better for the country if they were to do it together. He should point out that there are many areas of bipartisan agreement with mainstream Democrats, invite them to work with him on a bipartisan plan — and tie it to his plan to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. Let Democrats say no. <br> [Trump’s budget takes shape, and it’s sounding awfully familiar] <br> Trump should ask Democrats to join him in a bipartisan effort to revitalize our inner cities. He should ask Democrats to work with him to increase funding for programs to train and assist local police, reform and strengthen the social safety net, improve educational opportunities by expanding vocational and technical education, and give poor parents the same right as wealthy parents to choose where to send their children to school. Let the Democrats say no. <br> Trump should ask Democrats to work with him to support working mothers by allowing Americans to deduct child-care and elder-care expenses from their taxes and by creating tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts with matching contributions for low-income families. Let the Democrats say no. <br> If Trump lays out a positive agenda and asks for support from Democrats, it will put them in a bind. Their base will not countenance any cooperation that “legitimizes” Trump. But refusing to cooperate could backfire, especially for the 10 Senate Democrats who are fighting to retain their seats in states Trump won. But to do that, Trump must sound a hopeful, optimistic tone — something that, to date, he has declined to do. <br> If Democrats want to resist everything, fine — then make them resist bipartisanship. <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The Internal Revenue Service has just released its latest estimate of the “tax gap” — the difference between what Americans pay in taxes and what they actually owe. For the years 2008 to 2010 (the IRS’s latest data), the annual gap averaged a huge $458 billion. It’s surely higher now. <br> If everyone religiously paid every penny owed, budget deficits would shrink dramatically. This isn’t about to happen, for reasons I’ll explain in a moment, but first let’s take a closer look at the tax gap. <br> It represents slightly less than a fifth of the total tax liability. Americans pay the other four-fifths voluntarily, if not always enthusiastically. <br> Put differently, the $458 billion is 18.3 percent of the estimated $2.496 trillion of taxes owed annually for the three-year period. The IRS expects to collect $52 billion annually of the unpaid amounts through late payments, audits and enforcement actions. This would reduce the final tax gap to $406 billion, or 16.3 percent of total tax liability. <br> In general, the more income that is subject to mandatory reporting and withholding, the higher the compliance rate. Most wage and salary payments must be automatically reported to the government; the compliance rate is about 99 percent. By contrast, the compliance rate of taxpayers where there is no automatic reporting and withholding — for example, on farm and small-business income — is 63 percent. And, obviously, most income from criminal activity is not reported. <br> Individuals — including the self-employed — account for most of the tax gap. For the years 2008-2010, they represented about 90 percent of the unpaid $458 billion. Most of this involved underreporting of income as opposed to underpayment of taxes due or not filing at all. <br> All this suggests three takeaways. <br> First, it’s possible to reduce the gap further by more enforcement. It makes no sense (as my colleague Catherine Rampell has repeatedly pointed out) for the Republican-led Congress to criticize the IRS for poor performance and, simultaneously, cut its budget. This limits the number of audits of tax evaders and tax cheats. It also reduces the size of tax compliance centers, where taxpayers can have questions answered by phone. We expect people to pay their taxes; the least we can do is help them understand what their taxes are. <br> Second, even if this problem were solved — which seems unlikely — it’s impossible, as a practical matter, to close the entire tax gap. This would require draconian measures such as universal audits and much steeper penalties. They would be hugely unpopular and, almost certainly, would trigger a fierce public backlash. Moreover, much of this exercise would be uneconomic: The IRS would spend as much or more in compliance costs as it would recover in small underpayments. <br> Finally, the tax gap is yet another reason for tax reform. The code’s complexity is a major cause of underpayment. Some of this is unintentional; taxpayers mistakenly deduct more than is allowed. But much is intentional; taxpayers dare the government to catch relatively modest income misstatements or excess deductions. A simpler system with fewer tax breaks and lower rates would limit these opportunities. <br> But this isn’t likely — as I pointed out in a recent column — because too many Americans are wedded to existing tax breaks: say, the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions. Little wonder the IRS is so unpopular. We expect it to do an efficient job of collecting tax revenue when the underlying system is hopelessly inefficient. It has been charged with a mission impossible. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: A chance for tax reform? <br> George F.

 Almost exactly a year ago, I suggested a rule of thumb for evaluating candidates’ economic agendas: The more growth a politician promises, the worse his or her economic plan probably is. <br> Why? Because it suggests they had to make extra-rosy assumptions to get their math to work. <br> Supercharged growth implies higher tax revenue, as well as lower spending on means-tested programs such as Medicaid and unemployment insurance. As a result, astronomical economic growth is often used to paper over the astronomically large deficits that would result under more realistic assumptions. <br> As President Trump assembles his fiscal agenda, that rule of thumb is coming in handy once again. <br> [Anyone home in Trumpville?] <br> Astonishingly, the White House still hasn’t released details for any of the major economic initiatives Trump promised during the campaign (a “terrific” Obamacare replacement, a top-to-bottom tax overhaul, massive infrastructure investment). But thanks to recent leaks about the administration’s economic book-cooking, we at least know that whatever Trump ultimately proposes will be very, very expensive. <br> After the election, the Trump transition team began the long, arduous process of putting together the presidential budget. As is always the case, it worked with the (non-political) career staffers at the Council of Economic Advisers. <br> Normally this process starts by asking the CEA staff to estimate baseline economic growth under current policies. These professionals then build on this baseline to forecast how the president’s proposals will affect the overall economy, as well as budget deficits. <br> The end results are often more optimistic than what independent forecasters predict — the White House is factoring in new policies it believes are pro-growth, after all — but not wildly so. The numbers still need to be credible. <br> Like I said, that’s how things normally work. Not this time around. <br> As the Wall Street Journal first reported (and as I’ve independently confirmed through my own sources), the Trump transition team instead ordered CEA staffers to predict sustained economic growth of 3 to 3.5 percent. The staffers were then directed to backfill all the other numbers in their models to produce these growth rates. <br> Set aside for a moment the sheer intellectual dishonesty of this approach. Let me first offer context for how nutty such a forecast would be. <br> Inflation-adjusted economic growth over the past decade has been under 2 percent. And independent projections for the coming decade are equally lackluster, thanks in part to population aging. The Federal Reserve, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and private forecasters predict about 1.8 to 1.9 percent annual growth. <br> In other words, based on nothing but expediency, the Trump team prophesies growth that’s more than a full percentage point higher than almost anyone else expects. <br> Even conservative economists who believe that a tax-cutting, deregulatory agenda will unleash pent-up growth must find Trump’s forecasts-by-fiat hard to swallow. <br> On an American Economic Association panel last month, Columbia Business School dean Glenn Hubbard — who chaired George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers and advised the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush — discussed the consequences of Trump’s agenda. He estimated that “reasonable or upper-bound estimates” for sustained economic growth would be about 2.75 percent. And to be clear, many economists find even that prediction Pollyannaish. <br> During the campaign, Trump made no secret of his disdain for experts, economic or otherwise. He has since doubled down on this view by demoting the CEA chair from his Cabinet. Not that the demotion really matters at this point; a month into his presidency, Trump hasn’t named a single political appointee to the council. <br> [I didn’t think I’d ever leave the CIA. But because of Trump, I quit.] <br> Given this recent Argentine-style data manipulation decree, perhaps no one respectable is willing to take the job. <br> Trump and his team have likewise openly disparaged federal statistics. He has called the unemployment rate “phony” and “a total fiction.” The administration is also reportedly trying to manipulate the official trade statistics. <br> In fairness, Trump is not the first politician to engage in voodoo economics or monkey with growth forecasts to make his own proposals look better. <br> During the 2016 presidential campaign, lots of Republican candidates and at least one Democratic candidate inflated their gross domestic product forecasts to make themselves appear less fiscally irresponsible. “Rosy Scenario” was also known to haunt the Reagan White House. <br> Of course, there are also risks to overpromising on growth — or on jobs, deficits, health-care affordability, trade or any other front on which Trump has pledged to repeal the laws of economics. That is, voters might remember your promises and punish you when you don’t deliver. Maybe Team Trump is counting on being able to backfill voter memories, too. <br> Read more: <br> Catherine Rampell: Bernie Sanders’s statistical shenanigans <br> Mark Sanford: Trump can’t Twitter-shame his way to economic growth <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s proposed tax ‘reform’ is hardly reform at all <br> Robert J.

 Let’s say you are a Trump voter, the kind we often hear about — an honest, hard-working American who put up with Donald Trump’s unusual behavior because you wanted a president who would stop playing Washington’s political games, bring a businessman’s obsession with action and results, and focus on the economy. How is that working out for you? <br> The first few weeks of President Trump’s administration have been an illustration of writer Alfred Montapert’s adage, “Do not confuse motion and progress. A rocking horse keeps moving but does not make any progress.” We are witnessing a rocking-horse presidency in which everyone is jerking back and forth furiously, yet there is no forward movement. <br> Since winning the election, Trump has dominated the news nearly every day. He has picked fights with the media, making a series of bizarre, mostly false claims — about the magnitude of his victory, the size of his inauguration crowd, the weather that day, the numbers of illegally cast ballots, among many others. He has had photo ops with everyone from Kanye West and Jack Ma to Shinzo Abe and Justin Trudeau. Now he is embroiled in a controversy about ties to Russia. But in the midst of it all, what has he actually done? Hardly anything. <br> [Reality will get its revenge on Donald Trump] <br> On Thursday, Trump said at a news conference, “There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time.” Matthew Yglesias of Vox observes that at this point in his presidency, Barack Obama had signed into law an almost-trillion-dollar stimulus bill to revive the economy, extended health insurance to 4 million children and made it easier to challenge discriminatory labor practices. In their respective first 100 days in office, FiveThirtyEight calculates, Bill Clinton had passed 24 bills; John Kennedy, 26; Harry Truman, 55; and FDR, 76. <br> Despite having a Republican House and Senate, Trump does not seem likely to crack 10 in his first 100 days. Yglesias notes that the Trump White House has not even begun serious discussions with Congress on major legislation. According to The Post, of the 696 positions that require Senate confirmation, the president has yet to nominate 661 of them. <br> Trump has issued a series of executive orders with great fanfare (though fewer than Obama at this point). But they are mostly hot air — lofty proclamations that direct some agency to “review” a law, “report” back to him, “consider” some action or reaffirm some long-standing practice. His one order that did something, the temporary travel ban, was so poorly conceived and phrased that it got stuck in the court system and will have to be rewritten or abandoned. For a recent piece in Politico Magazine, Zachary Karabell carefully analyzed all the executive orders and presidential proclamations and concluded, “So far, Trump has behaved exactly like he has throughout his previous career: He has generated intense attention and sold himself as a man of action while doing little other than promote an image of himself as someone who gets things done.” <br> Historian Douglas Brinkley recently observed that Trump is a creature of reality television, for which the two cardinal rules are: Always keep the cameras focused on you, and always stay interesting. The president has certainly fulfilled those mandates. But what about the ones he promised his voters? What about the plans to reindustrialize the Midwest, bring back jobs, and revive the coal and steel industries? What, for that matter, of his explicit commitments that “on Day One” he would begin “removing criminal illegal immigrants” and would “label China a currency manipulator,” “push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress” and “get rid of gun-free zones in schools, and . . . military bases”? All were promised. Almost nothing has been done. <br> [How could things get worse for Trump?] <br> There are two aspects to the Trump presidency. There is the freak show — the tweets, the wild claims, the fake facts, the fights with anyone who refuses to bow down to him (the media, judges), the ceaseless self-promotion. But then there is Trump the savvy businessman, who named intelligent heavyweights such as Gary Cohn, Rex Tillerson and Jim Mattis to key positions, and who has at times articulated a serious reform agenda. For many people, the bargain of the Trump presidency was that they would put up with the freak show in order to get tax reform, infrastructure projects and deregulation. That may still happen, but for now at least, reality TV is in overdrive, and not much is happening in the realm of serious policy. <br> That voter in Ohio or Michigan might well wonder how picking fights with the media will bring jobs back to his region or how assaulting the judiciary will help create retraining programs for laid-off workers. But maybe Donald Trump, who freely admits to getting most of his information from television, has a television view of the presidency. The point is to be seen doing things. The Romans said that the way to keep people happy was to give them “bread and circus.” So far, all we have gotten is the circus. <br> Read more from Fareed Zakaria’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Hugh Hewitt: Stop the Trump hysteria.

 In early January, House Speaker Paul Ryan met on the issue of tax reform with a delegation from the president-elect. Attending were future chief strategist and senior counselor Stephen K. Bannon, future chief of staff Reince Priebus, future senior adviser Jared Kushner, future counselor Kellyanne Conway and future senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. As the meeting began, Ryan pointedly asked, “Who’s in charge?” <br> It is still the right question. Former officials with deep knowledge of the presidency describe Donald Trump’s White House staff as top-heavy, with five or six power centers and little vertical structure. “The desire to be a big shot is overrunning any sense of team,” says one experienced Republican. “This will cause terrible dysfunction, distraction, disloyalty and leaks.” <br> Trump has run a family business but never a large organization. Nor has he seen such an organization as an employee. “Trump,” says another former official, “is ill-suited to appreciate the importance of a coherent chain of command and decision-making process. On the contrary, his instincts run instead toward multiple mini power centers, which rewards competing aggressively for Trump’s favor.” <br> This seems to be the dynamic unfolding on the weekend political talk shows. These have traditionally been venues for an administration to communicate with media and political elites (whose religion dedicates Sunday morning to the gods of policy, scandal and pith). But Trump surrogates are clearly appealing to a different audience: an audience of one, who may well tweet them a nice pat on the back. The goal — as Miller demonstrated over the weekend — is not to persuade or even explain. It is to confidently repeat Trump’s most absurd or unsubstantiated claims from the previous week. This time it was electorally decisive voter fraud in New Hampshire (for which there is no evidence). Next weekend it could be the harm done by vaccination, or the possible murder of Antonin Scalia (both of which Trump has raised in the past). It is the main function of Trump surrogates to restate Trump’s “alternative facts” in a steady voice. <br> It is hard for me (and everyone else outside the White House) to know exactly what is going on in the West Wing. Leaks may provide a distorted picture. But, in this case, there have been an awful lot of them, clearly from the highest levels. And they uniformly reveal a management structure and culture in which the highest goal is not to display competence or to display creativity but to display loyalty, defined as sucking up. The philosophy of competing power centers has, indeed, produced terrible dysfunction, distraction, disloyalty and leaks. Trump’s failed and frightening executive order on immigration is exhibit A. But now the National Security Council seems to be in a full-scale crisis of purpose, thoroughly demoralized and trying to discern American policy from presidential tweets. With the real NSC badly weakened by the travails of the national security adviser, it seems that Bannon is developing a shadow NSC to serve his well-developed nationalist agenda. <br> The president may thrive in chaos, but the presidency does not. A president needs aides who will give him honest information and analysis, not compete for his favor. This may even involve checking a president’s mistaken instincts. There will always be competing power centers in the West Wing. But the White House runs best when there is, according to a former White House official, “a strong chief of staff, empowered by the president to exercise absolute control over all logistics, decision-making processes and execution. He can have as many advisers as he wants, but until one person has full control over the process, chaos will persist.” <br> What does it mean to have a president who seems so hungry for affirmation and so influenced by slights? I recall (from working in George W. Bush’s White House) the briefing material that senior staff received before international visits. It always included detailed personality profiles of foreign leaders. Surely other intelligence services prepare the same way. Might Trump’s impulsive (and perhaps compulsive) reactions be manipulated by enemies and allies, either to allay or to enrage? <br> For whatever reason, Trump sees benefits in surrounding himself with a swarm of disorder and disruption. So far, that has helped produce relatively small, self-made crises. But what about the big ones caused by the relentless flow of events? The president will face challenges of amazing complexity that must be addressed in real time, without do-overs. Will the president be able to act swiftly, on the best information and the best advice? <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Dana Milbank: Trump’s one consistent policy: Chaos <br> Paul Waldman: This is what incompetence looks like <br> Josh Rogin: Inside Trump’s shadow national security council <br> David Ignatius: When it comes to his contacts with Russia, Michael Flynn has bigger problems than the Logan Act <br> David Ignatius: Michael Flynn: Trump is like the chariot driver in ‘Ben-Hur’ <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 PALO ALTO, Calif. <br> Imagine a successful Trump presidency. <br> That is the assignment I gave myself this week as I met with research fellows at the Hoover Institution, a free-market think tank located here on Stanford University’s campus, and with Stanford professors. Set aside the initial stumbles and Washington angst, and imagine how Donald Trump might build on his unexpected electoral victory. <br> I was taken aback by the first response. <br> “Well, it’s sad,” a conservative expert on politics replied when I asked the question. “Because he could have done something groundbreaking.” <br> Could have? Past tense? Already? <br> Yes, this person replied. Trump took office with a unique opportunity to triangulate between the two parties. With Republicans he could have enacted tax reform and rolled back regulations. With Democrats he could have pushed through a giant infrastructure bill, dividing the Democratic coalition (trade unions from teachers unions, Midwesterners from coastal elites). Presto: a new working coalition. <br> But Trump’s first three weeks were so disastrous and toxic to the opposition that he has made it impossible for Democrats to cooperate. “With all the noise about crowd size, the complaints about the march, the executive order, the attacks on judges — how can [Senate Minority Leader Charles] Schumer cooperate now?” he said. “He can’t.” <br> Undoubtedly the “resistance” has emerged far more quickly than anyone predicted. But surely, I thought, three weeks is a bit soon to say last rites over a 208-week presidency. <br> Unexpectedly, perhaps, a Never-Trump national security expert here, Kori Schake, agreed. <br> “I actually think there’s a strong optimistic case to be made,” she told me. <br> Government is so averse to risk, Schake argued, that many policies and processes have become “silted up.” Buying weapons takes too long and costs too much. Innovators stay away. <br> Trump complains about allies freeloading more rudely than did his predecessors, Schake noted, but the complaint isn’t new; maybe he can get somewhere. Similarly, he’s hardly the first president to promise in a campaign to help those left behind by trade; maybe he will be the one to do something about it. <br> “There’s a lot of stuff that needs fixing,” Schake said. “He’s going to break a lot of china, but there are opportunities to do things better.” <br> In practice, experts here such as Richard Epstein hope that means fewer regulations and lower taxes, which they say could spur investment — providing that the positive effects are not swamped by Trump-initiated trade wars or Trumpian interference in market decisions, such as telling companies where and how much to invest. <br> Overseas, the administration might seek stability via understandings with Russia and China. China could promise fairer access to its market for U.S. firms, less theft of intellectual property, maybe even more direct investment and job creation in the United States. <br> What would Trump give in return? Certainly an end to the annoying-to-China U.S. habit of talking about human rights and democracy. Smaller countries in the Pacific worry that he might give up a lot more. <br> “I think we are at risk of the president making a large number of high-octane bad deals,” Schake said. But setting “rules of the road for big-power behavior” has been a positive in past years and could be so again, she said. <br> Similarly, Russia might promise to withdraw gradually from eastern Ukraine, in return for a reduction of sanctions and America’s recognition that Ukraine would never be in NATO or America’s sphere of influence. Whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor such a promise is another question. <br> In any case, you can see something like a best-case scenario taking place. I should make clear: I don’t mean best-case in the sense of good policy. Personally I would not favor reducing regulations that, for example, protect stream beds in coal country. I don’t think it’s responsible to postpone entitlement reform, as Trump vows to do. Nor do I think that a values-free foreign policy is likely to be sustainable in the long term. <br> But you could imagine all of this translating into a reasonable short-term value proposition to voters three years from now: economic growth without too much inflation (for the moment), global stability, lower taxes. <br> The question is whether the administration has the discipline and finesse to pull off these difficult balancing acts. Was the lost opportunity of the first 20 days based on a strategic decision to double down on us-vs.-them, or on whim and resentment? And if the latter, will it become a learning opportunity? <br> “It will all come down to whether people feel like things are getting better for them,” said Stanford political scientist Morris P. Fiorina. “He could blunder into a successful presidency. It could also be a disaster.” <br> Read more from Fred Hiatt’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Michael Gerson: The ‘best fortnight in a decade’ for conservatives?

 Stupid but legal. Such is the Trump administration’s travel ban for people from seven Muslim countries. Of course, as with almost everything in American life, what should be a policy or even a moral issue becomes a legal one. The judicial challenge should have been given short shrift, since the presidential grant of authority to exclude the entry of aliens is extremely wide and statutorily clear. The judge who issued the temporary restraining order never even made a case for its illegality. <br> The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has indeed ruled against the immigration ban, but even if the ban is ultimately vindicated in the courts (as is likely), that doesn’t change the fact that it makes for lousy policy. It began life as a barstool eruption after the San Bernardino massacre when Donald Trump proposed a total ban on Muslims entering the country “until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.” <br> Rudy Giuliani says he was tasked with cleaning up this idea. Hence the executive order suspending entry of citizens from the seven countries while the vetting process is reviewed and tightened. <br> The core idea makes sense. These are failed, essentially ungovernable states (except for Iran) where reliable data is hard to find. But the moratorium was unnecessary and damaging. Its only purpose was to fulfill an ill-considered campaign promise. <br> It caused enormous disruption without making us any safer. What was the emergency that compelled us to turn away people already in the air with already approved visas for entry to the United States? <br> President Trump said he didn’t want to give any warning. Otherwise, he tweeted, “the ‘bad’ would rush into our country. . . . A lot of bad ‘dudes’ out there!” <br> Rush? Not a single American has ever been killed in a terror attack in this country by a citizen from the notorious seven. The killers have come from countries that are not listed — Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Lebanon, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan (the Tsarnaev brothers). The notion that we had to act immediately because hordes of jihadists in these seven countries were about to board airplanes to blow up Americans is absurd. <br> Vetting standards could easily have been revised and tightened without the moratorium and its attendant disruptions, stupidities, random cruelties and well-deserved bad press. <br> The moratorium turned into a distillation of the worst aspects of our current airport-security system, which everyone knows to be 95 percent pantomime. The pat-down of the 80-year-old grandmother does nothing to make us safer. Its purpose is to give the illusion of doing something. Similarly, during the brief Trump moratorium, a cavalcade of innocent and indeed sympathetic characters — graduate students, separated family members, returning doctors and scientists — were denied entry. You saw this and said to yourself: We are protecting ourselves from these ? <br> If anything, the spectacle served to undermine Trump’s case for extreme vigilance and wariness of foreigners entering the United States. There is already empirical evidence. A Nov. 23 Quinnipiac poll found a six-point majority in favor of “suspending immigration from ‘terror prone’ regions”; a Feb. 7 poll found a six-point majority against . The same poll found a whopping 44-point majority opposed to “suspending all immigration of Syrian refugees to the U.S. indefinitely.” <br> Then there is the opportunity cost of the whole debacle. It risks alienating the leaders of even nonaffected Muslim countries — the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation expressed “grave concern” — which may deter us from taking far more real and effective anti-terror measures. The administration was intent on declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, a concrete measure that would hamper the operations of a global Islamist force. In the current atmosphere, however, that declaration is reportedly being delayed and rethought. <br> Add to that the costs of the ill-prepared, unvetted, sloppy rollout. Consider the discordant, hostile message sent to loyal law-abiding Muslim Americans by the initial denial of entry to green-card holders. And the ripple effect of the initial denial of entry to those Iraqis who risked everything to help us in our war effort. In future conflicts, this will inevitably weigh upon local Muslims deciding whether to join and help our side. Actions have consequences. <br> In the end, what was meant to be a piece of promise-keeping, tough-on-terror symbolism has become an oxygen-consuming distraction. This is a young administration with a transformative agenda to enact. At a time when it should be pushing and promoting deregulation, tax reform and health-care transformation, it has steered itself into a pointless cul-de-sac — where even winning is losing. <br> Read more from Charles Krauthammer’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Matt Zeller: Trump shuts the door on men and women who have sacrificed for America <br> Hadi Ghaemi: Trump’s travel ban is a gift to Iran’s rulers <br> Michael V.

 Woodrow Wilson, who enjoyed moralizing about the mundane, called paying taxes a “glorious privilege.” In 1865, when there was a Civil War income tax, one taxpayer shared this sensibility, sort of. Mark Twain said that his tax bill of $36.82 (including a $3.12 fine for filing late) made him feel “important” because the government was paying attention to him. Today, Rep. Kevin Brady wants to change the way government pays attention to taxpayers. <br> Congress is like a Calder mobile: Something jiggled here causes things to wiggle over there. When conservatives toppled House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), they inadvertently propelled Brady into the House’s most important chairmanship, that of the Ways and Means Committee. Because revenue bills must originate in the House, Brady now wields Congress’s most important gavel, all because the committee’s previous chairman, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), now sits in Boehner’s chair. <br> If there is going to be growth-igniting tax reform — and if there isn’t, American politics will sink deeper into distributional strife — Brady will begin it. Fortunately, the Houston congressman is focused on this simple arithmetic: Three percent growth is not 1 percent better than 2 percent growth, it is 50 percent better. <br> If the Obama era’s average annual growth of 2.2 percent becomes the “new normal,” over the next 50 years real gross domestic product will grow from today’s $16.3 trillion (in 2009 dollars) to $48.3 trillion. If, however, growth averages 3.2 percent, real GDP in 2065 will be $78.6 trillion. At 2.2 percent growth, the cumulative lost wealth would be $521 trillion. <br> Brady, however, would like to start with the approximately $2 trillion that U.S. corporations have parked overseas. Having already paid taxes on it where it was earned, the corporations sensibly resist having it taxed again by the United States’ corporate tax, the highest in the industrial world. “[The $2 trillion] won’t just naturally fly back to us,” Brady says. Measures should be taken to make it rational for corporations to bring money home. And to make it rational for corporations such as Pfizer, which recently moved its headquarters to Ireland for tax purposes, to remain here. <br> In the past 30 years, Brady says, more and more taxes have been paid by fewer and fewer people. And fewer and fewer businesses have been organized as corporations: Three-quarters of job-creating entities are not paying corporate taxes. <br> “You can’t,” Brady says, “ask people to make big changes, leapfrogging our global competitors, just to get to average.” But making big changes “is why we all came to Congress.” And the benefit that comes from something unfortunate — the fact that there are so few (perhaps fewer than 40) competitive House seats — is that members can take risks. Presidential engagement is necessary for tax reform, and Brady says that will require a new president who understands that “just a little respect goes a long way up here [on Capitol Hill].” <br> All Republican presidential candidates have tax reform proposals, but only one candidate proposes increasing the cost of government for every American. Here, at last, Donald Trump actually resembles a Republican. Unfortunately, it is a Republican from 125 years ago, when the party stood for big government serving crony capitalism with high tariffs. <br> As Steven R. Weisman demonstrates in his splendid history of American taxation, “The Great Tax Wars,” the GOP’s tariffs were indirect, hidden sales taxes that crimped consumption by Americans with small incomes. In 1913, the first year of Wilson’s presidency and the year the 16th Amendment and the income tax arrived, the glorious privilege of paying taxes was enjoyed primarily through tariffs: They provided nearly half of federal revenues, with most of the rest coming from tobacco and liquor taxes, which also were hardest on people of modest means. <br> Trump, who works himself into a lather because Nabisco is making some Oreo cookies outside the country, is obsessed with the United States’ trade with China. “We’re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country,” he says, aiming to raise the price Americans pay for Apple products that today are assembled in China, which, according to trade attorney Scott Lincicome, makes about $6 by assembling an iPhone from parts (many of which China has imported). <br> Trump favors a 45 percent tariff to protect customers of Walmart and similar retailers from the onslaught of inexpensive Chinese apparel, appliances and food. He can explain the glorious privilege of paying taxes-as-tariffs when he makes his next visit to a Walmart, perhaps the one in Secaucus, N.J., just seven miles from his Fifth Avenue penthouse. <br> Read more from George F.

 This column was updated at 8:54 a.m. Feb. 8. <br> A massive people’s uprising is driving the opposition to President Trump. In Congress, the Congressional Progressive Caucus is an emerging center of that resistance. <br> This year marks the 25th anniversary of the CPC. Its first and founding director was an independent socialist from Vermont named Bernie Sanders. Now, co-chaired by Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the CPC is the largest Democratic House caucus, with 73 dues-paying members. Each election in recent years has provided it with dynamic new leaders — Wisconsin’s Mark Pocan, New York’s Yvette Clarke, Pennsylvania’s Matthew Cartwright, and now Washington’s Pramila Jayapal and Mayland’s Jamie B. Raskin. <br> Last weekend more than 30 of those members joined with activists from across the progressive landscape to share ideas and plot strategy at the annual summit of Progressive Congress. CPC members individually are already mobilizing against Trump. The challenge is whether the CPC can collectively begin to define the forward-looking agenda of the resistance. <br> After all, the CPC’s agenda has been vindicated again and again over the years. It was right to oppose the Iraq War, right to challenge ruinous corporate trade policies and catastrophic banking deregulation, and right to call for a bold green New Deal, with public investment driving economic recovery. Now, the CPC is right to demand progressive tax reform and higher taxes on the rich. It is right to call for Medicare for All and to push to expand, not cut, Social Security. It is right to join workers in championing a $15 minimum wage. It is right to urge an end to bloated defense budgets. <br> Getting it right, however, is small solace if you can’t get it done. The CPC has had some victories, usually in conjunction with outside movements. Most recently, its members — spearheaded by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) — joined with a broad coalition of citizen groups to help defeat President Barack Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership before Trump ever took office. Too often, though, the CPC and its members have gotten it right but the Democrats have gone the other way. <br> To be sure, the CPC disappoints some activists on the left. The caucus hasn’t wielded the weight of its numbers (partly because it does not enforce unanimity among them) and is criticized for being reluctant to break with the Democratic leadership (not surprising since House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) was one of the founders of the caucus). While its members are staunch on civil rights and social issues, they are more divided on bread-and-butter concerns. Strikingly, only the co-chairs — Ellison and Grijalva — plus two members — Rick Nolan (Minn.) and Peter Welch (Vt.) — stepped up to endorse Sanders in the Democratic primaries. <br> Increasingly, however, the CPC has the wind at its back. Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and Fight for $15 drove the debate. Sanders’s stunningly successful primary challenge galvanized the young around a bold agenda, showing its power. Hillary Clinton’s unexpected loss demonstrated the failure of the establishment. <br> And now, to paraphrase Mark Twain, Trump, like hanging, concentrates the mind. CPC members will help Democrats in rallying the resistance. They already know how to support outside movements and groups, and seed political organizing and education in their own districts and elsewhere. <br> More important, CPC members are ready to join together in championing a bold alternative to Trump, drawing from their own history and the Sanders platform. The Sanders candidacy demonstrated the potential. Now a range of citizen movements and grass-roots and activist networks are rallying around similar ideas, and others are recruiting and supporting candidates to run on this agenda. <br> That’s why Ellison’s candidacy to head the Democratic National Committee is so important. Ellison has pioneered grass-roots organizing and education in his own district. He has proved that principled progressives can win transformational victories. And he can help the party reconnect with working people. If he wins, the party will be able to capture more of the new energy. <br> Every year at the Progressive Congress summit, Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), No. 2 in the House Democratic leadership, hails the CPC, of which he is not a member, as “the soul of the Democratic caucus.” The sly put-down is implicit: You idealists cultivate our conscience, while we pragmatists get on with governing. Now Trump’s rise has exposed the catastrophic failures of the New Democrats, the Blue Dogs, the Wall Street wing of the party. It is time for the CPC to move from being the conscience of the Democratic caucus to its captain, from defining the alternative to defining the agenda. This won’t be easy. The CPC will have to raise its game and organize itself far more aggressively. Progressive senators such as Sanders and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have a bigger megaphone. But citizens on the march will find the leaders and members of the CPC standing with them. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more here: <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: Three steps for progressive resistance and rebuilding as Trump era launches <br> Eugene Robinson: Trump inspired a movement, all right <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: The resistance to Trump is big, diverse and ferocious <br> E.J.

 Henry Olsen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. His book “Ronald Reagan: New Deal Republican” is scheduled to be published in June. <br> Monday would have been Ronald Reagan’s 106th birthday. President Trump’s election has caused many observers to bemoan Reagan’s supposedly waning influence on today’s Republican Party. But these people start from the same flawed assumption, that Trump’s election means the United States and Republicans have rejected Reagan’s legacy. <br> Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Trump’s election does not represent the de-Reaganization of the Republican Party; it presents Republicans with their last, best hope to re-Reaganize it. <br> This flawed common wisdom flows from a flawed understanding of Reagan’s philosophy that accepts the myth that Reagan was an anti-government ideologue. But to paraphrase Reagan himself, it’s not that the common wisdom is wrong, it’s that so much of what it knows just isn’t so. <br> Reagan’s conservatism was not a more attractive version of Barry Goldwater’s anti-statist ideology. From the moment Reagan started speaking out as a conservative in the late 1950s, he endorsed an active role for government. He believed that government should care for those who could not care for themselves, build public housing for the poor and expand public universities. Where Goldwater attacked Republican President Dwight Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon for supporting Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, Reagan enthusiastically backed both men in their presidential campaigns. <br> Reagan’s conservatism even supported the idea of universal health coverage. He opposed Medicare only because he felt it unnecessary in light of another federal bill, the Kerr-Mills Act. That long-forgotten program gave federal funds to states to construct programs that paid health-care bills for poor seniors. He believed deeply, as he said in 1962, that “any person in the United States who requires medical attention and cannot provide for himself should have it provided for him.” <br> Reagan did not shrink from endorsing government action when needed as governor or as president. He raised the gas tax in 1983 to fund road construction and repair. He also imposed sanctions on Japanese industries and companies for what he believed were unfair trade practices even as he sought to extend free-trade agreements throughout the world. <br> Even Reagan’s support for immigration was limited by a belief in protecting U.S. workers. He supported taking in genuine refugees fleeing communism or dictators, but he opposed open borders. He wrote one correspondent in 1981 that he favored immigration quotas because “there is no way that we could, without limit, take all who want to come here simply for the opportunity this country offers.” <br> Each of these positions has a clear analogue in Trump’s early acts or statements. Trump’s position that everyone should have some sort of health insurance finds its counterpart in Reagan’s long-expressed beliefs. Trump’s belief in building more public infrastructure could be funded by a gas tax hike just like Reagan’s was. His belief that free trade should be fair trade was Reagan’s, and his belief that immigration controls to protect U.S. workers are just also was Reagan’s. <br> That’s not to say Reagan would have agreed with everything Trump says or does. But the overlap in their views on these issues stems from a broader overlap in philosophy. Trump seems to believe the federal government should act forcefully to protect the interest of the U.S. worker. Reagan’s philosophy was broader and deeper, but it stemmed from the same source: that enhancement of the life, dignity and freedom of the ordinary American was the proper role for the government. <br> Republicans have too often forgotten this principle in the years since Reagan’s presidency. They have tended to shy away from forceful action to help ordinary Americans in limited circumstances in favor of a more purist free-market ideology that can overlook the genuine suffering markets can create. Too often the person who loses his or her factory job has been treated as collateral damage in the march toward globalization. Reagan never believed government alone or even primarily was the solution, but he also didn’t believe it was never the answer. Republicans have lost that belief, and with it have lost the presidency for most of the post-Reagan era. <br> It’s no coincidence that Trump’s biggest popular vote gains over prior Republicans came where Reagan also excelled. Throughout the Midwest, the areas where Reagan in 1980 surpassed Gerald Ford in 1976 are usually the same places where Trump overperformed Mitt Romney. Northern and western Wisconsin, the automobile-building and rural regions of Michigan, industrial Ohio and Pennsylvania – many of those who are today’s Trump Democrats were Reagan Democrats first. <br> A re-Reaganized Republican Party would, like Reagan, meld this belief in limited but forceful government action with the traditional belief in the private sector. Like Reagan, it would reduce burdens on private economic activity while ensuring that the government did not stand idly by when average Americans were hurt. It would finally bring into being that “New Republican Party” Reagan spoke of in 1977, a party that would give “working men and women of this country . . . a say in what goes on in the party.” <br> That New Republican Party would finally make the GOP something it has not been since before the Great Depression: America’s majority party. And giving birth to that party would be the best birthday present the GOP could possibly give to the Gipper. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Dana Milbank: The de-Reaganization of the Republican Party <br> Lawrence Summers: On tax reform, take a page from Ronald Reagan <br> Henry Olsen: For Trump voters, there is no left or right <br> Michael McFaul: Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan could not be more different on foreign policy <br> Will Bunch: Five myths about Ronald Reagan’s legacy <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 After his spat with Mexico, after the travel ban, this week President Trump did something that surprised me. He put in place a policy with which I agreed. He placed a smart check on ever-proliferating federal regulations. His executive action requires any department that wants to add a regulation to get rid of two existing ones. It might seem gimmicky, but the British government instituted just this “one-in, two-out” rule in 2013 and it has worked well. In fact, while I find much of Trump’s worldview alarming, I generally agree with some important parts of his program — tax reform, infrastructure investment, deregulation, civil service reform. But the larger question I keep asking myself is: Does Trump want someone like me to agree with him? <br> The Trump White House has decided that the best way to deal with any institution or group that might stand in its way is to relentlessly try to delegitimize it. This has led to a ferocious strategy of attack on the media, which the president now says is “the opposition party.” His chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, urges the media to “keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.” Sean Hannity, the Fox News host who has become an unofficial spokesman for the White House, describes the media as “a bunch of overpaid, out of touch, lazy millionaires that have nothing but contempt for the people that do make this country great.” <br> [Trump’s corporate bullying will only hurt Americans] <br> At this point, one could note that, if we are to listen to America, almost 3 million more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Trump (who received a share of the popular vote that was lower than Mitt Romney’s, in fact lower than the share received by most of the losers of recent presidential elections). And as for which of these groups makes America great, I’m not sure what criteria to use, but if it is generating wealth and contributing to gross domestic product, it’s not even close. According to the Brookings Institution, the 500 counties won by Clinton produced 64 percent of U.S. economic output, while the 2,600 counties won by Trump produced just 36 percent of GDP. Use any economic measure — employment, start-ups, innovation — and the areas that score highest voted heavily against Trump. <br> The much-maligned urban elites may be out of touch with the rest of the country, but they still pay its bills. A few years ago, the Economist compared how much each American state contributed to the federal coffers against the funds they received from Washington. The basic pattern is simple: It is blue states, which voted against Trump in 2016, that fund the red states that voted for him. From 1990 to 2009, Clinton states collectively paid $2.4 trillion more in federal taxes than they received in federal spending, while Trump states altogether received $1.3 trillion more than they paid. <br> But this is not the way I think we should look at America. It’s one country, and different parts and people contribute in different ways. We are living through times in which economics and technology separate us — some people and places prosper while others languish. The goal should be to use politics as a mechanism to bring us together through both public policy and public discourse. The truth is, there are no real Americans and fake Americans (though there is real news and fake news). <br> [Sharia law may be coming to America. But it’s Christians who are bringing it.] <br> Most presidents begin their tenure by trying to reach out to their political opponents, signaling that they want to represent those who didn’t vote for them as well as those who did, and generally trying to bring the country together. Trump has made almost no such effort, simply asserting that the country was divided before he was elected and thus absolving himself of any responsibility for unifying it. In office, he has mercilessly attacked anyone who dares to disagree with him, whether senators, prime ministers or student protesters. It might be a good way to play to his base, but it’s a terrible way to lead the country. <br> The challenge for the media must be to ensure that we don’t mirror Trump’s attitude of hostility. We cannot absorb and reflect that negativity. We are not the opposition. We are a civic institution, explicitly protected by the Constitution, that is meant to hold government accountable and provide real information to the citizenry. I hope to be able to do that. Along the way, when I have to, I will disagree vigorously with Donald Trump. But just as important, when warranted, whether he likes it or not, I will agree with him. <br> Read more from Fareed Zakaria’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Five policies Trump might get right <br> Stuart Benjamin: Trump’s executive order on regulatory costs imperils the rest of his regulatory agenda <br> Philip K.

 The writer, a Republican, represents South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District in the House. <br> If politics is considered in part theater, President Trump’s opening act has been a most colorful one. The media, critics and even supporters swing from being confounded, frightened or elated by the possibility of what might come next — but those perceptions can change in 10-minute increments given the administration’s blitzkrieg-like movement forward. <br> But politics is not theater. It is not entertainment. The seemingly unvetted immigration order signed on Friday reminds us of all the ways in which politics affects people’s lives. <br> And while immigration grabs headlines, it steals attention from the path the administration is charting on the economy. The business experience of Trump’s top appointees should certainly comfort anyone who cares about commerce, but there is a larger course being set that should concern all of us who believe in free markets and the things traditionally vital to U.S. job growth. <br> I raise this respectfully, as one who spent eight years of his life as a governor trying to encourage capital investment and all that flows from it. Our team in South Carolina was successful, and despite the headwinds of 2008 and the Great Recession, we saw $23 billion of capital investment. <br> Hopefully, waters will calm as the Cabinet moves from confirmations to operations. But at this point, what Trump is doing in the name of economic development will in fact prove counterproductive. <br> I offer three suggestions. <br> One, ditch Twitter. Embarrassing companies into business decisions has a short half-life. Capital needs to be invited, not shamed, into staying. In fact, the saying is that capital goes where it’s loved. While it can certainly be buttonholed for a time, a long list of Third World countries stands as a monument to the fact that trying to trap money comes with a host of unintended consequences. Return of capital always matters more than return on capital. If the United States is ever seen as a place that resembles the Eagles’ “Hotel California” — “you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave” — the giant sucking sound you will hear won’t be from the North American Free Trade Agreement. <br> Two, adding jobs is not enough; the operative question is how they are created. The ends do not justify the means here. It can’t be a job at any price. Bought jobs, or jobs protected by legislative edict, are not the same as those that flourish from the invisible hand of the marketplace. As governor, I tried to focus on bettering the soil conditions essential to capital formation. We knew if we built the right conditions to attract capital, the jobs would come. This meant things such as the legal, tax and regulatory climate. To his credit, Trump has talked of regulation, infrastructure and tax policy. What he has not seemed to recognize so far is the way in which our institutions are part of our competitive advantage relative to so many other spots around the globe. <br> Governors and presidents naturally want to be the ones credited for economic development efforts, but in fact we are all much better served in unrecognized efforts bettering soil conditions. One ingredient most vital is our tradition — the institution, if you will — of limited government. Federal power has always been checked by state and local government and, accordingly, “send in the Feds” should not be the default tweet. Deals can always get done. The fundamental question is whether they are good for the taxpayer. <br> Finally, Trump’s ability to sell his brand throughout the world was based on our country’s engagement with it. Since the horror of Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression, our country’s bias has been toward more open trade and engagement with the rest of the world. This is ultimately not just about trading things but also the investment and capital flow that comes with it. Were it not for this, companies such as BMW, Bosch and Volvo would not have invested in South Carolina as they have. To hinder trade would be to hinder jobs in a place such as my home state. <br> So I write to say that if you’re in business, you need to make your voice heard. Politicians are risk-averse, and they won’t lead if you don’t. No one wants to be at the receiving end of Trump’s Twitter account, and Washington has a way of bending its will to the loudest voice in the room. Without a drumbeat from employers and employees alike, Republicans in Washington will be all too quiet on actions by the new administration that, if left unchecked, represent storm clouds forming over the Potomac. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Lawrence Summers: The economy under Trump: Plan for the worst <br> Robert J.

 Donald Trump argues that Washington is captured by special interests, especially Wall Street. <br> Trump argues that Washington politicians don’t know how to make deals, including with each other. <br> Trump argues that a weak Republican establishment has let a Democratic president steamroll it with executive actions. <br> I have a humble suggestion for how the political establishment — particularly the Republican political establishment — can kill all three of these allegations with one stone. <br> Congress should close the “carried interest loophole.” <br> This refers to a quirk in the tax code that allows a small, mostly mega-rich segment of the population to pay much lower tax rates on the fruits of their labor than everyone else. <br> Managers at certain kinds of investment funds — such as private equity and venture capital funds — receive a share of the profits earned on their clients’ investments in exchange for the service of managing those investments. This performance fee is called “carried interest.” <br> Under current practices, these managers report this carried interest as long-term capital gains, which are taxed at 20 percent. That’s about half the tax rate these managers would pay if carried interest were treated as ordinary labor income and taxed at the top marginal rate. <br> Make no bones about it: This is a huge giveaway to a tiny but generally ultrawealthy and politically influential constituency. An estimated 60,000 households benefit from this loophole, according to Victor Fleischer, a University of San Diego law professor. <br> It’s a pretty niche tax issue, but the loophole is extremely unpopular among the masses and has gotten a lot of play lately on the political stage. Calls to close the loophole have been gathering steam at both the state and federal levels, and with Democrats and Republicans alike. <br> Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Jeb Bush and Trump all targeted this loophole for closure in their tax plans. Trump in particular has made it a frequent talking point, since it conveniently illustrates his sometimes-made populist claim that he’d soak the politically connected rich (even though his tax plan overall would dramatically reduce rates on high-income households). <br> “Rarely has a policy existed so long with such weak arguments in its favor,” former treasury secretary and former National Economic Council chair Lawrence Summers observed at a hedge fund conference this week, offering a backhanded compliment to the industry’s lobbying prowess. “It’s the First Amendment, the Second Amendment and carried interest, right?” <br> President Obama has advocated taxing carried interest as ordinary income for years, of course. And in recent months, a growing chorus of tax experts has argued that the White House can close the loophole without any action from Congress. <br> As Gretchen Morgenson explained in the New York Times last week, Obama potentially could instruct Treasury to change how carried interest is taxed through regulatory measures alone. <br> The administration thus far has shown little interest, at least publicly, in this route, instead insisting on the need for legislative action. “No one should be able to play by a different set of rules, so it’s time for Congress to act to close the carried interest loophole once and for all,” a Treasury spokeswoman told Morgenson. <br> But remember that administration officials had also initially pooh-poohed the legality and propriety of other executive actions ultimately taken by Obama after Congress failed to act, including on immigration and corporate tax inversions. <br> During the same conference panel that Summers participated in this week, Carlyle Group co-chief-executive David Rubenstein even seemed to tacitly acknowledge that the loophole could be closed through executive-branch action. <br> Should the Obama administration indeed decide to pursue closing the carried interest loophole through Treasury action, GOP legislators would find themselves in a very bad position. <br> Executive overreach is a touchstone of the Republicans’ anti-Obama narrative, so they’d be obligated to oppose such a move. Opposing such action, though, would play into the anti-establishment populist narrative — presented by Trump and Sanders, among others — that most GOP politicians are Wall Street puppets. <br> Which is exactly why it would be so smart for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and the rest of the Republican Congress to get in front of this issue while it’s in the spotlight, and close the loophole themselves. <br> Relatively little money is at stake in the grand scheme of things (about $20 billion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation; Fleischer estimates it at about an order of magnitude higher). Nonetheless, plugging an unfair and unpopular loophole through legislative action would be a major symbolic victory. It would demonstrate that a Republican-led Congress could actually get something done, was not beholden to its financier donors and could even unify around the leadership of its new party standard-bearer. <br> Win-win-win — just the kind of dealmaking Trump has been advertising. <br> Read more: <br> Ed Rogers: Will the ‘carried interest’ debate start tonight? <br> Robert J.

 If the president is open to taking the advice in Todd Stern’s Jan. 25 op-ed, “The deal of the century on climate,” he should do so by pursuing the one option that would also help him deliver on tax reform and infrastructure. That option is a carbon fee, which a large majority of economists (and our incoming secretary of state) say is the quickest, most efficient and most potent solution to climate change. If Congress finally puts a price on carbon emissions, the free market will drive down the use of carbon. That’s what Canada is doing. <br> For our dealmaker in chief, the bait is the money that would come pouring in. If we adopted a fee of $35 per metric ton (MT) of carbon dioxide, with annual increases of inflation plus 4 percent, it would generate $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 years. That would go a long way toward paying for infrastructure, tax cuts — and maybe even part of that border wall. <br> The U.S. national debt held by the public equals nearly $12 trillion. That’s sobering enough. Now the Congressional Budget Office is predicting that it will soar by $8.6 trillion over the next 10 years. <br> As global temperature records continue to be topped, a carbon fee is a simple way to help us achieve several goals. It represents the kind of old-fashioned, bipartisan compromise that our elected officials are paid to hammer out. <br> George T. Frampton Jr., Washington <br> The writer is co-founder of the Partnership for Responsible Growth. <br> Todd Stern gave solid reasons why acting on climate now is the “deal of the century.” I add a point made strongly by faith communities across the board: We have a deep ethical and moral obligation to current and future generations. Loss of life, property and prosperity from climate change has already touched many, and many more will suffer those losses if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.  <br> As Mr. Stern noted, we still need strong policy support and research and development. President Trump should seriously work with Congress to make that a reality. Doing so would be exercising American leadership, and in that way would give new and welcome meaning to Mr. Trump’s call — “America first.” <br> Peter Adriance, Falls Church 
 If blue states think they’re going to be shielded from the coming Trump tsunami, they’re sorely mistaken. <br> Much has been written about how the unified Republican front in Washington is going to betray the working-class whites of deep-red Trump country. The coming Obamacare repeal, fewer worker protections and additional fraying of the safety net will inflict enormous pain. <br> Blue states might appear to be relatively insulated from much of this turmoil, since they’ve already locked in many of the progressive policies Republicans aim to roll back at the federal level. <br> But make no mistake: Blue states are also in for a world of pain — specifically, fiscal pain. There are at least three major reasons why. Two of them are driven by that newly unified Republican front in Washington; the third is their own fault. <br> [Trump’s hiring freeze will do the opposite of what he wants] <br> First, the coming tax overhaul. <br> President Trump has been relatively vague and inconsistent about what his preferred tax plan looks like, beyond including major cuts that primarily benefit the highest earners. The Republican-led Congress, on the other hand, has at least one relatively detailed plan ready to go. <br> Its plan, like Trump’s, would sharply reduce tax rates, especially at the top. Additionally, it would eliminate most itemized deductions — including those for state and local income and property taxes. <br> Unsurprisingly, these deductions are most often claimed in relatively high-tax states such as Connecticut, New Jersey, California and New York. You know, places that just happen to vote Democratic. <br> Whether this facet of the GOP tax plan is specifically designed to stick it to liberal elites is debatable. Either way, though, it would be “devastating on the state of New York, California, et cetera, if you didn't allow the people of this state to deduct their state and local taxes,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told reporters last week. <br> Second, Medicaid block grants. <br> On Sunday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway reaffirmed her boss’s — and his chosen health secretary’s — commitment to restructuring Medicaid so that states receive flat, lump-sum payments, called “block grants.” This would replace today’s system, in which states and feds share costs for eligible Medicaid enrollees, whose numbers can rise and fall with changes in the economy. <br> This idea has long been popular among Republicans — partly because it shunts the burden of figuring out where and how to curb spending onto the states.  <br> But transitioning to block grants is trickier than it sounds. How do you decide how big each state’s initial lump-sum payment should be? How will it change over time? <br> One option is to permanently freeze payments at current levels, perhaps indexing them to inflation. But this locks into place huge discrepancies between states and doesn’t provide much flexibility as relative economic conditions change. Today, federal Medicaid spending per low-income state resident varies dramatically across the country, from a low of $1,051 in Nevada to more than 11 times that in the District, according to calculations from the Urban Institute’s John Holahan and Matthew Buettgens. <br>  Which is why one other likely alternative — and one that might appeal to many Republican legislators — would be pegging the size of a state’s lump sum to its per-capita income. The higher-income the state is, the less money it gets. <br> As economists Jeffrey Clemens and Benedic Ippolito explained recently, this formula “would result in a seismic redistribution of federal spending.” <br> [Under Trump, Christians may have it easier. They’ll also be in grave spiritual danger.] <br> Among the biggest winners would be lower-cost-of-living red states; among the biggest losers, high-cost-of-living blue states. Texas, for example, would gain about $8 billion in federal Medicaid funding relative to what it receives today. New York and California would each lose more than $15 billion annually. <br> With fewer federal funds coming in, these states would be forced to cut health benefits for the poor, siphon off money from other programs, raise taxes or some combination of all these things. <br> Third, and finally, unfunded pension obligations. <br> As it turns out, some heavily Democratic states have little room to shift funds toward safety-net programs such as Medicaid. That’s because they’re among the states that most need to raise the share of revenue that they contribute to their government pensions to avoid an increase in their already-large unfunded pension liabilities. <br> Among those most in trouble: New Jersey, California and Oregon, according to calculations from Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Joshua Rauh. (Being a pension basket case is hardly a Democratic affliction, needless to say; plenty of Republican states are struggling, too.) <br> This last affliction can’t be blamed on the new Republican White House and its allies on the Hill. But that doesn’t mean they won’t enjoy the show.  <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Jennifer Rubin: When Trump and GOP leaders lack a plan, others jump in <br> Greg Sargent: Republicans are losing the argument over Obamacare repeal.

 Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto told an assembly of top diplomats last week that “Mexico of course will not pay” for Donald Trump’s wall. His predecessor, former president Vicente Fox, put it more bluntly in a tweet storm last week, declaring: “TRUMP, when will you understand that I am not paying for that [f----n] wall.” <br> They are both wrong. Trump absolutely can make Mexico pay. And the answer lies in a provision of the corporate tax-reform plan House Republicans are planning to take up after Trump’s inauguration — the so-called “border adjustment.” <br> Trump criticized the border adjustment this weekend, telling the Wall Street Journal “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it.” Here is why he should: It would force Mexico to give us every penny we need to pay for the wall, and then some. <br> The House Republicans’ plan would lower the corporate tax from 35 percent to 20 percent and apply the tax based on the location of consumption rather than the location of production. It would do this through a “border adjustment” that exempts exports while taxing imports. Under the plan, all imports coming into the United States would be subject to the 20 percent tax, but exports would have the tax refunded — making them tax-free. <br> Supporters see it as a way for Trump to follow through on his campaign pledge to tax imports and support exports without resorting to tariffs that would provoke a massive global trade fight. Right now, more than 160 countries around the world have a “border adjusted” value-added tax (VAT). So unlike tariffs, a border adjustment should be able to pass muster with the World Trade Organization. <br> Here is where the wall comes in: As economist Martin Feldstein explains, the border adjustment would raise hundreds of billions in tax revenue — not from U.S. consumers or corporations, but from our foreign trading partners. Under the border adjustment, the United States would refund the tax on exports and charge it on imports — so the net revenue would be negative if we had a trade surplus, and positive if we had a trade deficit. Because the United States has a trade deficit, Feldstein calculates the border adjustment would bring in about $120 billion a year, or $1 trillion over a decade. <br> One of the countries with whom we have a large trade deficit is . . . Mexico. The U.S. trade deficit in goods with Mexico was $60.7 billion in 2015 and is expected to be around $65 billion in 2016. So if Mexican imports are taxed at a rate of 20 percent, the United States would raise about $13 billion a year in revenue from Mexico via the border adjustment. <br> How much will the wall cost? Trump has put the price at between $8 billion and $12 billion. Others have suggested it could be higher, between $15 billion and $25 billion. Either way, the full cost would be more than covered in one or two years by the $13 billion in annual revenues we would collect from Mexico. Indeed, over several years, the border adjustment could force Mexico to pay not only for the wall, but for the costs of a lot of Trump’s other border-security measures — from expediting the deportation of criminal aliens to hiring more screeners to conduct “extreme vetting.” <br> In other words, the border adjustment would allow Trump to keep two major campaign promises at once — he could tax imports and subsidize exports, while forcing Mexico to pay for the wall. <br> And here is the really brilliant part: There is nothing Mexico could do about it. Mexico might find ways to retaliate over specific measures targeting it — such as increased fees for visas or taxing remittances. But with the border adjustment, Mexico would have no recourse to complain, because such a measure is global in nature and would affect all U.S. trading partners equally. Plus, how could Mexico object when it is one of the 160 countries around that world that has a “border adjusted” VAT of its own? <br> So yes, thanks to the border adjustment, Donald Trump can indeed make Mexico pay for the BLEEP-ing wall. And Mexico would be powerless to stop him. <br> Mr. President-elect, what’s not to love? <br> Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Mexico will pay for that wall . . . eventually? <br> Robert J.

 Lawrence Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. <br> An ironic contradiction is likely to define the global economic community’s convocation in Davos this week as it awaits Donald Trump’s inauguration. There has not been so much anxiety about U.S. global leadership or about the sustainability of market-oriented democracy at any time in the past half-century. Yet with markets not only failing to swoon as predicted, but actually rallying strongly after both the Brexit vote and Trump’s victory, the animal spirits of business are running hot. <br> Many chief executives are coming to believe that, whatever the president-elect’s infirmities, the strongly pro-business attitude of his administration, combined with Republican control of Congress, will lead to a new era of support for business, along with much lower taxes and regulatory burdens. This in turn, it is argued, will drive major increases in investment and hiring, setting off a virtuous circle of economic growth and rising confidence. <br> [Trump is being handed a great economy. What happens when it goes south?] <br> While it has to be admitted that such a scenario looks more plausible today than it did on Election Day, I believe that it is very much odds-off. More likely is that the current run of happy markets and favorable sentiment will be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, as a sugar high. John Maynard Keynes was right to emphasize the great importance of animal spirits, but other economists have also been right to emphasize that it is political and economic fundamentals that dominate in the medium and long terms. History is replete with examples of populist authoritarian policies that produced short-run benefits but poor long-run outcomes. <br> The new U.S. president will be operating on a weak political foundation, is unlikely to be able to deliver the results he has promised to key constituencies and seems likely to take dangerous gambles in the international arena. This makes it probable that a cycle of growing disillusion, disappointment and disapproval will set in within a year. <br> Trump will likely be the first modern U.S. president to come into office with more public disapproval than approval. No outsider can know the validity of allegations regarding his campaign’s involvement with Russia, but the shadow of possible scandal is far more present in the pre-inaugural press than it was even before Richard Nixon’s second term in the White House. And the Trump family’s continued operation of his business interests offers potential for at least the allegation of serious misconduct. <br> Nor is Trump likely to be able to keep his promises to key middle-class constituencies. The consequence of the weak Mexican peso that has been a consequence of his rhetoric is more Mexican immigration to the United States and more businesses choosing Mexico over Ohio as a location for production. <br> [Paul Waldman: Republicans say they’ll protect you if you have a preexisting condition. Don’t believe them.] <br> Moreover, it is not possible to repeal Obamacare without taking health insurance away from millions of Americans and placing new burdens on those with preexisting conditions. If Trump follows through on proposed increases in tariffs, the result will be lower real wages and incomes as prices rise faster than wages. All in Congress agree that tax reform will not happen in a few months, and it is impossible to reconcile the president-elect’s stated goals of major reductions in corporate and top rates, a fair distribution of the benefits of tax cuts and preventing a huge increase in federal debt. <br> Finally, Trump will be taking some major risks. Seeking to use the one- China policy as a lever for extracting trade concessions from China risks major confrontation and will complicate cooperation on critical issues such as North Korean nuclear proliferation. Questioning the value of the European Union and NATO risks undermining our principal democratic allies at a time when they are already politically fragile. Unilateral imposition of tariffs or enactment of a tax system that subsidizes exports and penalizes imports risks both retaliatory protectionism and a spiking dollar, with potentially grave consequences for the global economy. And threatening businesses, as happened with the attack on the pharmaceutical industry during Trump’s last news conference, risks major increases in uncertainty and even questions about the rule of law. <br> Animal spirits are as fickle as they are important. Right now they certainly are an impetus to economic growth. The speed with which they changed after the Brexit vote and after the U.S. election should be cautionary. They can easily change again. If ever there were a time to hope for the best but plan for the worst, it is now. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Robert J. Samuelson: Trump’s mission impossible? <br> Robert J.

 Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is a tough and wily operator. But he is opposed by an equally relentless and worthy adversary: Mitch McConnell. <br> Nobody in recent memory has argued so frequently and so passionately against himself as the Kentucky Republican. Oyez, oyez, oyez: Let us hear the case of McConnell v. McConnell. <br> In November, magnanimous McConnell spoke of restraint: “I think it’s always a mistake to misread your mandate, and frequently new majorities think it’s going to be forever. . . . We’ve been given a temporary lease on power, if you will.” <br> That was wise. Republicans won the White House and both chambers of Congress, but the president-elect lost the popular vote by almost 3 million and Republicans lost seats in Congress. <br> [Where’s the GOP’s health-care plan?] <br> Yet, two months later, McConnell is disregarding his own advice and treating his “temporary lease on power” as if it were St. Edward’s Crown. <br> He is hurrying through a repeal of Obamacare — using a procedure he once decried as a “power grab” — before Republicans come up with an alternative. He’s preparing to use the same technique to overhaul the tax code. He is pushing ahead with nine confirmation hearings this week, five on Wednesday alone, the same day the Senate is scheduled to hold dozens of budget votes and President-elect Donald Trump has planned a news conference. This will protect the nominees from public scrutiny — even though most have not yet received the required vetting. <br> In politics, where you stand often depends on where you sit. If your party doesn’t control the Senate, for example, you’re more likely to value the filibuster. But McConnell’s principles are particularly situational. <br> Back in 2009, when he was minority leader, McConnell insisted, among other things, that nominees shouldn’t get hearings unless “the Office of Government Ethics letter is complete and submitted to the committee in time for review and prior to a committee hearing.” <br> Now, the OGE director warns that the GOP is rushing through “several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process,” leaving some “with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues.” The director noted that this violates the law. <br> But McConnell has reversed McConnell. “All of these little procedural complaints are related to their frustration in having not only lost the White House but having lost the Senate,” he explained Sunday on CBS. He suggested “we need to sort of grow up here.” <br> Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, illustrated McConnell’s reversal by sending him on Monday the same letter McConnell sent Democratic leader Harry Reid in 2009 demanding complete ethics reviews before hearings. Schumer crossed out “Harry” in the salutation and substituted “Mitch.” <br> Back in 2010, McConnell argued that using the budget process of “reconciliation” to pass Obamacare with a 50-vote majority in the Senate rather than a 60-vote supermajority “would be one of the most brazen single-party power grabs in legislative history.” <br> So what is McConnell doing now? Using reconciliation to eliminate Obamacare with a 50-vote majority. <br> Back in 2007, McConnell said that “we can stipulate” that “in the Senate it takes 60 votes on controversial matters.” <br> Now McConnell has signed on to using the same 50-vote maneuver to enact tax reform. <br> McConnell has been particularly flexible on the 60-vote threshold. In 2012, he said that if he were the majority leader, repealing Obamacare could “be pursued with 51 votes in the Senate.” <br> But in 2014, as McConnell was becoming majority leader, he again reversed McConnell. Repealing Obamacare “would take 60 votes in the Senate,” he concluded. <br> Back in 2011, McConnell proudly declared that “I voted for the Ryan budget.” But in 2014, when his opponent tried to tie him to the Paul Ryan budget cuts, McConnell’s campaign said that “there is no way to speculate” whether McConnell supported the Ryan budget in 2011. <br> [Republicans are over-promising again on health care] <br> A year ago, McConnell said he would block consideration of President Obama’s nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy “until we have a new president.” <br> Now, when Democrats floated the (improbable) notion that they wouldn’t act on President Trump’s nominee to the same seat, McConnell said that is “something the American people simply will not tolerate.” <br> McConnell said his position against filling the vacancy last year was so that “the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice.” <br> He argued the opposite in a years-ago law-review article, when he argued that making “purely political decisions” in considering a Supreme Court nominee isn’t “an acceptable practice.” <br> In a typical McConnell speech in 2012, he argued that “the unique role of the Senate has been to protect the voice of the minority.” Now he’s facing pressure from fellow Republicans to eliminate the filibuster, one of the main protections of minority rights in the Senate. <br> It’s too soon to say who will win this battle, but it promises to be another epic showdown between McConnell and McConnell. <br> Twitter: @Milbank <br> Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Barry Yeoman is a freelance journalist. <br> One of the most surreal moments during last week’s fracas at the North Carolina legislature came during a news conference called by the state NAACP. The civil rights organization was blasting the Republican legislative majority for its brazen efforts to strip authority from the incoming Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, and a state Supreme Court that tilted Democratic in last month’s elections. <br> From the back of the room came the voice of an uninvited guest: Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the state Republican Party. “I’m just wondering,” Woodhouse said, as others tried to shush him, “what about when Jim Hunt tried to fire all the Republicans in the Christmas massacre? . . . What about the Democrats stripping the lieutenant governor, a Republican, of all his power? Was that right?” <br> Woodhouse had a point: North Carolina’s Democrats have hardly been strangers to the rough-and-tumble of governance. After Hunt was elected governor in 1976, he demanded the resignation of 169 policymakers hired during the previous Republican administration and fired those who didn’t comply. (That was the “massacre.”) Then in 1989, after Republican Jim Gardner took office as lieutenant governor, Senate Democrats denied him the right to lead their chamber. <br> Last week, as Republican lawmakers passed a wholesale shift in the state’s balance of political power — during a special session called without public notice — they justified it with various refrains of they-did-it-first. “History matters,” Woodhouse said in a statement. <br> Indeed, it does. That’s why it’s worthwhile to recall how Democrats ran the legislature during Woodhouse’s adolescence and why politicians of both parties worked together to bring that roughshod rule to an end. <br> I became a statehouse reporter in Raleigh in 1986, in an era when the North Carolina budget was assembled in secret by eight legislators, all of them white Democratic men. Informally they were called the “Gang of Eight,” or the “super-subcommittee” — “supersub” for short. <br> Because it wasn’t a formal body, the supersub could meet without the constraints of the state’s open-meetings law. Once its budget was released — sometimes larded with favors for friends of the eight — it flew through the approval process with little time for study, much less debate. Lawmakers knew that defiance would cost them both plum assignments and pork-barrel funds for their districts. Democratic dissenters might also find their own bills bottled up permanently in committee. Republicans had less to lose; they were disregarded entirely. <br> “To get along, you have to go along,” Democratic lawmaker J. Ray Sparrow told me during the first session I covered. “There have been some definite threats.” <br> By then, there was already a movement afoot for more open, less vindictive government. Bumper stickers saying “Sink the Supersub! Vote Republican” began showing up around North Carolina. GOP lawmaker Coy Privette declared that if politicians in his county “operated as the Gang of Eight does, they’d be indicted and be put in jail.” In a symbolic showdown, a group of House members from both parties voted for a tax-reform measure that Democratic leaders opposed. Few people cared about the tax issue; this was a protest against autocracy. <br> Then, in 1989 — the same year Senate Democrats defanged the incoming lieutenant governor — something entirely different happened in the House. Twenty Democrats teamed up with Republicans to oust Democratic Speaker Liston Ramsey. (Among the Democrats was Cooper, now the governor-elect.) It was a rare moment of substantive bipartisanship: a declaration that the hoarding of power is incompatible with democracy. “The people of North Carolina were voting for two parties,” Alex Warner, a Democratic House member, said at the time. “That meant representation for all.” <br> Since then, the best of North Carolina’s legislative leaders, though not all, have presided over its chambers with an eye toward good government. But last week’s session was a reversion to the strong-arm rule that Republicans decried in the 1980s. The sweep of the power seizure is spectacular: a weakening of the governor’s control over the state and county election boards; a slashing of his hiring and firing powers; a Senate veto over his Cabinet picks; the transfer of authority over public education and the university system to agencies controlled by Republicans; a shift from nonpartisan to partisan Supreme Court elections; and a judicial restructuring that favors the Republican-leaning Court of Appeals over the Democratic-leaning Supreme Court. <br> These measures are more blatant than the abuses that provoked calls for more inclusive governance 30 years ago. It’s no surprise that old-timers including former GOP governor Jim Martin have scolded their party for going too far: History matters, and the Republicans of the 1980s wouldn’t recognize their 21st-century successors. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> The Post’s View: North Carolina Republicans lost.

 AS THE federal government has grown, so has the power and responsibility of the White House-based agency charged with keeping tabs on spending, revenue and regulation. The director of that agency, the Office of Management and Budget, is much more than the president’s bean-counter; he or she is a key player on policy, as well as, traditionally, the voice of fiscal responsibility both within the executive branch and in the public arena. <br> OMB director looks to be an especially challenging post under Donald Trump, because the president-elect has sent highly mixed fiscal signals. Specifically, he has promised large tax cuts and a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure program, while also pledging to leave Medicare and Social Security untouched. That leaves very little in the way of credible options to keep yet another promise: curbing the national debt. <br> [Trump’s OMB pick seems poised to ignite a worldwide financial crisis] <br> Is Mr. Trump’s choice for the OMB up to the job? Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) is certainly outspoken about fiscal discipline, having joined fellow members of the tea party and the House Freedom Caucus in repeatedly warning against deficits — and in using the federal debt ceiling as a bargaining chip over the issue during the Obama administration. This struggle, which included the 16-day partial government shutdown in 2013, might not have been necessary if Mr. Mulvaney and company had conceded that achieving fiscal stability necessarily involves increased revenue as opposed to the spending-cuts-only orthodoxy that they have done so much to reinforce. <br> Mr. Mulvaney played down predictions of a disastrous government default if the debt ceiling were not raised. Those warnings, he told NPR in 2011, reflected “a good bit of politics.” In fact, the United States must meet its obligations on time, lest financial markets tremble. Coming from the OMB director-designee of a president-elect who mused aloud that “you can do things with discounts” to avoid paying back all of the national debt, this bit of history from Mr. Mulvaney’s freshman term in the House is not reassuring. <br> Also concerning, Mr. Mulvaney is the author of legislation that would essentially recreate the unstable pre-financial-crisis status quo in housing policy by restoring government-sponsored mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to private ownership. This would be a huge taxpayer-subsidized windfall for a handful of hedge funds that own beaten-down Fannie-Freddie stock and have tried — and failed — repeatedly to convince the courts, Congress and President Obama to deliver the companies to them. What’s that got to do with fiscal conservatism? <br> To be sure, Mr. Mulvaney has shown some flashes of intellectual consistency. In 2015, he argued that the Pentagon should have to make off-setting spending cuts rather than be allowed to raid the so-called “overseas contingency” fund meant for ongoing military operations as Republican hawks wanted. Again, this is the sort of dilemma that could be avoided if the GOP were to acknowledge the need for more revenue to meet the country’s defense responsibilities and other valid priorities. But at least Mr. Mulvaney called out this budget gimmick for what it was. <br> Senators should ask Mr. Mulvaney to tell them in detail how he would hold his new boss to the same minimum level of intellectual honesty. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Trump’s economic plan goes from worse to bad <br> The Post’s View: The GOP’s radical tax plan <br> Lawrence Summers: On tax reform, take a page from Ronald Reagan <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Lowering taxes is a central tenet of most Republican campaign platforms, and 2016 has been no different. The Republican candidates have all pledged to lower taxes, help improve the business climate and stimulate job growth. But there is one subtle but important issue that could be a meaningful divide within the GOP during a campaign season where there hasn’t really been much of a focus on the issues: carried interest. In the carried interest tax scenario, the income hedge fund managers, private equity managers and other big financial players generate from investing other people’s money is taxed as a “long-term capital gain” — not as regular income — therefore allowing the hedge fund managers, etc. to pay a much lower tax rate than if their earnings were classified as regular income. It’s a tax quirk that really helps the very, very rich, giving them a different — and much more desirable — tax treatment on income. It’s a niche issue as far as the general public is concerned, but it could become a vivid divide among some of the campaigns. <br> Jeb Bush has been forthright in saying he would end this preferential treatment and has released a comprehensive and specific plan to move toward a more level playing field on taxes. He has been clear in making the case for getting rid of special-interest deals and trying to balance the treatment of Wall Street and Main Street. Unlike some of the Democratic efforts, such as Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Rep. Sander Levin’s (D-Mich.) proposed “Carried Interest Fairness Act,” which is not a comprehensive tax plan and targets only investment fund managers, Bush’s plan to eliminate carried interest is not some punitive measure aimed at taking down Wall Street; it’s a common-sense measure that appeals to calls for fairness in the context of big tax reform. And in a world where a bumper sticker beats an essay, at the end of the day, how can Republican candidates defend carried interest when it enables a hedge fund manager to pay a lower tax rate than someone working as his or her landscaper? <br> To be fair, Donald Trump’s tax plan does also mostly get rid of carried interest, but as with most things Donald Trump, his tax plan is mostly bluster and goes too far to be considered reasonable. Marco Rubio’s tax plan outline makes provisions for eliminating carried interest, although not explicitly, but his plan has been repeatedly criticized for its unrealistic promises. And Hillary Clinton, who would end the carried interest provision through the punitive, President Obama-approved “Buffett Rule,” doesn’t even have an issue position specifically for taxes or tax reform on her campaign Web site, which makes it difficult to analyze her overall tax plan for Americans unless you are studying the fine print. <br> Anyway, both Republicans and Democrats have avoided putting the issue of carried interest in the crosshairs for years, but this could be the year when support for carried interest takes a meaningful dive. I think it is inevitable, especially because of how Jeb Bush has taken a lead in promising to eliminate that provision. In tonight’s economic debate on Fox Business Network, I hope the moderators will ask the candidates to comprehensively explain their tax reform plans and, more specifically, ask each candidate what they will do about carried interest as part of big tax reform. The hedge funds and financial players have powerful political allies, and they do a lot to fund both parties. It will be interesting to see which candidates will be ready to follow Bush’s lead and present and defend a clear position, and who will try to hide. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The most amusing part of the Trump transition has been watching its effortless confounding of the media, often in fewer than 140 characters. One morning, after a Fox News report on lefty nuttiness at some obscure New England college — a flag-burning that led a more-contemptible-than-usual campus administration to take down the school’s own American flag — Donald Trump tweets that flag burners should go to jail or lose their citizenship. <br> An epidemic of constitutional chin tugging and civil libertarian hair pulling immediately breaks out. By the time the media have exhausted their outrage over the looming abolition of free speech, judicial supremacy and affordable kale, Trump has moved on. The tempest had a shorter half-life than the one provoked in August 2015 by a Trump foray into birthright citizenship. <br> Trump so thoroughly owns the political stage today that the word “Clinton” seems positively quaint and Barack Obama, who happens to be president of the United States, is totally irrelevant. Obama gave a major national security address on Tuesday. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn’s son got more attention. <br> Trump has mesmerized the national media not just with his elaborate Cabinet-selection production, by now Broadway-ready. But with a cluster of equally theatrical personal interventions that by traditional standards seem distinctly unpresidential. <br> It’s a matter of size. They seem small for a president. Preventing the shutdown of a Carrier factory in Indiana. Announcing, in a contextless 45-second surprise statement, a major Japanese investment in the U.S. Calling for cancellation of the new Air Force One to be built by Boeing. <br> Pretty small stuff. It has the feel of a Cabinet undersecretary haggling with a contractor or a state governor drumming up business on a Central Asian trade mission. Or of candidate Trump selling Trump Steaks and Trump wine in that bizarre victory speech after the Michigan primary. <br> Presidents don’t normally do such things. It shrinks them. But then again, Trump is not yet president. And the point here is less the substance than the symbolism. <br> The Carrier coup was meant to demonstrate the kind of concern for the working man that gave Trump the Rust Belt victories that carried him to the presidency. The Japanese SoftBank announcement was a down payment on his promise to be the “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.” (A slightly dubious claim: After all, how instrumental was Trump to that investment? Surely a financial commitment of that magnitude would have been planned long before Election Day.) And Boeing was an ostentatious declaration that he would be the zealous guardian of government spending that you would expect from a crusading outsider. <br> What appears as random Trumpian impulsiveness has a logic to it. It’s a continuation of the campaign. Trump is acutely sensitive to his legitimacy problem, as he showed in his tweet claiming to have actually won the popular vote, despite trailing significantly in the official count. His best counter is approval ratings. In August, the Bloomberg poll had him at 33 percent. He’s now up to 50 percent. Still nowhere near Obama’s stratospheric 79 percent at this point in 2008, but a substantial improvement nonetheless. <br> The mini-interventions are working, but there’s a risk for Trump in so personalizing his coming presidency. It’s a technique borrowed from Third World strongmen who specialize in demonstrating their personal connection to the ordinary citizen. In a genuine democracy, however, the endurance of any political support depends on the larger success of the country. And that doesn’t come from Carrier-size fixes. It comes from policy — policy that fundamentally changes the structures and alters the trajectory of the nation. <br> “I alone can fix it,” Trump ringingly declared in his Republican National Convention speech. Indeed, alone he can do Carrier and SoftBank and Boeing. But ultimately he must deliver on tax reform, health care, economic growth and nationwide job creation. That requires Congress. <br> The 115th is Republican and ready to push through the legislation that gives life to the promises. On his part, Trump needs to avoid needless conflict. The Republican leadership has already signaled strong opposition on some issues, such as tariffs for job exporters. Nonetheless, there is enough common ground between Trump and his congressional majority to have an enormously productive 2017. The challenge will be to stay within the bounds of the GOP consensus. <br> Trump will continue to tweet and the media will continue to take the bait. Highly entertaining, but it is a sideshow. Congress is where the fate of the Trump presidency will be decided. <br> Read more from Charles Krauthammer’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more here: <br> George F.

 YOU WOULD not know it from the rhetoric of the recently completed political campaign, but the United States is in pretty good economic shape. The unemployment rate stands at a mere 4.6 percent of the labor force, the lowest level since August 2007, according to the Labor Department report published Friday. Inflation is running at a manageable 1.6 percent. The Dow Jones stock index stands at an all-time high of over 19,000. And hourly wages are growing at an annual rate of more than 2 percent. By any conventional measure, President Obama is handing his successor, Donald Trump, a far, far better situation than the one he inherited in January 2009. Reflective of that reality, the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its gradual normalization of monetary policy by raising interest rates slightly later this month.  <br> There is, indeed, room for improvement: Broader labor-market statistics that account for underemployment (involuntary part-time work and the like) have still not quite returned to pre-recession levels. Labor-force participation remains subpar, especially among men in the prime working years between the ages of 25 and 54. Productivity growth has slowed. And the federal budget deficit has resumed growing, reflecting the continued imbalance between spending commitments (entitlement programs, defense spending) and revenues. <br> In short, the punishing cyclical crisis of 2008-2009 is far behind us; there is no need for large-scale, short-term stimulus. The economy faces long-standing structural issues, which call for long-term structural reforms. In their more lucid moments, Mr. Trump and his advisers have spoken of targeted deregulation, business tax reform and other measures which might enhance the economy’s growth potential, depending on how they are actually done. At other times, unfortunately, they have spoken of massive defense spending increases or huge tax cuts skewed in favor of the wealthy; Mr. Trump’s top political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, dreams of a conservative nationalist pseudo-New Deal in the form of “a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. . . . Shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up. We’re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks.”  <br> Cooler heads must prevail. The record of nationalistic economic populism around the world is a dizzying and destructive one of boom followed by bust. Even if matters do not reach that extreme during the Trump administration, reckless expansion of the federal debt would not only violate Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, it would use up “fiscal space” the federal government needs to address a true economic emergency. Under no responsible reading of the data does our current situation fit that description. <br> Read more here: <br> Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross: How Trump would stimulate the U.S. economy <br> Robert J.

 Mark R. Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, is a member of the U.S. Senate. <br> Modern American capitalism is not working for many Americans. That’s why, no matter what your political leanings, fixing an economy that can no longer be counted on to create steady, well-paying jobs for all has to be our top priority. <br> Whether you were heartened or heartbroken by the election results, millions of American voters have made one thing clear: There is a widespread belief that our once great institutions are unable, or at least unwilling, to work together to address today’s economic challenges. <br> Job creation has continued for 73 straight months. Wages are beginning to rise. Still, the populist tide we’ve seen all year is fueled by Americans who continue to white-knuckle it every day, believing they are just one or two paychecks away from disaster. Indeed, too many of them are. <br> Democrats and Republicans in Washington largely have failed to respond adequately to the seismic shifts that have been occurring for some time across our economy, many of them triggered by increased automation and global, competitive pressures. <br> While there is no consensus yet on how to respond to a globalized economy that now disrupts at Internet speed, here are a few ideas for equipping Americans with new tools to help navigate the changes: <br> First, while much attention has been given to the recent growth in gig-economy start-ups such as Uber, Lyft and TaskRabbit, this app-driven work remains a relatively small part of a much broader universe of freelance, temporary and part-time work. About one-third of working Americans today are involved in some form of contingent work, and that’s expected to swell to nearly 50 percent over the next decade. <br> Workers unattached to traditional long-term jobs typically have limited access to social insurance such as health care, disability insurance and retirement savings, which provide peace of mind and a safety net to protect them if needed. At the same time, we have never made it easy for even successful independent contractors, such as consultants and lawyers, to find or fund their own social insurance. <br> So we should be encouraging more innovation and experimentation around portable benefits — a 21st-century safety net tied to the individual, not the job. This approach could provide greater income stability and protection for workers who hold multiple jobs — whether across a single day or an entire career. <br> Second, the government-driven, top-down programs to train workers for today’s jobs simply don’t function well enough. The jobs available today and the jobs expected tomorrow are higher-skill positions that will require targeted and continuous learning to allow workers to adapt to changing technology. <br> Congress should be talking about ways to incentivize businesses to provide additional training, especially for their lower- and middle-skill workers. We should discuss the appropriate metrics to make sure this training actually results in higher skills and better pay. <br> Third, too many U.S. public companies today are preoccupied with short-term profits at the expense of longer-term investments. While we used to see 50 percent of corporate profits reinvested in a business, today about 95 percent are redistributed as dividends or stock buybacks. This short-term focus robs companies of the investments in capital and people that make them a source of longer-lasting, well-paying jobs. <br> Investors, too, have increasingly displayed this short attention span. In the 1960s, the average hold of a share of public stock was eight years; today, it’s four months. If Washington is serious about tackling tax reform next year, we should be looking for constructive ways to encourage more public companies and their shareholders to make longer-term investments. <br> And while we’re at it, greater transparency around things such as stock buybacks and executive compensation would help restore public confidence in U.S. businesses, too. <br> Americans want this economy to work better for more people. They want to know how their jobs will pay for the economic security they have earned by following the rules. And they’re worried about their kids and whether any young person entering today’s workforce will ever have an opportunity to catch up. <br> If the new president and the new Congress do not find new ways to work together and demonstrate a real resolve to begin tackling these challenges, then we will have learned nothing from the election — and that will be on us. <br> Read more here: <br> Mark R.

 Henry Olsen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and an adjunct professor at Villanova University. His book “Ronald Reagan: New Deal Republican” is scheduled for publication next year. <br> Donald Trump has won what might be the greatest “change election” in decades. Republicans leaders are only now waking up to the fact that the change Trump’s voters want will end up changing the GOP, too. <br> Trump’s voters were not voting for less government. Instead, they believe the promise of American life has been taken from them by elites of both parties who neither know nor care what they are doing to their fellow citizens. Trump stepped into this massive credibility gap with the message that he was different. In his talks, tweets and rallies, he identified the problems these people were facing: stagnating wages, shrinking numbers of good jobs, a political and media culture that treated them as though they were aliens in their own country. For years, they had been longing for someone of Trump’s stature to say to them: “I hear you, and I will make things right.” <br> These voters backed Trump because they want their heritage back. This is not, as has been charged, a racially tinged impulse. Millions of Trump’s supporters voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Rather, it is the heritage that all Americans are of equal worth, that common values and common activities are worthy of respect and reward and confer dignity. Trump said he would “make America great again,” but he could have run on a different, more intellectual slogan: “Make American citizenship count again.” <br> This citizenship agenda is less interested in shrinking government than in making it work for average Americans. Trump’s signature issues — immigration, trade, law and order, fighting terrorism — all involve the federal government doing more and doing it better. This push for federal action will pose serious challenges to the reigning GOP orthodoxy. However, if the first 100 days of a Trump presidency involve nothing more than tax cuts, deregulation and other traditional Republican ideas, the voters who wanted something different will wonder whether they were simply marks in a skillful con. <br> Many of Trump voters’ priorities can be addressed in ways consistent with Republican inclinations. Immigration can be reduced but not eliminated; trade deals can proceed if they ensure that benefits flow to average Americans, not just those in finance or exporting industries. Tax reform, which means raising taxes on millions of honest Americans, can make way for tax cuts, and those cuts can be structured so that large proportional gains go to those making less than the median income. <br> Other initiatives might require more direct government action. Stagnating wages are not going away overnight. Why not create a generous wage subsidy in place of a minimum wage increase? Why not pass a New Homestead Act that gives incentives to Americans in low-growth areas to move to places with greater opportunity? Why not withhold federal criminal-justice funding from police departments with a pattern of civil rights violations, and increase funding for departments that cut crime and eradicate police misbehavior? <br> This style of governance is not just what Americans want: It also fits with the Reaganite philosophy Republicans purport to admire. In his famous speech endorsing Barry Goldwater, Reagan told Americans: “There is no such thing as left or right. There is only up or down.” Trump voters believe this wholeheartedly. They want government to move up and move beyond the sterile ideological battles of left or right. There’s a reason Trump got the votes of the descendants of the Reagan Democrats: He was communicating the Reagan message that Americans of all stripes deserved a hand up from their government. <br> Reagan never let ideology get in the way of helping average Americans. Reagan didn’t just support free trade; he subtly encouraged Japan to enact “voluntary” export limits, which forced Japanese firms wanting to sell more cars in the United States to build American factories employing American workers. The Gipper’s tax cuts always included generous exemptions or credits geared toward removing millions of low-income workers from the rolls entirely. Reagan’s two terms are replete with examples of an energetic, active government that was nonetheless limited in its scope and aspirations. <br> Trump’s victory has given the Republican Party the opportunity of a generation. It can either hear the demands of whom, echoing Reagan and conservative Australian statesman Sir Robert Menzies, Trump calls “the forgotten people” or not. If it does, it will realign the GOP with its Reaganite heritage and work to affirm what Reagan called “the purpose and worth to each and every life.” If the GOP can change back to what it once was, it can enact the change Trump’s voters want and change America for the better. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Lou Cannon: I covered Ronald Reagan.

 Norman J. Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. <br> How does a divided United States, gripped with a combination of angry populism and partisan tribalism, govern with a president who lost the popular vote but a Congress that is primed to implement swaths of his agenda — and expects the president to bow to some of its policy preferences along the way? How can this dynamic play out in a way that respects the fact that Republicans control the executive and legislative branches but more than half the country does not embrace a sharply ideological or radical agenda? How do we keep extreme policies at bay? <br> Donald Trump’s choice of alt-right leader Stephen K. Bannon as top White House strategist suggests that the worst instincts of the president-elect remain intact. The hopes for governance hewing closer to the center, and respecting all those living in the United States, rest with the Senate, and with the behavior and outlook of senators in both parties. <br> For Senate Republicans, this is a critical moment to heed a call their colleague Lindsey Graham (S.C.) made earlier in the campaign — there is a time to put country ahead of party. Reflexive party loyalty now, including blindly confirming all of Trump’s executive and judicial nominees, would violate that maxim. Republicans need to vet thoroughly and firmly all nominees, but especially those who violate basic standards of moderation, civility and respect for constitutional norms. That means racially divisive and bombastic figures such as Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke, who stunningly called on his allies during the campaign to ready their “pitchforks and torches,” and who has been rumored to be Trump’s top choice for homeland security secretary, should be rejected. <br> Should the equally divisive Rudy Giuliani be nominated for a position in Trump’s Cabinet, he should be subject by Republicans as well as Democrats to probing confirmation hearings, including his highly questionable relationship during the campaign with the New York office of the FBI, the over-the-top accusations he directed at Hillary Clinton and his enrichment from a range of autocratic regimes. And whatever figures are eventually confirmed, it is vital that Senate Republicans provide oversight with vigor and integrity to make sure that offices are not abused. Similarly, vigorous oversight is needed to keep the country from becoming a kleptocracy, where policies that serve the holdings of officeholders, including the president, prevail over the needs of the country. <br> Senate Republicans should also make sure that destructive policies, whether to increase the debt with unpaid-for tax cuts, blow up agencies, make mindless cuts in regulations, pursue trade wars, accept torture, move us closer to an all-out war with Islam or curtail civil liberties, do not get jammed through Congress. They cannot succumb to the pressure sure to come from the radical right to kill the filibuster not just for nominations but also for legislative actions. Not every Senate Republican will heed this call. But from a group including Graham, Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), John McCain (Ariz.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), among others, there should be sufficient numbers to provide a check and balance against authoritarian and divisive rule. <br> What about Senate Democrats? They will be tempted to adopt the Republican playbook from 2009, when Democrats controlled Washington: Vote in unison against everything, filibuster everything, even those things you like, to obstruct action and make it look ugly, allow damage to the country in the short term to reap political rewards in the next election. That would be a mistake. <br> Democrats have a chance to use their filibuster power not just to obstruct but also to improve. The first opportunity to do that will likely be on an infrastructure bill. Financing a good portion of the package through repatriated corporate profits invested in long-term, low-interest infrastructure bonds is one key. Making sure that a significant share of the program goes to green energy, broadband, cybersecurity and the electrical grid should be strong demands. So should a guarantee that any corporate tax reform that is a part of the deal not be simply another giant tax cut and giveaway. <br> The second chance may come on health policy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has pledged to repeal Obamacare as an early priority — now contradicted by the president-elect. Democrats can bargain for a revision of Obamacare — call it Trumpcare — that keeps exchanges and the individual mandate to preserve a meaningful protection for preexisting conditions and prevents a new lifetime coverage limit, and also strengthens risk corridors to prevent huge premium fluctuations. In return, they can drop the employer mandate, strengthen markets and reform malpractice insurance. <br> Filibustering an extreme Supreme Court nominee, and blocking legislation to privatize Medicare or Social Security, to eliminate or eviscerate the Environmental Protection Agency or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or to give more giant tax cuts to the super-rich — all these make sense for Democrats and for the country. But embracing the McConnell tactic of mindless obstruction does not. Right now, our hopes of having the better angels in our system prevail over our worst forces and instincts rest with the Senate. Let’s hope its members respond. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Robert J.

 The Republican Party is everywhere triumphant — House and Senate, executive and legislative, national and state — and yet faces a series of crises. <br> There is a crisis of identity. Donald Trump now leads a coalition including the Republican establishment — and people who despise the Republican establishment. The insurgent president-elect — lacking relevant experience, adequate personnel and actual policy proposals — cannot exercise power without the help of those he ridiculed. <br> Trump has chosen to incorporate this conflict into the structure of the West Wing. His chief of staff, Reince Priebus, was the sponsor of the 2013 Republican autopsy report, which called on the party to accommodate America’s multicultural future. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has made a career out of resisting that future. This is less a team of rivals than an ideological cage fight. <br> Every good presidential transition should involve betraying a few of your friends. Not everyone who helps a president become president is fit to help him govern. Bannon — whose Breitbart News invited the alt-right into the conservative mainstream and who has made a business model out of spreading conspiratorial nonsense — belongs in this category, along with Sarah Palin, Rudy Giuliani, Corey Lewandowski and the rest of the distracting campaign sideshow. <br> For the Republican Party, this is also a governing crisis. Trump won office promising to undo globalization, bring back manufacturing jobs and fulfill “every dream you ever dreamed.” So expectations are pretty high. But Trumpism, for the most part, consists of cultural signals and symbolic goals, not a set of developed proposals. <br> Many Republican members of Congress are frankly confused. Are they supposed to follow Trump’s lead or supply his agenda? He has embraced massive infrastructure investment, but there is no favored bill or detailed plan. Obamacare must go, but what approach to “replace” does Trump prefer? House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) is pushing for tax reform. Does the president-elect have any interest in the topic at all? The biggest frustration reported by Republicans who have met with Trump is his inability to focus for any period of time. He is impatient with facts and charts and he changes the subject every few minutes. Republican leaders need policy leadership — or permission to provide it themselves. <br> One area where the agenda is unifying and well-developed concerns the reversal of Obama-era executive orders. Republican lawyers have spent the past year and a half working in study groups on reversal language in order to be ready on the first day of a GOP presidency. The action most likely to cause controversy would overturn President Obama’s limited amnesty for students brought illegally to the United States as children. Most Republicans think that executive order was illegal; but most Americans will probably find the victims of reversing the order to be sympathetic. <br> This hints at the long-term political crisis faced by the triumphant GOP. Trump won the presidency in a manner that undermines the GOP’s electoral future. He demonstrated that the “coalition of the ascendant” — including minorities, millennials and the college-educated — is not yet ascendant. But in a nation where over half of children under 5 years old are racial or ethnic minorities, it eventually will be. Trump was elected by a 70 percent white electorate. But that was about two percentage points lower than in the 2012 election — and that number has been dropping by about two points each presidential election for decades. Trump’s white-turnout strategy is not the wave of the future; it is the last gasp of an old and disturbing electoral approach. <br> The final crisis faced by the GOP — and just about everyone else — relates to the quality of our political culture. Trump won office in a way that damaged our democracy. He fed resentment against minorities, promised to jail his opponent and turned shallow invective into an art form. If he governs as he campaigned, Trump will smash the unity of our country into a thousand shards of bitterness. <br> We should hope that the president-elect will be sobered by the responsibilities of high office and discovers hidden resources of charity (even though malice has been the habit of a lifetime). He deserves the space at least to try. But Republicans may end up depending on a younger generation of leaders — Ryan, Ben Sasse, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Jeff Flake, Marco Rubio — to demonstrate the possibility of unifying aspiration and civil disagreement. And that would lay the foundation for a lasting and honorable victory. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: President Trump <br> Paul Waldman: The Trump administration hasn’t even started yet, and it’s already a fiasco <br> Kathleen Parker: Is the White House already changing Donald Trump? <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Lawrence Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. <br> Following a brief market plunge, the president-elect’s speech last Tuesday night was more conciliatory than many expected and emphasized his commitment to infrastructure investment. Investors have, on balance, concluded that the combination of a shift to very expansionary fiscal policy and major reductions in regulation in sectors ranging from energy to finance to drug pricing will raise demand and reflate the U.S. economy. <br> The result has been a rise in real interest rates and inflation expectations, along with a strong stock market and a strong dollar. Experience suggests, however, that initial market responses to major political events are poor predictors of their ultimate impact. <br> The late MIT economist Rudiger Dornbusch made an extensive study of the results of populist economic programs around the world, finding that while they sometimes had immediate positive results, over the medium- and long-term they were catastrophic for the working class in whose name they were launched. This could be the fate of the Trump program given its design errors, implausible assumptions and reckless disregard for global economics. <br> I have long been a strong advocate of debt-financed public investment in the context of low interest rates and a decaying U.S. infrastructure, so I was glad to see Trump emphasize it. Unfortunately, the plan presented by his advisers, Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross, suggests an approach based on tax credits for equity investment and total private-sector participation that will not cover the most important projects, not reach many of the most important investors and involve substantial mis-targeting of public resources. <br> Many of the highest-return infrastructure investments — such as improving roads, repairing 60,000 structurally deficient bridges, upgrading schools or modernizing the air traffic control system — do not generate a commercial return and so are excluded from his plan. Nor can the non-taxable pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that are the most promising sources of capital for infrastructure take advantage of the program. <br> I am optimistic regarding the efficacy of fiscal expansion. But any responsible economist has to recognize that, past a point, it can lead to some combination of excessive foreign borrowing, inflation and even financial crisis. As Dornbusch showed, in emerging markets this can happen quite quickly. In the United States the process would take longer. <br> Even without taking account of the likely costs of the infrastructure plan (which the Trump team badly underestimates) or the proposed defense build-up, the Trump tax reform proposals are too expensive. Many, such as the proposed abolition of the estate tax, will benefit only the high-saving wealthy. <br> While drastic changes in the proposed domestic program are necessary for it to work, the general direction of increasing public investment, reforming taxes and adjusting regulation is appropriate. The same cannot be said of Trump’s global plan, which rests on a misunderstanding of how the world economy operates. <br> Consider the immediate effects of Trump’s victory. The Mexican peso has depreciated about 10 percent relative to the dollar over fears of new protectionist policies, and many other emerging market currencies have also fallen sharply. The impact of this change is to raise the cost of anything the U.S. exports to Mexico and to lower the cost of anything Mexico exports to the United States. <br> It will also make Mexico and other emerging markets much cheaper relative to the United States for global companies. So U.S. workers, particularly in manufacturing, will face increased pressure. <br> The plan seems to assume that we can pressure countries not to let their currencies depreciate, as suggested by the intention to have the new treasury secretary name China as an exchange-rate manipulator. This is ludicrous. While there are reasonable arguments that China manipulated its exchange rate for commercial advantage in the past, the reality is that for the past year the country has intervened to prop up its exchange rate. The same is true of most emerging markets. Not even U.S. presidents with political mandates can repeal the laws of economics. <br> Populist economics will play out differently in the United States than in emerging markets. But the results will be no better. All with a stake in the global economy must hope that now, as has happened often in the past, a U.S. president faced with the responsibility of governing preserves the valid core of campaign economic plans while making major adjustments. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Robert J.

 Regarding the April 7 Style article “Quiet tip unleashed Panama Papers”: <br> I doubt international tax reform can address fraudulent use of tax havens. Any solution will fail without transparent ownership of privately held companies. The invention of the now ubiquitous limited liability company drives fraud and prevents discovery of criminal activity. A privately held LLC can be formed without any public reporting of ownership at formation or thereafter. Remember Enron? <br> Until ownership is publicly reported, every citizen will be at risk from terrorists, drug traffickers and fraudsters — and international influence in our elections. <br> Corporate law is generally state law, but our national security is at risk. Congress should act to require reporting of ownership interest in all privately held business associations licensed by any state corporation commission. This may sound radical, but let’s shine some light on this problem. <br> Juliet Hiznay, Arlington <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Kristen Soltis Anderson is a Republican pollster with Echelon Insights, a columnist for the Washington Examiner and the author of “The Selfie Vote: Where Millennials Are Leading America (And How Republicans Can Keep Up).” <br> ‘You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus,” President Bill Clinton said on Inauguration Day in 1993. “I earned capital in this campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it,” President George W. Bush said upon being reelected in 2004. Most succinct was President Obama in 2009: “I won.” <br> With just over a week until the 2016 election results are tallied, it seems overwhelmingly likely that Hillary Clinton will be the next president of the United States. And her campaign clearly has mandate-building in mind as it makes its final push. Not content to merely fight for Florida or Ohio, just one of which would be needed to deny Donald Trump the presidency, the Clinton team has deployed surrogates like Michelle Obama to places like Arizona in hopes of running up the score. It is quite likely that if Clinton takes the stage to give a victory speech, she will make a claim similar to those of the presidents before her: that Americans have clearly endorsed her vision for the country. <br> Some political pundits and supporters are already laying out the case for her. “Clinton is in a position to notch a resounding victory by historical standards,” Frank Bruni wrote in the New York Times. Similarly, Damon Linker argued in the Week: “The wider Clinton’s margin of victory and the closer she comes to winning an outright majority of the votes cast, the more persuasive her claim of a mandate will be. And if she actually crosses the 50 percent threshold, she’ll have one of the strongest claims to a mandate in nearly a century.” Running mate Tim Kaine told CNN: “Donald is still going to whine if he loses. But if the mandate is clear, I don’t think many people will follow him.” <br> Would a big Clinton win actually mean a mandate, though? In an election where voters are more disappointed than ever in the choices they face, where an astonishing number will cast a ballot primarily as a way to oppose a different candidate and where core issues have taken a back seat to tabloid headlines, even a legitimate landslide wouldn’t necessarily clarify what, exactly, Clinton had been sent to the White House to do. <br> Mandates are often talked about in relationship to the decisiveness of victory. But in practice, the two may not have much to do with each other. Political scientist Julia Azari, the author of “Delivering the People’s Message: The Changing Politics of the Presidential Mandate ,” describes presidential mandates as “elite constructions,” more about credible claims than objective facts. They are grand narratives about support for a particular agenda — and serve as a threat that Congress ought to go along with that agenda or else face the wrath of the voters. They are a product of those eager to leverage election results to further political goals. Consider that when Bill Clinton invoked that “unmistakable chorus,” only 43 percent of voters had raised their voices for him. <br> Bush’s presidency offers another good example of the disconnect between mandate and margin of victory. Despite his narrow win in 2000, his administration governed as if it had a mandate, and in its first term it enacted many of the policies he ran on, including tax cuts, education reform and Medicare Part D. After Bush’s reelection, when he defeated Sen. John Kerry by more than two percentage points in the popular vote and by 35 electoral votes, Bush decided to devote his “political capital” to fixing entitlements. The effort failed. Peter Wehner, who headed up the Bush White House’s Office of Strategic Initiatives, says the White House had a “false sense of comfort” about the public willingness to rally behind the president’s proposals. <br> Even electoral landslides such as Lyndon B. Johnson’s defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964 do not protect presidents from political challenges, with Johnson’s “mandate” curdling into a loss of Democratic seats in Congress in 1966 and his loss of control of his own party by the 1968 election. <br> The Clinton camp seems concerned that Trump’s repeated claims that the election is “rigged” could chip away her mandate. But though doubts about legitimacy make a president more likely to assert a mandate — Azari’s research has found that mandate claims have risen as trust in government and other institutions has declined — whether or not a president has a mandate is not the same as a question of legitimacy. Presidents can be fairly and legitimately elected and yet not have a mandate to push through their agendas. <br> A bigger factor undercutting Clinton’s claim to a mandate is the unprecedented level of negativity that voters feel toward both candidates in this election. According to Pew, a majority of Trump supporters say their vote is mostly about taking a stand against Clinton, and nearly half of Clinton’s voters say their vote is mostly to oppose Trump. Compare that with the 2012 election, which at the time felt like an incredibly negative race. Both Mitt Romney and Obama had positive net-favorables in polls, meaning more people liked them than disliked them. Only 10 percent of voters in the exit polls that year said their vote was primarily cast as a way to stop the opponent. At the very least, Obama could claim that the vast majority of those voting for him affirmatively wanted him to be president; it would be harder for Clinton to say the same. <br> Yes, voters may choose to stay home, vote for a third-party candidate or write in someone else if they dislike both Trump and Clinton. But the stakes may feel too high in this election — especially in swing states — to cast a protest vote just to feel good; better to hold one’s nose and do the unpleasant thing to stave off an even graver threat to one’s way of life. (No wonder the American Psychological Association found half of Americans expressing election-related stress.) <br> The concept of a mandate also relies on the idea that voters do not elect just a particular person but one with a specific vision. On this front, too, the Clinton campaign is lacking. While she does discuss policy a great deal, she rarely articulates clear priorities or which issues she would tackle first. And the media frenzy around Trump has pushed all positive messaging about policy agendas out of the headlines. “I don’t know that voters could name what her policies are,” says former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau. <br> Of course, elections are often more about personalities than policies, and voters may be drawn to candidates for a variety of reasons that may not overlap. But this election seems to be especially short on substance. Gallup has asked voters for decades whether or not presidential candidates are “talking about issues you really care about.” Typically as Election Day approaches, more and more voters say yes; in 2016, the trend has been the opposite. And whereas about three-quarters of voters said yes at the equivalent point in previous election years, less than half said yes in this month’s survey. <br> Even on the few issues that have broken through, it’s unclear that there’s overwhelming support for Clinton. Take immigration. Kaine has expressly used the term “mandate” in this context, telling voters at a rally in Nevada that a Clinton win would affirm a strong preference for immigration reform over Trump’s vision of a “deportation nation.” But while support for mass deportation is low , and a majority of voters reject Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, The Washington Post’s most recent polling shows voters fairly evenly divided between trusting Trump or Clinton on immigration issues, and Pew polling has found that the plurality of voters think there should be equal weight on border security and a path to citizenship. <br> If elections are a chance to sell voters on an issue agenda, both candidates have completely squandered that opportunity. <br> Some progressives have tried to head off debate about Clinton’s mandate by arguing that mandates are meaningless, given the toxic relationship between the parties. “The truth is that the people who have to approve or reject the president’s agenda don’t give a damn about mandates one way or the other — they’ll support what they want to support and oppose what they want to oppose, whether because of their sincere beliefs or the political demands of their districts and states,” Paul Waldman wrote in the American Prospect. And in New York magazine, Jonathan Chait called mandates “an archaic holdover” from a time when “crossing the aisle was common” and members of Congress could be influenced by “moral pressure” to pass the agenda of a president from the opposing party. <br> Actually, Azari’s research — going back to 1928 — shows that it is in a moment like this that mandates matter most. When party polarization is low, there isn’t much need for talk of mandates. In periods of intense polarization, invoking mandates helps presidents defend what they want to do, especially when they can’t do it alone. <br> And research has shown that legislators do change their voting behavior, at least temporarily, in response to perceptions of a mandate. “For some it is a means of insulating themselves from the changing electoral landscape,” write the authors of a 2003 paper published in the American Journal of Political Science. “These members’ responses to the mandate election are, we believe, an attempt to stave off the possibility of electoral defeat. For other members the mandate provides new opportunities to vote their ideological preferences.” <br> It’s true that after this election, there will be little incentive for either side to bend to the will of the opponent on any particular policy issue, even in defeat, and it will be shocking if the next president gets anything resembling a honeymoon period. <br> But even if a Clinton win does not come with a clear mandate for her specific agenda, it should send a wake-up call to Republicans. It will at a minimum be a repudiation of the way Trump has conducted himself, and the anger and division he has sown, in this campaign. Clinton may be seen as unlikable and untrustworthy, and she may not represent significant majorities on key issues, but in polls she is at least viewed as having the temperament to serve as president. If she has a mandate at all, it would be to use that temperament to thaw relations with Capitol Hill and to take steps toward progress on the sorts of major challenges — tax reform, entitlements, infrastructure — both parties agree are facing us, even though they hold deep disagreements on how to solve them. <br> To the extent that any presidential election is ever about choosing an individual for the express purpose of enacting an explicitly articulated policy agenda, this election is most certainly not about that. Voters are fed up and frustrated, disappointed in their choices, and disheartened by how little they have heard about the issues that matter to them. <br> Clinton will probably win the White House in a large, legitimate victory in the ugliest election America has seen in decades — even if the “unmistakable chorus” is not exactly singing in unison. But once the cacophony of the election has died down and governing begins, the new president will have to work to earn the support of the people on the issues that matter most. <br> Twitter: @KSoltisAnderson <br> Read more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter. 
 WASHINGTON STATE will vote next month on one of the most ambitious climate-change programs ever seriously considered in the United States. Yet major players in the environmental movement either oppose the ballot measure or are undermining its chances in less formal ways. <br> You might assume these environmental groups were making the perfect the enemy of the good. But they are not defending the perfect. Their approach would be worse than what is on Washington’s ballot. They are wrong on the politics and wrong on the substance. <br> The ballot initiative would impose a significant tax on carbon dioxide emissions, the main culprit in human-caused climate change, and set the tax level to rise annually. Because low-income people would be disproportionately harmed by the tax, the state would use the revenue to reduce the state sales tax and increase the earned-income tax credit for the working poor. This would protect the poor and make Washington’s tax structure, one of the nation’s most dysfunctional, more progressive. This win-win plan is optimized to fight climate change; economists have explained for years that pricing carbon, as with a carbon tax, is the most efficient way to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, because it impels consumers and businesses to change their behavior without bureaucratic micromanagment. <br> The activists want micromanagement. Because the plan would recycle the revenue it raised, none would be left over for “investments” that activists favor. Elements of the coalition that environmentalists have assembled want “green jobs” programs, initiatives aimed specifically at communities of color, infrastructure that labor unions favor, and so forth. In other words, softening the blow for the poor and middle class is not enough. The government must divert the revenue according to the wishes of specific interest groups. <br> To some, naked interest-group politics is a principle of sorts. In a detailed account of the environmentalist civil war over Washington’s ballot initiative, Vox’s David Roberts explained that many activists believe that building a big leftist coalition is the only way major action on climate will happen. Recycling carbon-tax revenue, rather than showering it on interest groups, “loses you the left coalition, and with it the big left funders, and doesn’t gain you any Republicans.” Maybe — just maybe — this reflects not just a failure on the part of Republican climate head-in-the-sanders, but also of “the big left funders” and their intellectual enablers. If the movement cannot accept economically sound policy that would help solve the fundamental problem, there is something deeply wrong with the movement. <br> As it happens, the activists’ self-justifying political analysis is wrong, too. In most of the country, a leftist coalition could not impose a dramatic climate plan premised on jacking up taxes and government spending. If it really wants to fight climate change, the movement should be able to take yes for an answer. <br> Read more: <br> The Post’s View: With more people hitting the road, it’s time for a carbon tax <br> Letters to the Editor: A carbon tax is the wrong solution <br> Robert J.

 I would like to agree with Robert J. Samuelson’s Oct. 24 op-ed, “Split your ticket.” I used to split my ticket routinely and purposely, but no more. Mr. Samuelson wrote that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) “want to get things done.” This is surely not true of Mr. McConnell, who openly stated that his main goal was to prevent the president from accomplishing anything. Regarding the Affordable Care Act as an example of a program failing without bipartisan support, it is hard to imagine a more Republican-friendly health-care reform. Many Democrats prefer single-payer or at least a “government option,” similar to Medicare for all.  <br> I’ll continue to vote the straight Democratic ticket until Republicans begin to offer real dialogue and the possibility of compromise, or at least until they begin to confirm the president’s court appointees. <br> Ruth Skjerseth, Reston <br> Of the three reasons Robert J. Samuelson cited for splitting one’s ticket when voting this November, the one he claimed to be most consequential was that doing so might produce better government by giving a new Congress a fresh start. Yet for the past six years, government — Congress in particular — has done nothing to deal with the vexing issues facing the nation: immigration reform, tax reform, entitlement reform, climate change, etc. <br> Mr. Samuleson’s basis for thinking that a Republican Congress with a Democrat in the White House would cause a break in the persistent government gridlock is not borne out by history. Nor would the players be new: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) would continue to lead a Congress trying to impose a failed agenda in a desperate attempt to govern. Why would it be any other way, politics being what it is?  <br> Voters should ignore Mr. Samuelson’s advice and vote for the candidate who most closely favors their own politics, rather than look for phony ways to make government work, such as splitting their ticket at the voting booth.    <br> Jared Wermiel, Silver Spring 
 This month, the Congressional Progressive Caucus got far less attention than a random Donald Trump tweet when it released its annual budget — “The People’s Budget” — for fiscal 2017. The media’s oversight does Americans a disservice. Surprised by Bernie Sanders’s surge in the presidential campaign, the media tends to echo the Clinton campaign’s dismissal of his ideas as unrealistic. In fact, as the CPC budget demonstrates, there is growing political support at all levels for bold ideas that challenge the failed conservative consensus of the previous decades. And those ideas, like Sanders’s, are quite sensible. <br> The CPC budget is a detailed and sophisticated document. Prepared in conjunction with the Economic Policy Institute, it is projected in parallel with the Congressional Budget Office baseline. Its assumptions, programs, costs and revenue are laid out for all to see. And it is a ringing indictment of our current course. <br> Like Sanders, the People’s Budget boldly calls for a new era of public-investment-led growth. The budget supports a $1 trillion, 10-year-plan to rebuild our infrastructure, including a specific provision for addressing the decline in safe water illustrated in the Flint, Mich., calamity. It increases investments dramatically in education from pre-K to debt-free college. It unapologetically increases funds for cracking down on wage theft and enforcing worker rights and environmental protections. <br> Like Sanders, the CPC calls for progressive taxes and sensible spending savings to pay for its programs. But it also heeds the pleas of establishment institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (made up of the world’s leading economies) that have been begging the United States and other countries to expand public spending to stave off the renewed threat of a global downturn. The CPC frontloads its investments to move the economy rapidly toward real full employment (targeting 4 percent unemployment). Full employment would end the destructive job gap that has persisted since the Great Recession. And at full employment, wages would go up across the board, as workers start to be in demand. <br> The People’s Budget also would invest in job training and provide greater support to workers displaced by companies moving abroad. It invests in renewable energy and efficiency. It provides a special provision for jobs in chronically distressed communities, both rural and urban. It expands the earned-income tax credit for childless workers and the child-care tax credit. Americans would have jobs, see their incomes begin to rise and benefit from investments long overdue. <br> The CPC also provides a bold call for progressive tax reforms, increasing revenue while cutting ill-conceived tax policies. The CPC’s tax reforms include higher rates at the top, taxing returns on capital at the same rate as income from work and ending the perverse deferral of corporate taxes on profits squirreled abroad. The CPC supports the Robin Hood tax, the tax on financial transactions that would slow down nanosecond, computerized trading. It raises taxes on wealthy estates, and levies a new tax on banks that are too big to fail. It would also put a price on carbon emissions, rebating a portion of that revenue to lower-wage workers. It also saves nearly a half-trillion from health care by empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prices on drugs, creating a public option in Obamacare and reforming our corrupted drug patent and development laws. It would end subsidies to oil, coal and gas companies. By combining smart policies and smart economics, says Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), first vice chair of the CPC, “The People’s Budget reverses harmful austerity cuts and fixes a system that for far too long has only benefited those at the top.” <br> The People’s Budget also takes on wasteful spending. It features a proposal that progressives, responsible moderates and thinking conservatives have embraced: auditing the Pentagon. “As the only federal agency that cannot be audited, the Pentagon loses tens of billions of dollars annually to waste, fraud, and abuse,” argues the CPC. It would end the blind, across-the-board cuts to the military imposed by the sequester and budget caps. Instead, it would save a similar amount with considered cuts that focus Pentagon spending on modern security threats instead of Cold War-era weapons and contracts, and it would invest in a job-creation program that would help workers transition into civilian jobs. It would also end the off-budget funding of the military’s endless wars after a year, calling for an end to fighting in Afghanistan, while increasing investments in diplomacy, sustainable development, and humanitarian assistance to address the ongoing crises in Syria and Iraq. <br> At the end of 10 years, the CPC projects a lower annual deficit and level of debt-to-GDP than either current law or the president’s budget. And remarkably, only the People’s Budget succeeds in returning our spending on domestic programs that are voted on by Congress (discretionary domestic spending) to their historic average as a percent of GDP. The president’s budget, meanwhile, projects a continued unprecedented gutting of the domestic functions of government, from education to environmental protection to the FBI. <br> The contrast with Republicans is obvious. The House GOP released a budget that cuts domestic spending to levels lower than they were eight years ago, with the bulk of the cuts coming from programs for the most vulnerable. They would promote fracking, cut funding for renewable energy, end support for Amtrak and urban mass transit, shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, repeal the Affordable Care Act without a plan to replace it and turn Medicaid and food stamps into block grants for the states to savage. They would increase military spending. The Congressional Budget Office warned that under the House proposal, “economic output would be lower . . . because differences in federal spending and revenues would reduce total demand for goods and services.” <br> Over the past decades, conservatives in both parties have failed the vast majority in this country. The CPC People’s Budget, like the Sanders platform, shows there is an alternative. Bold, big reforms can make our lives better. Last year’s version of the People’s Budget had the support of nearly 100 legislators, yet its passage will require, as Sanders argues, a political revolution. What this remarkable document makes clear is that the question is not one of fate, but of policy and power. And more and more Americans are waking up to that. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: We need Bernie Sanders to redefine our politics — just like Ronald Reagan did <br> Robert J.

 Last year, I wrote an article calling Donald Trump a godsend for moderate Republicans. Trump, I predicted, would lose so spectacularly that the GOP would be forced to transform itself, surrendering its mindless obstructionism, science denial, xenophobia and plutocracy. After a purge like that, the party would finally be able to compete in future national elections. <br> I was wrong. I now see that Trump’s candidacy has exacerbated the Republican Party’s weaknesses, alienating minorities, fracturing the base and stunting smart policy development. The party’s structural problems are so severe that reform is impossible. Even if Trump loses and the GOP races to forget him, the party is doomed. And very few of our leaders seem to care. <br> In the short run, it will be easy for Republicans to convince themselves that nothing needs to change. The establishment believes that Trump is an anomaly, an aberration. GOP leaders think the party’s next nominee will be a more typical politician who knows the issues, has well-developed debating skills and who will appeal to the elite and the Trumpkins. Someone like John Kasich or Marco Rubio. <br> Many leaders also assume that Hillary Clinton is an automatic one-termer. They think she’s incompetent, scandal-ridden and hell-bent on destroying the economy. They know, too, that neither party has held the White House for more than three terms in the post-World War II era. <br> But Clinton’s chances of being reelected in 2020 are better than Republicans think. Already, Democrats have a virtual lock on 18 states, giving them an almost automatic 242 electoral votes. States such as Virginia, Colorado and Florida routinely vote Democratic, too. <br> Additionally, the Republican Party will have to contend with the Trump constituency, which will remain a powerful force in the presidential primaries (fueled, perhaps, by a Trump cable channel). White nationalists will continue to back racist candidates, alienating minority voters. It’s not hard to imagine another cycle with 17 candidates vying for the nomination. If that comes to pass, someone could win the primary race with less than half the vote, as Trump did. It could well be a candidate unpopular with mainstream conservatives. Even if not, it’s hard to imagine Republicans unifying around a consensus candidate. <br> If Clinton wins a second term, major progressive change becomes possible. Sixteen years of Democratic presidents will give the Supreme Court a solid liberal majority, making electoral reform doable. Restrictions on campaign contributions and gerrymandering could emerge, making it harder to draw districts that reliably swing one way or the other. If Democrats put resources into state legislative races, they may be able to undercut GOP gerrymandering after the 2020 census. The practice gives Republicans more seats than their share of the aggregate House vote — in 2014 they earned 51 percent of the vote but 57 percent of the seats. <br> By 2022, it’s possible that Democrats will control Congress and gridlock will be broken. Once that happens, the federal government will be able to tackle major issues. The constant Republican demands for budget cuts, tax cuts and deregulation won’t be the starting points for all policy discussion. We could see fundamental tax reform that raises rates for the rich and multinational corporations, meaningful measures to address climate change, fresh funding for crumbling infrastructure, and a public option for the Affordable Care Act. These measures, which I support, are popular with Americans. Their passage will bring more voters into the Democratic fold. <br> These policies will, of course, be opposed by Republicans (even those who know better) because the GOP’s Trump/tea party wing will control the nominating and primary process for years to come, dooming any leader or lawmaker who compromises with Democrats. <br> At this point, corporations and lobbyists will have to work almost exclusively with the Democratic Party to have a seat at the policy table. Even the billionaires who now provide the oil that keeps the GOP machine lubricated may decide that if they can’t have tax cuts, they should try to carve out special breaks for themselves. To do so, they may start funding friendly Democratic candidates and campaigns. As former U.S. deputy Treasury secretary Roger Altman showed recently in the Financial Times, busi­ness­peo­ple are already flocking to Clinton, and to Democrats more broadly. <br> Deprived of funding and business support, the national GOP will shrivel to what the party has become in California — irrelevant politically and unable to win outside its wealthy, right-wing enclaves. Republicans hold just 35 percent of the California Senate and Assembly, and have no hope of regaining the governor’s mansion or U.S. Senate seats. Virtually all debate about policy takes place among the Democratic Party’s strong factions. Everyone who matters is a Democrat. <br> Eventually, of course, Democrats will become corrupt, will overreach or will bear the blame for things beyond their control, like a recession. They may foolishly nominate someone too far left for the country, giving a Republican another shot at the White House. A strong leader could change the GOP’s trajectory, like Dwight Eisenhower did after five straight Republican presidential losses from 1932 to 1948. He put the party, as conservative then as it is today (just read the 1952 platform) on a more moderate, technocratic path that continued for a quarter-century through Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. A leader like Eisenhower might help right the GOP, attracting moderate voters and enhancing the party’s crossover appeal. <br> When I began criticizing the GOP for pandering to populists and extremists, I was largely alone. But now, longtime Republican luminaries, including John McCain’s 2008 campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, and Washington Post columnist George Will, share my perspective. Many, such as Josh Barro, a columnist for Business Insider, have virtually washed their hands of the party, viewing the intellectual rot as terminal. <br> Of course, the conservative era that lasted from 1994 to 2016 will leave behind legacies — some court decisions and legislative policies, such as aggressive tax cuts and a focus on deficit reduction, will be hard to reverse. But by and large, the right will cease being the obstacle to progress that it has been. Democrats will have to follow through with policy actions and political organizing at the state and local levels if they hope to see a long-term period in power. Still, the ground is being plowed and a brighter future — one without gridlock, when one major party can enact sweeping change — is visible on the horizon. <br> Because of the way our government is set up, the United States will probably always have two parties. But it is not foreordained that the GOP will be the center-right party. It could go the way of the Whigs or Canada’s Conservative Party in 1993 and literally disappear, or it could reconstitute itself so radically that it bears little resemblance to the Republican Party of today. One thing, however, is certain: A party that cannot capture the White House cannot survive. <br> Twitter: @BruceBartlett <br> Read more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Donald Trump has done America a great public service. No, really. By taking advantage of the country’s tax laws in such spectacular fashion, he has shone a spotlight on the corruption that is at the heart of American politics — the tax code. <br> When most people discuss taxes, they tend to talk about them in left-right terms. The right says that taxes are too high for everyone. The left worries that the rich don’t pay their fair share. But the facts don’t support either position. The simplest comprehensive way to judge a country’s tax burden is to look at its tax revenue from all levels of government as a percentage of gross domestic product. The United States has the fourth-lowest burden in the industrialized world, ranking 31st out of 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The United States’ percentage is actually lower today than it was in 2000, while the OECD average is about the same. <br> Nor is it true that the rich don’t pay much in America. Obviously some people manage to arrange their affairs so that they don’t pay many — or, possibly in Trump’s case, any — taxes. But the federal government derives most of its revenue from the income tax, and 70 percent of the federal income tax is paid by the top 10 percent of Americans. Most other countries rely on value-added taxes — a sales tax, often as high as 25 percent — that hit everyone equally. Summarizing the academic research for The Post, Dylan Matthews noted: “The United States has by far the most progressive income, payroll, wealth and property taxes of any developed country.” <br> The problem with American taxes is something different: their complexity. The United States has the world’s longest tax code. The scholar Sean Ehrlich tabulated its word count at 3,866,392. Germany and France have codes that are less than 10 percent as long. And size makes for burdens. In most international comparisons, the United States scores very poorly on this measure. The World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index ranks the United States 53rd for its tax system. The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report polls executives on the five biggest burdens of doing business in a country. For the United States, Nos. 1 and 2 are tax rates and tax regulations. <br> Even though America is generally more competitive than other rich countries, its taxation is much more complicated and inefficient. Why this anomaly? The answer is that it is intentional — a feature, not a bug, in the system. The complexity of the tax code exists by design, because it allows for the distinctive feature of the American political system: fundraising. <br> America is unique among democracies in requiring, at all levels of politics, that vast amounts of cash be raised from the private sector. In order to get this money, senators and members of Congress need something to offer in return, and what they sell are amendments to the tax code. When you pay $5,000 to have a stale breakfast with a congressman, you are not paying for his insights or personality. You and others like you are buying a line of the code, which is why it is thousands of pages long. This is the world’s ultimate “pay for play” setup. <br> All these small additions and exemptions to the tax code are terrible economics. They divert business activity into areas that might not make economic sense but provide tax benefits. They are expensive and reward people and businesses for activities that they might have done anyway. And most damaging of all, they are hidden and often eternal, not requiring reauthorization. If Congress wants to fund something, it could do so openly by giving a grant. By providing a complicated tax credit, it ensures that no one realizes that it is giving cash to a company or industry. <br> There are only two ways to fix this problem. One would be to stop people from paying politicians. But the Supreme Court ruled in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976 that money is speech and thus constitutionally protected. (As far as I know, this is a view shared by no other Western democracy.) That leaves another path — take away what Congress sells. If the tax code were to be made short and simple, with a handful of deductions, politicians would have little to offer people as a quid pro quo. You could still pay them, for their ideas and personality, but I suspect that the flow of money would slow to a trickle. It is the simple, single solution to the cancer in American politics. And we could thank Donald Trump for highlighting it. <br> Read more from Fareed Zakaria’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Ruth Marcus: Trump’s leaked returns show his tax fixes would most help — guess who <br> The Post’s View: To prevent corporate ‘inversions,’ the American tax code needs to be fixed <br> Garrison Keillor: The question no one is asking about Donald Trump <br> Robert J.

 Rosy Scenario is alive and well. There is a long and dubious tradition among politicians of projecting high — usually unrealistic — rates of economic growth as a way of avoiding unpopular political choices. We can do everything, because rapid growth and torrents of tax revenue will pay the bills. That’s Rosy’s message, and Donald Trump has eagerly embraced it. <br> What Trump proposes is a huge vote-buying machine — a massive tax cut, financed mostly with borrowed money — masquerading as an economic policy. Almost everyone would get something, although the rich would get the most (because they pay most of the taxes). This is Trump’s other tax problem, alongside the weekend revelation that he may have paid no federal income taxes for years. <br> Here are the basics. The standard deduction for married couples would rise from today’s $12,600 to $30,000; any couple with taxable income below that level wouldn’t pay a cent (generally, the amounts for singles are half those for couples). On the first $75,000 of taxable income — again for couples — the rate is 12 percent. The other two rates are 25 percent (on taxable income up to $225,000) and 33 percent (on income above $225,000). The top rate today is 43.4 percent. <br> Businesses would also get big breaks. The top rate on corporate income would drop to 15 percent from today’s 35 percent. <br> The price tag for this extravaganza? The nonpartisan Tax Foundation puts it between $4.4 trillion and $5.9 trillion over a decade (2016 to 2025), depending on how the plan is implemented. It’s a lot. <br> Not to worry, say Trump advisers. Last week, Peter Navarro, an economist at the University of California at Irvine, and Wilbur Ross, a well-known investor, released a 31-page study full of fancy calculations purporting to show how Trump’s plan would ignite rapid growth while barely adding to the $14 trillion federal debt held by the public. <br> First, they say, you have to adjust for the “dynamic” effects of lower tax rates on both labor income (wages, salaries) and capital income (profits, interest payments). Low tax rates raise economic returns. People work more; companies invest more. This speeds up economic growth, though how much is debated by economists. The Tax Foundation says these adjustments could reduce the 10-year cost of Trump’s tax plan to between $2.6 trillion and $3.9 trillion. Still a lot. <br> Next, say Navarro and Ross, you have to count the higher taxes from Trump’s trade, regulatory and energy policies. These are huge. Through tougher trade policies, Trump would quickly eliminate the chronic U.S. trade deficit, $500 billion in 2015. American jobs and profits increase. So does tax revenue, to the tune of $1.7 trillion over a decade. <br> The same logic applies, say Navarro and Ross, to government regulation and energy policy. Overregulation stifles hiring and investment, they say. They figure that Trump cuts regulatory costs by 10 percent, resulting (again) in higher employment and profits. The tax windfall over a decade is nearly $500 billion. Streamlining energy regulations would, by the same logic, increase taxes by almost $150 billion over a decade. <br> Do the arithmetic. According to Navarro and Ross, the higher tax revenue from Trump’s policies totals about $2.4 trillion — roughly equal to the lower estimate of lost revenue in the “dynamic” simulation. <br> Convinced? You shouldn’t be. You will notice that all these changes are simply assumed ; they’re made-up and self-serving. They assume that Trump’s tough trade tactics immediately scare other countries into submission, rather than (as many trade experts expect) triggering retaliation that would reduce many countries’ income and taxes. Similarly, the regulatory changes are assumed to occur smoothly, dispensing with political and legal challenges or the sheer complexity of many rules. <br> Even the tax gains from adopting “dynamic” economic assumptions are uncertain, as the Tax Foundation itself acknowledges. “It is very tricky to isolate the effects of tax policy” on the economy, it says. The effects could be swamped by other factors: the state of the business cycle, other government policies, broad social and economic trends. <br> What’s also forgotten is that both Trump’s and Hillary Clinton’s programs accept the deficits of existing policies. That’s about $8 trillion over a decade. Clinton’s proposals would also add to these, but much less than Trump’s. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Clinton’s policies would increase the debt by about $200 billion above existing deficits for the decade. <br> None of this means that U.S. trade, regulatory and energy policies aren’t essential subjects for debate. Constructive changes might improve the budget and economic outlooks. But the notion that Trump can wave a magic wand over these matters and — presto! — produce vast revenue to finance politically popular tax cuts is either wishful thinking or deliberate deception. It’s make-believe: a ploy to procrastinate on hard political choices.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Republicans are a feisty bunch this year, to put it mildly. Among the presidential contenders there are plans for flat tax reform, for pro-growth tax reform, and for pro-growth and pro-family tax reform. Donald Trump won’t touch entitlements; in the grownup world New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has set out a responsible plan for reforming them. Some candidates want to “police” the Iran deal and others recognize (if you weren’t convinced before, check the last 48 hours) the deal has a noxious effect now and must go. Aside from repeal of Obamacare and opposition to abortion, there is hardly any issue on which there is consensus (and even on abortion there are differences as to the exceptions to be allowed). <br> In other words, there is true diversity, the diversity of ideas. There is also racial, gender, age and professional diversity. The debates have been remarkably substantive, more so than any primary debate I can recall. The candidates have challenged one another and the moderators have tried to pit one candidate against another, properly so. This is a debate, after all, not an infomercial for one candidate or even the party. Conflict means excitement; excitement means viewers. (And yes the Trump circus has added to the attention.) <br> The Democratic debate tonight will be, well, different. The only two viable candidates, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), are white, professional politicians over the age of 65. Yes, one calls himself a “democratic socialist,” but the policy differences between the two are mild in comparison to the Republicans’ ideological gaps. Soak the rich? Check for both Dems. Regulate industry severely to affect global warming? Check for both again. Pro-gay marriage, anti-Trans-Pacific Partnership, pro-Iran deal — it’s pretty much the same. That is, moreover, intentional. <br> Whatever differences there were have narrowed because Clinton is racing to the left, trying to catch the left-wing surge in her party. Whatever differences did or still do exist are matters of degree. Clinton wants to spend less than $18 trillion, for example. She wants to punish Wall Street less than he does. <br> There is another contrast between the two parties: The Democratic candidates may be loath to confront the front-runner’s greatest liability. Think about that. If one of the GOP leaders were under investigation by the FBI, had a track record of avoiding transparency and misleading voters about it, and a raft of conflicts of interest, don’t you think he or she would get slammed round after round? <br> The Democrats, however, likely will walk on egg shells. Clinton will claim all her troubles are part of a “right-wing conspiracy” and her opponents will likely say it’s up to the voters to decide. She’s an expert filibusterer in interviews. The debate will likely be more of the same. <br> So to be clear: CNN is offering a debate with two candidates and some extra lecterns. The two differ on little and are old. The most contentious issues will be minimized and the objective for Clinton will be to say nothing memorable. If one is not required by work or school assignment to watch the two-hour event, I can’t imagine many Americans will put themselves through the ordeal, and certainly not the whole thing. <br> If you tried, you couldn’t make the debate less enticing. Come to think of it, that is precisely what the DNC and Clinton had in mind. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 GLENOLDEN, Pa. <br> From Erie in the west to Scranton in the east, Pennsylvania is flecked with casualties the stubborn economic sluggishness and relentless globalization have inflicted on industrial communities. But in this middle-class Philadelphia suburb, Tom Danzi knows that the economy is denting even his business repairing damaged cars. <br> His Suburban Collision Specialists once had 27 employees kept busy by drivers stimulating the economy by producing fender benders. Now he has only 17. Many cash-strapped motorists keep driving cars with unrepaired scars. So, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican seeking a second term, recently came here to commiserate and to warn that if his Democratic opponent wins she will make matters worse. <br> Which she probably will if she gets to the Senate. There Katie McGinty, a creature of the public sector who began her government-centric life giving then-Sen. Al Gore environmental policy tips, probably would be a reliable member of an unleashed, and perhaps unhinged, Democratic majority: As Toomey’s seat goes, so, probably, goes the Senate. <br> If he loses, Republicans probably will lose control of the Senate, and that body probably will lose its character: Senate Democrats, who are situational ethicists regarding Senate rules, might further dilute the ability of the minority to require a 60-vote majority for, among many other things, confirmation of Supreme Court justices. <br> Toomey recited for a smattering of supporters here McGinty’s policy enthusiasms, which encompass Democratic orthodoxy and have a cumulative price tag, he says, of $980 billion. While Toomey talked, on the sidewalk in front of Danzi’s shop a small gaggle of McGinty supporters held signs to explain their prop, which needed an explanation: It was a large — the size of an ironing board — replica of the “friendship” bracelets children make at summer camps. This was the gaggle’s labored way of saying that Toomey is Donald Trump’s friend. Not exactly. Toomey supported Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) for the Republican nomination, then Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), and has not yet said he will vote for Trump. But the fiction could be fatal where this election probably will be decided — here among moderate voters in the “collar” counties surrounding Philadelphia. Trump probably will carry some Pennsylvania counties with at least 75 percent, so Toomey must sail between the Scylla of endorsing Trump and thereby offending all non-Trumpkins, and the Charybdis of not endorsing and fueling the Trumpkins’ constant rage. <br> In June, Toomey had a high-single-digit lead. Today, he is tied. He says that by Nov. 8 more money will have been spent against him than against any other senator. And for him, some Republican good news is problematic: In Ohio, the weakness of Ted Strickland, the Democratic challenger to Sen. Rob Portman, might cause Democrats to redirect money to McGinty. And some bad Republican news elsewhere is bad for Toomey: Because two Republican incumbent senators — Missouri’s Roy Blunt and North Carolina’s Richard Burr — are having more difficult races than anticipated, Toomey faces intensified competition for Republican funds. <br> Toomey surfed into office on the Republican wave of 2010, which was largely a result of a recoil against the Affordable Care Act. But even in that favorable environment he won by only 51 percent to 49 percent. He could, however, wind up owing two Senate terms to the ACA, which is unraveling in Pennsylvania, too: The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that by next year, only 28 counties will have three or more health insurers selling through the ACA exchanges, down from all 67 counties this year. <br> Toomey grew up in a union household in Rhode Island, earned a Harvard University scholarship, did well on Wall Street, then joined his brothers in Allentown, Pa., to start what became a successful chain of restaurants. He successfully ran for Congress in 1998 and in 2004 did something eccentric: He kept his promise not to run for a fourth term. After losing a Senate contest that year, he became head of the free-market advocacy group Club for Growth. Today he is among the most important Republicans regarding the most important issue, tax reform, relating to the nation’s most important challenge, the restoration of robust economic growth. <br> There is no really happy ending for Republicans in 2016. If Trump wins, the party’s rupture with its past is complete and irreparable. If he loses narrowly, there will be an orgy of intramural recriminations, and the GOP’s 2016-2019 will be like Spain’s 1936-1939, an exceptionally uncivil civil war. If Trump loses emphatically, Democrats probably take the Senate. Unless Toomey wins this year’s most consequential Senate race. <br> Read more from George F.

 Once upon a time, I thought the repudiation of white supremacists was the easiest layup in U.S. politics. Not for the Trump campaign. <br> Asked recently whether he considered former KKK leader David Duke deplorable, Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence said he was “not in the name-calling business.” Earlier this year, Donald Trump was posed a similar question and claimed, incredibly and repeatedly, “I don’t know anything about David Duke.” In a particularly revealing campaign moment, Trump was asked to repudiate the anti-Semitic death threats made by some of his followers against a reporter. “I don’t have a message to the fans,” Trump said. <br> The fans, no doubt, regard this as the gotcha game of a politically correct press. Even if this is true, an initial reluctance to condemn some of the very worst people in U.S. politics conveys a message. Several years ago, researchers developed an Implicit Association Test — a sort of computerized “blink test” measuring how subjects associate positive and negative words with people of different races. The immediate reaction of a politician to the KKK is a kind of political blink test. The right response is revulsion. And there has generally been a Grand Wizard exception to the prohibition on name-calling. <br> For a politician on the right, this is an entirely costless Sister Souljah moment. The repeated refusal to seize it conveys an impression of calculation. It indicates a strategy of no enemies to the right. <br> For some of us, this raises the hardest moral and emotional issue of the current campaign. The Republican nominee came to prominence feeding fears of Mexicans, migrants and Muslims. He refuses to engage in the normal moral and political hygiene of repudiating extremism. I don’t believe that anything close to half of Trump supporters are motivated by racism. But they are willing to tolerate a level of prejudice that should be morally unacceptable in a presidential candidate. <br> Why is this such a problem? Because racial prejudice is not one problem among many in American history. It is the sin that nearly destroyed us. It is a special category of wrong. It is not sufficient to say: I agree with Trump on 90 percent of the issues — on tax reform and energy policy and criminal-justice issues — but dissent on the 10 percent involving systematic religious discrimination, forced expulsion, war crimes, the demonization of refugees and the general dehumanization of the other. These matters are foundational. <br> History has little sympathy for those who supported Stephen Douglas for his views on tariff policy or internal improvements while playing down his belief that the rights of minorities should be determined by the majority. As Abraham Lincoln saw it, America fought at Gettysburg and Antietam over the most basic questions — how to define the protections and promise of a great republic, as well as the duties we owe to each other as human beings. This remains the central issue of politics — the source of its nobility when it serves human dignity, and a source of dishonor when it reflects baser motives. It is not possible to build the greatness of this nation — this shining example in the conscience of humanity — while forgetting or undermining its deepest ideals. <br> A refusal to aggressively confront a racially tinged extremism has been taken as a source of validation by white nationalists. They feel emboldened. Duke reports being “overjoyed” that Trump has embraced “most of the issues that I’ve championed for years.” No presidential candidate is responsible for the views of all their supporters. But at least since the 1960s, conservative leaders have felt a responsibility to actively oppose and discredit those elements of the right that identify Americanism with ethnic purity and spin conspiracy theories of Semitic control. Opposing these long-standing tendencies of right-wing nationalism is part of what conservative intellectual and political leadership has meant for decades. The current vacuum of such leadership at the top of the Republican ticket is taken as a cultural signal by both the perpetrators and objects of prejudice. <br> Or so I would argue. Other Republicans I know and like find my viewpoint morally problematic, because it helps enable the election of Hillary Clinton and the nomination of liberals to the Supreme Court, which would result in irreparable harm to the country. It is a dispute causing a crisis of self-definition among conservatives, straining and rupturing friendships across the movement. That is another legacy of Trump, who will be known for the wounds he leaves behind. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Dana Milbank: Yes, half of Trump supporters are racist <br> Dana Milbank: Trump’s many racist supporters <br> Colbert I.

 EIGHTY-FOUR percent of voters say the economy is “very important” in choosing a president this year, according to the Pew Research Center, as jobs and income continue to trouble the public mind eight years after the Great Recession. This is not the same as saying that nothing has changed, either in actual conditions or in voter perceptions, during the Obama presidency, much less that we are living in a disastrous “false economy,” as Donald Trump recently claimed. To the contrary, the past seven-plus years have seen progress in both respects — more than the campaign-year public conversation usually acknowledges. <br> Unemployment is at 4.9 percent, down from its October 2009 peak of 10 percent. Wage growth has resumed, with the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank reporting a median annual pay increase for full-time workers at or above 3 percent since November 2015. Home foreclosures have eased dramatically, with 97 percent of major metropolitan areas logging rates below their Great Recession peaks in the first quarter of 2016, according to Realtytrac.com. By the end of 2015, net private business investment had recovered to pre-recession levels, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. <br> Undeniable, too, is the improvement in subjective economic well-being. Consider these recent Gallup Poll findings: 55.4 percent of Americans say they are “thriving,” in contrast with 48.9 percent in 2008. Some 62 percent say their standard of living is “getting better,” versus 42 percent in 2008; 39 percent say now is “a good time to find a quality job,” a five-fold increase over 2008. And 68 percent of workers told Gallup in August that they are making more money than they did five years ago. The United States, in short, has largely recovered from the Great Recession — albeit at a far slower pace than anyone would have liked — and people can feel the difference. <br> With a horrific cyclical crisis behind it, the U.S. economy now faces knottier structural flaws. These help explain the lingering sense of unease, as reflected in such objective indicia as this year’s decline in business investment or Gallup’s August poll finding that the public is significantly more confident about current economic conditions than about the future. Threats include Europe’s continued sluggishness, lower participation in the labor force, especially by 25- to 54-year-old “prime age” men and, perhaps most worrisome of all, plunging productivity — output per hour worked — which fell at a 0.6-percent annual rate during the second quarter of 2016, according to the Labor Department. The latter is the most baleful trend of all, since productivity growth is the key to increasing real wages. <br> Much of the credit for the progress to date goes to the Federal Reserve, whose un­or­tho­dox policies have probably done as much as they can to enable growth, and which should be gradually unwound. Indeed, the Fed appears a bit perplexed about what to do next, as evidenced by the uncertainty surrounding a possible interest rate hike at its next meeting this month. Elected officials — the next president and Congress — must finally shoulder their share of the policy burden by tackling structural problems such as education, training, infrastructure, federal debt, tax reform and regulation that lie beyond the Fed’s ambit. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Jared Bernstein: Sorry, Donald.

 Jim Millstein was chief restructuring officer at the Treasury Department from 2009 to 2011. He is chairman and chief executive of Millstein Co., a financial advisory and investment firm. <br> Our major political parties don’t agree on much these days, but the 2016 Republican and Democratic platforms both include prominent planks calling for the federal government to address the sorry state of America’s infrastructure. The question is: Can the parties resolve their differences on fiscal policy to find the necessary federal funding to address this urgent need? <br> They can — if the next administration and Congress keep in mind two basic principles. <br> First, infrastructure spending generates a range of productivity gains that augment long-term economic activity and thereby increase tax revenue. <br> Second, in an economy where, since the start of this century, productivity and income growth have been well below the trend of the previous “American century,” a well-designed program of new infrastructure spending can be just the catalyst the U.S. economy needs to get out of its rut. <br> After World War II, America’s periods of greatest economic growth coincided with a much higher level of public investment in infrastructure and research and development than has been made over the past 16 years. The persistent shorting of funds for infrastructure modernization and repair has left us with a huge hole to fill: The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the federal government needs to spend an additional $140 billion a year for the next 10 years to fill the gap. <br> The problem is that any program involving such a dramatic increase in spending will inevitably get bogged down in legitimate concerns about the trajectory of budget deficits and the already dramatic, relatively recent increase in the size of the federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product. Given the parlous state of America’s infrastructure, a solution cannot await some “grand bargain” that brings all aspects of the federal budget into long-term balance. Debt financing is not only needed but appropriate. <br> At the historically low interest rates at which the federal government can now borrow, there is no better time to incur long-term debt for the construction of long-term assets. And because of the positive effects on productivity and economic growth that public infrastructure creates, we need not worry about the implications of this spending for debt sustainability in the long run. A well-designed program of infrastructure modernization can pay for itself in economic activity and the tax revenue that results from that activity. <br> We must, however, take three steps to ensure that outcome. <br> First, infrastructure spending needs to be divorced from annual discretionary appropriations, categorically escaping the “pay for” rules that have frozen federal budget priorities and tax policy for six years. It must become a “mandatory” part of the federal budget, placed into a planning cycle and funded on a time horizon stretching beyond the next election. <br> Second, federal infrastructure spending needs to be centrally coordinated and optimized over a period of years, not balkanized across agencies that manage annual budgets. This could be achieved through the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis
 I shouldn’t tell you this. Publicity will only make the problem worse. But you deserve to know: Tax cheating is about to rise in the United States. <br> Today, Americans are among the most law-abiding taxpayers in the world, by which I mean they lie to the taxman much less than people in other countries do. Today, about 82 cents of every dollar owed in U.S. taxes gets paid voluntarily, which is high. <br> Here are six reasons that number is going to fall: <br> 1. Congress has gutted Internal Revenue Service enforcement. <br> The most important determinant for tax cheating is: Can I get away with it? <br> The answer, increasingly, is yes. <br> Thanks to budget cuts, audit rates have plummeted, especially for the biggest corporations, with armies of sophisticated tax preparers. Criminal tax prosecutions have nose-dived, too. <br> In some districts, the IRS has openly acknowledged that scofflaws owing under $1 million will get a free pass because the agency no longer has the resources to go after them. <br> That acknowledgment is bad, as is the fact that I’m drawing attention to it. Tax cheating is more dependent on perceived probability than actual probability of getting caught. <br> 2. Budget cuts have also hurt IRS customer service. <br> Wait times on the IRS’s toll-free phone lines are finally down, but the agency still will answer only “basic” questions (i.e., the ones you can Google yourself), not the complicated ones taxpayers actually need help with. Don’t be surprised if some who are trying to pay their taxes honestly get frustrated and simply give up — and do whatever seems cheapest. <br> 3. The growing perception that everyone else is doing it. <br> Both left and right are mad that certain populations don’t pay their “fair share.” Conservatives, stoked partly by Mitt Romney’s infamous “47 percent” comments, believe the poor pay too little. Liberals, stoked partly by the low tax rates paid by the likes of Romney, believe the rich pay too little. And a growing share of Americans overall think their own tax bill is “too high” and “unfair.” <br> In other countries, this (often well-founded) belief that everyone else is shirking has led to cascading tax evasion.  <br> “My sense in Greece and other areas that have low compliance rates is that people look around and say, ‘Why should I be a sucker and be the only one who actually pays?’ ” IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told me in a phone interview. (Which is another reason a column predicting more tax cheating could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.) <br>  4. Declining trust in government. <br>  A troubling working paper, by economists Julie Berry Cullen, Nicholas Turner and Ebonya Washington, suggests that tax evasion rises when taxpayers are not in “political alignment” with the government. That is, Democrats cheat more if a Republican holds the White House, and vice versa. Earlier research has also shown that general distrust in the government reduces compliance. <br> Now consider the long-term downward spiral in trust in the U.S. government and the democratic process; the fact that politicians on both sides of the aisle preach that the political system is rigged; and Americans’ increasing perception that their partisan opponents are not only wrong but also immoral and malevolent. <br> All these trends will make shortchanging the government even more attractive. <br> 5. The tax code gets more complicated every year. <br> This results in more opportunities for innocent error; increased perception that rich people with fancy tax preparers get away with murder; and, again, more people simply giving up on calculating their tax bills accurately. <br> 6. The rise of the “gig economy.”   <br> People rarely cheat on their taxes if they know there will be substantial third-party reporting and withholding, as is the case with traditional, W-2 employees. Ninety-nine percent of these taxes get paid voluntarily. But for income subject to little or no information reporting — such as income from odd jobs — only about 37 cents of every dollar owed gets paid. <br> In addition, lots of self-employed “gig economy” workers, such as Uber drivers, probably don’t realize they’re supposed to be making quarterly estimated tax payments and paying both parts of their payroll taxes. That means they may get hit with an unpleasant surprise come April 15 — increasing their incentives to fudge the numbers. <br> Now, there are at least two counterarguments to my dire prediction: Fewer business transactions are done in cash today, so they’re harder to hide; and, relatedly, in the era of “Big Data,” there’s more third-party information for the IRS to check to figure out if people are cheating. <br> There’s also plenty politicians could do to prove me wrong — by, for example, simplifying the tax code, or adequately funding IRS enforcement, or stopping actively delegitimizing the government. <br> I’d be thrilled if they did, but I wouldn’t bet my tax refund on it. <br> Read more: <br> Robert J.

 WHEN PRESIDENT Obama takes the lectern for his final State of the Union address Tuesday night, he may return to the sort of high-minded rhetoric that propelled him into office seven years ago, countering the sour themes dominating both parties’ presidential primary contests with a message of American possibility. <br> That would be appropriate. We also would not blame Mr. Obama for taking a victory lap or two. Defying the doom-ridden predictions of Republicans, including Mitt Romney in 2012, Mr. Obama has presided over an economy that has grown and added jobs, despite recent jitters from China, and he has entrenched important policy accomplishments, despite constant harrying opposition from Congress. <br> But the State of the Union address should be not only about past accomplishments and future potential, but also about the next 12 months. Americans have a right to expect that both the president and the Congress will do their jobs. With federal budget limits agreed upon for the rest of Mr. Obama’s term, there is some openness in Congress for policy that could gain significant bipartisan support and has been far too long in coming. <br> Top on the list should be approving the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a goal that congressional leaders and the White House share, and one that would be wise to complete as soon as possible. Should the presidential race continue turning toward the populist, completing the deal would only get harder. The prospects for corporate tax reform are dimmer, but congressional leaders from both parties favor simplifying the country’s tax structure, and there is still some chance for progress this year. <br> Mr. Obama and Congress also might agree on criminal justice reform, ending some of the excesses of the tough-on-crime movement of the 1990s. Mr. Obama should press lawmakers to repair the Voting Rights Act, restoring the legal protections minority voters had before the Supreme Court struck a piece of the law. The president should push for improvements in federal mental health-care policy, which members of both parties say they support, and for Congress to revise email spying laws that do not protect information stored in the cloud. <br> Some goals are important enough that they deserve the president’s attention even if their prospects in Congress are dim: voting rights for the District of Columbia, for example, and action on climate change. <br> Finally, Mr. Obama’s domestic achievements have not been matched by his performance on the global stage. Places such as Libya and Syria have suffered from the lack of American leadership during his second term; democracy is in retreat in much of the world. The president must explain how he will not just contain the Islamic State and other threats but how he will defeat them. In the process, he should encourage Congress to pass a new authorization for the use of military force, finding a compromise with Republicans worried about tying future presidents’ hands with restrictions on the future scope of military action. <br> The president’s message should be optimistic Tuesday night — about the year ahead, as well as the years beyond that. <br> Read more here: <br> David Ignatius: Obama is a rationalist president in the age of anxiety <br> Paul Waldman: Guess what: Barack Obama has been a great president for job creation <br> Chris Cillizza: President Obama’s year-end message: I played the long game — and I won <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 THAT OLD saw about death and taxes does not apply to not-for-profit institutions such as colleges and universities, which may not be immortal but are exempt from (most) taxes, state, local and federal. The rationale for this long-standing policy is a wise one: namely, that these institutions seek to serve broad public needs, not provide a return on shareholder investment. <br> Yet, in modern times, that argument runs into the blunt fact that some institutions of higher education have morphed into economically impactful entities employing thousands of people, occupying hundreds of acres and investing endowments that sometimes surpass $1 billion — as do the endowments of two schools in the District, George Washington University and Georgetown University. <br> And so the question arises: Shouldn’t these behemoths have to help the surrounding jurisdiction pay its bills, too? In the District, large patches of which are covered not only by universities, churches and private K-12 schools but also by tax-exempt federal buildings, land accounting for 45 percent of the total value of real estate is exempt from property tax, according to the D.C. government. If higher education’s $10 billion worth of real estate were subject to property tax, the city would reap $111 million per year, enabling that much tax relief for individuals and private-sector firms, according to an article this month by The Post’s Danielle Douglas-Gabriel. <br> Not surprisingly, the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area has always opposed proposals to subject member institutions to local property taxes — and its opposition has always been successful. The consortium argues, correctly, that the schools are major sources of economic activity for the city, and that they provide security, shuttle buses and housing for their students — thus saving the District the cost of providing such services itself. Higher education also opposes payment in lieu of taxation (PILOT) programs, a voluntary alternative by which Boston, among other jurisdictions, has negotiated regular annual payments from the many schools within its borders. Boston is not comparable, the consortium argues, because it is more reliant on property taxes than the District, which can charge income and excise taxes, and because Boston spends a greater percentage of its budget on classically local functions such as police and fire protection. <br> Actually, the comparison with Boston cuts the other way: The District levies taxes beyond the property tax because its unique political status requires it to assume spending obligations — Medicaid, for example — that other cities can leave to their respective states. As for the stimulus universities provide for the local economy, and the services they provide students, both are fair points — but it’s equally true that the universities’ ability to attract students in the first place depends in some measure on the city’s infrastructure and amenities, paid for by local households and businesses. <br> A meaningful contribution by the District’s best-endowed private universities, through a PILOT program, could improve overall fiscal equity in the city. Town-gown relations might benefit, too. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> The Post’s View: D.C. tax reform proposal merits a close look <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Hillary Clinton will accept her party’s presidential nomination on Thursday night, entering and departing the stage as the prohibitive favorite to win the presidency. Forget the polls showing the race neck and neck, the breathless commentators saying that Donald Trump is “moving” on security issues. Americans are not lining up to elect the egregious Trump, the most unpopular candidate in the modern history of presidential politics, to the presidency. <br> But just because the race is Clinton’s to lose doesn’t mean it can’t be lost. Campaigns may not matter much, but in a deeply divided nation, they matter enough. And, at a time when two-thirds of Americans still think the country is on the wrong track, there is one critical question in this campaign: Who is the credible candidate of change? The challenge for Clinton on Thursday night is to make herself that candidate. <br> This isn’t exactly conventional wisdom. After Trump’s Republican convention and his rambling, apocalyptic one hour and 15-minute acceptance diatribe, Democrats hoped to “grab the center.” The selection of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine as vice-presidential nominee followed. The Democratic convention and easy slogans — inclusive, socially liberal, “stronger together,” “building bridges, not walls,” advertising competence and experience — contrast naturally with the Republican gathering. <br> Beneath this is a self-satisfied confidence about demographics. The “Obama coalition” — young, women, people of color, liberal professionals — has produced majorities for two elections in a row and continues to gain in numbers. And Trump has certainly intensified the Republican isolation as a party of disgruntled aging white voters. <br> So the Clinton campaign has scheduled the convention to celebrate progress and advertise competence. The progressive wing of the party — Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — got their time on Monday, softened by Michelle Obama’s appearance. Then comes Bill Clinton on Tuesday, when the big “dawg” will surely take a bite out of Trump but will also want to contrast his record with what came after. Then Wednesday night, President Obama will hand over the baton, after celebrating the progress made over the past eight years. And finally, Hillary Clinton will appear, teed up to promise continued reform and showcase confidence and steadiness. <br> As a candidate of continuity, however, Clinton makes herself more vulnerable, not less. She is at risk of merely intensifying her personification of an establishment that has failed at home and abroad, unaccountable and untrusted, burdened by scandals and corruptions. <br> Instead, Clinton would be well-advised to use her acceptance speech to go bold: using her experience and competence — which voters readily salute — as the basis for laying out a big agenda for change. <br> The elements of that agenda are contained, to some extent, in the Democratic platform. She should focus on getting the economy right, taking on the rules that have rigged the economy to benefit the few and challenging the money politics and special interests that stand in the way. <br> Clinton could creatively elevate core elements. To help build enthusiasm among Sanders’s millennial voters, she should tie her jobs agenda to the imperative of addressing climate change. The transformations and innovations required to move to sustainable energy will generate jobs directly and will capture the markets that are spreading across the globe. <br> Ensuring that the rewards of growth are widely shared appeals to Americans generally, and women in particular. Lift the floor under workers — raise the minimum wage, pass paid family leave and sick days and paid vacations, guarantee equal pay for equal work, end arbitrary schedules. Empower workers to organize while curbing the ability of chief executives to literally plunder their own companies to pad their own incomes. <br> Sanders’s independent voters and workers across the industrial heartland need to hear her commitment to a new global strategy. Her belated opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership is unconvincing unless she integrates it into a broader strategy aimed explicitly at moving to balanced trade and ending our obscene trade deficits. <br> Championing curbs on the excesses of Wall Street, breaking up banks that are too big to fail and holding bankers accountable personally for the crimes that they commit — along with an aggressive agenda on money in politics — are essential to answering deep and widespread doubts about her being in the pocket of the big banks. <br> She needs to be clear that she would reject the austerity others have pushed in recent years, laying out a bold, shared security agenda — tuition-free public college, expanded Social Security, opening Medicare to 55-year-olds, forcing the drug companies to negotiate bulk discounts for prescription drugs. Tie that investment in real security with progressive tax reforms — closing the loopholes and outrages built into the tax code, raising rates on the rich, forcing the corporations to pay what they owe — that can pay the freight. <br> And all of these ideas face a much steeper road to reality unless we are ready to take back our government from the big money and entrenched interests. Clinton can talk, like Trump, about how she knows how this system works — and how to fix it. It isn’t done by bluster, but by changing our laws and changing our courts. Then lay out the bold elements that are in her platform already. <br> On security, Clinton’s task is harder. Trump presents himself as both tougher on terror and as a dissenter from core elements of the failed bipartisan foreign policy consensus: corporate trade deals, NATO’s imbalance and adventurism on the Russian border, regime change and more. Clinton, tied to each of these, will be tempted to defend each, while dismissing Trump as irresponsible. Surrounded by neo-conservatives and liberal interventionists, her instincts have always been to present herself as more interventionist than Obama. It is difficult to imagine her changing that posture now. What she can do, however, is demonstrate that she has learned from her experience: that America cannot afford to police the world and should not attempt to do so. That we do not want a new cold war with Russia and with China, and that finding areas of cooperation and settling areas of tension are vital going forward. <br> It is hard to envision Trump winning an election. But voters across the country are disgusted with an establishment that Clinton personifies. Good policy can’t save her. But a bold agenda for change — naming names of corporate abusers, committing to real changes in contrast to Trump’s bluster — can help build enthusiasm and turnout. If Democrats are just offering more of the same, Trump’s chances rise dramatically. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: Clinton may take the nomination, but Sanders has won the debate <br> E.J.

 TO GRASP the utter fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican presidential campaign so far, consider these statistical realities, from the Congressional Budget Office. <br> Under current law (a relatively optimistic policy assumption), the U.S. government is on course for high and rising annual budget deficits after 2018, leading to national debt equal to 103 percent of economic output by 2040. In that year, four of every five federal dollars spent would go to entitlements and interest, with one left over for every other need, including defense. Avoiding this scenario, merely to the extent of keeping the debt at today’s already historically high level (74 percent of output), would require a downward adjustment in the projected debt accumulation of 1.1 percent of economic output each year for the next quarter-century. That’s the equivalent of 5.5 percent less spending in each of those years, or 6 percent more taxes. <br> In the face of these realities, the major GOP candidates are proposing nothing like such a huge cut in spending — while they are proposing tax plans that would slash revenue . <br> Not surprisingly, businessman Donald Trump’s plan is the most implausible, costing the treasury $10.1 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation. Sen. Marco Rubio’s (Fla.) would cost $2.4 trillion; former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s plan, $1.6 trillion; and Sen. Ted Cruz’s (Tex.), $768 billion. (And yes, the Tax Foundation did account for the higher growth these cuts would supposedly encourage, meaning that the estimates are probably on the low side.) Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is calling for a flat tax, as is former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, but their plans have been too sketchy to “score” so far. And don’t get us started about the fact that upper-income people would benefit most from each of these plans. <br> To be sure, the blue-sky quality of the Republican discussion has its benefits. Radical but sensible ideas have arisen amid the radical but nonsensical ones. Mr. Rubio’s refundable child tax credit might help struggling families offset their payroll tax burden; Mr. Cruz (like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky) advocates a form of value-added tax, which could raise revenue more efficiently with fewer economic distortions than the current system. Mr. Carson bravely called for ending the mortgage interest deduction. While it’s absurd to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, as Mr. Cruz promises, or to speak of reducing the tax code to three pages, a la Ms. Fiorina, they are not wrong to target the current law’s costly complexity. <br> If Republicans were focusing on radical tax reform, as opposed to radical tax reduction, we’d be more open to their ideas. So might the public. GOP candidates are fixated on the ideological preferences of their primary electorate, but the broader electorate is not nearly as anti-tax as it once was. In a tax-season poll this year, 56 percent of Americans told Gallup their federal income taxes were “fair.” The poll showed the public evenly split between those who think taxes are too high and those who don’t; 15 years ago, 63 percent said “too high.” <br> Perhaps the people understand what GOP politicians do not: No sustainable fiscal path could include such massive tax cuts, but the road to ruin just might. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Jeb Bush’s tax plan doesn’t quite add up <br> Catherine Rampell: Donald Trump, the Santa Claus of tax reform <br> The Post’s View: Donald Trump’s tax plan is all talk <br> The Post’s View: Ted Cruz’s tax plan doesn’t add up <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Don’t laugh, but Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have a really compelling tax proposal. <br> So why won’t they own up to it? <br> For context, these two Republican presidential candidates have backed some completely bonkers economic ideas during the campaign. Both want to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service, even though doing so would leave no one to collect tax revenue. And both want to return to the gold standard, which means our money supply would be determined not by the coolheaded economic experts at the Federal Reserve but rather by, say, China. (China is the world’s No. 1 producer of gold; Russia is No. 3.) <br> Still, buried among such monetary meshugas is an interesting, serious and provocative idea: a value-added tax. <br> A value-added tax, or VAT, is a tax on consumption. It’s sort of like a sales tax. But rather than being collected only when a product is sold to a consumer, the tax is paid at each stage of the production process based on how much “value” a business has added to that product — for example, by spinning cotton into cloth, or sewing that cloth into a T-shirt. <br> Even though the tax is collected at various stages of production, economists believe it is generally borne more by consumers than businesses. Companies pass on the cost of the tax in higher prices down the production chain, keeping their profit margins roughly unchanged. <br> More than 160 countries, including every developed country except the United States, has some form of VAT. The VAT is also one of the first proposals out of the International Monetary Fund’s bag of tricks for countries that need to raise money. <br> That’s because it’s a really, really useful tool. <br> Unlike an income tax, it doesn’t discourage saving or working; it’s efficient and broad-based; and, at least most of the time, it’s harder to evade than income taxes because it can be designed with a clever self-enforcement mechanism. <br> In most countries that have value-added taxes, businesses get a credit for the taxes that previous companies in the supply chain have already paid. This means companies pressure their suppliers to pay the tax, too — effectively allowing the government to outsource some of the expensive enforcement of tax collection. <br> The main downside of a VAT is that it hurts the poor more than the rich, because the poor spend a larger share of their incomes on basic necessities. <br> There’s an easy way to counteract that problem, though: Just make the income tax system more progressive. What matters is the progressivity of the entire system, rather than any one component. Unfortunately, both Paul and Cruz want to make the personal income tax less progressive, too. <br> The United States has flirted with a federal VAT for centuries. In recent years, policymakers of all political persuasions, including Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi, Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, have expressed interest in creating one. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) even introduced legislation that would create a “progressive” VAT. <br> Strangely, though, neither of the presidential campaign’s VAT champions wants to openly call his plan a “value-added tax.” <br> Cruz euphemizes his as a “business flat tax”; Paul dubs his a “business-activity tax.” These rebrandings are probably intended to make their proposals sound more like business income taxes — which both candidates would entirely repeal — even though consumption taxes and business income taxes target different things. <br> After all, for all their pluses, VATs come with peculiar politics.

 The Obama administration is highly exercised about “inversion,” the practice by which an American corporation acquires a foreign company and moves its headquarters out of the United States to benefit from lower tax rates abroad. <br> Not fair, says Barack Obama. It’s taking advantage of an “unpatriotic tax loophole” that hardworking American families have to make up for by the sweat of their brow. His treasury secretary calls such behavior a violation of “economic patriotism.” <br> Nice touch. Democrats used to wax indignant about having one’s patriotism questioned. Now they throw around the charge with abandon, tossing it at corporations that refuse to do the economically patriotic thing of paying the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. <br> Odder still because Democrats routinely ridicule the very notion of corporations as persons. When Mitt Romney suggested that corporations were people in 2011, Democrats mocked him right through Election Day. In the Hobby Lobby case, they challenged the very idea that corporations can have religious convictions. Now, however, Democrats are demanding that corporations exercise a patriotic conscience. Which is it? <br> Moreover, corporations have an indisputable fiduciary responsibility to protect their shareholders’ interest. Surely Walgreens betrayed this responsibility when it caved to administration pressure and canceled its plans to move its headquarters to Switzerland. The inversion would’ve saved it billions of dollars. Its cancellation caused an instant 14 percent drop in Walgreens shares. <br> But the Democrats’ problem is deeper. Everyone knows why inversions are happening. America’s 35 percent corporate tax rate is absurdly uncompetitive. Companies are doing what they always do: try to legally lower their tax liabilities. <br> What is maddening is that the problem is so easily solved: tax reform that lowers the accursed corporate rate. Democrats and Republicans agree on this. After the announcement of the latest inversion, Burger King buying Tim Hortons and then moving to Canada, the president himself issued a statement conceding that corporate tax reform — lower the rates, eliminate loopholes — is the best solution to the inversion problem. <br> It’s also politically doable. Tax reform has unique bipartisan appeal. Conservatives like it because lowering rates stimulates the economy and eliminating loopholes curbs tax-driven economic decisions that grossly misallocate capital. <br> The appeal to liberals is economic fairness. By eliminating loopholes, tax reform levels the playing field. Today, the more powerful companies can afford the expensive lobbyists who create the loopholes and the expensive lawyers who exploit them. Which is why the nominal corporate tax rate is 35 percent but the effective rate for some of the largest corporations is about 13 percent. <br> So why not attack the inversion problem with its obvious solution: tax reform? Time is short, says Obama. He can’t wait. Instead, he wants legislation to outlaw inversion. <br> No time? Where has he been? He does nothing about tax reform for six years (during two of which Democrats fully controlled Congress), then claims now to be too impatient to attempt the real solution. Instead he wants to hurry through a punitive anti-inversion law to counterbalance the effects of our already punitive tax rates. <br> This is nuts. But amusing, given that a major financier of the inversion-célèbre of the day, the Whopper-to-Canada deal, is none other than Warren Buffett, Obama’s favorite plutocrat. <br> Buffett’s demand that the rich be required to pay more taxes made him a hero to the president. In 2012, Obama repeatedly held up Buffett as a champion of economic justice. What does Obama say today about his 2012 class-war comrade in arms — now become, by Obama’s own lights, an economic traitor? <br> And more such Benedict Arnolds are being minted every week. One of the reasons for the recent acceleration of inversions is that corporations want to move before Obama outlaws it, locking them into America’s anti-competitive corporate tax rate. <br> The Wall Street Journal cited a Buffett confidant as saying he likely wouldn’t have backed a deal like Burger King if it were purely for tax reasons. Indeed, there are other considerations that can always be invoked. Which makes some of the contemplated anti-inversion proposals even more absurd: They would outlaw only those mergers done for tax reasons. How do you prove motivation? Lie detectors? <br> A real political leader would abandon this sideshow and actually address corporate tax reform with a serious revenue-neutral proposal to Congress. There would be hearings, debate, compromises. We might end up with something like the historic bipartisan tax reform of 1986 that helped launch two decades of nearly uninterrupted economic growth. <br> But for that you need a president. <br> Read more from Charles Krauthammer’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this from Opinions:  <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: If Congress won’t, Obama may have to address inversion <br> Jacob J.

 You know it’s a peculiar election year when Mitt Romney and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) can agree that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is a “fraud.” But that label shouldn’t be reserved for Donald Trump alone. It’s also an apt description of the man Trump supplanted as the de facto leader of the party — Romney’s running mate in 2012, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis). <br> Indeed, years before Trump sold Republican primary voters on the myth of his own great success, Ryan sold a credulous Washington establishment on the notion that he was a serious thinker overflowing with political courage — a policy wonk uniquely willing to tackle tough issues such as entitlement reform. In the past month, however, it has become more obvious than ever that Ryan’s reputation is worth about as much as a degree from Trump University. Let’s review. <br> After a fleeting flirtation with principle, Ryan kicked off June by endorsing Trump for president. Despite his previous indication that Trump would have to change course to earn his support, Ryan’s endorsement came without any public concessions or reassurances from Trump. It also came after The Post reported in late 2013 that Ryan was embarking on a personal crusade to steer Republicans “away from the angry, nativist inclinations of the tea party” and toward a “more inclusive vision.” <br> A few weeks after bowing to Trump, Ryan did take a stand — against the historic sit-in on the House floor led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) to demand a vote on gun legislation. Ryan derided the show of solidarity with victims of gun violence as a “publicity stunt” and warned ominously that in the future, “We will not take this. We will not tolerate this.” (But Ryan has said the House will vote on a GOP-sponsored gun bill this week.) <br> Lastly, there is Ryan’s supposed bread and butter: a policy agenda rolled out over the course of the month. <br> Ryan put forward a health-care proposal that was hyped as the long-awaited Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act, but the “plan” consisted largely of well-worn talking points instead of actual legislation. In a withering editorial titled “Paul Ryan’s flimsy health plan,” The Post’s editorial board described it as “less detailed in a variety of crucial ways than previous conservative health reform proposals,” while adding, “The outlines that the speaker did provide suggest that it would be hard on the poor, old and sick.” <br> He also released a tax reform proposal that, according to the Wall Street Journal, “isn’t detailed enough for a complete nonpartisan congressional analysis to verify the effect on the budget and on households.” The limited details he did provide, however, do not paint a pretty picture. It’s not just that Ryan proposes to slash rates for the rich and corporations. He also wants to create a new loophole for “pass-through” income, which is a feature of Trump’s proposal and the disastrous plan implemented by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback (R) that has wrecked his state’s finances. <br> And perhaps most significantly, given his disavowal of his past “makers and takers” rhetoric, Ryan introduced an “anti-poverty” plan that would severely weaken the safety net for those living in poverty. The plan, according to Politico, is mostly “repackaged GOP proposals,” including cuts to unemployment assistance, Head Start and federal Pell Grants. With Ryan’s blue-collar home town of Janesville already suffering the consequences of corporate trade deals and other Ryan-backed economic policies that have eviscerated the city’s manufacturing base, TalkPoverty editor Greg Kaufmann writes that Ryan’s latest proposal demonstrates “his enduring disconnect from the people struggling in his own district and across America.” <br> None of this is new. Ryan has been selling snake oil for years — promising to “save” Medicare by privatizing it, boasting that he could balance the budget with tax cuts for the rich and without any cuts to defense spending, pretending to be a pragmatist while embracing the extreme ideological dogmas of Ayn Rand and the religious right. But his unearned standing as a serious and courageous leader in a sea of cynical hacks has persisted nonetheless. Even today, there are those who sympathize with Ryan, suggesting that he is somehow a victim of Trump and right-wing Republicans in Congress when, in fact, his leadership — and failures thereof — helped pave their path to power. <br> When he was nominated for vice president in 2012, I wrote that Ryan’s vision for the country isn’t courageous — it’s cruel. While that remains true four years later, it’s not only Ryan’s policy goals that need to be exposed for what they are. It’s also long past time for the political world to recognize that Ryan’s whole career, like Trump’s, is one big con. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Paul Ryan’s flimsy health plan <br> Richard Cohen: Paul Ryan’s profile in cowardice <br> The Post’s View: Mr. Ryan’s endorsement of Trump: A sad day for the GOP — and America <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> The Republican Party is at the proverbial fork in the road. It can make a sharp right turn over the cliff and destroy itself. Or it could lean to the right but stay on firm ground. What would each look like? <br> In the gloomy view, House Republicans, after electing Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) speaker, sabotage him at every turn. They, in concert with a sliver of the Senate Republicans, orchestrate another government shutdown, or worse, a technical default in early November. The Freedom Caucus becomes the face of the GOP in all its anger, anti-government vitriol and anti-immigrant fervor. Meanwhile, the party nominates Donald Trump or Ben Carson and hands the Democrats 400 electoral votes, or it nominates Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and gives away “only” 350. (Alternatively, the GOP nominates an ineffective nominee whom the far right savages, handing the election to the Democrats and leaving the right-wingers to scream that once again they were sold down the river by the “establishment.”) <br> Massive losses for the GOP give the White House and the Senate to the Democrats, and perhaps in the next few cycles the House. A chunk of the GOP, more progressive on social issues and deeply troubled by the anti-immigrant bent of the GOP, after enlisting as “Republicans for Hillary,” permanently change their affiliation. The party of Lincoln is effectively gone. <br> Now, now. That is just one scenario. In the other, 2015-2016 becomes a new chapter in the GOP, led by new leaders. With a more contemporary, diverse and cheerier face, the party chooses governance over hollering. Ryan enjoys a honeymoon in which the government does not shut down and the debt ceiling is raised, but with some further spending reforms. The House and Senate pass reauthorization and reform of No Child Left Behind, removing the threat of federal takeover of the schools and encouraging school choice programs. The House passes an Obamacare alternative and tax reform, both of which are filibustered in the Senate. <br> Meanwhile, in the presidential race, Carson wins Iowa and then plummets in the polls. Trump declares that elections are for “losers” and takes over leadership of Heritage Action. One of many constructive and serious candidates (Sen. Marco Rubio, who is rising in the polls at the very time Ryan becomes speaker, Carly Fiorina, etc.) wins the nomination, pulling the party together and setting out an agenda that entices many who voted for President Obama the first time and stayed home in 2012 back into the GOP fold. A chunk of Democrats frightened by the Obama foreign policy and another recession, after joining “Democrats for [fill in GOP nominee],” permanently change their affiliation. <br> In the first hundred days of the new administration, with assistance from Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a newly elected whip Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), the GOP passes conservative health-care reform, scraps the sequester in favor of a budget that restrains entitlements and adequately funds the military, and passes pro-growth tax reform. With Vice President Nikki Haley at the helm, the party embarks on a plan to revitalize inner cities under the Jack Kemp Act. Secretary of State Joe Lieberman and Defense Secretary John McCain re-establish solid relations with our allies and begin to re-establish American influence abroad. (Cruz replaces Rush Limbaugh, Carson replaces Sean Hannity.) <br> That’s a rather stark choice, more stark than these things work out in real life. But there really is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the Republicans to evolve, adapt and expand to match the country as it is now, not as it was in 1950 or 1980. There is a point at which a party becomes so rigid and out of whack with the times that it breaks. It is not clear whether that time will be 2016. We’ll see how it all works out. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> For a couple of months we have noted that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is performing better than his poll numbers reflected. He had two good debate performances. He has put out meaty plans on national security, entitlement reform, and tax reform. In TV interviews he has been relaxed and up-to-speed on foreign policy, as he was again on Sunday on ABC. <br> On “This Week,” he urged implementation in Syria of a no-fly zone. (“America’s got to re-establish its presence in that area. We should be the ones leading the fight on ISIS. And by the way, we know Putin’s not fighting ISIS. Putin’s there to prop up Assad. . . . And I’ll tell you this, there’s now 300,000 nearly dead in Syria because of Assad and now Putin is going in and teaming with the Iranians to prop up Assad. Only Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton could mess up this foreign policy that badly. And anybody who agrees with allowing the Russians into the Middle East is just painfully naive.”) He also made a credible case for tax reform. (“I’ve vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history”) and for his record in dealing with Democrats (“I’m the only guy with a Democratic legislature that’s brought people together.”). <br> Finally in the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist New Hampshire poll Christie got a bump, moving up to 7 percent. That has been where he has spent the lion’s share of his time, and where his best chance for an early primary win rests. He has also been helped by a drop in interest in a main rival for moderate voters, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has gone from double digits to 6 percent. <br> But Christie will need several things to fall his way to jump into real contention. <br> First, he will need to make the next debate — currently he is barely above CNBC’s threshold of a 2.5 percent average in recent national polls — and deliver another top-flight performance, taking it to his most likely rivals for moderate and independent voters while continuing to shoot down Trump’s inane policy remarks. <br> Second, it is not clear how much money he has but soon enough we will know if he has enough in the till to go up on the air in New Hampshire. It’s not essential, as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) showed by winning the state one townhall at a time, but it will be hard to keep pace with those who have ample funds and a good ground organization. <br> Third, he’s got to figure out a way to deal with Carly Fiorina. It’s a delicate balance between trying to knock her down to size and appearing overbearing toward the only woman in the field. Rather than snipe at her for talking about her business background (what else can she do when explaining her readiness?) he would do well to start pressuring her to lay out concrete proposals as he has. It is one thing to say “there are lots of good ideas out there,” as she often does; it’s quite another to select specific ones and make the case for your agenda to voters. <br> Fourth, he will need to live down the notorious scene of him hugging the president on the beach just before the 2012 election. In fact, he’s got a good case to make that he’s been fighting the Obama-like liberal agenda in a blue state, and has plenty to show for it. <br> Make no mistake: Christie has an uphill climb. There are many candidates ahead of him in the polls, many with more money and some without the hostility coming from the base. Healing the divide between the grass roots and the establishment will not be easy for someone perceived as too moderate by the base. That said, he has something other candidates lack: A pairing of a strong executive record in public office with a charismatic personality. Jeb Bush has the former, but not the latter. Fiorina and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have the rhetorical skill but not his track record of leading a state or dealing with a serious public crisis (e.g. Ebola, hurricane Sandy). If nothing else Christie will make the race more interesting and pose a challenge for several competitors who need to win or come close in New Hampshire. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 WITH MUCH of the Republican presidential field unwilling to address budget issues, former Florida governor Jeb Bush on Wednesday released a comprehensive and detailed tax plan worth taking seriously. Mr. Bush’s proposal is arguably more fine-grained than was Mitt Romney’s during the 2012 presidential race, and it easily surpasses the mathematically challenged nonsense passed off by some other GOP candidates. It should serve as a starting point for the 2016 Republican debate on governing priorities. <br> Mr. Bush borrows heavily from the recent work of Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor and Ronald Reagan’s chief economics adviser. Mr. Feldstein has identified the country’s overgrown mess of a tax code as a vehicle for government spending that isn’t transparent and often isn’t particularly useful. Deductions, such as for mortgage interest, cost tens of billions of dollars every year, mostly to the benefit of the wealthy. Mr. Feldstein has proposed limiting the deductions Americans can claim, thereby bringing in more revenue, while offsetting that move with lower income-tax rates. <br> Mr. Bush embraces this logic. He would spare the deduction for charitable giving, but he would cut the deduction for state and local taxes entirely, and he would limit the value a tax filer could claim from every other itemized deduction, including mortgage interest, to 2 percent of adjusted gross income. He would then cut income-tax rates significantly, with the top rate falling from 39.6 percent to 28 percent. He also would eliminate the estate tax and Social Security taxes on working seniors, and he would increase tax credits for the working poor. For corporations, the top rate would fall from 35 percent to 20 percent, with added incentives for investment and reduced incentives for taking on debt. <br> Mr. Bush deserves credit for, among other things, naming real deductions he would eliminate or limit. His expansion of low-income tax credits is a long-overdue bipartisan reform that every candidate should champion. On the negative side of the ledger, his total elimination of the state and local tax deduction amounts to an attack on blue states; ending Social Security taxes on working seniors would help a lot of people who don’t need the assistance; and abolishing the estate tax makes no sense at a time of rising inequality. <br> There’s another, gigantic catch: Mr. Bush’s plan would reduce federal revenue — a lot. An analysis from Mr. Feldstein and three other economists estimates that, without accounting for any added economic growth the plan might spur, the tax scheme would lose the government an astonishing $3.4 trillion over 10 years. A “dynamic” analysis estimating the effects of added economic growth still predicts a loss of $1.2 trillion. <br> Mr. Feldstein and his colleagues suggest that this budget hole can be made up by cutting spending, and Mr. Bush’s campaign staff promises more proposals that will illuminate the whole picture. Yet the budget is already strained against strict spending caps. The impending rise in old-age costs promises to hollow out the government’s capability to do much of anything but send out Social Security checks and finance Medicare. The only feasible way to deal with this problem is to raise revenue, not lower it, and simultaneously reform big entitlement programs. <br> That wouldn’t be a popular thing to say in the midst of a Republican primary. But if Mr. Bush makes it to the general election — or the White House — it is the reality he will have to confront. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Martin Feldstein: It’s time to cap tax deductions <br> The Post’s View: An ideological blueprint <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 It’s mid-April, and Karlyn Bowman — the astute public opinion analyst at the American Enterprise Institute — has noticed something significant. Tax Day “comes and goes without a ripple,” she recently wrote. There’s not much fuss. <br> Discontent with the income tax has ebbed. To buttress the point, Bowman cited intriguing survey data. A recent Gallup Poll found that only 1 percent of Americans rated taxes the nation’s top problem. In a Pew poll, respondents ranked “reforming” the tax system 16th out of 24 problems. Indeed, Gallup reports that roughly half of Americans think their income-tax burden is about right. <br> Of course, the other half of Americans think their burden is too high. But that’s down from about 70 percent in some earlier years. What explains the mood shift? Here are four possibilities. <br> 1) Historically, the income-tax burden isn’t high. In 2014, federal individual income taxes amounted to 8.1 percent of the nation’s income (gross domestic product). It’s been noticeably higher. From 1995 to 2000, it averaged 8.9 percent of GDP. The tax cuts of George W. Bush — most of which have been accepted by the Obama administration — have lightened the income-tax burden. For about 80 percent of Americans, payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare exceed income taxes, says the Treasury Department. <br> 2) The remaining income-tax burden falls mainly on the rich and the upper-middle class. From 1979 to 2011, the share of income taxes paid by the wealthiest 1 percent rose from 18 percent to 35 percent, and the share paid by the richest fifth (including the top 1 percent) rose from 65 percent to 88 percent, says the Congressional Budget Office. This reflects two factors: growing income inequality (the rich pay more because they have more) and lower tax rates on the middle class. Average income-tax rates on the middle fifth of Americans have dropped from 7.4 percent in 1979 to 2.4 percent in 2011, reports CBO. <br> 3) Even this lightened tax burden is increasingly invisible. Most people never see the money they pay in taxes. Income taxes are not only withheld; they’re overwithheld, so that many taxpayers get a refund. The Internal Revenue Service is running a mandatory saving system. (As of early April, the IRS had issued 77 million refunds worth $217 billion.) Payroll taxes are also automatically deducted. <br> 4) The IRS is also a welfare agency: The tax system is so complex that almost everyone benefits from some break. In 2011, 28 million poor families received $63 billion under the Earned Income Tax Credit, reports the Urban Institute’s Elaine Maag. Homeowners get the mortgage interest deduction. Parents get the child tax credit. Itemizers get the charitable deduction. <br> The implications? For Republicans, the political punch of income-tax cuts is less powerful, because the benefits would go mainly to a relatively small segment of the electorate — upscale taxpayers. And “tax reform” is a long shot: Too many constituencies have a stake in the existing system. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: GOP voters like candidates who won’t raise taxes <br> The Post’s View: A chance for tax reform? <br> Glenn Hubbard: Tackle income inequality through tax reform <br> Lawrence Summers: Changing the tax code could curb inequality <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 THE NATION relies on federal funding to build and maintain the roads, bridges, rails and other transportation infrastructure that Americans use every day. For the sake of the economy — and for the sanity of drivers, riders, bikers and even walkers — that federal contribution must be healthy and reliable. Instead, the last time Congress seriously bolstered transportation funding revenue, Bill Clinton had just been inaugurated — for the first time. <br> That streak could change, however, as an impending revenue shortfall forces lawmakers to revisit transportation funding between now and next May. There are at least two bipartisan options already on the table that, if acted upon, would break Congress’s recent habit of resorting to short-term gimmicks where the country needs long-term solutions. <br> The first is to simply raise the federal gasoline tax, which has been set at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993. Though they increased the gas tax then, lawmakers did not set it to rise with inflation. Along with other factors, such as more fuel-efficient cars on the road, inflation has eroded the revenue stream to the point that it now falls short — something like $16 billion short — of covering the nation’s yearly transportation spending obligations. <br> In recent years, Congress has ignored perpetual shortfalls until the last minute, then hurriedly passed stopgaps using cash scraped up from arcane corners of the federal budget unrelated to transportation. In contrast to these fiscal contrivances, the gas tax is a simple user fee system that provides an ongoing stream of revenue, charging people roughly according to how much they use the roads. The policy structure is already in place. All lawmakers need to do is approve an increase and, better yet, peg it to inflation this time. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) have introduced a bill that would do both. Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), a key player in the transportation funding debate, said last week that a gas tax hike would attract 60 votes in the Senate, at least as things stand now. <br> We would prefer to see Congress make that simple change and dispense with the issue, immediately. But President Obama and some Republicans are on the record favoring a different approach — raising money through corporate tax reform and putting it into transportation. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) and Mr. Obama offered strikingly similar proposals along these lines this year. Following this month’s midterm results, GOP leaders and Mr. Obama both put tax reform on their lists of potential areas of agreement in the new Congress, and the president explicitly linked the idea to infrastructure spending in his post-election remarks. <br> This approach could provide several years of continuous funding, which is good for state transportation authorities who want to be able to plan long-term projects. The revenue would be one-time only, leaving the transportation budget in the same or worse trouble after the cash runs out. Even so, a four- or eight-year program based on serious new revenue would be much better than the slapdash funding schemes Congress has resorted to lately. <br> With preexisting bipartisan buy-in, there’s no good reason Congress can’t adopt a better transportation funding strategy, and soon. <br> Other editorials in this occasional series are at wapo.st/beyondgridlock. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> The ‘Beyond Gridlock’ editorial series <br> The Post’s View: Congress should fix the gas tax <br> The Post’s View: New gas tax can help pay for roads and transportation <br> The Post’s View: Paving the way for shoring up U.S. transportation funding <br> The Post’s View: Raise the gas tax <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The April 25 front-page article “Metro at 40: A mess of its own making” documented several problems dating to Metro’s birth: cutting corners on construction to reduce initial costs, a complex management structure making accountability difficult and politicians focused on new tracks and stations but not interested in “spending for maintenance.” <br> The Federal Transit Administration is considering a “full funding agreement” for the Purple Line, which will link to Metro. We should learn the lessons of past expansions and first make some of the 200 critical repairs that have been deemed necessary to fix Metro. <br> Twenty years from now, I want to read a success story, not about more financial, management and environmental problems.     <br> Robyn Lieberman, Chevy Chase <br> “Metro at 40: A mess of its own making” underscored a problem in this country: the cowardice of members of Congress, primarily Republicans, regarding tax increases out of fear of alienating Grover Norquist, founder of Americans for Tax Reform. This person, who has never been elected to public office, has intimidated politicians into signing a pledge to never raise taxes. Thus, instead of doing what’s best — funding Metro, repairing more than 58,000 bridges desperately in need and fixing our deplorable roads — politicians happily ignore the general good to ensure their own continued political, parasitic existence. <br> This is precisely why voters give such appallingly low approval ratings to Congress and why this country will continue its downhill slide. 
 DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS in Ukraine have often been hamstrung by infighting, and the coalition that took power following the pro-democracy uprising of 2014 unfortunately was no exception. Now President Petro Poroshenko has moved decisively to consolidate his control, engineering the installation of a close ally as prime minister and filling other key posts with cronies. The result is that Ukraine’s attempt to fend off Russian aggression, stabilize its economy and integrate into the democratic West will now rise or fall with a leader whose commitment to reform is questionable. Without robust intervention by Ukraine’s Western allies, failure is probable. <br> Mr. Poroshenko and his new prime minister, Vladi­mir Groysman, talked a good game as Mr. Groysman presented his cabinet to parliament last week. They said they were committed to continuing an International Monetary Fund program that is keeping Ukraine financially afloat, to fighting corruption and to rejecting the economic populism proposed by many in parliament. But neither man has a record of supporting the radical steps Ukraine needs, including a sweeping reform of the judiciary, big increases in energy prices for consumers, and an uncompromising assault on corrupt oligarchs and vested interests. <br> In recent months Mr. Poroshenko has blocked a necessary clean sweep at the state prosecutor’s office, which has been protecting rather than prosecuting corrupt businessmen. Though he promised to sell his own business when he took office, Mr. Poroshenko did not do so, and the Panama Papers revealed that he had set up offshore accounts for his assets. For his part, Mr. Groysman put himself at odds with the IMF late last year by opposing a critical tax reform and delaying the adoption of this year’s budget, according to Anders Aslund of the Atlantic Council. <br> While former prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk feuded with Mr. Poroshenko and protected oligarchs close to his own party, he presided over a cabinet seeded with capable technocrats from outside Ukraine. Now they are all gone, including American-born Natalie Jaresko, who oversaw negotiations with the IMF and a debt restructuring as finance minister. <br> The good news, perhaps, is that Mr. Poroshenko cannot afford to break with the IMF or with European Union governments that, together with the United States, are helping to finance Ukraine and — barely — restraining Vladi­mir Putin from resuming military aggression. IMF aid has been frozen since last October; to restart it, the government should be required to take reform measures it has been resisting, such as an increase in gas prices. E.U. governments will pressure Mr. Poroshenko to implement constitutional changes that are part of a stalled peace deal with Russia. However, a recent escalation of attacks along a cease-fire line by Russian-backed forces should push that issue to a back burner. <br> The Obama administration has pressed the cause of reform in Ukraine, correctly noting that 2016 could be a turning point for the country if it cleans up its government and establishes the rule of law. Vice President Biden visited Kiev in December and has been prodding Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Groysman with phone calls. According to a White House statement, he urged the new prime minister to move quickly on IMF commitments and the confirmation of a reformist chief prosecutor.

 HERE’S HOW American democratic capitalism should work: U.S. corporations would have a duty to maximize shareholder profit and would be free to pursue that duty, including by mergers with foreign firms. These mergers would be driven by economic fundamentals, not a desire to game the U.S. tax system. In turn, U.S. tax law would provide the appropriate incentives, as adjusted through regular legislation, not episodic, politically driven executive action. <br> Though all concerned are eager to cast it as a morality play, with either corporate America or Big Government as villain (depending on political ideology), the Treasury Department’s de facto cancellation of a pending $160 billion merger between U.S. drug giant Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan is best understood as a case study in how far our system deviates from that ideal. <br> “Tax inversions,” essentially switching a corporate address to a low-tax foreign country via merger with a foreign firm, cost the U.S. about $2 billion a year, a rounding error in the federal budget but a legitimate concern for taxpayers who support the public goods, such as the U.S. patent and higher education systems, from which firms such as Pfizer benefit. But the corporate behavior should not surprise. The U.S. corporate tax rate exceeds rates abroad; firms will take advantage of that disparity, within the law. As of the time Pfizer began planning it, its inversion merger with Allergan was legal. Casting the firm as immoral or unpatriotic is a way to deflect blame for those who have created the wrong incentives. <br> Is the government, then, the villain? It stands accused of acting arbitrarily by imposing new rules to stop inversions — indeed, to stop the Pfizer-Allergan deal in particular. <br> One of the rules targets “earnings stripping,” whereby multinational corporations borrow from foreign subsidiaries and use the tax-deductible interest payments to shift income to lower-tax jurisdictions overseas. This is a benefit of inversion, and by curbing it, the new rule may deter inversions themselves. This rule seems well-grounded in a 1969 statute authorizing Treasury to redefine debt as equity when necessary to rein in tax avoidance. <br> More controversial is a second rule, which undid Pfizer-Allergan: Current U.S. law allows inversions if a certain percentage of the merger partner in a low-tax jurisdiction abroad is legitimately foreign-owned. The Pfizer-Allergan deal conformed to that standard; but the new regulation changes that by disallowing formerly American parts of a foreign firm that were acquired over the previous three years. Notably, this applies whether those mergers were tax-motivated or not. Treasury’s claimed legal authority is a tax-law provision that empowers it to police tax-avoidance-by-inversion but does not authorize this specific method of doing so. <br> That might or might not stand up in court. But Pfizer and Allergan would have had to go through years of expensive litigation to find out. <br> Thus did Treasury, blending reason, authority and a measure of sheer bureaucratic force, scuttle one politically sensitive inversion, without solving anything fundamental; indeed, companies involved in six other pending inversions say theirs can proceed even under the new rules. The U.S. corporate tax code remains an uncompetitive mess. Republicans in Congress and President Obama have promised repeatedly to do their duty and reform it. Not only economic efficiency but also the rule of law demand that they get on with it. <br> Read more: <br> The Post’s View: To prevent corporate ‘inversions,’ the American tax code needs to be fixed <br> The Post’s View: Mr. Obama’s action against corporate tax ‘inversions’ just a short-term risk <br> Orrin Hatch: How to deal with corporate inversions — without the politics <br> Jacob J.

 Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association and the Parental Rights Organization. <br> Democrats have approached the 2016 presidential election with great confidence, arguing that changing demographics will guarantee them victory. By this, they mean the growing number of African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans expected to vote in November. <br> However, other dramatic changes in the electorate over the past 30 years give Republican candidates an advantage. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has insulted — and telegraphed her plans to damage the issues important to — these groups of Americans. Clinton began her political life in the late 1970s, and her understanding of who votes and why predates the emergence of these voting constituencies — in some cases by decades. <br> Home-schoolers: Thirty years ago, home schooling was illegal in almost every state. Today, all 50 states allow home schooling, and about 2 million children — nearly 4 percent of K-12 students — are home-schooled. Ten million Americans have been home-schooled at some point in their lives. Home-schoolers and their families make a great sacrifice, usually taking one parent out of the job market. They self-identify as “home-schoolers.” Home-schoolers believe Clinton and the modern Democratic Party would like to regulate home schooling out of existence to please the teachers unions. <br> Charter school supporters: There are nearly 3 million students in public charter schools, an educational choice not available before 1992. Clinton has been endorsed by teachers unions, which see as a top priority bringing unionized teachers and work rules into public charter classrooms, destroying the very educational environment that parents of charter school students fought to win for their children. Paraphrasing Al Shanker, the former president of the American Federation of Teachers, the kids cannot vote. Their parents can. These children and their parents live in cities, and often in swing states. <br> Concealed-carry permit holders: When Bill and Hillary Clinton were promoting gun control in 1993, the “gun lobby” was imagined by liberal politicians as limited to hunters in rural areas. Easy to ignore, they thought. But now 42 states have enacted laws that grant any honest citizen the right to carry a gun. Nearly 13 million Americans have concealed-carry permits. Carrying a gun is a personal decision, a big part of many people’s lives. But in the March 6 Democratic presidential candidates debate, Hillary Clinton said, “I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms.” <br> This is an insult to the 13 million Americans who have decided to take upon themselves the task of protecting themselves and their families. Perhaps Clinton thinks she can ignore those whom some liberals consider rubes living in square states out west. But let’s look at swing states in 2016: Florida has about 1.4 million concealed-carry permits, Pennsylvania 1 million, Michigan 600,000, Ohio 460,000 , and Colorado 160,000. <br> Fracking workers: It has historically been an easy decision for Democrats to insult and belittle the oil and gas industry. Energy workers lived in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Alaska — unlikely states for a Democratic presidential candidate to win. But the emergence of fracking has opened up oil and gas exploration in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Try winning 270 electoral votes while threatening to damage the nearly 186,000 energy jobs in Ohio, almost 73,000 jobs in Pennsylvania and more than 100,000 jobs in Colorado. <br> Again at the March 6 debate, Clinton made this not-so-veiled threat: “By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place.” <br> Users of e-cigarettes and vapor products: Vaping, an alternative to smoking cigarettes, was not around 10 years ago. Today, more than 9 million Americans vape. They have shifted from smoking cigarettes to a healthier lifestyle. They are proud of their transition. These voters defeated Elizabeth Thomson, a Democrat in the New Mexico House who pushed for tax increases and regulations on vaping. President Obama’s Food and Drug Administration is moving to essentially kill the vaping industry through regulations, and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), the Carrie Nation of the new prohibition movement, has said, “The e-cigarette industry should be put out of business.” If you doubt that this is a vote-moving issue, ask someone who vapes. <br> Uber drivers and others in the sharing economy: There was no Uber before 2009. Today, there are 400,000 Uber drivers who take at least four trips a month. Clinton has announced that she wants to “crack down” on independent contractor laws that allow Uber and the entire sharing economy to exist. Why? Unions don’t like laws that allow Americans to work independently. They don’t pay dues. Clinton wants you to have a boss. Add to Uber drivers those Americans who know what Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Instacart and Postmates are. <br> Clinton watched her husband run for the presidency and win in 1992 and 1996. But that was before vaping, fracking, Uber, concealed-carry, charter schools and home schooling became prevalent in the United States. <br> Read more: <br> E.J.

 Jeffrey R. Immelt is chairman and chief executive of GE. <br> We at GE were interested to read comments Monday by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who told the New York Daily News editorial board that GE is among the companies that are supposedly “destroying the moral fabric” of America. The senator had been asked to cite examples of corporate greed at its worst. Somehow that got him to talking about us. <br> GE has been in business for 124 years, and we’ve never been a big hit with socialists. We create wealth and jobs, instead of just calling for them in speeches. We take risks, invest, innovate and produce in ways that today sustain 125,000 U.S. jobs. Our engineers innovate every day to build hardware and software solutions that meet real-world challenges. Our employees are proud of our company. I meet second- and third-generation employees whenever I travel across the country. I am one myself. Our suppliers and partners are proud of our company. Our communities are proud of our company. Our pride, history and hard work are real — the moral fabric of America. <br> The senator has never bothered to stop by our aviation plant in Rutland, Vt. We’ve been investing heavily (some $100 million in recent years), hiring and turning out some of the world’s finest jet-engine components in Vermont since the 1950s. The plant employs more than 1,000 people who are very good at what they do. It’s a picture of first-rate jobs with high wages, advanced manufacturing in a vital industry — how things look when American workers are competing and winning — and Vermont’s junior senator is always welcome to come by for a tour. <br> Elsewhere in Vermont, GE Healthcare employs more than 340 men and women in South Burlington. Yearly, GE does about $40 million worth of business with dozens of suppliers of parts and services across Vermont. Nationwide, we have 200 GE plants, including 15 that were built in the past five years — all with the aim of making GE the world’s premier industrial company. <br> Sanders says that he is upset about GE’s operations abroad — as though a company that has customers in more than 180 countries should have no presence in any of them. He never mentions that we are one of the United States’ prime exporters, annually selling in excess of $20 billion worth of American-made goods to the world. Nor does he mention that our sales around the world support our manufacturing base here at home, along with the thousands of U.S. companies in our supply chain. You want to cause big problems for our suppliers — many of whom are small and medium-size businesses — and their workers? The surest way would be to pull out of those countries and lose those customers. <br> We are competing globally with foreign companies whose governments care whether they win and support them in innumerable ways. U.S. companies continue to wrestle with an outdated and complex tax code that puts them at a distinct competitive disadvantage. Sanders has stated many times that GE pays no taxes. Repeating a lie over and over does not make it true. We pay billions in taxes, including federal, state and local taxes. The U.S. tax system has not been updated in 30 years and isn’t designed for today’s economy, which is why we support comprehensive tax reform — even if it raises our tax rate. <br> It’s easy to make hollow campaign promises and take cheap shots in speeches and during editorial board sessions, but U.S. companies have to deliver for their employees, customers and shareholders every day. GE operates in the real world. We’re in the business of building real things and generating real growth for a nation that needs it now more than ever. I’m proud of all that we do, and how it all figures into “the moral fabric” of America is so plain to me. It seems Sen. Sanders is missing the point. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Jonathan Capehart: 9 things Bernie Sanders should’ve known about but didn’t in that Daily News interview <br> The Post’s View: Bernie Sanders’s attack on reality <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Trumpanomics doesn’t compute. The media keep piling on Donald Trump, because he keeps saying things that are controversial, impractical, undesirable and — in some cases — simply impossible. Into this last category has now tumbled something new: Trump told Post reporters Robert Costa and Bob Woodward that he could eliminate the $19 trillion federal debt “over a period of eight years.” He won’t, even if he wins in a landslide. <br> To explain: You can’t increase military spending (which Trump has promised), preserve Social Security benefits (also a Trump promise), enact a huge tax cut (another proposal) and simultaneously pay off the debt. Trump’s budget is awash in glaring contradictions. The math doesn’t work. It’s virtually impossible to retire all the debt. <br> A quick look at the budget shows why. <br> In fiscal 2016, the national government will spend $3.9 trillion, estimates the Congressional Budget Office. The largest programs are Social Security ($911 billion), Medicare ($695 billion), defense ($548 billion) and Medicaid ($371 billion). Spending exceeds tax collections, resulting in a deficit estimated at $534 billion. To cover the shortfall, the government borrows; the borrowings then add to the federal debt. <br> How can Trump eliminate the publicly held debt of about $14 trillion? (The $19 trillion figure also includes Treasury securities held by government trust funds, such as Social Security. In theory, these debts could be canceled if Congress refused to spend from the trust funds.) <br> Just balancing the budget would require $534 billion of spending cuts or tax increases in 2016. If applied only to defense, the cut would virtually eliminate the Pentagon. If applied only to Social Security, the benefit cut would be 59 percent. If the four large programs listed above were all exempted (plus interest on the debt, $253 billion), all the remaining programs would need to be cut by nearly half. <br> Given an aging population and high health costs — health spending is nearly 30 percent of the budget — this exercise would have to be repeated annually. From 2017 to 2026, present policies produce deficits estimated at $9 trillion by the CBO. That would be added to the debt. <br> And remember: These hypothetical changes merely balance the budget; they don’t repay the existing debt. That would require additional spending cuts or tax increases. How much? Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest another $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion annually. <br> There’s no consensus for this policy. If undertaken, it would surely provoke doubt whether the economy could handle such a dramatic shift, from large budget deficits to large surpluses, without plunging into a deep recession. But even without these problems, Trump would need to repudiate some of his other promises. His proposed tax cut, for example, would lose about $9.5 trillion in revenue over a decade, estimates the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. <br> The contradictions are so obvious that they raise questions about Trump’s understanding or motives. Did he mean to say that he could end annual deficits as opposed to repaying the entire debt? If so, why was he confused? If not, does he cynically assume that most people won’t notice the inconsistencies? Either way, fantasies trump facts. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Ruth Marcus: Donald Trump’s utterly ridiculous budget plan <br> Catherine Rampell: Donald Trump, the Santa Claus of tax reform <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Lally Weymouth is a senior associate editor of The Washington Post. <br> A hero in the financial world for the reforms he has enacted to open up Mexico’s economy, President Enrique Peña Nieto took time out from his appearances at the United Nations and the Economic Club of New York this past week to talk to The Washington Post’s Lally Weymouth about the U.S. border, crime and security, and how, in almost two years in office, he has sought to change his country. Excerpts: <br> You just passed a lot of significant reforms that most of your predecessors dreamed about but no one imagined would be enacted. How did you persuade your opposition to join you? <br> It was in the interest of all political parties to make the changes that would allow us to break the gridlock we’ve had for so many years. We had to change. All the reforms were envisioned when I was running for office — in the areas of energy, education and telecommunications. Then, during the long transition period after my election, we decided to reach agreements with the representatives of different political forces. So the day after I was sworn in, we signed the “Pacto por Mexico,” in which we defined the goals to be reached and the deadlines for the reforms. <br> Why would they suddenly agree that energy reform and others should be carried out when they had never agreed before? <br> The reforms we achieved did not enjoy the support of everybody, but they did receive the support of the majority needed to pass them. The pact defined topics and specific subject matter to take action on. The first reform that we managed to pass was the education reform. This was a reform that was passed on a consensus basis. We began with the reforms that had the most support. <br> But there was resistance to the education reform, wasn’t there? <br> Yes, there was. And we still have it from certain sectors of the teachers union. <br> Didn’t you put the head of the largest teachers union in jail? <br> That is not related. The process of the reform started way before the leader of the teachers union was put in jail. <br> You had bureaucrats examine teachers and evaluate them based on merit. Is that correct? <br> That is correct. Education reform has as its main purpose to make sure that the education delivered is of quality. For that to happen, we had to professionalize teachers. The teachers are going to be examined periodically to make sure that they have all the skills needed to teach students. Of course, we have run into resistance from certain groups of teachers. But most have welcomed the reform. This first reform was passed specifically because it had the largest endorsement. It was passed unanimously. The three main political forces in the country endorsed the education reform as well as other reforms that came after it. <br> One of the main goals of the reforms is to broaden the rights of Mexicans. We needed a standard criminal code, the same rule of law all over the country. Instead of having different laws in every state, there will be the same law all over the country — at the federal and the local level — for any criminal procedure. Also, we have created an attorney general’s office that is autonomous and independent. <br> What else? <br> From 2018 on, any government after an election can decide to build coalitions with other parties. That may be common in parliamentary systems but not in presidential ones. We are creating incentives to create majorities to make future reforms possible with the support of a majority. <br> So the main reforms are education, energy, telecommunications . . . <br> I’m coming to that. The other important political reform is the creation of a transparency system, which is also independent. It means there is a system that obligates the three levels of government — state, city and federal — to be transparent. <br> The third goal is to enhance economic growth, which has been the main challenge we have had in the last three decades. . . . Our average growth in the past three years has been 2.6 percent, which is positive but not enough. <br> Haven’t you done things that will benefit Mexico in the long term, but Mexicans are frustrated with the lack of short-term results? <br> Yes. We have been explaining the reforms, and I am sure that some of them will have results in the very short term. Then you have the labor reform, which is already implemented and which will introduce flexibility into the labor market. It will allow new means to hire young people, women and others. <br> Can you fire people? <br> No. But you can hire them for a period of training and not necessarily [keep them on] if you are not satisfied with their performance. These new ways of hiring people open up the labor market. It incentivizes people being hired. <br> Can you describe your efforts at tax reform? <br> There has been a tax reform, and you know, tax reforms are not popular at all. But the aim is to have a more simplified tax code, to increase tax collections on those who have higher incomes and thus to strengthen the finances of the state. We want to be less dependent on oil-related income. Last year, we had a budget that allowed us to make larger investments in infrastructure, education, health, science and technology. It is foreseen that the increase in tax collections up to 2018 will represent 2.5 percent of our GDP. <br> The difficulty before you now is implementing the reforms you have enacted and creating independent regulatory agencies. <br> That is the difficulty with any reform. I would say the financial reform was made to give more credit to people and create more competition in the financial system. We have solid financial institutions, but they lent very little. So with the financial reform, we wanted to push them to lend more and to encourage the development bank to create instruments for lending mainly for micro and medium-sized companies. <br> You tackled some of Mexico’s oligarchs with the telecommunications reform. <br> The telecommunications reform opened that sector to more competition. It is against having monopolies. You have two television networks now, and two more will be launched next year. <br> That meant going up against some powerful people. <br> Every time you go for more competition, some people don’t like it, but that’s the way it is. We believe it is better for the people. <br> Some say your main achievement is energy reform. <br> Energy reform is maybe the most important because it has totally changed the way we have been exploring our natural resources, mainly the hydrocarbons. Under the reform, the state keeps possession of the hydrocarbons. <br> Pemex [Mexico’s state-owned oil company] keeps the hydrocarbons? <br> Pemex becomes a productive company of the state, but it will have competition and can make associations with the private sector. Now private investment is allowed to be made for exploration and exportation of our hydrocarbons. That is a big change. . . . We will have a regulatory commission to control the state market and buy energy at a more competitive price. The aim is to get more production and get the price of energy down. <br> What are you going to do about the immigration problem — about children crossing Mexico from Central America alone, hoping to reach the United States? <br> We have agreed with countries in Central America — El Salvador and Guatemala and Honduras, where most kids come from — to establish better border controls. Nevertheless, we have people who go through those controls and go to the northern border. We will give the best help to the children who are unaccompanied. We have created — since this phenomenon started — a system to give them medical services and shelter, and we have personnel to take them back to their countries of origin. <br> But they were hanging on top of trains, attempting to cross Mexico. <br> We have stopped that. In the last few weeks, we established controls in order to not to have people going onto the trains. <br> Is there any truth to the allegations [by Texas Gov. Rick Perry and others] that Islamic State fighters are crossing into the United States through Mexico? <br> There is no evidence that terrorists use Mexico to cross into the United States. There have been comments to that regard, but not one of those statements has contained hard evidence. We exchange information with the U.S. It is unacceptable to say that the Mexican territory is being used as a platform by terrorists to enter into the U.S. There is not the minimum proof or evidence pointing to that fact. <br> You captured drug kingpin Chapo Guzmán. How do you feel about the current security situation in Mexico? What is your strategy? <br> Security is a priority of my administration. . . . Now, we have better coordination with local governments — instead of competing against each other, the federal and local governments are working in tandem to fight crime. The results are quite encouraging. If you compare the figures of 2012 to those of 2014, the number of murders has dropped 29 percent. Other crimes have dropped as well, for example kidnappings. Most of the crimes that are committed — murder, extortion and kidnapping — have been because the criminal groups have been fragmented, because the cartel leaders were either apprehended, prosecuted or killed. At the beginning [of my term], we had 122 targets we identified as leaders of criminal organizations; 84 have been detained. This is quite encouraging, but there is a lot to do still. <br> What will you concentrate on in the next three to six months? <br> We have a lot of things to do, but I would point to two main goals. First, to reach the realization of the ambitious infrastructure projects we have planned. We are building the first high-speed train — it will be the first in the Americas. It will go from Mexico [City] to Querétaro [130 miles away]. [We are also building] some massive transportation systems like subways in the great metropolitan areas. In Guadalajara, we are building a suburban railroad. We have a project to double the capacity of our ports from the 280 million tons today to 500 million tons at the end of my administration. . . . We have announced a new airport in Mexico City. We have announced it, and we have the land. In the next four years, we hope to start construction of the airport that will create many jobs and manage up to 120 million passengers [per year]. <br> So right now? <br> I intend to put the reforms into action — to have them implemented. <br> But the Pacto por Mexico is over, right? <br> Yes, it’s finito. We have an election next year. But [in the past 18 months] we have managed to pass the most transformational reforms that Mexico has had, and that’s thanks to the Pacto por Mexico. <br> lally.weymouth@washpost.com <br> Read more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter. 
 In this depressingly unserious campaign season, it’s time — past time — to take Donald Trump seriously. In particular, to take seriously what passes for Trump’s domestic policy, aside from that wall. <br> Trump purports to care about the national debt. “We can’t keep doing this,” he said of the debt at MSNBC’s town hall Wednesday. “We’ve got to start balancing budgets.” <br> Except, Trump — alone among Republican candidates — insists that he will leave entitlement spending untouched, although it consumes more than two-thirds of the federal budget. <br> On Social Security, for instance, Trump rejects raising the retirement age (a move he once endorsed), increasing payroll taxes, reducing cost-of-living adjustments and trimming benefits. <br> In Trumpworld, the solution to controlling entitlement spending is that refuge of lazy and dishonest politicians everywhere: waste, fraud and abuse. “It’s tremendous,” Trump said at the recent CBS News debate, citing “thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old” and collecting Social Security. <br> Reality check: A 2013 audit found 1,546 people who had received Social Security benefits despite being dead. Total cost? $31 million. Cost of Social Security that year? $823 billion. <br> Another Trump favorite — empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices — produces claimed savings, $300 billion annually, that are mathematically impossible. Medicare spending on prescription drugs was $78 billion in 2014. Total national spending on prescription drugs, not just by the federal government, was about $300 billion in 2014, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Stick with Trump! He’ll get the drug companies to pay us to take their meds! <br> Push Trump on cuts elsewhere in the budget, and you get suggestions that are paltry and unrealistic. <br> “I’m going to cut spending big league,” Trump pronounced at the MSNBC town hall. His sole example, when pressed by Joe Scarborough, was the Education Department. <br> Which part, please? The $28 billion to fund Pell Grants for low-income college students? The $16 billion to local school districts with large numbers of low-income elementary and secondary students? The $13 billion to states for special education? The entire $78 billion federal education budget? <br> Sometimes Trump tosses in abolishing the Environmental Protection Agency (budget $8.1 billion). Which brings his potential cuts to $86 billion. The Congressional Budget Office projects this year’s deficit at $544 billion. <br> This would not be so maddening if Trump were not simultaneously pushing a tax cut costing double-digit trillions of dollars over the next decade. His Republican rivals peddle big tax cuts — Trump’s is huuuger. <br> The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates its 10-year cost at $9.5 trillion, or $11.2 trillion with interest. The Tax Foundation gives the Trump plan credit for generating economic growth; as a result, its estimated $12 trillion cost of Trump’s plan would drop to a mere — mere! — $10 trillion, excluding interest. <br> How to pay for this? The Tax Policy Center illustrates the magnitude of cuts required. The Trump tax plan would reduce revenues by $1.1 trillion in 2025. Federal spending that year is estimated to be $5.3 trillion, excluding interest payments. Thus, Congress would have to cut spending across the board by 21 percent merely to pay for the tax cut, no less bring the budget into balance. <br> Trump asserts that his cuts “are fully paid for” by cutting deductions for the wealthy and corporate special interests, plus generating extra cash from corporate profits held overseas. <br> But the Tax Policy Center numbers already account for that new revenue and for limits on deductions Trump has already specified. So how is Trump going to pay the $1 trillion annual cost? TPC Director Leonard Burman tells me that wiping out all individual and corporate deductions would raise perhaps $700 billion annually at Trump’s tax rates. That’s all deductions — charitable contributions, mortgage interest, retirement savings, health insurance. Which would Trump eliminate? <br> Trump also claims his plan would spur economic growth to offset the cost. “My policies are going to reduce taxes, okay?” he told MSNBC. “And the taxes is going to bring jobs back and we’re going to bring jobs back into the country big league, and we’re going to have a dynamic economy again.” <br> The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculates that paying for Trump’s tax plan would require the economy to grow at more than 7 percent annually. The average since 1946 has been 3.3 percent. The Federal Reserve predicts growth in the 2 percent range. <br> Trump is a charlatan. Exposing his ignorance is harder than covering his boorishness, but it is no less essential. <br> Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Donald Trump’s tax plan is all talk <br> Catherine Rampell: Donald Trump, the Santa Claus of tax reform <br> The Post’s View: Ted Cruz’s tax plan doesn’t add up <br> Fareed Zakaria: Bernie Sanders’s outlandish plans make Republicans look serious <br> The Post’s View: Hillary Clinton panders to middle-class voters with unrealistic promises <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Barton Swaim is the author of “The Speechwriter: A Brief Education in Politics.” <br> COLUMBIA, S.C. <br> Activists dressed as robots have made their way from New Hampshire to South Carolina, where I live, for the purpose of lampooning Marco Rubio. He performed poorly during the first part of the Feb. 6 Republican presidential debate, when he tried to answer criticism of his inexperience by enunciating the same talking point four times, sounding more like a malfunctioning machine with each repetition. Now he can only hope the jokes will get old quickly — the robot costumes, the verbatim repetition of anything said about him, the “Marcobot” nickname. <br> Coverage of Rubio’s howler has, to my mind, been vastly overdone (the episode did not reflect poorly on his judgment, his character or even his abilities), but it touches on a suspicion most of us have entertained about our politicians: that they use words mindlessly. Probably all of us who follow politics sometimes feel that the whole business is nothing but drivel and fakery — that politicians are emitting vacuous jargon, their key phrases repeated again and again with apparently no concern for accuracy or feasibility or coherence. <br> Amplifying that suspicion, a computer scientist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst has created an artificial-intelligence program that generates meaningless political verbiage on its own. I don’t pretend to know how he’s done it — the study looks like a lot of complicated algorithms, and, being a writer, I have only the faintest idea of what an algorithm is — but his invention has produced copy that’s more or less grammatically correct and sounds more or less like what a modern American politician would say. <br> And, of course, it’s all nonsense. The input data consists of words uttered on the floor of the House of Representatives (the phrase “I yield the balance of my time” occurs frequently), but the words are placed into new arrangements to form original copy. Taking a passage at random: “Sometimes I think the way we look at these medical issues, instead of looking at the cost savings involved with prevention, we simply are able to look at how much it saves in the long run.” <br> Why do politicians use language in this way? Is it deliberate? Do they not know how irritating it is, how fraudulent they sound? <br> We long for them to speak to us plainly and directly, as they would speak to a friend. But they can’t use language in that way, because they aren’t speaking to a friend. They’re speaking to hundreds of thousands or, in the case of presidential candidates, millions of people with widely varying interests and opinions. <br> Not only that: They also have to consider hostile opponents ready to pounce on even the slightest injudicious phrase and gaggles of reporters determined to second-guess all their pronouncements. Who, amid all these deterrents to clarity, would dare to speak plainly? If politicians used the unguarded language we want to hear from them, they would lose elections. <br> This is what gives political discourse that distinctive air of unreality. Its language isn’t intended to persuade as you and I would try to persuade each other; it’s intended to convey impressions and project images and so arouse the sympathies of voters. The English philosopher Michael Oakeshott’s bleak description of politics (in a 1939 essay titled “The Claims of Politics”) captures the essence of the political sphere and its madcap discourse: “A limitation of view, which appears so clear and practical, but which amounts to little more than a mental fog, is inseparable from political activity. A mind fixed and callous to all subtle distinctions, emotional and intellectual habits become bogus from repetition and lack of examination, unreal loyalties, delusive aims, false significances are what political action involves. . . . The spiritual callousness involved in political action belongs to its character, and follows from the nature of what can be achieved politically.” <br> Donald Trump, notoriously, doesn’t sound like other politicians. In a sense, though, he has intensified rather than changed our political discourse: He’s made it more, not less, bizarre and inhuman. What seems to make him attractive to his supporters is not the content of his language — there isn’t much — but the attitude conveyed by it through a variety of hammer-like phrases: “We don’t have victories anymore,” “We’re gonna build a wall,” “We’re being led by stupid people” and so on. <br> If the nature of politics makes it vaguely but consistently ludicrous, its practical execution makes it more so. I’m thinking of the way politicos rely on metaphors and other figures of speech long made meaningless by overuse. Quoting another random passage from the University of Massachusetts study: “Supporting this rule and supporting this bill is good for small business. It is great for American small business, for Main Street, for jobs creation.” <br> That use of “Main Street” — usually in contrast with “Wall Street” — caught on a few years ago and has only just started to let up. It seems to signify heartland values together with bold American entrepreneurship, but who knows what it really means? And “jobs” or “job creation” is among the most frequently abused terms in current American politics. In the 1990s, when politicians wanted to preempt criticism of a bill or proposal, they would say it was about “education.” Now, among both Democrats and Republicans, it’s about “jobs” and “job creation.” <br> The lexicon of overused expressions currently includes “step in the right direction,” “have a serious conversation,” “existential threat,” “level playing field,” “skin in the game” and many others. More permanent and serious entries include “economic development,” “the American people deserve better” and all kinds of “reform” — “tax reform,” “health-care reform.” <br> Most politicians tend to overestimate their own articulacy as they enter public life, so when they discover how often they’ll be required to speak — interviews, party addresses, ribbon-cuttings, convocations — they don’t try harder to improve on their expressive gifts but instead rely more and more on whatever clumsy cant they hear from their ideological co-belligerents. Meanwhile the natural tendency toward repetitiousness, aggravated by the fear of being portrayed as inconsistent or a “flip flopper,” becomes a mania, and suddenly every statement must be identical with previous statements, each new one prefaced with “I’ve been saying from the beginning” or “I’ve said since Day One.” <br> Some politicos are worse than others, but even the gifted talkers draw on a collection of these nebulous terms anytime they’re stumped for the right words or just too lazy to come up with fresh language. President Obama, for instance, as Chris Scalia observed this past week in USA Today, can’t stop saying “That’s not who we are” anytime he disapproves of a policy or opinion. A few years ago, a Danish TV host noted that Obama habitually declares that any small country whose premier he happens to be hosting “punches above its weight.” <br> Maybe politicians and political offices will one day rely on robots to generate their rhetoric. But I don’t see how a machine could make democratic politics any more bogus, more prone to preposterous unintentional comedy — or indeed more weirdly beautiful — than it already is. <br> Twitter: @bartonswaim <br> Read more: <br> Can you tell the computer-generated speech from the real one? <br> Who had the worst week in Washington?

 It’s hard to believe that the United States, having resisted the siren song of socialism during its entire 20th-century heyday (the only major democracy to do so), should suddenly succumb to its charms a generation after its intellectual demise. Indeed, the prospect of socialist Bernie Sanders, whatever his current momentum, winning the Democratic nomination remains far-fetched. <br> The Democrats would be risking a November electoral disaster of historic dimensions. Yet there is no denying how far Sanders has pulled his party to the left — and how hard the establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton, has been racing to catch up. <br> The Republicans, on the other hand, are dealing with a full-scale riot. The temptation they face is trading in a century of conservatism for Trumpism. <br> The 2016 presidential race has turned into an epic contest between the ethno-nationalist populism of Donald Trump and traditional conservatism, though in two varieties: the scorched-earth fundamentalist version of Ted Cruz, and a reformist version represented by Marco Rubio (and several so-called establishment candidates) — and articulated most fully by non-candidate Paul Ryan and a cluster of highly productive thinkers and policy wonks dubbed “reformicons.” <br> Trump insists that he’s a conservative, but in his pronouncements and policies, conservatism seems more of a rental — a three-story penthouse rental with Central Park-view, to be sure — than an ideological home. Trump protests that Ronald Reagan, too, migrated from left to right. True, but Reagan’s transformation occurred in his 40s — not, as with Trump, in his 60s. <br> In radically different ways, Trump and Sanders are addressing the deep anxiety stemming from the secular stagnation in wages and living standards that has squeezed the middle and working classes for a generation. Sanders locates the villainy in a billionaire class that has rigged both the economic and political system. Trump blames foreigners, most prominently those cunning Mexicans, Chinese, Japanese and Saudis who’ve been taking merciless advantage of us, in concert with America’s own leaders who are, alternatively, stupid and incompetent or bought and corrupt. <br> Hence Trump’s most famous policy recommendations: anti-immigrant, including the forced deportation of 11 million people; anti-trade, with a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods and a 35 percent tariff on U.S. manufacturing moved to Mexico; and anti-Muslim, most notoriously a complete ban on entry into the United States. Temporarily only, we are assured, except that the ban applies “until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on” — a standard so indeterminate as to be meaningless. <br> Trump has limited concern for the central tenet of American conservatism (and most especially of the tea party movement) — limited government. The most telling example is his wholehearted support for “eminent domain,” i.e. the forcible appropriation by government of private property. Trump called it “wonderful.” <br> Trump has not yet called Vladimir Putin wonderful but he has taken a shine to the swaggering mini-czar who seems to run his trains on time. When informed that Putin kills opponents and journalists, Trump’s initial reaction was, “Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, also,” the kind of moronic what-about-the-Crusades moral equivalence that conservatives have railed against for decades. Although, to be fair, after some prompting, Trump did come out against the killing of journalists. <br> Cruz is often lumped with Trump in the “anti-establishment” camp. That suited Cruz tactically for a while, but it’s fairly meaningless, given that “establishment” can mean anything these days. And given the huge gulf between the political philosophies of the two men. Cruz is a genuine conservative — austere, indeed radical, so much so that he considers mainstream congressional conservatives apostates. And finds Trump not conservative at all, as he is now furiously, belatedly insisting. <br> My personal preference is for the third ideological alternative, the reform conservatism that locates the source of our problems not in heartless billionaires or crafty foreigners, but in our superannuated, increasingly sclerotic 20th-century welfare-state structures. Their desperate need for reform has been overshadowed by the new populism, but Speaker Ryan is determined to introduce a serious reform agenda in this year’s Congress — boring stuff like welfare reform, health-care reform, tax reform and institutional congressional reforms such as the return to “regular order.” <br> Paired with a president like Rubio (or Chris Christie or Carly Fiorina, to go long shot), such an agenda would give conservatism its best opportunity since Reagan to become the country’s governing philosophy. <br> Unless the GOP takes the populist leap. In which case, a conservative restoration will be a long time coming. <br> Read more from Charles Krauthammer’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> George F.

 Maybe this makes me a traitor to my sex, but I support the tampon tax. <br> Mostly because it’s not actually a tampon tax. <br> For those unaware, “tampon tax” is shorthand for the fact that menstrual products are subject to sales taxes in most states, even though other products considered necessities (such as food and medicine) are often exempted. <br> In recent months, this has spawned a legion of articles suggesting that squeamish, old, predominantly male politicians are punishing half of humanity for the crime of having a period. Some offer stories about poor women who say “tampon taxes” are cutting into money they desperately need for groceries or other bills. <br> The issue has gained steam on the left, partly because it fits neatly into both the “war on women” and “war on the poor” narratives. Protests have erupted across the United States and abroad; bills have been introduced in state legislatures around the country, and a change.org petition gathered more than 40,000 signatures. Activists have already logged wins in Canada and France. <br> Last week, even President Obama got drawn into the battle. <br> His interviewer, YouTube celebrity Ingrid Nilsen, posited that “pads, tampons and other menstrual products are taxed as luxury goods in 40 states.” She asked the president why. <br> A seemingly surprised Obama responded, “I have to tell you, I have no idea why states would tax these as luxury items. I suspect it’s because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.” <br> But the premise of this question, and of the broader “tampon tax” debate, is wrong-headed. <br> First of all, it’s highly misleading to call the taxes that tampons are subject to “tampon taxes.” To my knowledge, no jurisdiction has a tampon-specific tax, as it might an alcohol or yacht tax. <br> Politicians didn’t one day decide that periods were gross and therefore ought to be made more expensive. Instead, when states and cities needed revenue, they passed general sales taxes — which happened to fall upon tampons along with countless other goods. <br> Then, every interest group on earth came out of the woodwork demanding a carve-out on the grounds that their product or service was a “necessity,” just as anti-“tampon tax” activists have recently done. <br> But what is a “necessity,” exactly? <br> It’s a pretty squishy term. Almost any product can be called necessary in modern times. And almost every product has. <br> In California, the state where a “tampon tax” repeal bill has gotten the most press, such tax-favored purchases include: candy and bottled water, school yearbooks, certain commemorative lapel pins, hot prepared foods sold to airlines, farm equipment, garment alterations and racehorse breeding stock. <br> The more things you exempt from sales taxes, of course, the higher the tax rates on other products have to rise to make up the lost revenue. That in turn increases the incentive for other interest groups to lobby for yet more exemptions, or find ways to disguise and recategorize their products to dodge taxes. (Is cold pizza a grocery item, and therefore a “necessity,” or a prepared food, and a luxury?) Which leads to more carve-outs for more “necessities.” Which leads to ever-higher tax rates. <br> This vicious cycle is one reason tax experts generally caution against creating product-specific exemptions to consumption taxes. Very low tax rates, over a broad base of items, cause fewer distortions, in both what people buy and how many resources get devoted to repackaging and marketing existing products. <br> Another reason to be skeptical about such exemptions is that they’re poorly targeted. <br> The most common rationale for exempting “necessities” — whether they be milk, Advil or, yes, tampons — is that such taxes especially hurt the poor. Low-income people, after all, spend a higher share of their incomes overall, and particularly more on “necessities,” however they’re construed. <br> But when you strip taxes from tampons or groceries, you relieve not just poor students and families from paying them. You’re also giving a break to billionaires. <br> A better way to address the regressivity of sales taxes is to just increase cash transfers to the poor — or to whichever group you think needs money the most. Maybe that’s women, since they are more likely than men to buy menstrual products, though I’m skeptical of the idea that government is obligated to address every difference in every demographic group’s consumption bundle. <br> Maybe it seems unfair that in so many states Twizzlers don’t get taxed while tampons do. But the solution isn’t to dole out yet more tax breaks but to end the ones we have and direct more public funds to people who actually need assistance. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Catherine Rampell: Ted Cruz and Rand Paul’s hidden tax <br> Charles Lane: Another tax reform solution: taxing consumption <br> Daniel Nemirovsky: A simple fix for big money in politics: Tax campaign spending <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 The first round of the District’s 2015 budget approval process could have been billed as the lame-duck mayor vs. the D.C. Council. But that shorthand would downplay what appeared to be the beginning of the muscular reconstruction of Phil Mendelson’s chairmanship of the council. <br> Mendelson (D) became the city’s legislative leader almost by accident, or at least through misadventure: Kwame Brown (D) resigned as chairman after being charged with felony bank fraud in 2012; the remaining council members chose Mendelson, an at-large member, as the interim replacement. But he decided he wanted to stay there. He won a special election for the seat in 2012 and, after triumphing in the Democratic primary this April, appears poised to claim a full four-year term as chairman in November’s general election. <br> Could that prospect be the reason behind the new, emboldened chairman on display last week? Or is the robust Mendelson an apparition? <br> “It seems he’s starting to find his footing,” said longtime civic activist Terry Lynch. <br> I have lambasted Mendelson for his failure to lead, drawing attention to his often bland, namby-pamby approach and the fact that some of his colleagues have jokingly called him “staffer Phil.” The nickname acknowledges his approach to governance: all trees, no forest. <br> Equally troubling, as the government — and the city’s image — slid into a ditch last year after details about the corruption surrounding Mayor Vincent C. Gray’s 2010 campaign became public, Mendelson didn’t step up to attempt a rescue. Some council members called for the mayor’s resignation. Mendelson was mostly mum, arguing only that the legislature had to restore the public’s trust. Duh. <br> Residents began to lament the absence of strong council leadership. The level of apathy within the city rose exponentially. No one should have been surprised when only about 27 percent of registered voters showed up at the April 1 primary. <br> However, a new Mendelson appeared to have reported for duty last week. During the first phase of the budget-approval process, he snatched money from the streetcar project, aggressively pushed through a historic package of tax reforms and effectively beat back an effort by veteran council members Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) and Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) to strip money from a welfare training program. That last move would have delayed, yet again, implementation of the legal mandate to remove from the program recipients who have been in it for five years or more. (A similar federal requirement went into effect in the mid-1990s. But the District — a haven for bleeding-heart liberals — moved to take such action only in recent years, setting a graduated scale for ending welfare services and participation.) <br> Mendelson said he merely listened to his colleagues and knew what they would support: “I’m not on my own.” <br> It’s true the majority of council members got in line behind him, but Mendelson’s demeanor on the dais was tough and confident. “It’s a sea change. It’s part of Phil’s maturation as chairman,” said Lynch. <br> Of course, not everyone agrees: Dorothy Brizill, executive director of DCWatch, a good-government group, said, “Phil doesn’t have that leadership gene. The best I can say is that he has learned a new math. He’s learned how to count” to seven, the number of votes necessary to get legislation approved by the 13-member council. <br> It’s more than that, however. Consider that Mendelson sued Gray, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey DeWitt and Attorney General Irvin B. Nathan after the District’s executive branch announced that it would not honor the voter-approved budget autonomy law. Mendelson lost the case but demonstrated his willingness to rumble with the mayor, who is perceived as a political ally. <br> Passage of the tax reform package was yet another example. In his 2015 budget, Gray had proposed implementing only a few of the recommendations by former mayor Anthony A. Williams’s tax commission. The council, led by Mendelson, went much farther. Its decision to impose a sales levy on previously untaxed services such as fitness club memberships and yoga classes drew sharp rebukes from the businesses and residents. <br> Mendelson told me that he doesn’t intend to buckle under the pressure. In the past, he probably would have been trying to forge a compromise. <br> Compliments certainly are deserved. But, truth be told, the jury is still out on whether Mendelson has decided to fully accept the leadership role demanded of the council chairman or whether he is, indeed, exploiting the weakness of a lame-duck mayor. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Anthony A.

 Trent Lott and Tom Daschle were, respectively, Senate Republican leader from 1996 to 2003 and Senate Democratic leader from 1995 to 2005. Each served as Senate majority leader twice during those years. Their book “Crisis Point: Why We Must — and How We Can — Overcome Our Broken Politics in Washington and Across America,” co-authored with Jon Sternfeld, will be published this month. <br> As we head into a new year and another election cycle, all evidence points toward a disheartening replay of years past. We will see a rearranging of the players, perhaps, but the continuing landscape in Washington is unmistakable. Though Congress recently passed a budget agreement and a highway bill, it seems mainly to have spent the past year spinning its wheels. Our great deliberative bodies continue to be embroiled in an unnecessary standoff with themselves and a poisonous relationship with the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. More money than ever is flooding the system. On deck is a batch of candidates merely demonizing the other side in hopes of rallying support by scratching at the basest itches of the electorate. We have never been more divided. <br> The deterioration has brought our country’s government to such a crisis point that we have decided to join voices to sound an alarm. The United States was launched in grand revolutionary spirit as an experiment, and after 240 years, the experiment continues. Democracy doesn’t work in a vacuum: The system is only as good as its citizenry and the representatives it sends to work its daily machinations in city, state and national governing bodies. In the sense that our system begins with the single voter, it remains revolutionary. But turnout in the 2014 midterms was dismal and, worse, those who did turn out don’t represent a wide and diverse sampling of Americans. Those at the far extremes are continuing to control what’s happening in the center, and our leaders have done little to bridge the gap. <br> We have a combined 59 years in elected office. We don’t see eye to eye on a range of issues, and, indeed, we understand the particulars of our present moment differently. Nonetheless, our efforts to find common ground while in office were inspired and informed by a set of principles that are inseparable from American democracy. As we look out on today’s contentious political landscape, calling on these principles can help to define our challenge and chart our path. <br> We offer the following criteria for what we should all expect from our candidates, governments and, ultimately, ourselves, as the 2016 election nears. <br> ● Compromise: Make no mistake — our political system was built by men in vigorous conflict with one another, but there’s a spark that comes from opposing ideas sharing the same space. It’s the purpose of the two chambers of Congress and the party system. We shouldn’t expect some kind of mass delirium to infect Democrats and Republicans that makes them all agree; we wouldn’t want that. Our strength comes from the disagreement, but we need to harness it properly and use it for something beyond the destruction of the other side. Reaching for compromise is no less than the duty of our elected representatives. <br> Our current officeholders are embracing the conflict and ignoring its purpose. Representative democracy is not winner-take-all. The Constitution was designed as a harmonizing system, balancing the competing interests of all the people toward something that serves everyone. We need to insist that our representatives move beyond the ideological purity that reads compromise as betrayal. <br> ● Chemistry: Government comes down to people interacting. As Senate leaders, we each had a phone on our desk that directly patched us to each other. It created a chemistry that begins at the top and trickles down. But our representatives in Washington no longer know one another as people. Few members of Congress even live in Washington anymore. They no longer share meals or glasses of wine in the Senate dining room, their spouses never meet, their children don’t play together. Between commuting to their home states and the Sisyphean task of raising money, often there simply isn’t time. If our representatives knew one another personally, they might think twice before painting one another with a wide and ugly brush. We need to look for candidates who understand the necessity of getting to know the other side. <br> ● Leadership: Leadership is the ability to sense where the best angels of the public want to go and helping them get there. It’s about governing — not necessarily winning — and finding common ground that leads to action. Our leaders have stalled on the major issues of our time: immigration, cybersecurity, energy policy, tax reform. Leadership takes genuine courage, courage to act on the recognition that the choice between right and left is a false one when it comes to getting things done. We must demand of our leaders that they actually lead. <br> ● Vision: Nothing is more upsetting than seeing political leaders refuse to even attempt to inspire the country as a whole. We have seen more than enough strategy on how to beat the other side, to flip blue states to red or vice versa, or to win over some demographic slice. What we haven’t seen is a vision of where we can all go together, inclusively, as a nation. Whether that ultimate vision is something we entirely agree with — and the likelihood that we’d be in lockstep with one another is low — we still want leaders who communicate something beyond their own or their party’s aspirations. We need to expect them to offer this vision, and for it to be wide enough to embrace us all. <br> We have enormous faith in the judgment of the American people, but it has become impossible to even know what that is anymore. Our political process is rewarding the extremes, and the political leadership reflects the view of that minority. It has become a race to the edges and a downward spiral. Citizens are too turned off to vote, which only empowers those who demand no compromise — leading to more discontent and less inclination to vote. <br> Democracy requires active engagement, mindfulness and tolerance. We can’t expect our leaders to do their part if we don’t do ours. We must retake control of our duty as Americans. The only way to turn the spiral around is for the individual American to make a commitment to vote in the coming year. If these resolutions for the New Year are to take root, there is only one way: It is in our hands. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Ruth Marcus: Two ideas that could overcome political gridlock <br> E.J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> THE MORNING PLUM: <br> Donald Trump continues to rage against Hillary Clinton over her suggestion during the Democratic debate that Trump has become “ISIS’s best recruiter.” Clinton argued that terrorists are using videos of Trump insulting Islam to “recruit more radical jihadists,” and Trump has demanded an apology. <br> The Clinton camp has since walked back the video comment, though her advisers continue to point to social media evidence of the broader claim that Trump’s rhetoric has become a terror recruiting tool. The Clinton camp has refused Trump’s demand for an apology. <br> Make no mistake: Both Trump and Clinton must be very happy to be embroiled in this spat. Indeed, the Clinton camp has cheerfully fed the flames of this fight, in what appears to be a concerted effort to boost Trump among GOP voters. The theory may be that Trump benefits among those voters if he is perceived as a chief antagonist of Clinton, thus helping him spread more intra-GOP damage. <br> Here’s the latest on this: Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told a conference call of Clinton supporters that the Clinton camp takes the possibility of a Trump nomination “very seriously.” The Wall Street Journal reports on the call: <br> One person on the call mentioned the extent to which Mr. Trump’s name came up in the Democratic debate Saturday and asked if that represented a “shift” in the Clinton campaign’s view of his “viability” as a candidate. <br> Mr. Podesta said that Mr. Trump has “demonstrated to be a serious” candidate for the Republican nomination, and that he is “someone who could very well be successful in their nominating process. People have come around to the conclusion that this isn’t just…going to go away at some point.” <br> It’s hard to know whether the Clinton camp really believes this. But one obvious possibility is that the Clinton camp is signaling to top supporters that they should publicly make the case that Trump now looks like a genuinely viable candidate to win the GOP primary. If so, this takes the Clinton camp’s trolling of GOP voters to another level: Hillary is attacking Trump because Democrats are afraid that he’ll become the nominee!!! <br> But there may be a deeper rationale here, too. As I reported the other day, Democrats plan to increasingly make the case that Trump’s simplistic bluster and belligerence are forcing the other GOP candidates to dumb down their rhetoric to match his, thus revealing Clinton to be more prepared to lead in complicated and dangerous times than any of the GOP candidates. <br> This is a political and policy argument: Democrats are claiming that Trump’s rhetoric has become a threat to national security, which in turn makes the other GOP candidates’ efforts to match it — or at least, fail to condemn it in a full-throated fashion — more consequential, and reveals Clinton to be a steadier, more reliable presence. (The bet is that, while all the bluster may appeal to GOP primary voters, it will taint the party in the eyes of the general election audience.) Clinton’s increasing efforts to highlight Trump’s reckless anti-Muslim demagoguery not only gives Trump a way to boost himself among Republican voters, by arguing that he has emerged as Clinton’s chief foe; it’s also designed to advance that larger argument. <br> *********************************************************************** <br> * TRUMP STILL LEADS, BUT CRUZ IS CLOSING IN: A new Quinnipiac poll finds that Donald Trump still leads with 28 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents nationally, while Ted Cruz is a close second at 24 percent. Marco Rubio has 12 percent and Ben Carson has 10 percent. <br> Notable details: Trump leads Cruz among non-college voters (another sign that’s where his base of support lies) while Cruz dominates Trump among Tea Partyers and white evangelicals, suggesting his assiduous courting of that demographic might be working. Also: Where’s that Rubio-mentum? <br> * CLINTON HOLDS VAST LEAD OVER SANDERS: The new Quinnipiac poll also finds that Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 61-30 among Democrats and Dem-leaning independents nationally. Clinton leads among those who self describe as “very liberal” by 52-42, and among those who are “somewhat liberal” by 60-31, suggesting her campaign may be in the process of patching up whatever problems she had with the Democratic Party’s left flank. <br> Indeed, only 10 percent of “very liberal” Dems say they definitely won’t support Clinton. <br> * AMERICANS WOULD BE ‘EMBARRASSED’ BY PRESIDENT TRUMP: One last fun nugget from the Quinnipiac poll: 50 percent of Americans say they would be “embarrassed” by having Donald Trump as president, while only 23 percent say they would be “proud” and another 24 percent say they would be neither. <br> But a plurality of Republicans, 44 percent, say they would be “proud” to have President Trump in the Oval Office, while only 20 percent of them would be embarrassed by it. <br> * TALK RADIO CONSERVATIVES RALLY TO CRUZ: Politico reports on all the conservative talk radio hosts who are rallying to Ted Cruz’s defense, fending off attacks on the Texas Senator from Trump and Marco Rubio. Notably, radio conservatives are defending Cruz against Rubio’s false claim that Cruz once supported legalization, as Rush Limbaugh does here: <br> “At the end of the day when people go vote, people are gonna remember, of the two, it was Marco Rubio that was a member of the Gang of Eight and Ted Cruz that wasn’t, and that’s as complicated or simple as it’s gonna end up being.” <br> Conservative radio is determined not to let GOP voters forget Rubio’s heinous support for comprehensive immigration reform, which could give a big boost to Cruz over the long haul. <br>  * SANDERS HITS HILLARY OVER WALL STREET: At Saturday’s Dem debate, Clinton said she wants to be loved by everyone, including Wall Street. On the campaign trail in Iowa, Sanders went after Clinton over this: <br> “In the real world, if we’re going to transform America, if we’re going to stand up to the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street…and the greed of corporate America, I accept their not liking me….I don’t need to be loved by everybody.” <br> Clinton has not embraced as robust a Wall Street reform agenda as the Sanders/Elizabeth Warren wing of the party has wanted. But Paul Krugman, for one, has argued that Clinton’s plan for Wall Street is better than the one Sanders has offered. <br> * CLINTON ROLLS OUT PLAN TO FIGHT ALZHEIMER’S: CNN reports: <br> Hillary Clinton will roll out a plan to combat Alzheimer’s disease in Fairfield, Iowa, on Tuesday, pledging to spend $2 billion annually to fight the disease and research a cure, according to a Clinton aide….The proposal would be paid for by tax reform proposals and other savings, the aide added. <br> It will be interesting to how the GOP candidates attack this. It’s likely they’ll blast the plan for hiking taxes. <br> * AND THE TRUMP VULGARISM OF THE DAY: At a rally in Michigan, the Donald deconstructs Hillary Clinton’s debate bathroom break: <br> “I know where she went — it’s disgusting, I don’t want to talk about it,” Trump said, screwing up his face, as the crowd laughed and cheered. “No, it’s too disgusting. Don’t say it, it’s disgusting.” <br> Trump then described Obama’s 2008 Dem primary victory over Clinton this way: “She was favored to win, and she got schlonged.” All this should give him another poll bump! <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Last week , Hillary Clinton’s campaign released an ambitious plan for curbing tax inversions. It’s a good start, even if much more is needed. <br> First, a little context. <br> U.S. corporations love to whine and complain about their onerous tax burdens, often citing the 35 percent top statutory tax rate on corporate profits. But with help from legislators, loopholes and clever tax advisers, their actual tax liability is far lower. On average, U.S. corporations pay an effective tax rate closer to about 20 percent, according to calculations from Gabriel Zucman, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. <br> And some of the most sophisticated multinationals have infamously paid little or no tax at all, even in years when they reported billions in profits. <br> How can that be? <br> Large U.S.-based multinational companies have gotten really, really good at “shifting” their profits abroad — that is, manipulating their income statements so that even when they sell goods to U.S. consumers, the proceeds get booked in low-tax countries such as Ireland and the Netherlands. Zucman estimates that this profit-shifting alone costs the U.S. government about $100 billion in corporate tax revenue annually. <br> Such large-scale corporate tax shirking is not a victimless crime (and of course it is, technically, legal). When big, sophisticated companies find ways to shortchange Uncle Sam, other taxpayers — including workers, consumers and small businesses — have to make up for the shortfall. As Leona Helmsley might say, the little people get stuck with the bill. <br> Even so, despite their obvious stake in the matter, ordinary Americans haven’t paid much attention to corporate tax shirking. And so there hasn’t been much popular pressure to do anything about it. <br> Until now. <br> Lately, one corporate tax avoidance tactic has gotten Americans riled up: the “tax inversion ,” which is what it’s called when a U.S. company merges with a smaller foreign company to reduce its U.S. tax liability. Often the company is changing its headquarters on paper but not altering much (or any) of its actual day-to-day operations. <br> Inversions are no worse for our nation’s fiscal health than other tactics used to shield profits from the taxman. In fact, inversions are not even the main way that U.S.-based multinationals reduce their payments to the U.S. government. <br> But the image of an American-born-and-bred company such as Burger King, Pfizer or Walgreens attempting to turn its back on its homeland seems to stir up nationalistic sentiment. For patriotic reasons, if not really fiscal ones, this particular form of tax avoidance has aroused the ire and revulsion of regular Americans. <br> As a result, it has also attracted renewed attention from politicians, including Clinton. <br> Clinton’s strategy for curbing inversions boils town to three parts. <br> Part one would restrict when the U.S. government formally recognized a company as having left the United States (only when it was at least 50 percent foreign-owned, rather than the current, 20 percent threshold). Part two would apply an “exit tax” to companies trying to leave (something similar happens to individuals who renounce their citizenship). And part three would make it harder for multinationals to transfer profits from their U.S. subsidiaries to their lower-tax foreign parents through intra-company “loans” (this is known as “earnings stripping”). <br> Almost all of the tax experts I’ve consulted — people who’ve worked for both Republican and Democratic presidents and legislators — agree that these proposals would probably reduce the incentives to invert, at least in the near term. Still, it’s hard to say how easily these policies could be circumvented eventually. <br> Federal policymakers are pretty much always outgunned and outmanned by the armies of tax attorneys and accountants employed by big multinationals, and past attempts to curb tax inversions were also initially successful but ultimately skirted or outsmarted. <br> Curbing corporate tax avoidance under the current system, in other words, is a lot like Whac-a-Mole. Which is why we really need a much more comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax system, which we last did nearly three decades ago. The next reform likely requires a radical rethinking of not only statutory tax rates, but also how profits are apportioned to different countries in the first place. <br> Still, it’s dangerous to do nothing while we wait for that, especially when — for once — there’s some political will to plug at least one of the holes in the tax code. In the time it takes for Congress to grow the backbone needed for a full overhaul, the tax base will only get ground down further. <br> Clinton’s proposals for curbing tax inversions may ultimately just be a Band-Aid, but we don’t want to bleed out while we wait for the more holistic cure. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: To prevent corporate ‘inversions,’ the American tax code needs to be fixed <br> Jared Bernstein: Protecting the tax base: Why it’s important to block tax inversions <br> Jacob J.

 UKRAINIANS, PERPETUALLY and justifiably concerned that their pro-Western, pro-democracy revolution will be abandoned by the West, have recently had some reasons for reassurance. The European Union has backed most of the government’s terms for making peace with Russian-backed rebels and will likely renew sanctions against Russia in the coming weeks while moving toward implementation of a free-trade agreement with Kiev. <br> For its part, the United States is training Ukrainian military forces and Congress just appropriated another $300 million in military aid. This week, Vice President Biden traveled to Ukraine and assured its parliament that “the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine against Russian aggression.” <br> There is still more the West could do; President Obama has yet to provide the defensive weapons funded by Congress. For now, however, the biggest challenges to Ukraine’s consolidation as an independent state and liberal democracy lie with the country’s political leaders — as an outbreak of brawling in the parliament Friday vividly illustrated. <br> The punches flying between loyalists of President Petro Poroshenko and his coalition partner and prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, testified to a creeping dysfunction that must delight Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, who has been counting on a Ukrainian political collapse. The parties in the ruling coalition have been at odds over the terms of a crucial tax reform and budget for next year, and also over their mutual failure to move against the country’s predatory oligarchs and the massive corruption they foster. <br> Mr. Poroshenko stubbornly refuses to replace the country’s chief prosecutor, who has been blocking corruption investigations, while Mr. Yatsenyuk has been protecting oligarchs in his party who hold parliamentary seats. Their mutual suspicions and recriminations are reminiscent of the power struggles that caused Ukraine’s first pro-Western regime to stumble a decade ago. <br> Mr. Biden recalled that bitter failure in bluntly urging the parliament to pass a budget that meets the tough criteria of the International Monetary Fund and to begin “a historic battle against corruption.” He spelled out a number of necessary steps, starting with “reform” of the chief prosecutor’s office and an overhaul of the judiciary — where just a handful of 8,000 judges have been replaced though thousands are known to be corrupt. Oligarchs, Mr. Biden said, must be forced to pay taxes, observe laws and settle their disputes in court; politicians must separate their personal business interests from those of the government. <br> Ukrainians who joined the massive demonstrations that brought down Ukraine’s previous, pro-Russian government last year increasingly are questioning whether the necessary reforms can be pushed through by Mr. Poroshenko — himself a big businessman — and Mr. Yatsenyuk, a veteran of the failed post-2004 government. For now, though, there is little choice: Mr. Poroshenko is about 20 months into a five-year presidential term, while a parliamentary no-confidence vote in Mr. Yatsenyuk would probably lead to snap elections and months of turmoil that Ukraine can ill afford. <br> That means Ukraine’s best hope probably lies in the two leaders and their followers quickly taking measures that will restore international confidence and offer Ukrainians hope; encouragingly there were reports Friday that they had renewed their alliance. As Mr. Biden put it with remarkable candor, “anything else will . . . drive down support for Ukraine . . . which is always tenuous.” <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Anne Applebaum: Ukraine battles a second enemy: Corruption <br> Jackson Diehl: Putin shifts fronts in Syria and Ukraine <br> Jackson Diehl: Will we let Ukraine die? <br> Jackson Diehl: Ukraine’s civil (service) war <br> Lally Weymouth: Poroshenko: ‘Ukraine is fighting . . . for global democracy and freedom’ <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> This week we see what a change in House leadership can do for a party that has constructive, widely popular policy ideas. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is defying conventional wisdom that politics is too polarized and nasty to allow Congress to do its work. <br> While Donald Trump was roiling the GOP presidential race with his Muslim ban, Congress actually did something constructive on a bipartisan basis. The Associated Press reports: <br> Driven by the Paris terror attacks, the House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to tighten controls on travel to the U.S. and require visas for anyone who’s been in Iraq or Syria in the previous five years. <br> The legislation takes aim at the “visa waiver” program that allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the U.S. for stays of 90 days and less without first obtaining a visa from an embassy or consulate. Belgium and France, home to most of the perpetrators of last month’s Paris attacks, are among the participating countries. <br> The bill, which passed 407-19, would institute a series of changes, including the new visa requirement for citizens of Iraq, Syria and any other country deemed a terrorist hotspot, along with anyone who’s traveled to those countries in the previous five years. Exceptions are made for official government visits and military service. <br> The bill was actually designed to fix a real, not imaginary, issue. The AP observed that “the program has been used by would-be terrorists, including ‘shoe bomber’ Richard Reid, who boarded a flight from Paris to Miami in December 2001 without a visa and attempted to set off a bomb. Zacarias Moussaoui, the ’20th hijacker’ from 9/11, also flew from London to Chicago with a French passport and no visa in February 2001, according to a Homeland Security Inspector General report from 2004.” By sticking to a discrete problem, Ryan avoided the pitfalls of more grandiose schemes and incendiary, unrelated issues. (“Lawmakers of both parties spoke in favor of the legislation, which is also backed by the White House. It’s a rare area of bipartisan agreement after the Obama administration’s fury when the House passed legislation last month cracking down on the Syrian refugee program in the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks.”) <br> Later today, a final vote in the Senate is expected on the revision to the No Child Left Behind law. Receiving more than 80 votes for cloture in the Senate, the bill is expected to pass easily. Last week The Post reported: <br> The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bipartisan K-12 education bill that would significantly shift authority over the nation’s 100,000 public schools from the federal government to states and local school districts. <br> The bill — which passed easily by a margin of 359 to 64, with all the no votes coming from Republicans — would replace No Child Left Behind, the 2002 law that amplified Washington’s role in local classrooms and launched a national system that held schools accountable based on student test scores. <br> Conservatives did not get everything they wanted, including a hoped-for expansion of vouchers. Nevertheless, the bill will “significantly reduce the legal authority of the education secretary, who would be legally barred from influencing state decisions about academic benchmarks, such as the Common Core State Standards, teacher evaluations and other education policies.” That has long been the rallying cry for anti-Common Core advocates who fear a federal-run national school system: <br> Under the proposal, the federal government would still require that states test students annually in math and reading in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school and publicly report the scores according to race, income, ethnicity, disability and whether students are English-language learners. <br> It would require states to intervene with “evidence-based” programs in schools where student test scores are in the lowest 5 percent, where achievement gaps are greatest, and in high schools where fewer than two-thirds of students graduate on time. <br> But under the proposal, states — not the federal government — would determine which actions to take in those struggling schools, deciding how to evaluate school progress, how much weight to devote to standardized test scores and whether or how to evaluate teachers. States would set their own goals and timelines for academic progress, but their plans would require the federal Education Department’s approval. <br> That strikes us as a reasonable balance. Attention, one hopes, will now focus on the states, where a slew of GOP governors has run on plans to reform public education. <br> Like the recently passed transportation bill, this education bill was the subject of years of partisan bickering. With more energetic and amicable leadership, deals could now be struck, and a final product — widely supported by both parties — emerged. <br> Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who ushered the Senate version of the bill to passage, tells me, “It turned out liberals were about as fed up with a ‘national school board’ as we were.” By that he means that through control of federal funds the Department of Education had gotten into the business of micromanaging schools. One Democratic colleague told him the odds against the bill were 5 to 1 at the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, the committee persevered. “The fundamental compromise was to keep tests in place but to turn back to the states what to do about [the results].” He said, “What I heard going around the state was about Common Core, a ‘national school board’ and local control. I said, ‘Give us control of the Senate.’ Well, we fixed all three. It’s not every day you can do the next year what you promised you’d do.” Conservatives did not accomplish a major expansion of school vouchers (it got 44 of the needed 60 votes in the Senate), but Republicans still have plenty to crow about. “This is the biggest shift in local control [we’ve seen],” Alexander says. “I think we are going to see a new era of innovation for excellence in student achievement.” <br> Alexander says Congress can build on this success. He is already at work on legislation to accelerate approval of new drugs by the Food and Drug Administration and another bill to simplify the aid process for higher education. <br> All of this may bode well for other measures, such as tax reform and anti-poverty legislation, although on these matters, deep divisions may prevent filibuster-proof majorities in the Senate. When it comes to passing an alternative to Obamacare, for example, the House will probably act on a partisan basis. Still, after years of dysfunction and gridlock, it appears that bipartisan, productive governance is not entirely impossible. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 THE ANNUAL congressional scramble over a “tax extenders” bill has long epitomized what’s wrong with Washington. Fortunately, both Democrats and Republicans seem intent on ending this maddening ritual. Unfortunately, what they’re thinking about doing would make matters worse. <br> Most years around this time, Congress takes up the renewal of a grab bag of “temporary” special tax breaks for special interests, hence the term “extenders.” This of course spurs frenetic lobbying. Things have gotten so dysfunctional that last year lawmakers couldn’t complete even the usual sorry exercise; Congress thus faces the challenge of not only extending more than 50 provisions by the end of 2015 but also making them retroactive, so as not to impose financial chaos on millions of households and businesses. <br> A bipartisan agreement reportedly taking shape on Capitol Hill would make permanent certain provisions — such as the research and development tax credit for business and Obama-era expansions to the earned-income tax credit for the working poor — that deserve to be fixtures of the tax code on their merits, and already were, for all intents and purposes. Making their de facto permanence de jure would, to be sure, increase the future deficit. But this revenue loss on paper reflects artificial “scoring” rules, not fiscal reality. You could argue this aspect of the emerging deal helps ensure a future tax reform effort proceeds from more honest budget assumptions. <br> One problem, though, is that lawmakers might make some tax breaks more generous while they acknowledge their permanence. If the deal includes the plus-size research and development credit that passed the Republican-controlled House, for example, the national debt will grow $70 billion more (over 10 years) than it would if the deal simply made the current version of the credit permanent, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. <br> Fiscal responsibility would require paying for any bill that comes out — if not all of it, then at least the costs of such expansions. At the moment, however, not even that minimal level of responsibility is on the table. <br> To the contrary — and this is the second major problem — the bill also may gut two Obamacare revenue sources: excise taxes on medical devices and on high-cost employer-paid health insurance. Both of these measures help fund insurance for lower-income people; the latter, by shifting incentives, tamps down medical costs. It’s especially galling that this budget-busting assault on President Obama’s signature domestic policy enjoys the support of many Democrats. They are responding to home-state device-makers protecting their profits and labor unions protecting their expensive health plans. <br> Mr. Obama needs to take a hard line against this potential disaster. He has resisted, so far, any delay or repeal of the health-care excise taxes. But some lawmakers are trying to sway him by offering additional funding for the “risk corridors” that subsidize insurers’ unexpectedly high costs of participating in Obamacare. No such palliative would justify the long-term damage to Obamacare’s funding base and to its cost-curbing purposes — much less the additional debt. Better to accept another short-term “extender” bill, as in the past, than to so thoroughly imperil the future. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Congress needs to come up with a way to pay for ‘tax extenders’ bill <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 At this time of year, when most Americans have just filed their returns, exasperation with the income tax system reaches a peak. Hardly anyone denies that it is a complex mess. In 2010, calculating their taxes cost Americans $168 billion, estimates the Taxpayer Advocate Service of the Internal Revenue Service. That’s about 15 percent of taxes collected — a heavy overhead. Almost 60 percent of taxpayers pay accountants or other tax preparers. Public esteem for the tax system is low; in a 2011 Pew poll, 55 percent judged it unfair. Disaffection was fairly even politically: 47 percent among Republicans, 58 percent among Democrats and 56 percent among independents. <br> So “tax reform” ought to be a cinch, right? Well, no. <br> True, it’s again on the national agenda. Both the White House and congressional Republicans support it. But judged realistically, the odds of major “reform” passing seem slim. The job is technically daunting (the tax code runs almost 74,000 pages). There’s ample competition for Congress’s attention: an immigration overhaul, gun control and the ongoing budget battle. Most important, the apparent consensus to “do something” is a mirage, erased by three major problems. <br> First: Democrats and Republicans — with some exceptions — have fundamentally different views of what constitutes “reform.” <br> Republicans have generally remained faithful to the central idea behind the landmark Tax Reform Act of 1986, which commanded bipartisan support. Tax reform then meant “broadening the base” — eliminating tax deductions, credits and other tax preferences — and using the resulting revenue to lower overall tax rates. The Tax Reform Act reduced the top individual rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. Now, Republicans want any new tax reform bill also to be “revenue neutral.” <br> By contrast, Democrats — again, with exceptions — now see “reform” as a way to make the system more progressive. They’d raise taxes on the well-to-do and rich through higher rates or fewer preferences. The extra revenue would go to deficit reduction or middle-class tax relief. <br> Second: Though deplored in the abstract, tax breaks are popular with the public and politicians. <br> The value of tax breaks is roughly reckoned at about $1 trillion annually. There seems ample room for trimming. <br> Guess again. Tax breaks have huge constituencies. The largest is the exclusion of employer-paid health insurance from the income tax. That’s worth an estimated $213 billion in 2014. If Congress tried to reduce it, there would be howls of protest — from affected workers and firms, insurance companies, hospitals. The next largest is the deductibility of home mortgage interest: $101 billion. Builders, real estate agents and homeowners would resist any cut. Charitable contributions ($54 billion) and individual retirement accounts ($19 billion) also involve big breaks. Politicians abet tax complexity, because dispensing preferences enhances their power. This helps explain why the Tax Reform Act unraveled. New tax breaks multiplied; rates were raised. <br> Finally: It’s hard to show that tax reform increases economic growth — even if it does. <br> A major argument for the 1986 law was that lower tax rates would spur economic growth, because workers and investors would keep a larger share of the last (“marginal”) dollar earned. This, it was said, would promote more work effort, risk-taking and investment. Although the period after the Tax Reform Act was prosperous, academic studies have trouble separating the effects of lower tax rates from developments in technology, shifts in the business cycle and other economic changes. Thus, some benefits from “tax reform” are abstract; losses — for those whose tax preferences end — are tangible. <br> There is a countervailing force. The chairmen of Congress’s tax-writing committees — the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Democrat Max Baucus (Mont.), and the House Ways and Means Committee, under Republican Dave Camp (Mich.) — seem determined to pass major legislation. Their task will be to encourage compromises that overcome these obstacles. Otherwise, legislation will probably bog down. <br> “Any big reform is going to create losers,” says economist Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, a top Treasury official during the 1986 debate. Despite that, his advice is to do more, not less. “The lobbyists are going to scream just as loud if you go small or go big,” he says. Advocates need to counter that changes represent “significant improvements over what we have” in terms of simplicity, fairness and efficiency. <br> What saved the 1986 law was bipartisanship. “If you want reform, both sides have to come away being able to claim victory,” says Steuerle. In today’s climate, that’s a tall order. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more about this issue: <br> David Nunes: A tax reform to get businesses expanding <br> The Post’s view: A chance for corporate tax reform <br> The Post’s view: Special interests win on tax-break extensions <br> Lawrence Summers: A reform to cut out complexity, increase fairness <br> Jonathan Bernstein: Could tax reform really happen? <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> The indispensable Arthur Brooks’s column on gratitude and it’s scientifically proven connection to happiness is an apt start to the Thanksgiving week. He wisely recommends, “Make gratitude a routine, independent of how you feel — and not just once in each November, but all year long. There are concrete strategies that each of us can adopt. First, start with ‘interior gratitude,’ the practice of giving thanks privately. Having a job that involves giving frequent speeches — not always to friendly audiences — I have tried to adopt the mantra in my own work of being grateful to the people who come to see me.” <br> That is sometimes difficult in the contentious, frustrating political realm. Coverage of problems and reports of discontent dominate. It is not considered news to write “America still here” or “Iran didn’t announce it has nukes today.” Yes, the adage “If it bleeds it leads” is still true. There certainly is no shortage of bleeding and other bad news stories. But taking Brooks’s advice let’s be grateful: <br> While Donald Trump remains a poll leader and continues spinning lies and spouting xenophobia, he has won no votes as yet and is opposed by a fleet of more reasonable, sensible and decent opponents. <br> Yes, the president is entirely adrift on foreign policy and less than a quarter of respondents  in a CBS News poll think he has a plan for defeating the Islamic State. (“Just over a week after the terrorist attacks in Paris, only 23 percent of Americans think President Barack Obama has a clear plan for dealing with the militant group ISIS, the lowest number yet recorded in the CBS News Poll. Sixty-six percent do not think he has a clear plan — a new high.) Nevertheless, there is more bipartisan recognition in Congress and among voters that there is a need for stronger action. (“Most Americans (63 percent) think ground troops will be necessary to remove the threat from ISIS militants; just one in five thinks the threat from ISIS can be removed using airstrikes alone.”) The next president will have a firm base of support on which to rest a more assertive foreign policy. And, in the aftermath of the horrible Paris attacks, the French, British and other Europeans are more amenable to joint action to defeat the Islamic State. <br> Sure, the press is already helping Hillary Clinton in her effort to separate herself from the Obama foreign policy that she studiously refused to criticize until her own political future was at risk. Republicans and the electorate as a whole can be thankful that there are capable groups, fact checkers and candidates to remind us of her record and hold her accountable. Her own plentiful words (written and spoken) evidence the two have been joined at the hip on major issues including policies toward Russia and Iran. <br> Republicans have two guidebooks to 21st-century policy, one on foreign affairs from the John Hay Initiative and one on domestic issues entitled Room to Grow. Despite a whole lot of rubbish coming from a few know-nothings in the presidential race, a Republican president would have a treasure trove of helpful policy ideas. And despite CNBC’s catastrophe, the GOP debates this cycle have been the most substantive and interesting in a generation. Ideas do matter, at least on the right. <br> We went from “chaos” and “meltdown” in the House to Speaker Paul Ryan, with no government shutdown. The Freedom Caucus is less powerful and the GOP more united. There is even hope the House might get around to passing tax reform or an Obamacare alternative. <br> Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) will be out of politics. Character still counts for something. <br> Despite irresponsible and dangerous budget cuts, we have the most skilled military on the planet. Battle-tested and asked to serve longer tours of duty over more than a decade, our all-volunteer military is evidence that there is greatness in every generation. <br> Yes, there is plenty for which to be thankful. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> During the debate last night, Jeb Bush remarked that the Hillary Clinton camp would be “high-fiving” one another over the anti-immigration rhetoric coming from some Republicans. It’s not the only thing that should concern Republicans. They had better be on the lookout for incoming fire from Democrats, some warranted and some not, concerning GOP rhetoric and proposals: <br> First, while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) got some pushback on the revenue shortfall in his tax plan, all of the candidates have to explain how a tax scheme that creates more debt is consistent with fiscal discipline. Ideas like removing all tax on capital gains (Sen. Marco Rubio’s idea) will provide fodder for the argument that these plans are unworkable and will simply favor the rich. If tax plans are not modified, the candidates had better have a bevy of plans to address those on the lower rungs of the income ladder. <br> Second, saying wages are “too high,” as Donald Trump did, is a big, fat target for Democrats in a time of wage stagnation. (It’s also entirely at odds with his feigned concern that immigration allegedly puts downward pressure on wages.) Republican must be for raising incomes and wages, although they may oppose a hike in the minimum wage as counterproductive. <br> Third, the idea that we would let Bank of America “fail” (watching passively as depositors and the remainder of the economy are swept away) will strike many voters as dangerous and cruel. In that regard, Cruz came off looking like a heartless ideologue. Republicans should be in favor of breaking up big banks to stimulate competition, reduce risk and prevent a replay of 2008. However, saying that in an emergency a president will not act is, from a policy and political standpoint, a dead-bang loser. <br> Fourth, and on a related note, vowing to repeal Dodd-Frank may be a crowd-pleaser on the right, but as with Obamacare, candidates should explain what specifically is wrong with it and what they’d replace it with. Democrats will argue that we are returning to the Wild West of no regulation (although such a state of affairs existed only in the minds of liberal demagogues) unless Republicans make clear that they are for reasonable regulation. <br> Fifth, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) — whom Rubio aptly labeled a “committed isolationist” — previewed the attack that Democrats will launch on a defense spending increase. Saying we have a bigger military than a bunch of countries combined sounds compelling, but it is poppycock. Here the Republicans need to explain that the administration has cut defense while allowing threats to multiply. Others do not spend as much on national security because they rely on the United States. When we fall down, chaos ensues. <br> To some extent, both parties face the problem of playing to their base in the primary and then trying to paddle toward the center in the general election. But Republicans, who on one level seem to recognize they must appeal to working-class voters, need to begin thinking now whether their positions are going to reinforce easily deployed stereotypes that Republicans are rigid, lack compassion and favor the rich. Before they dig in further on untenable positions, they should try some of their lines out on non-Republicans. They may be in for a rude awakening. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> But what about right after? “Bush: ‘No way’ I will drop out before Iowa.” <br> After this election, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s (D) pretty much done. “Republicans kept control of the senate, 21-19. They also maintained their large majority in the state house. As for McAuliffe, he was thwarted once again by Republicans. He now faces the strong possibility his record of significant achievements will be a blank page. . . . His chief foe, house speaker William Howell, said he ‘can’t think of anything’ important that McAuliffe has gotten through the legislature since he was elected governor in 2013. He has failed to expand Medicaid, his top priority, and once more faces a Republican legislature opposed to his ideas for gun control.” Republicans’ favorite Democratic governor? <br> After creating the state of Israel, has the United Nations done anything positive? Cliff May on its 70th anniversary: “In other words, some of the world’s worst human rights violators run the U.N.’s top human rights organization, thereby making the U.N. Charter’s commitment to ‘reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights’ an Orwellian joke. The Charter’s other great post-World War II vision: for the U.N. to ‘save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.’ It’s never managed anything approaching that. And right now, of course, a broad swath of the Middle East is in flames with the region’s ancient Christian communities facing annihilation.” Read the whole thing. <br> After their filibuster, Senate Democrats aren’t even bothering to defend it. “The JCPOA does not address the full range of Iran’s record of illicit activities and lifts many of the most impactful sanctions on Iran. It also fails to achieve the stated goal of the P5+1: blocking all pathways to an Iranian nuclear bomb. . . . Despite wishful thinking that the nuclear deal will empower the moderate forces in Iran, the deal is more likely to enrich the most dangerous elements of the regime, in particular Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), as well as the massive business interests of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.” Shorter: Critics were right. <br> You would think after that lame hearing they would give up. “House Republicans are divided over whether they should open a separate probe of Hillary Clinton’s controversial email setup, with some conservative firebrands calling for an expanded inquiry while other GOP lawmakers would rather the Justice Department take the lead.” Stop. Just stop, fellas. <br> After the Iraq pullout, it was all downhill. Max Boot: “The reason that Iraq is in such dire straits now is that after the American troop pullout in 2011, the Shiite sectarians in charge of the Iraqi government alienated the Sunnis once again, driving them back into the arms of AQI’s successor organization: the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Today, Iraq is divided with the Kurds virtually independent, ISIS in control of Sunni areas, and Iranian-backed Shiite militias in control of Shiite areas. As long as that is the case, I remain skeptical that there will be any dramatic change in the balance of power on the ground.” <br> After this president, I’m not sure how many are left. “Innovation Democrats care about inequality. But they also know the difference between sound economic theory and a political marketing scheme. You can’t redistribute wealth without first creating it. Raising the minimum wage or instituting paid leave may be good ideas, but they aren’t necessarily growth-y ones. Rich countries get richer over the long term by becoming more productive. And that requires doing the things Inequality Democrats don’t seem much interested in, such as free trade, deregulation, and corporate tax reform.” <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 SPEAKER PAUL D. RYAN (R-Wis.) promised to return the House to good order, and he’s started by touting the “open” process for considering a major bill setting transportation policy for the next six years. But the process apparently isn’t open enough to allow for a vote on the most obvious transportation solution: raising the gasoline tax to pay for the country’s roads and rails. <br> In the past, House leaders weren’t so spineless. They established the Highway Trust Fund in 1956, supported by a 3-cent-per-gallon gas tax, and passed periodic increases thereafter. The tax was last raised in 1993, to 18.4 cents per gallon. The policy is elegant: Those who use the roads pay for them, which discourages unnecessary or excessive driving and gives the country’s infrastructure budget a predictable source of funding. <br> Since 1993, inflation and other factors have eroded the value of the revenue the gas tax provides. A functional Congress would conclude that raising the tax to keep up with inflation would be the simple way to repair the policy and provide badly needed roads money. Instead, Congresses since 1993 have resorted to gimmicky, short-term patches for the transportation budget, the legislative equivalent of looking under the couch cushions for loose change. <br> Two proposed amendments would have brought budgetary sanity to the House’s latest transportation package. One, from Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), would have simply and immediately raised the gas tax. Though the best policy, it would have faced a politically tough road. Another should have had more of a chance. Rep. James B. Renacci (R-Ohio) and Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) suggested establishing a task force to recommend a stable, long-term funding policy for the transportation budget. If Congress refused its recommendations or failed to act by 2019, the gas tax would be set to increase. Moreover, the amendment would have pegged the gas tax to inflation, which is something Congress should have done decades ago. <br> Yet, even though the House began working through amendment after amendment on the floor Wednesday — many of them trivial or far-fetched — Politico noted that the House Rules Committee blocked consideration of both gas tax proposals. The public, in other words, won’t even get to see who stands against sensible funding for roads because the Rules Committee spared House members the inconvenience of voting. <br> Once the House finishes the transportation bill, it will have to be merged with the Senate’s. There’s talk of adding new policy at that stage. Mr. Ryan, for example, has been working with Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a transportation funding package that involves major corporate tax reform. They should add in the bipartisan Renacci-Pascrell plan. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Joshua Schank and Jeff Davis: Follow Reagan’s example, and fill up America’s highway fund <br> The Post’s View: Congress faces a highway funding cliff.

 There is no tooth fairy. Republicans and Democrats take note. <br> Taxes will surely continue to play a big role in the presidential campaign. The Republicans contend that cutting rates will do the trick; the pickup in economic growth will generate additional tax revenues. Democrats retort that raising taxes on the rich will provide needed revenues to expand progressive government. Both parties are likely to be disappointed. <br> That’s significant, because these partisan beliefs — though dramatically different — have something in common. They obviate the need for middle-class tax increases to pay for government. This sounds self-serving and too good to be true, because it is — as studies by two Washington think tanks make clear. <br> Many Republican candidates have already issued detailed plans that lower personal and corporate income tax rates. For instance, Jeb Bush would replace today’s seven individual rates with three — 10 percent, 25 percent and 28 percent — and cut the top corporate rate to 20 percent from today’s 35 percent. Some of these cuts are offset by eliminating personal and business tax breaks. But not all. <br> The nonpartisan Tax Foundation evaluated seven Republican tax plans and concluded that all lose gobs of tax revenue. Some estimated shortfalls are gigantic. Over a decade, Donald Trump’s plan results in a $12 trillion revenue loss. The other losses include $6.1 trillion for the plan from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and $3.7 trillion for Bush’s. <br> But these losses reflect static assumptions; the economy’s performance is taken as given. What if the tax changes increase growth? Couldn’t revenue losses be reversed? <br> To judge that, the Tax Foundation’s economic model also simulated “dynamic” gains from the tax proposals. These gains mainly involved higher business investment, reflecting firms’ ability to write off buildings and machinery in the year they’re purchased (current law spreads the write-offs over many years). The simulated gains are large. After a decade, the economy’s output (gross domestic product) is 15 percent bigger under Rubio’s plan, 12 percent under Trump’s and 10 percent under Bush’s. <br> But the model is artificial; it isolates the effects of tax incentives and holds constant other factors that might dampen growth (the business cycle, interest rates, the effects of budget deficits). Even under these favorable and unrealistic assumptions, most Republican tax plans still lose gobs of tax revenue. The loss over a decade is $10 trillion for Trump’s package, $2.4 trillion for Rubio’s and $1.6 trillion for Bush’s. <br> These proposals are certainly worth debating. Some aspects may be highly desirable, but — for Republicans — their benefits have been oversold. <br> The same can be said of Democrats’ faith in soaking the rich. Their political narrative seems powerful. The rich have gotten richer and don’t pay their “fair share” in taxes. Raising their taxes will temper inequality and finance good causes. Redistribution becomes an engine of social justice. The trouble is that the math doesn’t match the rhetoric, as a new Brookings Institution study shows. <br> In it, economists William Gale, Melissa Kearney and Peter Orszag asked this question: What would happen if the top income tax rate were increased from 39.6 percent to 50 percent? The answer — less than you think. <br> For starters, it would raise about $100 billion in tax revenues. That seems like a lot (and is), but it’s actually slightly less than a quarter of the $439 billion budget deficit for fiscal 2015. Never mind paying for new programs. Even if the $100 billion were directly distributed to the poorest fifth of Americans (an average $2,650 per household), the effect on overall inequality would be “exceedingly modest,” the authors say. <br> There is a broader message here. Both parties have constructed rationales for avoiding middle-class tax increases, which would be highly unpopular. It’s not that these rationales are illegitimate: The effect of tax policies on economic growth is clearly important; similarly, redistribution is a central function of the welfare state. But the resulting tax policies don’t come close to covering the real costs of government. <br> For years, budget deficits have straddled the contradictions. The trouble is that the mounting costs of retiring baby boomers have made this solution less and less tenable. The present campaign rhetoric will ultimately prove hollow. If middle-class Americans need or want bigger government, they will have to pay for it. Sooner or later, a tax increase is coming their way. There is no tooth fairy. <br> Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive. <br> Read more here: <br> The Post’s View: Ted Cruz’s tax plan doesn’t add up <br> Jennifer Rubin: Bush tax plan’s critics should take a closer look <br> Catherine Rampell: Bobby Jindal out-Trumps Donald Trump <br> The Post’s View: Donald Trump’s tax plan is all talk <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> The event this week that may prove to have the most influence on the 2016 elections was not the elevation of Speaker Paul Ryan, nor even last night’s Republican presidential debate. There is a real world outside the political arena, and in that real world in which Americans spend their lives, the U.S. economy, well, stinks. The Wall Street Journal reports: <br> The U.S. economy stayed afloat in the third quarter despite global turmoil, but it’s struggling to break out of the slow-growth pace that has plagued the economic expansion. <br> The economy grew at a modest 1.5% seasonally adjusted annual rate from July through September, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That marked a deceleration from the second quarter, when U.S. gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — expanded at a 3.9% pace. <br> That will no doubt come up in the next GOP debate, but it really should be front and center in the Democrats’ next face-off as well. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) say they are running on President Obama’s record. Hillary says middle-class Americans do better under Democrats. That seems to pose a problem for Democrats running on issues such as income inequality and jobs. <br> We have already seen a peculiar contradiction in the Democrats’ campaigns. They live in a dark and gloomy time where the rich have never been richer and the poor never poorer, where the middle class is squeezed, and where average people can’t pay for college. How does one simultaneously denounce the state of the economy (and therefore insist on even more spending and gouging of the rich) when one is running on the Obama record. I suppose after eight years they can try to blame this all on President George W. Bush, but even for them that is extreme. <br> As for the Republicans, the current economic doldrums should cast further scrutiny on the green-eye-shade, balanced-budget set that wants to continue slicing away at domestic spending. Obsessed with the annual deficit, which is shrinking, Republicans need to reconsider whether 1980s gimmicks such as a balanced-budget amendment make sense (even if an amendment could be ratified). Unfortunately, the three-ring circus last night did not provide sufficient focus to explore what the GOP candidates would recommend to jumpstart the economy. They should be falling over one another to offer a bevy of pro-growth policies, not simply tax reform. Candidates wanting to put up protectionist trade barriers and reduce immigration (or kick out in large numbers those here) should be asked why they are pursuing anti-growth measures.  Candidates who want to eliminate chunks of the federal government should consider whether they are throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Aren’t some areas of spending (defense R D, infrastructure, worker training, etc.) helpful in the short or long run if you want to spur growth, stimulate job creation and induce higher wages for pinched middle-class workers? <br> In sum, Democrats ignore the current economic malaise, preferring to talk about redistribution and oblivious to policies that slow growth and job creation. One would think we could tax and regulate to liberal hearts’ content without worrying about adverse economic consequences. On the other side, Republicans bemoan the Obama economy, but many offer policies that would be unhelpful or counterproductive. Maybe for the next GOP debate and the next Democratic one the subject should be: How to do better than the Obama economy. It might be more elucidating than Sen. Marco Rubio’s Senate attendance record. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 HOUSE REPUBLICANS nominated Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to serve as the next speaker Wednesday afternoon, setting up a Thursday floor vote that should make his ascent official. We wish him luck. Mr. Ryan promised last week that his speakership would bring “real reform.” Every American should hope he succeeds in establishing a governing majority that acts on issues Congress has let fester for years — and that the rules changes he demands will enable him to act with less fear of Freedom Caucus conservatives than outgoing Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). <br> Yet he faces several grave challenges, some self-imposed. Top among them is that Mr. Ryan promised hard-right members of Congress that he would respect the informal “Hastert Rule,” which requires that a majority of the majority party in the House favor a bill for it to get a floor vote. Adherence to the rule unwisely blocks important policies that would win a majority of House members if they came to an up-or-down vote, restricting the House’s ability to work on behalf of a majority of Americans. In fact, the budget deal Mr. Boehner just struck with the White House violated the Hastert Rule, passing the House Wednesday with only 79 Republicans voting “yes.” Yet the deal will keep the government’s debt payments current and its lights on. It would have been better for Mr. Ryan to have refused to have his hands tied. <br> Congress, moreover, seems to be in the process of punting the most important issues until after the next president is sworn in. Mr. Ryan promised to keep comprehensive immigration reform off the table as long as President Obama was in the White House. Mr. Boehner’s budget deal will keep the government funded for two more years, so there will be less opportunity to tackle the country’s long-term budget imbalances until early 2017. <br> That leaves Mr. Ryan — and the country — with a clipped agenda over the next two years. He may waste more of the people’s time attempting to repeal Obamacare. But he might also push to reform corporate taxes and federal anti-poverty programs. He has already devoted considerable energy to these matters, which could produce useful results. If done carefully, for example, corporate tax reform could boost U.S. competitiveness and provide some cash for the government to invest in infrastructure. Yet a House in which the hard right still holds considerable sway could easily sit more or less idle instead. <br> Mr. Ryan, meanwhile, can’t assume that a Republican will be in the White House in 2017 to make it easier for him to tackle immigration and the budget. Even if there is a GOP president, measures such as raising the debt limit will remain unpopular necessities — and very difficult to pull off without Democratic votes. <br> Mr. Ryan attempted to seek the speaker’s gavel on his own terms, informing the GOP caucus that he would not take the job unless the right wing put down one of its weapons, a procedure to remove the speaker by majority vote. Yet that alone will not solve the House’s dysfunction. At some point during his speakership, it is likely that Mr. Ryan will have to choose between failing the country or violating one of the pledges he made to conservatives. When that happens, we hope and trust that he will make the right choice. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Ruth Marcus: Why would Paul Ryan want to be speaker? <br> Kathleen Parker: Don’t do it, Paul Ryan <br> Eugene Robinson: Paul Ryan is doomed, too <br> Dana Milbank: Can Paul Ryan keep his dignity? <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> The Post reports: <br> House Republican leaders introduced legislation just before midnight on Monday, finalizing a two-year budget agreement between Congressional leaders and the White House. The introduction sets up a vote as early as Wednesday on the bipartisan budget deal which would increase military and domestic spending and avert a potentially catastrophic default in exchange for long-term spending cuts. <br> The 144-page bill, which is the result of weeks of negotiations between the White House and Congressional leaders, would increase spending by $80 billion over two years and would increase the federal borrowing limit through March 15, 2017. A Wednesday vote all but ensures the budget deal will be one of the last acts for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) who intends to step down from the speakership by Friday. <br> Consider it a final act of responsible, albeit unappreciated, leadership from Boehner. We’ve long argued that, at a time the annual deficit is plummeting, it is well worth raising discretionary spending in order to begin properly funding our military. To do so without a tax hike and with some entitlement reforms should — but won’t — be considered a huge win for Republicans. The far right, which expects to get everything it wants all the time with no trade-offs and which genuflects at the altar of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (while refusing to touch entitlements), will be miffed. So be it; the far right’s conniptions are a telltale sign that effective governance is going on. <br> Moreover, “The deal would repeal a major piece of ObamaCare known as the auto-enrollment mandate, which would require large employers to automatically enroll workers into healthcare plans. Any employees already under the plan would be rolled over into plans as well.” The specifics of entitlement changes are uncertain, but it appears there, too, the GOP did not go away empty-handed. (On Social Security Disability Insurance, “the move would forestall an across-the-board 20 percent cut that was in the cards, in exchange for ‘structural reforms,’ that would strengthen it and save $168 billion in ‘longterm’ savings.”) <br> The main benefit to Republicans and to the country is avoidance of shutdown fights and potential default for the remainder of the Obama presidency, which is precisely why Freedom Caucus and outside right-wing groups that raise money over these standoffs will be disappointed. In fact, the GOP never wins these fights, and they only exacerbate divisions within the GOP. Rather than engage in these useless rounds of political theater, the incoming speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), can attend to things around which the GOP could unite, including an Obamacare replacement plan and tax reform. <br> If conservatives want more extensive reforms to the tax code, entitlements, health care, energy policy and more, they need to win the White House. Without the White House, deals like the one to be voted on this week are about as good as they can do. If anything, the great failing of the GOP has been in suggesting (or letting the grass-roots delude it into thinking) that Republicans could accomplish sweeping changes without winning the presidency. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), after getting the endorsement of two GOP caucuses in the House and a “supermajority” of the Freedom Caucus, formally announced he was running for speaker. With his votes now in the bag, it is tempting to paint this as the end of a House spasm of leadership turmoil. In fact, it is only the beginning. <br> In a “Dear Colleagues” letter, Ryan wrote: <br> We can rally House Republicans around a bold agenda that will tackle the country’s problems head on. And we can show the country what a commonsense conservative agenda looks like. . . . That’s because, whatever our differences, we’re all conservatives. We were elected to defend the constitution. We share the same principles. We all believe America is the land of opportunity—the place where you should be able to go as far as your talents and hard work will take you. We all believe in empowering every person to realize his or her potential. And we have the know-how to apply these principles to the problems of today. <br> That is, in essence, the mantra of the reform conservatism movement, in which Ryan has been front and center. Reform conservatism stands for the proposition that conservatism is not defined by rigid fidelity to an agenda frozen in time, and certainly not by advocacy of labor and trade protectionism. Rather, it is based on the belief that conservatism is worthwhile because it is more effective than the liberal welfare state  in making more Americans’ lives better. It is a movement that embraces limited but active government; will reduce government and transfer funds to states and localities when appropriate; will promote work and investment; will reimagine entitlement programs to make them sustainable; will seriously attempt to address poverty, not as an exercise in budgetary penny-pinching but as a social and economic necessity; and will redesign much of government (health care, education) to promote individual choice. If Ryan can bring that to the speaker’s job and make it a policy blueprint for the party as a whole, much is possible. <br> For starters, it marginalizes the most radical and extreme elements in the party, which are tinier than many imagine. Only a fraction of the rump Freedom Caucus opposes Ryan. The usual anti-everything right-wing groups that make money off opposing sensible people and good governance are against him — and are raising money as they always do. The most extreme in the talk radio crowd, which has become obsessed with one issue — immigration — will be miffed. But everyone else — the overwhelming majority of the party — can unite behind a Ryan agenda. That puts the cranks and the radicals in proper perspective. It also reinforces the commonality among the remainder of the party (just as Ryan said in his letter). <br> The Ryan ascendancy also offers the chance for some bipartisan legislation. He can at least put to votes corporate tax reform, education reform (which has passed both houses but in different forms) and a comprehensive energy plan. That will test the spirit of compromise among Democrats. He can also pass and send to the Senate the Republican alternative for health-care reform, perhaps using the plan put out by Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) as a model. It is important for the party in 2016 to say what it is for, and passage of a reasonable health-care reform bill would do that. <br> In addition, Ryan’s election as speaker would, we hope, inspire a more serious tone in the GOP presidential race. No more clowns, no more screeching to please the fraction of the fraction of the Freedom Caucus. Who would work effectively with Ryan to promote a reform agenda? Who has an agenda? <br> Finally, Ryan offers the promise of a shift in tone in the party as a whole from angry to optimistic, from nasty to empathetic, from destructive to constructive. <br> That is a lot to rest on the shoulders of one person. Ryan cannot accomplish any of this without support from the large majority of his conference. And with good cheer and incisive arguments, he will need to beat back the reactionary voices preaching xenophobia and opposing good governance. The country, the party and the conservative movement should hope he succeeds. If not, it is time to rethink the mission and viability of the Republican Party. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Conventional wisdom would have you believe that Jeb Bush is dead in the water. He has fallen from leader to single digits in the polls. He has no big money advantage. He’s not connecting with voters. Well, he is not the front-runner, to be certain, but consider the following: <br> 1. His main challengers in New Hampshire — Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — have $2.6 million and $1.4 million cash on hand respectively, and as of now in the national RealClearPolitics average are below the 2.5 percent threshold for the next debate. If Kasich and Christie don’t make it to New Hampshire or lose in New Hampshire, Bush then occupies the entire “moderate” sector of the GOP while numerous other candidates carve up the right wing. <br> 2. If you take out the general-election money that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) raised, Bush has more cash on hand ($10.3 million to $9.7 million) than Rubio. <br> 3. Bush does have more money on his side than anyone in the GOP primary. It’s in his super PAC, which announced on Thursday a $17 million ad buy in early states, something no one else has come close to doing. It has socked away $56 million in advertising money, including a $17 million buy for states with March primaries. (“Right to Rise plans to spend $2.6 million in Georgia, $1.7 million in Tennessee, $6.1 million in Texas, $550,000 in Oklahoma, $630,000 in Massachusetts, $60,000 in Vermont and $3.1 million in Vermont. The new round of ads also includes $2.1 million in ads in Michigan, which holds its primary on March 8.”) <br> 4. Bush satisfied many conservatives with solid tax reform and health-care plans. Those, plus his Florida record, should be sufficient to win over not tea party types, but rather, mainstream conservatives. <br> 5. While not nearly the best of the bunch, Bush’s performance in the second debate showed significant improvement over his first outing. <br> I’m not saying Bush is the favorite at this point. He does, however, have a viable path to the nomination beginning in New Hampshire. It’s a mistake to write him off or to assume he’s lost his one advantage (money). In many ways, Bush right now is where Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was in 2008 — but with $100 million in a super PAC. In 2008, McCain’s campaign blew its money, and McCain, with lowered expectations, survived Iowa and went to New Hampshire to win over voters with his ubiquitous town hall appearances. In other words, this game plan has been carried out before by someone with even fewer resources than Bush has. <br> Rubio, whom many suggest is the favorite, appeals to many segments of the party, has had terrific debate performances and also has rolled out a series of creative policies. He and Bush, however, remain deadlocked in New Hampshire. Bush won’t just disappear on his own. Rubio will need to beat Bush, the earlier the better. If not, he’ll face trench warfare against Bush and his super PAC’s millions. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 There are, in essence, two races each presidential candidate is running. One is the national media-driven race, including interviews and the debates, which in turn pushes national polls. The second is on the ground: What kind of crowds, excitement and organization are present in early states? <br> Just as it seemed her support may have leveled off (in fact she is only slightly down from her post-debate peak) after a smashing debate performance she comes up with a remarkable fundraising haul: $6.8 million in the 3rd quarter, with $5.5 million cash on hand. She certainly did capitalize on the debate — with donors. We have seen a total transformation in her candidacy from minor curiosity to legitimate contender. (The Hill observes, “Fiorina more than tripled her fundraising total from the previous quarter, in which she raised $1.7 million and spent $714,000.”) She bests the fundraising efforts of both Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) ($6 million) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) ($2.5 million). <br> She is fourth in the RealClearPolitics average nationally, between Rubio and Bush. In Iowa she is third, and she’s second in New Hampshire, which as we have noted before is a must-win state for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. While she is generally thought of as an outsider candidate, of the three non-pols she clearly has the most appeal outside the tea party. If she chases two sitting governors from the race she stands to pick up a good deal of their support. <br> Moreover, in the recent Fox News poll she beats Hillary Clinton narrowly and comes within 4 points of Vice President Joe Biden (only Rubio does better than she against Biden in that poll). <br> Only in this year can we imagine a Trump vs. Fiorina standoff, with the latter having the backing of the establishment. It is that kind of year. Fiorina, however, has far to go. She will need to accomplish several things. <br> First, as other candidates roll out meaty policy proposals she will need to as well. It’s what top candidates do, and she has the chance to present more serious plans than Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson (a low bar, I know) and thereby secure her niche as the serious outsider. On tax policy, she would do very well to avoid the pitfalls of other plans by not giving high-income earners a big tax cut and thereby provide a truly populist proposal. (There is plenty of growth to be had in corporate tax reform, tax cuts for the middle class and in energy, regulatory, trade and immigration policy reforms.) <br> Second, building on her foreign policy positions — which are sound, mainstream conservative and grounded in specifics — she would do well to start challenging Trump and Carson on their grab back of ill-advised positions. Trump mimics President Obama in wanting to cede the Middle East to Vladimir Putin. Carson questions why we did not use “diplomacy” rather than military force to retaliate against jihadists in the wake of 9-11. Again, she can show herself to be head and shoulders above those two. <br> And third, she could use a signature policy issue or two. Frankly, neither Trump nor Carson is suggesting anything we have not heard from right-wingers for years. Fiorina, however, could make a splash and also demonstrate her own strengths. She might consider a full-blown economic internationalist policy. Indeed, she could work off of Gen. (Ret.) David Petraeus and Michael O’Hanlon’s strong articulation of just such an approach, including support for “scientific research, infrastructural investment and education” and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She can expand upon the theme of economic world leadership by reiterating her proposals for additional sanctions on Iran and reform of international entities to root out corruption and use them to further the West’s strategic interests. Championing energy sales to Europe and other measures to squeeze Putin could be included. <br> In short, Fiorina is the only true outsider who can credibly appeal to the mainstream elements of her party. Her fundraising total will get her even more attention. With concrete domestic policy programs and creative foreign policy plans, including a blueprint for international economic leadership, she could further enhance her chances. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> We have long argued that Jeb Bush’s big challenge would not be ideological, since he is a very conservative reformer. Despite his difficulties as a campaigner (which we have said would be the real test), his ideological preferences have been reinforced by a series of conservative policies — government reform (including shrinking government by attrition), tax reform (pro-growth, more fiscally responsible than some others), and now healthcare. <br> In New Hampshire’s Union Leader (emphasizing the importance of the state to Bush), he writes of his aim is to make healthcare center “around individuals, and enable innovation to make care more accessible, convenient, personal and affordable.” He then lists the components: <br> His tax credit system — available to all Americans — eliminates the steep marginal tax rate for those who leave Obamacare and find work. As a defined contribution plan it has the benefit of forcing individuals to look for value and thereby reduce healthcare costs. The plan was warmly greeted by a number of conservative healthcare mavens, in part because it essentially follows a previously release plan from the 2017 Project. <br> It has yet to be scored, but it eliminates the bevy of taxes imposed by Obamacare and removes the compulsory individual mandate, two main targets of Obamacare’s conservative critics. The campaign shows some deftness in releasing the plan on the same day as the Democratic debate, when the two liberal frontrunners will attempt to outdo one another in their proposals to grow the welfare state. <br> The plan raises a few issues. <br> First, it is almost inconceivable that the GOP House did not already vote on something like this, especially since it closely resembles the plan put forth by Rep. Tom Price (R-Tex.), who is seeking the majority leader post. If Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) takes the speakership he could very well rally the House around a Jeb Bush/2017 Project/Price health-care alternative. Rather than fight among themselves House Republicans might actually accomplish something, setting the table effectively for the 2016 election. <br> Second, the plan highlights why, for all his difficulties, Bush remains a top tier candidate. It is not simply the stash of money — although that helps — but the policy acumen and record of reform that he boasts, and which no other candidate in the race can match. If he can raise the level of his game, especially in the next two debates that are to focus on the economy, and win or come close in New Hampshire (by far his best shot before the Florida primary) his long game may pay off. <br> Third, the plan — along with other Republican proposals put forth  over the last few years — are a response to the inevitable general election attack from Democrats: The GOP is not offering anything. When Republicans show what they are for — modernizing government, relying more on markets than on compulsion, taxing less — they offer a stark contrast to the elderly Democratic candidates whose policy perspectives haven’t changed in 40 years. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Believe it or not, the Freedom Caucus is not in the driver’s seat in the speaker’s race. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) remains in office, and therefore the grownups hold the cards. Without a new speaker, the old one remains. If they want someone other than Boehner, someone they like better, it is they who need to bargain. <br> Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has become the hands-down choice for the job neither he nor many other competent members want. Realizing he is the alternative to Boehner finishing out the current Congress, he should consent to stand for speaker under a number of conditions: <br> 1. If it is not unanimous, he won’t serve. This is the first responsibility of conscientious members — electing a leader. He is not going to have dissenters, no matter how small they may be, out there whining that he is not their choice. <br> 2. There are no more rebels on the Rules Committee. This is a parliamentary tool that leadership must control. When a decision is reached, they go along. <br> 3. He will wide berth to offer amendments, but when urgent matters must be accomplished (e.g., the debt ceiling) he will go to Democrats if need be. Republicans can either get on board or see the bills become more accommodating toward the minority party. <br> 4. An Obamacare replacement bill will come to the floor and there will be a vote. <br> 5. A tax reform bill will come to the floor and there will be a vote. <br> 6. Given the impossibility of passage, he will not bring up immigration until there is a GOP president. <br> 7. There are no more challenges to the speakership for the balance of Congress. <br> The Freedom Caucus does not like this? Well, the minority of the majority is not running the show. If they don’t like it, Boehner remains. That’s actually a fine solution in my mind, for obvious reasons (e.g., he is sane, he can — if need be — get Democrats to vote to keep the government open). Alternatively, the Freedom Caucus can find someone else, but that someone else should demand the same measure of control described above. <br> The search for consensus is futile so long as the Freedom Caucus wants anarchy. It’s time to call their bluff. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie seem to be moving in opposite directions where it matters most. Nationally both are in low single-digits just above the cut-off for the top tier debate at the end of the month. That’s where the similarity ends, however. <br> Kasich started strongly in July, had a good first debate and then began sliding in the polls. Currently at only 6 percent in the latest poll from must-win New Hampshire he has lost half his support in roughly two months even while advertising in the state. Christie, by contrast, has bumped up to 7 percent in New Hampshire, where he is concentrating most of his energies. Even in his home state of Ohio, he is in third, running ten points behind Donald Trump, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll. <br> Moreover, Kasich now spends a good deal of his time either “clarifying” comments about Iran (he wants to police the deal) or the sequester (he’s against it but refuses to say how much more, if any, he would give the defense department). What was a positive message of inclusion and concern for the poor has morphed into holier-than-thou hectoring in which he questions critics’ religiosity. <br> On Tuesday in defense of his expansion of Medicaid he fumed, “Look at Medicaid expansion! Do you know how many people are yelling at me? I go to events where people yell at me. You know what I tell em? I mean, God bless ’em, I’m telling them a little bit better than this, there’s a book, it’s got a new part and an old part,  they put it together. It’s a remarkable book. If you don’t have one, I’ll buy you one, and it talks about how we treat the poor. Sometimes you just have to lead.” Way to win them over, governor. (The remark was reminiscent of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s accusation that those who did not agree with him on immigration lacked a heart.) It is that brusqueness and dismissive attitude toward critics that’s turned off donors and political allies in the past. <br> The contrast between the two candidates is stark. <br> Kasich gets in more words per minute than any candidate. In a stream of consciousness his words pour forth, creating uncertainty as to where the sentences are heading and what his policy point actually is. For all his Ohio accomplishments he has not laid out clear national policies with the exception of the balanced budget gimmick (how one is going to get there is the problem, of course). In an anti-insider year, he’s selling a straight diet of government experience. He failed in his second debate to convey a sense of command and was left out of the rat-tat-tat exchanges among Jeb Bush, Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina. In sum, he is not wearing well. <br> Christie, however,  has laid out a robust agenda with specific proposals on entitlement and tax reform, foreign policy (considerably more hawkish than Kasich), regulation and energy. He is relaxed and sharp on policy in news interviews and entertainment settings like his Tonight Show outing. He has had two strong debate performances. While he does not lack for candor the former prosecutor makes his arguments forcefully and focuses on the issue at hand. He previously carried the “bully” tag, but compared to Donald Trump he seems positively tame these days. <br> It is easy for liberals to paint Kasich as odd man out in the GOP because he talks about the poor and embraces energetic government. Still, that does not explain how Christie (who also expanded Medicaid and is a moderate Northeastern Republican) is getting traction. In fact the explanation boils down to a simple but overlooked truism: Better candidates beat worse candidates. Funny, relaxed contenders usually beat prickly, defensive ones. <br> This does not mean Christie is going to work his way into the top tier anytime soon. That, if it occurs, will take even stronger debate performances, money, organization and competitors’ self-destruction. He nevertheless seems to be moving in the right direction. In the meantime Kasich appears to be less and less a threat to contenders vying for moderate voters. Things can change quickly in this race to be sure, but for now Christie is by far the more impressive of the two. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Michael R. Bloomberg was mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013. Margaret Chan is director-general of the World Health Organization. <br> For the first time, the global sustainable-development goals being negotiated at the United Nations treat tobacco use — and the chronic diseases it causes — as a development issue. It’s long overdue. <br> Around the world, about 6 million people die every year from a tobacco-related disease. That’s one person every six seconds, or 10 every minute. By 2030, 8 million people are expected to die each year from tobacco use — and 80 percent of those deaths will occur in developing countries. In the United States alone, smoking-related illnesses result in $170 billion in annual medical spending. <br> The cause of these problems — tobacco sales — can also contribute to their solution. The tobacco industry, which generates more than $35 billion in profits annually, should bear the costs it inflicts upon society. And there is a straightforward way to ensure that it does: taxation. Why, after all, should governments effectively subsidize tobacco companies by picking up the tab for the health-care costs they generate? <br> Increasing taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products has mostly been a strategy for reducing usage — and it has proved incredibly successful. The evidence is clear that raising tobacco taxes cuts use, encourages smokers to quit and discourages young people from starting. In fact, the most price-sensitive demographic for tobacco use is young people, who tend to have less disposable income than their elders. Low-income populations are also sensitive to price increases, making taxes especially effective in poorer countries where tobacco use is rising fast. <br> Those same countries also have the greatest need for better health-care services. In addition to reducing the burdens on health-care systems, tobacco taxes can help countries absorb the huge costs imposed by tobacco usage. Fortunately, governments have begun waking up to the idea that tobacco taxes provide an opportunity to achieve both of those critical goals: reducing use and raising revenue. In South Africa, France and New Zealand, tobacco taxes have helped cut use and provided funding for health care. <br> In 2012, the Philippines passed its landmark Sin Tax reform law. This legislation, which increased tax rates on low-priced cigarettes by more than 300 percent, generates revenue for the country’s universal health-care insurance program. By 2014, these funds had helped the government subsidize the health-insurance premiums of approximately half the population. <br> The tobacco industry, of course, rejects the idea that it should pay for the long-term health costs its products generate, and it is working hard, directly and through front groups, to persuade governments to go easy on the taxes. If any other consumer product were known to kill one in two of its users, there would be calls on governments to ban it. Yet in much of the world, tobacco is only lightly regulated and taxed. <br> This is despite the fact that tobacco taxes have already been formally endorsed by governments representing 90 percent of the world’s people, through a legally binding global treaty — the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control — as an important and effective means to reduce tobacco consumption. The treaty even provides guidelines for governments to put in place or strengthen tobacco taxes. <br> If the primary role of government is to protect lives — and we believe it is — then tobacco taxes are an essential tool. The United Nations should encourage countries to raise tobacco taxes to support the world’s development goals and reduce tobacco use. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> The Post’s View: Raise the smoking age to 21 <br> George F.

 Philip K. Howard is chair of Common Good and author of “The Rule of Nobody.” <br> Most Americans believe that government is broken. So it’s hardly surprising that outsiders Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are doing well in the Republican nominating contest. They represent a break from the status quo. Trump especially stands out because he’s so colorfully disdainful of almost everything and everyone in government. <br> But voters should pause before placing their hopes in the personality of a strong person at the top: It will not work if he or she doesn’t have a coherent plan to unclog the gears of the government machinery underneath. <br> Remember that presidential candidate Barack Obama was a fresh face, brilliant on the stump and promising “change we can believe in.” Yet as soon as Obama took office, he got bogged down in the viscous bureaucracy. Even after winning congressional support for using economic stimulus funding to rebuild the United States’ decrepit infrastructure, he could barely move. There turned out to be no such thing as a “shovel-ready project” because the president, though duly elected, had no authority to escape from the legal goo of required studies, permits and processes. <br> Trump’s appeal is based on candor and power. He says he’ll start making decisions; no more pussy-footing around. Trump, in so many words, will make the trains run on time. <br> But how, exactly? He can’t ignore the law. The president is shackled by decades of accumulated statutes and regulations. He can’t say, “You’re fired!” That would violate civil service laws. He won’t be able to do almost anything he thinks he can. <br> The disappointment surrounding recent presidents is not due (mainly) to defects in their leadership qualities but to their failure to address the structural paralysis of modern government. George Washington couldn’t run the government today. Sensible actions are usually illegal. <br> Getting permits for infrastructure projects can take a decade. So can Food and Drug Administration approvals. Obsolete programs such as New Deal farm and labor subsidies live on forever, adding to the red ink burdening our children. The World Bank Group ranks the United States 46th in the world in ease of starting a business. Year after year, the bureaucracy grows ever larger, weighing down citizens with more rules and forms. <br> Washington doesn’t just need new leadership. It needs a vision for how to unstick the gears. That should be the main focus of the current presidential campaign, not Planned Parenthood or some other hot-button issue. Last week, Jeb Bush released a report calling for a radical simplification and updating of the regulatory state (including some ideas I proposed to him). There’s plenty in the report for other candidates to take issue with, but Bush has made a responsible contribution to the debate we need. His report says that “Americans in schools, hospitals, and small businesses — even within government itself — are tangled up in red tape that makes no sense to them or anyone else.” It calls for a shift in the current philosophy of regulation toward simpler structures that liberate Americans’ common sense. It offers concrete ways to get there, including streamlining authority to approve new infrastructure and creating “an independent commission to conduct a regulatory spring cleaning.” <br> Other candidates should rise to Bush’s challenge. What’s needed is not political grandstanding, but competing visions of how to fix our broken government. <br> The United States is at a perilous point. When democracies lose the ability to deliver basic services, the ancient Greek historian Polybius observed, the public gives up on democratic governance and reaches for a “monarchic master” who promises everything to everyone. When such leaders have taken over throughout history, it has rarely ended happily. <br> There’s little disagreement about the ineffectiveness of Washington. But where’s the vision of how to fix the problem? To paraphrase Yogi Berra, if you don’t know where you’re going, you might end up somewhere else. <br> Read more on this topic: <br> Philip K.

 “I don’t want to leave my successor a dirty barn,” John Boehner, the soon-to-depart speaker of the House, told CBS News’s John Dickerson. “I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets there.” <br> Heaven knows, there’s lots of shoveling to do. Boehner’s resignation, and the month until it takes effect, offers the prospect — albeit a slim one — for a mini-grand bargain to let the government function more effectively until after the presidential election. Boehner would do his successor, his party and the country a huge favor if he were to do the necessary mucking. <br> The bargain that’s in the realm of the possible is far from the sort of broad agreement on spending and entitlements that Boehner and President Obama envisioned in 2012. That deal entailed politically risky moves by both sides — for Democrats, raising the Medicare eligibility age and reducing cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients, along with huge spending cuts; for Republicans, acceding to $800 billion in new taxes. <br> That moment is gone. Some of the tax revenue was achieved in the 2013 fiscal cliff deal; some of the cuts were imposed through the clumsy mechanism of the sequester, which now requires undoing. <br> Meanwhile, there’s no time, or energy, for something as complex as tax reform. Once Boehner could have overseen an overhaul of immigration laws had he been willing to rely on Democratic votes; now, that would be irrelevant because support for immigration reform has evaporated among Senate Republicans who once approved it. <br> And so, my proposed mini-bargain does not resolve long-term concerns. Instead, it would put a Band-Aid — or, more likely, a series of Band-Aids — on shorter-term problems: setting spending levels to prevent a repetition of shutdown politics until after the election; avoiding the threat of default as the debt ceiling once again looms; replenishing the depleted and about-to-expire Highway Trust Fund; reauthorizing the lapsed Export-Import Bank; extending expiring tax breaks. <br> In other words, accomplishing what ought to be congressional business as usual, but what has become, in the current toxic atmosphere, a series of heavy, if not impossible, lifts. <br> The easiest path would be for Boehner simply to avert the worst of the worst and pass a short-term spending bill to avoid having the government shut down over federal funding for Planned Parenthood. That still leaves an awfully messy barn. <br> Boehner’s urge to do more is not only commendable — it’s achievable, in part if not entirely. After all, there is another chamber to contend with, one that requires 60 votes to act. That complicates even a simple vote to raise the debt ceiling; more elaborate endeavors, such as a funding bill that lasts beyond the current target date of Dec. 11, might not be achievable within the time remaining. <br> But if Boehner wants to leave on a note of statesmanship, he has to be willing, in a way he has not been previously, to rile up the ultraconservatives whose resistance to reason and basic arithmetic propelled him to leave. <br> Boehner has, on occasion, deviated from the so-called Hastert rule and relied on votes from the minority to pass legislation, including the fiscal cliff deal, Hurricane Sandy relief, the Violence Against Women Act and the debt-ceiling increase. But I am told that Boehner, while eager to broker a deal, is reluctant to act without the backing of a significant share of his caucus. He would bring a mini-grand bargain to the floor (as a whole or in individual pieces) with a minority of the majority, but not so small that it could threaten the incipient speakership of his likely successor, Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). <br> The way for Boehner to assemble more Republican support would be to argue that conservatives were getting something in exchange — for example, a change in the method of calculating cost-of-living increases known as chained CPI. But Obama may have neither the inclination nor the juice to persuade congressional Democrats to accept that controversial change. <br> On inclination, the administration and congressional Democrats calculate, correctly, that Republicans are the ones with more to lose in fights over the debt ceiling and a government shutdown. On juice, Democrats in Congress have already acceded to Obama on the Iran deal and trade promotion authority. It’s not likely they would follow Obama off the chained CPI cliff. <br> In other words: Pray for a bargain. But keep the shovel handy. <br> Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> The Post’s View: Mr. Boehner’s resignation is a political cop-out <br> Dana Milbank: Boehner didn’t have a prayer <br> Jonathan Capehart: Speaker Boehner leaves the House in disorder <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Like its author, Donald Trump’s tax plan suffers from intellectual incoherence and false advertising. He bills it as a populist plan to get the rich. It is not. <br> The basics are standard GOP fare. He reduces rates (to 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent) and keeps carried interest taxed as regular income (as does Jeb Bush). Trump’s top marginal rate is lower than some (e.g., Bush has 28 percent) and equal to others (Sen. Marco Rubio’s is also at 25 percent). In other words, purists who don’t like any tax hike won’t like how his proposal affects a sliver of the rich (hedge fund managers). Populists, however, will not like his plan, like all others with significant cuts to the top marginal tax rate. It will benefit the rich. In the last debate, he praised the progressive code; this plan does not reflect that philosophy. It is a shame he did not experiment with a tax plan that does NOT give the rich a big break (e.g., keep marginal tax rate where it is). Had he done so it would have made for an interesting debate. Instead the plan is more of the same. <br> On the corporate side, he reduces the rate from 35 to 15 percent and reduces capital gains to 20 percent. <br> In some respects, his plan is less growth-oriented than some plans. Americans for Tax Reform notes he does not go to a territorial tax system, thereby failing to eliminate the double taxation problem. (However, with a lower corporate rate, the problem is reduced somewhat.) ATR is more concerned about another missing feature: <br> The most disappointing part of the Trump plan is that the tax system would move no closer to full expensing of business fixed investment. Businesses would still be saddled with the complex, distorting, and growth-inhibiting “depreciation” regime where an asset is deducted over several or even many years. Far better would be to move to a full-expensing business cash flow model, where all business inputs including investments are deducted in the year spent. While this is somewhat ameliorated by the far lower tax rates, a lack of progress here is the plan’s biggest drawback. <br> Trump is hyping elements (e.g., removing lower-income taxpayers from the rolls) that are not unique to him. He is exaggerating any populist shift. This, in short, is a GOP plan with less growth. He makes no effort to explain how he will make up for the lost revenue under his plan. As with so much else he does, there is a lot less here than meets the eye. Perhaps, if credulous journalists do not, his opponents at the next debate will point out his contradictions and puffery. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 HOUSE SPEAKER John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) insisted on Friday that he was resigning in order to forestall a tough vote on his leadership and “protect the institution” of the House. Protecting the institution, he said, is a speaker’s primary job. We respect his devotion. But a speaker’s primary responsibility is to the nation, not the House. And what the nation needs is a Congress willing to make compromises in the national interest — compromises that Mr. Boehner may have favored but rarely had the stomach to promote. <br> From the start, Mr. Boehner seemed like a Republican leader for a different time, when serious policy could be hashed out in relative comity, over a drink and a smoke. The leadership challenge he was handed didn’t demand deal-making skills as much as it required creating the space for deal-making to happen in the first place. That, in turn, depended on sidelining an insurgent right wing that has made the House dangerously incapable of compromise on major policy questions, except in the most pressing of circumstances. Instead, Mr. Boehner ultimately decided to sideline himself. <br> It’s hard to know if someone else would have been — or will be — more effective managing a House with a bloc of Republicans who are more sensitive to the ideological preferences of their partisan districts than to the needs of the nation. What’s clear is that a loud faction in Mr. Boehner’s GOP caucus seems as hostile as ever to the process of governing in a democracy. The House will not deliver much until its leaders allow a simple majority — of Republicans and Democrats — to vote on budgeting, immigration and other crucial issues. Mr. Boehner was loath to call votes when he might need to rely on Democrats. The result was to hand the reins to the extremists. <br> We don’t minimize the political risks of taking on the extremes, which will fight to keep their stranglehold on the legislature. But the way the House currently operates is bad for the country. <br> There is a long list of policies that reasonable people of both parties know Congress has to tackle. First, the government must be funded. Mr. Boehner’s departure at best buys the country a few weeks, forestalling a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding. Once it approves a temporary spending resolution, Congress must lift the unsustainable funding caps that shortchange both military and social programs. Later this year, Congress must raise the debt ceiling. Given the projected growth of the old-age entitlement programs, Congress needs to secure them with targeted reforms that don’t hurt the needy and that help, along with tax reform, to deliver the revenue needed to pay for the government Americans expect. The nation needs comprehensive immigration reform that trades border security for a pathway to legalization for the undocumented. It needs to invest in its infrastructure and research. And so on. <br> There was a moment, during President Obama’s first term, when he and the speaker might have delivered compromise in the national interest. Neither ultimately had the courage to challenge his own party’s orthodoxy, the moment passed and Mr. Boehner hunkered down in a way that protected his job without getting much done. It’s too soon to know whether his departure will offer another opportunity; what’s certain is that the need is no less. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Dana Milbank: Boehner didn’t have a prayer <br> Jennifer Rubin: Boehner’s act of selflessness in stepping down as speaker <br> Jonathan Capehart: Speaker Boehner leaves the House in disorder <br> Alexandra Petri: The one time John Boehner wasn’t crying <br> Ann Telnaes: Speaker Boehner to exit Congress, with a little help from his ‘friends’ <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) announced today he will step down at the end of October. Facing a revolt from the unhinged segment of his caucus, he extracted a pledge to at least keep the government open. <br> In an era of egomaniacs and fire-breathing rabble-rousers, this was an act of uncommon grace and selflessness. Sparing the country a shutdown and his party a calamity, he chose to remove himself from the scene. In that regard, he epitomized the essence of public service. <br> Truth be told, no other responsible leader could have or will please the crazed tea party segment for whom governing is an annoyance and posturing is the objective. There is no reasoning with a couple dozen members of the House who refuse to recognize that a party out of the White House cannot control the government or unilaterally set the agenda. <br> We wound up at this juncture in large part because of cynical manipulators in talk radio and in groups such as Heritage Action who make money and attract attention by stirring the pot. For them, disruption for the sake of unattainable principle is the mechanism. Self-promotion is their goal. <br> If Boehner had one fault, it was in excessively accommodating the backbenchers as he did during the 2013 shutdown. Perhaps ruling with a tighter grip would have backfired, but responsible leaders sometimes need to force their own side to take a vote and/or go to the other side to make an end-run around obstructionists. <br> A new leader should push the caucus to advance a reform-minded agenda.  The House should move a tax-reform bill and health-care alternative to the floor. It may have the effect of unifying the conference behind conservative goals and setting the table for 2016. <br> I do not expect any responsible speaker can satisfy the far right. If Republicans and the country as a whole are lucky, Boehner’s successor will learn to corral them and direct their energies to more productive ends. Boehner’s foes are dancing on his speakership’s grave, but the country and party were fortunate to have him at a dangerous and critical time in history. Good luck to his successor. Heaven knows he will need it. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> You can’t fire me, John Boehner just told House Republicans, because I quit! <br> Amid yet more talk about a coup by ultra-conservative Republicans looking to replace him with one of their own — talk that has emerged seemingly every few months since he became Speaker of the House after the 2010 election — Boehner has finally decided to pack it in. And he’s not even waiting until his term runs out; instead, he’ll retire from Congress next month, presumably to become a spectacularly well-remunerated lobbyist. <br> Even Boehner’s most stalwart allies would have trouble arguing that his tenure was anything other than a failure. But the question is, how much of it was Boehner’s fault? Was he in an impossible situation from which no speaker could have wrung much success, or was he just terrible at his job? <br> The answer, I’d submit, is both. Boehner’s circumstances made success somewhere between unlikely and impossible. But along the way, he proved himself incapable of changing that situation in any way, seeming to make the worst of every crisis and showdown. <br> Let’s look at Boehner’s accomplishments in his nearly five years as speaker. Well, there’s…um…hmm. Can you think of any? <br> Conservatives might say that by joining with Mitch McConnell in a strategy of total and complete opposition to this administration, he helped stop Barack Obama from doing some things Obama might otherwise have done. Or I suppose one might argue that he limited the damage members of his own party could do to the country. Despite threatening to shut down the government more times than you can count, there was only one actual shutdown, in 2013. And we didn’t default on our debt by not raising the debt ceiling, which would have been catastrophic. <br> But that’s not much of a record of success. Boehner can’t say that he achieved any conservative ideological goals. But he did hold 50-odd votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is just about the opposite of a substantive achievement. <br> Granted, when your party doesn’t hold the White House, you aren’t going to be passing significant legislation to accomplish your own objectives. But you still might work with the other party to get some things done. That has happened in the past — legislative leaders have worked with a president of the other party to do big things like tax reform. But not anymore. <br> You also might mold your caucus into a unified force of strategic opposition, not just making the president’s life difficult but setting the stage for a successful wave of legislation the next time you do have control of both the legislative and executive branches. That’s what Nancy Pelosi succeeded in doing when George W. Bush was president, in advance of the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006. But Boehner couldn’t do that either — his speakership was spent fighting with members of his own party, and each successive crisis only made them look less and less serious. <br> From the beginning, Boehner may have been ill-suited to the historical moment. He was an old-school pol, the kind who favored hashing out deals over cigars and whiskey, but he was elevated to the speakership in a revolution fueled by anger, resentment, and distrust of party leaders. He spent his time as speaker trying constantly to mollify a group of unreasonable members for whom any compromise was betrayal, and the idea of strategically avoiding a confrontation today to put yourself in a better position tomorrow was just too sophisticated for them to wrap their heads around. They’re a group of bomb-throwers and lectern-pounders, who (like their mentor Ted Cruz) think that “standing up to Obama” is a substantive accomplishment in and of itself to be proud of. <br> That’s not to mention the fact that the rightward drift of the Republican Party, particularly in Boehner’s House, has made strategic action in the party’s long-term interest virtually impossible. The best example is immigration, where everyone including Boehner acknowledged that the party needed to pass comprehensive reform in order to prove to Hispanic voters that the GOP was not hostile to them. But it couldn’t happen because so many in Boehner’s caucus are ultra-conservative members who hail from conservative districts where they need only fear a challenge from the right. So they don’t want comprehensive reform, and neither do their constituents. <br> Could a more skilled speaker have found a way out of that conundrum? It’s hard to see how, other than the obvious way: by passing reform using a combination of votes from Democrats and sane Republicans. This was the option Boehner faced again and again on funding the government, and he only took it when things reached the point of crisis. Every time, observers wondered if it would lead to a revolt that would displace him as speaker, but his saving grace turned out to be that the job was so miserable that nobody else wanted it. <br> It’s still unclear how Boehner’s announcement will affect the current shutdown crisis we’re approaching, but since he no longer has to worry about his job, he may just bring it to a quick conclusion by throwing the conservatives some meaningless bone of a symbolic vote on Planned Parenthood, then putting a clean continuing resolution up to a vote (that seems to be the direction they’re moving). The CR would probably pass with Democratic support, and then doomsday could be avoided for a while, with Boehner’s replacement left to enact the next iteration of this absurd ritual once the CR runs out. <br> It would, in its way, be a fitting end to the Boehner speakership: a needless crisis driven by ultra-conservative members Boehner can’t control, finally resolved — but only temporarily — in a way that leads those members to call him a traitor and sets the stage for yet another crisis before long. <br> Can anyone blame him for wanting to get the hell out? <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> Yesterday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sat down to talk with Right Turn about a range of topics. Part 1 can be found here. In the remainder of the interview, he talked about his message in the presidential race and his domestic policy initiatives. <br> Christie is one of several candidates to put forth a tax plan. Like many GOP proposals, he would lower rates (with the top marginal rate at 28 percent), limit deductions and reduce the corporate tax (to 25 percent). Because of our progressive tax system, the rich would still pay more but the dollar savings to the rich would be substantial. Is he worried about liberals playing the class warfare card? “I don’t think so,” he says. ” What people want to know is if it is fair. They think the tax code is rigged in favor of the rich, and it is. I will get rid of all exemptions but two, the mortgage and charitable ones that many middle-class people use.” He continues, “Everyone pays less. People care about if the rich are paying their fair share. They will have the 28 percent rate but [virtually] no deductions nor loopholes. People will feel like the wealthy are paying their fair share.” <br> I asked him if he thinks some of the issues — the Confederate battle flag, the gay marriage ruling, etc. — have become overblown as opponents try to pander to the voters. “Well, it depends on what issue,” he says. “I think we should have a robust discussion on religious liberty. People want to see it protected.” On the issue of Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, he strikes a practical note. “Have the deputy clerks issue the licenses,” he suggests. Davis can keep her religious objections, Christie argues, but the licenses will still need to be issued. <br> On other issues, he is dismissive of his opponents. Dr. Ben Carson recently asserted that Muslims shouldn’t be president. (He subsequently walked his remarks back a bit.) “You know who should be president?” Christie asks. “Whoever the people elect, not who Dr. Carson thinks.” He recalls the 2000 election when George W. Bush won the electoral vote (barely) but lost the popular vote. “We have a way of electing the president. He wins; he’s president,” he says. <br> Does he think the voters will sour on the demagogic candidates? “People want you to be authentic,” he says, before they decide whether they like what you are saying. “What they are much more offended by is someone giving their talking points. That is part of [Donald] Trump’s appeal. But it’s a two-part analysis. Then they are going to ask if what you think is good for the country.” That said, Christie is clearly selling his experience and a set of concrete policy ideas. “After the experience of Obama, I don’t think people are going to elect a talker. The doers will triumph over the talkers.” As for the government shutdown, he opposed the move in 2013 and would oppose one now. “It is always a failure to govern if you shut down the government,” he says. <br> We then turned to the topic of judges. Christie got to know now-Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito because they both had served as U.S. attorney. Christie, who often refers to Alito as his ideal justice, says, “I was over the moon when he got appointed. There is no flash there. . . . He understands the role of the judiciary.” He described his own process: “First I get a look at everything they have written publicly — decisions, periodicals, law review articles,” he tells me. “Then I interview them. I don’t ask them how they’d rule on a specific case. No self-respecting judge would answer. I do get at the role of the judiciary.” And finally, he’ll send his staff out to talk to those who have worked with or appeared before the nominee. <br> In the most recent debate, there was a vigorous discussion about drug legalization. As governor, Christie has taken the lead in setting up drug courts to order rehabilitation rather than incarceration. It’s an issue he sounds passionate about and has worked on since his days in county government. “We see the results. The recidivism rate if you go to jail is 62 percent. If you go to a one-year rehabilitation, it is 16 percent.” He continues, “To me it is so obvious it is a disease. We need to put in jail the dealers, violent people. But over 50 percent of our prison population is nonviolent drug offenders.” He explains, “It costs $49,000 a year to keep you in jail. For one year of rehabilitation it costs $24,000. Even if you are a cold-hearted accountant, it makes sense.” He says saving the lives of those trapped in a cycle of addiction is part of being pro-life. “You need to be pro-life for the whole life. When you get out [i.e., are born] it gets complicated!” <br> One of Christie’s main initiatives as governor has been school reform. The state took over both the Newark and Camden schools. In Newark, Christie vastly expanded charter schools. “And there is still a waiting list,” he notes. “This wasn’t me pushing it. This was to meet parent demand.” However, he concedes progress has been slow there compared with Camden, where the mayor and city officials have been supportive of the effort. He says politicians know what needs to be done. He ticks through the list: “No tenure. Get rid of mandatory union dues. Extend the school day and the school year. More charter schools.” And in New Jersey, he’d redo the funding formula, which, under court rulings, currently sends 63 percent of state education funds to just 30 of about 600 districts. <br> On other issues, he argues that while people think as a blue-state governor he must be liberal, he is within the conservative mainstream. On entitlements, he made a sweeping proposal but acknowledges some Republicans don’t want to change Social Security. “I’m the only one telling them the truth,” he says of the demographic reality affecting retirement funds. “On abortion, I’m for three exceptions — rape, incest and life of the mother. It was good enough for Ronald Reagan.” On the Second Amendment, he contends that Democratic predecessors layer restriction over restriction. “I vetoed the ban on 50-caliber rifles. I vetoed the limit on magazines. I vetoed the state ID card. I want to enforce the laws against criminals.” <br> Christie remains confident about his prospects and is emphatic he’s not going anywhere. “I can assure Washington Post readers [of that],” he says. Few doubt Christie will grow weary of the fight. For him, however, the challenge is sticking around to get the voters’ attention and support when others fall by the wayside. Few pundits think he’ll win the nomination, but then virtually none of them thought Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker would leave before George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> During a brief swing through Washington, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) sat down with Right Turn. He was relaxed and jovial, not appearing disturbed by the National Guard flap back home or his low poll ratings in the presidential race. <br> As Christie said, “There are really two parts to the National Guard [controversy].” As to the first — allegations of poor morale, cronyism and racism — he said, “The National Guard got great reviews during [hurricane] Sandy.” He continued, “I’m waiting for Matt [Boxer] to come back with his report. I’ve not seen a morale issue, but I don’t want to be prejudging it.” While whistle-blower complaints surfaced earlier in the year, Christie insists he promptly appointed Boxer, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, and intends to “let him have the time to take a look” at the facts. The second part of the flap concerns guard commander Air Force Brig. Gen. Michael L. Cunniff, who has been reprimanded by the Air Force for his weight, something Christie was not told about. “I’m disappointed Mike didn’t tell me.” Some have criticized Christie for giving Cunniff another 90 days. “I’ve struggled with my weight,” Christie said, adding that Cunniff must get squared away with the Air Force. “This isn’t my rule; it’s the Air Force’s.” The National Guard flap, critics say, is another knock against Christie’s management, but he appeared unruffled by another story of New Jersey intrigue. <br> As for the presidential race, he is dismissive of early poll numbers. “I think we are making progress,” said Christie, whose debate performances have been favorably reviewed. “Listen, we got the whole NFL season — and the playoffs!” he said with a grin. “This is just week two.” <br> Christie, like the other contenders, has had to deal with Donald Trump and his virtual media monopoly, but Christie, who has known Trump for more than a decade, generally avoids taking him on. I asked whether he would feel comfortable with Trump as commander in chief, with his finger on the nuclear button. “I wouldn’t be worried. I will say I’d be better,” he offered. “Listen, I don’t think he is crazy. I’ve known him a long time. But this is not a crazy person who is going to get up on the wrong side of the bed [to nuke an enemy]. He wouldn’t do anything to intentionally harm the country. . . . But who you see on the stage is who he is. I’m much better qualified by temperament and what I’m saying I am going to do [on foreign policy].” If it ever comes down to the two of them, Christie said, we’ll surely hear more about his take on Trump. <br> Christie’s take on the electorate is that there is “distrust of Washington, D.C., politicians.” The candidates running now, he said, “all get painted with a broad brush.” He said he understands the frustration. We have had a Democratic House and Senate with President Obama, then a GOP House and next a GOP Senate, and yet still voters don’t see progress on big issues. “They want someone strong in charge,” he said. On the trail and in interviews, he’s been outspoken about the failure of Congress to put bills on the president’s desk on tax reform, an Obamacare alternative and Planned Parenthood defunding. As for the filibuster, he accuses Republicans running in 2014 of a “bait and switch,” essentially promising to get things done and then refusing to get rid of the filibuster. “Yeah, I’d do away with the filibuster,” he said. “They won’t do it because they’re afraid they’ll be back in the minority.” <br> On foreign affairs, Christie seems to have immersed himself in the complexities of the Middle East. He said, “We don’t have a choice to pick where to start.” He suggests a “multifaceted” approach and accuses Obama of gross mismanagement. “Not only has he messed up the entire Middle East, but he permitted [Russian President Vladimir] Putin in the door.” He said that Russia was essentially boxed out of the Middle East after the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Christie said the two largest mistakes have been the Iran deal and letting the Russians worm their way back into Syria. “I fear he wants to get in bed with Iran and into an alliance with Syria and Russia against ISIS,” he said, echoing the fears of many outside experts. “They are ‘perplexed’ [about Russian intentions],” he said in an exasperated tone. “They are either lying or stupid.” He said that upon taking office he’d sit down with each of our Arab allies and Israel to discuss their needs and assure them of American leadership. He said we should be arming, training and giving air cover to allied forces. However, in the end if we need U.S. troops, he said we would need to proceed. <br> As for the Iran deal, he differs with Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who simply want to police the deal. “No, we can’t live with the deal. They’ll have violated the deal multiple times by the time I get there.” If we can’t get allies to snap back the sanctions, he said the United States would do so on its own. “It will take American leadership. I don’t think it’s a question of ‘if’ [we get rid of the deal] but ‘how.’ ” <br> Christie said he is the “most tested” candidate in the race and also has been the most specific in laying out proposals — on taxes, entitlements, etc. He is clear about his economic objective: “Growth is the highest priority. I’m the only person with an entitlement reform plan, but we’re not going to cut our way out of debt. Growth is a top priority. We need to get to 4 percent growth. That’s one thing I agree with Jeb Bush on.” <br> Tomorrow in Part 2, Christie talks about his domestic policy ideas and how he stacks up against the “talkers” in the race. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 THE FEDERAL government’s authority to spend money on discretionary programs expires at midnight on Sept. 30 — just a week from Wednesday . As we write, no one can be sure that Congress will pass a law keeping the government funded beyond that date and thereby enable it to avoid a partial shutdown. In the Senate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) reportedly has a plan that would permit his caucus to stage a symbolic vote against Planned Parenthood without risking a shutdown. The bigger problem is in the House, where Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) is struggling — once again — to rein in far-right conservatives who are willing to pass a funding bill only if it reflects their priorities, in this case, by “defunding” Planned Parenthood. That is, they prefer grandstanding, on behalf of a cause most Americans don’t support, to governing the country. <br> Dysfunctional as this situation is, it’s only the prelude to a series of potential impasses, of which the next will be the need to replace the current short-term transportation bill, which expires Oct. 30. Not long after that, the government will hit its $18.15 trillion debt limit, followed, on Dec. 31, by the expiration of about 50 special tax breaks, such as those for wind energy or state and local tax payments — worth about $40 billion. Obviously, getting over these hurdles would be a modest feat compared with the passage of timely appropriations bills and tax reform, which would represent actual policymaking but are probably beyond Congress’s capability given the polarization of Washington. <br> The leader best positioned to spare us this season of costly uncertainty is Mr. Boehner. Yes, President Obama makes the task harder by insisting on “dollar for dollar” equality in increases in domestic and military spending, contrary to most Republicans’ preferences. And, yes, a lot of the chaos in the House is beyond Mr. Boehner’s control, in that it reflects pressure on the GOP caucus from a party base gripped by the delusion that the majority they sent to Congress should have been able to shift policy far to the right despite Mr. Obama’s veto power. <br> Still, as Mr. Boehner himself undoubtedly realizes, the ultras in his caucus are not only acting contrary to the national interest, but they are also acting contrary to the Republican Party’s own long-term political interest. By demonstrating the impossibility of overcoming a Democratic filibuster on defunding Planned Parenthood, Mr. McConnell’s plan may help House holdouts see reason. If it does not, however, the speaker must guarantee continued government funding, even if it means passing a bill with support of Democrats. No doubt that might trigger an internal rebellion and put his speakership at risk. A leader would take the chance. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> E.J.

 Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events <br> It is hard to overstate what a mess the world is in. Russia is spreading its influence from Ukraine to Syria. China is intimidating our allies and hacking into our computers. Iran is on the way to the bomb, has a presence in four Middle East countries and increases its funding of Hamas and Hezbollah, which continue to threaten Israel. We have let down allies (the Poles, the Czechs, the Israelis, etc.) and let run wild the Islamic State, Iran and its proxy terrorist groups. One hardly knows where to begin (Pushing out Bashar al-Assad? Trying to muzzle the Russian bear?). <br> If the next president is a Republican, he or she is going to have to do many things at once, spend more than he or she would like on national defense (both taxpayer dollars and his own political capital), resist liberals’ wailing about war fatigue, assure the public we will deploy our forces judiciously, cajole allies and stand up to adversaries. These are very serious times, even apart from the real problems of poverty, slow growth, education and debt at home. One would think the time demands exceptional leadership and sober leaders, who in turn will assemble a superior team to dig us out from the calamities he or she will inherit. <br> And yet the GOP race has decidedly unserious and utterly unfit figures atop the polls in Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Trump stokes birtherism, uses misogynistic rhetoric to put down women (in media or in the race) who show him up. He refuses to object to blatant displays of racism, including a voter’s outburst: “When can we get rid of them?” Trump’s knowledge of policy is nonexistent; his foreign policy consists of sitting down with tyrants whom he believes will like him. His immigration policy is bizarre, unworkable and unconstitutional. <br> Carson, hard as it is to imagine, is worse. Contrary to the express constitutional prohibition on a religious test, he says a Muslim cannot be president. His erratic views range from opposition to use of force against the Taliban after Sept. 11, 2001, to his daft assertion that prison turns criminals gay to his claim that the United States has become akin to Nazi Germany. These are cranks, not presidential candidates and not remotely suited for any office in troubled times like these. <br> Thankfully, none of the rest is nearly as unpresidential. Jeb Bush, who offers himself as the grownup, certainly projects calm and has his policy specifics down pat. He has stuck to his guns on immigration and presented a well-thought-out tax reform scheme. He sounds mature on Iran and continued to reject Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s call to rip up the Iran deal on Day One. But in tone he can seem almost too genteel. Will he get steamrolled by VP Joe Biden in the general election or by Democrats in Congress? Arguably, he is his father’s son (polite, gentlemanly) more than his mother’s (ready to pounce with a zinger). One wonders whether that will work in the 21st-century political world of vicious attacks. <br> At the other extreme, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) seems far too bellicose and irresponsible. He lacks plausible policies, and his tone is so antagonistic as to turn off all but the hard-core base. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is smart and inspirational, filled with creative policy ideas and resolute on immigration reform. Still, you wonder whether Vladimir Putin — or Biden (if he’s the nominee) — would run over him. <br> Into that field (which also includes a committed neo-isolationist and others who would spend endless time inveighing against gay marriage) and onto a national stage stepped Carly Fiorina. Far from being too stern, she appeared the one on stage most calibrated to the seriousness of the challenges we face. “What I would do, immediately, is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet, I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland, I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states,” she said with a staccato cadence leaving no moment of dead airtime. “I’d probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message. By the way, the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimani’s name is because Russia is in Syria right now, because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al-Assad.” She continued, “Russia is a bad actor, but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to, because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side, and we have all of that within our control.” Steely-eyed, well-informed, crisp and calm in her demeanor, Fiorina sounded presidential. She reminded one of Jeane Kirkpatrick in her precision, forcefulness and clarity. <br> Max Boot observed last week that he was skeptical someone “who has never held either elective or military office can become president but . . . she sure sounded presidential.” He is right. What then does a president sound like? <br> For one thing, there is a sense of urgency in her tone and rapid delivery. We and our allies are presently facing complex, serious challenges on multiple fronts, and there is no glossing over this. Some righteous anger is sometimes in order. <br> Second, she does not stoop to personal insults nor spend her time on endless digressions. She uses words economically (in contrast to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who tosses a word salad into the air with each answer), so there is no mistaking her meaning. She does not wallow in xenophobia nor treat her audience as know-nothings. <br> She generally avoids fantastical solutions (round up 12 million people!) but does not lack for specifics. On Iran, she vows to tell the regime’s leader “that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime, anywhere inspections by our people, not his, we, the United States of America, will make it as difficult as possible and move money around the global financial system. We can do that, we don’t need anyone’s cooperation to do it. And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States in America is back in the leadership business, which is how we must stand with our allies.” <br> There are candidates other than Fiorina with public records. There are candidates wise in the way of Washington. There are candidates who can charm audiences and reach out to voters who otherwise would not vote Republican. There are candidates without a problematic corporate track record. But ironically, in presence, delivery and tone, none is more presidential than Fiorina, someone with zero time in elective office. <br> If someone else is to be the nominee  — and she remains a dark horse — he’d do well at least to consult with her on debate prep. The eventual nominee will need to project that same sense of deliberateness, urgency and calm. That’s one reason Fiorina is soaring in the polls and, against all odds, may wind up on the presidential ticket, if not in the No. 1 slot. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Justin Ross is an associate professor of public finance and economics at Indiana University and author of “The Effect of Property Reassessments on Fiscal Transparency and Government Growth: Evidence from Virginia.” Eileen Norcross is director of the State and Local Policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. <br> In an episode from Season 1 of HBO’s “Veep,” the embattled vice president releases all of her office’s records simultaneously to feign transparency, hoping that the media will be distracted by meaningless nuggets of personal information. As one character put it, “By showing we have nothing to hide, we can hide something.” This resembles the current state of public finances in our country’s local governments. And although Virginia is typically a leader in fiscal transparency, the current situation also points to a problem with its property tax system. <br> The ease of releasing information digitally makes it more readily available than ever, but this also makes it easier to miss something. An extensive log of budget transactions reveals much but informs the average citizen of virtually nothing. The debate over public finance transparency has rapidly moved from “make data available” to “make data understandable,” much like nutrition labels in the grocery store identify nutrients as a percent of recommended daily intake rather than a mere listing of ingredients by quantity. <br> On these grounds, it is hard to find a state better than Virginia at providing meaningful forms of fiscal transparency. A quick trip to the local government reports section of the state’s Auditor of Public Accounts Web site will reveal comparative reports for all local governments that are seldom seen in other states. <br> There is room for improvement, however, with Virginia’s property taxes. Most citizens gauge them like they would any other tax — by monitoring the tax rate. This makes sense in theory: “Raising” or “lowering” a sales or income tax typically means adjusting the rate. There are usually estimates of how much revenue different tax rates will produce, but ultimately only time will tell. <br> For property taxes, however, there is very little uncertainty. The government determines the size of the tax base by conducting property value assessments. As any government finance textbook will explain, local governments decide how much revenue they would like to take from property taxes, and it is simple arithmetic from there to determine the property tax rate. <br> Sounds simple enough, right? But there is an X factor: When property values are rising, local governments can claim to “leave the property tax unchanged” or even decrease the rate by taking advantage of our mistaken focus on the tax rate. For example, a 1 percent tax on a property assessed at $300,000 would generate $250 more in taxes each year than a 1.1 percent tax on the same property assessed at $250,000. <br> Consider a recent headline in the Citizen, Arlington County’s government newsletter: “FY 2016 Budget Includes No Tax Rate Increase.” If you stopped reading there, you might expect your tax bill to stay the same. A little further into the article, a caveat appears: Despite no real estate tax increase, “due to an increase in residential assessments, the average Arlingtonian will see their tax and fee burden rise four percent — from $7,286 to $7,567.” <br> It sounds like homeowners’ property tax bills have gone down quite a bit in recent decades. But again, focusing only on the rate allows you to be misled. <br> Average property tax rates have been flat or have decreased over the past 15 years in Virginia counties, so why has property tax revenue grown by more than 50 percent since fiscal 2000? Because the average Virginia city or county has seen a doubling of the total value of taxable property . Homeowners are paying more in property taxes for more government spending, not because property tax rates have stayed flat but because local governments have chosen to spend enough to keep the rates unchanged. <br> Some states have addressed the problem with what’s known as a “roll-back” rule, where current property tax rates are compared with an adjusted version of the property tax rates that account for the growth in property values. Instead of comparing the 2015 property tax rate to the rate posted in 2014, they recalculate what the rate would have been in 2014 by using the 2015 property values. This transparently gives voters context on the size of the property tax extraction from its base. <br> Perhaps more revenue from property taxes is desirable, but it should be transparent to citizens, without misleading claims that politicians somehow managed to keep taxes flat and increase spending simultaneously. <br> Read more about this issue: <br> The Post’s View: D.C.’s tax reform merits a close look <br> Catherine Rampell: Anti-tax attitudes hurt local governments <br> The Post’s View: A bold plan in Prince George’s <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Zalmay Khalilzad was the U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2005 to 2007. <br> The reform campaign announced last month by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi represents a potential turning point for Iraq. Indeed, the outcome of this campaign will shape the future of a country central to the global fight against the Islamic State and to the stabilization of the Middle East. The United States must focus on Iraq’s newest struggle and assist Abadi’s reform effort. <br> Abadi is rushing his reforms because of pressure from a nonsectarian movement, which includes many civil society groups, that has taken to the streets for several weeks. The role of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who encouraged Abadi to be courageous and embrace reform, has been critical. Abadi’s reforms include fighting corruption and establishing a meritocracy in government employment in place of party patronage and sectarianism. The protesters also want national reconciliation and reform of the judiciary, including the replacement of top judge Midhat al-Mahmoud, who was a key enabler of the unconstitutional actions by Abadi’s predecessor, Nouri al-Maliki. <br> Sectarianism has been a cancer on Iraqi politics. The last large-scale expression of nonsectarian politics came during the 2010 elections, when an improved security environment briefly reduced the potency of identity politics. But sectarianism surged again when security deteriorated after the U.S. military withdrawal. Today’s events offer a rare second chance for Iraq. <br> Abadi’s reform effort faces three key challenges: <br> First, it has divided the Shiites, producing a political confrontation that Sistani aide Ahmed al-Safi has described as an “existential battle.” The reforms are opposed by militia leaders, including the Badr Organization’s Hadi al-Amiri and Kataib Hezbollah’s Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, as well as a number of political parties that support the political patronage system. Militia leaders have threatened reformers, targeting protesters with violence and kidnapping and even engaging in a deadly skirmish with security forces in Baghdad last week. They have also issued statements opposing national reconciliation in defiance of the prime minister and met with Mahmoud to express support for him. <br> Second, while the prime minister’s goals are laudable and ambitious, the means available to him to implement them are limited. Given lower oil prices, Abadi has far fewer financial resources than his predecessor. Complicating matters is the fact that, in the war against the Islamic State, he needs the support of the very militias opposed to his reforms. Many senior government officials hold their positions because of patronage and are unlikely to help his agenda succeed. And Abadi’s relations with the Kurds are strained by disputes over oil exports and the budget, among other issues. Abadi’s most important assets are support from Sistani and popular demands for reform. <br> Third, it appears that Iran wants the militias to dominate the Iraqi security sector and render it loyal to Tehran’s hard-liners. Abadi wants these militias and volunteer forces to be regulated and reorganized in a National Guard force under state control. It’s likely that Iran hopes the prime minister will fail and either simply abandon the reform program to work more closely with Iran or be replaced by someone who will side with the militias. Maliki began his first term as an independent leader, but as conditions changed and put his political survival at risk, he embraced Iran. Abadi’s reform agenda and Iran’s response to it have produced a nationalist Iraqi backlash against Iran. Sistani, Abadi and other reform leaders want good relations with Iran, but they resent Quds Force leader Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani’s effort to turn Iraq into a satellite state. <br> There is much at stake for Iraq in this struggle. The reform program is not comprehensive — it does not address the problems of the Kurdish region. Nevertheless, its success could lead to more effective governance, reconciliation and a reduction in sectarian tension. Sectarianism and discrimination against Sunnis have fueled extremism and terror in parts of the Sunni Arab community. Greater independence from Iran can also have a positive effect on Iraq’s regional relations and reduce Sunni Arab states’ incentives to support Sunni insurgents and terrorists. Greater emphasis on competence and the rule of law can reduce corruption and improve services for the Iraqi people — and even attract investment to Iraq. <br> The United States has an interest in the success of reform. To help tip the political balance of power in Abadi’s favor, policymakers should focus on understanding the nature of Iraq’s reform movement and identify ways to bolster and support it. Washington should also continue to provide robust military assistance. The U.S. effort to rebuild the Iraqi army is crucial to provide Abadi with loyal security forces and a strong formal chain of command. This security relationship and our operations against the Islamic State are vital for Abadi. Without them, Iran’s leverage grows. <br> We should also respond positively to Abadi’s appeal for help, and help him with implementing the reform agenda by providing technical advice to turn objectives into actionable plans and during the execution phase in areas such as fiscal policy, ministerial restructuring, tax reforms and electricity generation and distribution. We should also help Abadi refine the scope and pace of reform to make sure he doesn’t overreach. <br> Finally, this is a perfect time to redouble our diplomatic support by encouraging Iraq’s Sunni neighbors to constructively engage with Abadi. The reform campaign is evidence that he is moving away from the sectarian policies of his predecessor. The United States should emphasize to Iraq’s neighbors that successful reforms can help with national reconciliation and rebalance Iraq’s relations with its neighbors, positively affecting the broader region. <br> This struggle for political, economic and national security reform in Iraq is likely to be a long one, and success is not inevitable. Prime Minister Abadi faces major domestic and Iranian pressures, and he needs our help to make progress. We need to act quickly. <br> Read more here: <br> Daniel Byman: In Iraq, Obama has a choice: Bad guys or bad government <br> The Post’s View: The U.S. strategy to defeat the Islamic State is underpowered <br> Sarah Margon: For Iraq’s Sunnis, sectarian militias pose an extra threat <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 CONGRESS HAS a lot of bad habits, none more maddening than passing temporary tax deductions and credits for special purposes and special interests. In theory, this enables lawmakers to reassess them periodically, keeping the ones that work and discarding the rest. In practice, temporary provisions become permanent through the annual legislative log-rolling known as a “tax extenders” bill. It’s a full-employment exercise for lobbyists that in recent years has lumped some sound policies (a business credit for research and development) with others that are obscure (a break for rum makers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), wasteful (wind energy subsidies) and plain old indefensibly parochial (a break for auto racetracks). <br> Tax extenders used to be “must-pass” legislation because the bill included an annual “fix” to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) that would otherwise clobber the middle class; Congress saw no need to pay for it with offsetting tax increases or spending cuts. But Congress enacted a permanent repair to the AMT in the “fiscal cliff” deal at the beginning of 2013. As a result, the tax extenders bill lost a lot of its political urgency, and Congress did not pass one before Dec. 31. The expired provisions, totaling $54.2 billion, must be addressed retroactively in the coming weeks if they are to be addressed at all. <br> The remaining question is whether Congress will break with past practice and pay for the bill. Last December, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) tried to pass a tax extenders bill without offsetting spending cuts or revenue increases, but he was thwarted by Republican objections. On Thursday, Mr. Reid announced that the Senate wouldn’t tackle the issue again until Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) takes over as chairman of the Finance Committee upon the departure of Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. <br> Mr. Wyden, and his opposite number in the House, Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.), will face pressure to pass an unpaid-for bill, with the excuse that all tax breaks must be dealt with in a grand bargain on tax reform. That’s a fiscally irresponsible cop-out — and a hypocritical one, too, given that the House-Senate budget deal was premised on offsetting relief from sequester spending cuts. Even if it’s unlikely the tax-writers could get an agreement to eliminate or pay for the entire package, they could target the most expensive, least-efficient breaks. <br> A good candidate is bonus depreciation, which lets businesses deduct the cost of capital equipment in the year of its purchase, rather than more gradually. This provision accounts for nearly one-tenth of the bill’s cost, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. But a 2008 Congressional Budget Office report found it of questionable efficacy as a recession-fighter. It’s even less justifiable now that the recovery is picking up steam and U.S. corporations are flush with $1.8 trillion in cash, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. <br> It’s time for Congress to break a bad habit, tax log-rolling, and start a good one — tax policymaking. <br> Read more: <br> Glenn Hubbard: Tax reform is the best way to tackle income inequality <br> The Post’s View: Clean energy should do without special tax breaks <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Here’s the first lesson from the early skirmishing over ways to avoid the fiscal cliff: Democrats and liberals have to stop elevating Grover Norquist, the anti-government crusader who wields his no-tax pledge as a nuclear weapon, into the role of a political Superman. <br> Pretending that Norquist is more powerful than he is allows Republicans to win acclaim they haven’t earned yet. Without making a single substantive concession, they get loads of praise just for saying they are willing to ignore those old pledges to Grover. You can give him props as a public relations genius. Like Ke$ha or Beyonce, he is widely known in Washington by only one name. But kudos for an openness to compromise should be reserved for Republicans who put forward concrete proposals to raise taxes. <br> The corollary is that progressives should be unafraid to draw their own red lines. If you doubt that this is a good idea, just look at how effective Norquist has been. Outside pressure from both sides is essential for a balanced deal. <br> Start by insisting that Social Security and any increase in the retirement age be kept off the table. President Obama’s bargaining hand will be strengthened further if he can tell Republicans that there just aren’t Democratic votes for steep cuts in Medicaid and Medicare. The president’s room for maneuver expands still more if liberals refuse to look at cuts in programs unless Republicans are prepared to raise tax rates on the wealthy. <br> Already, there are signs that Republicans realize how much leverage the president has. If Congress doesn’t act, all the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year. At that point, the Senate’s Democratic majority has the power to block (or Obama can veto) any restoration of the upper-end Bush tax rates. <br> One indication that Republicans are aware they’re boxed in came from Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), one of his party’s shrewdest political minds. He suggested that Republicans should take up the president’s invitation to extend the Bush tax cuts for the 98 percent of Americans who earn less than $250,000 a year. Yes, this would amount to throwing in the towel on those upper-bracket levies. But Cole knows that it won’t help the Republican brand if voters come to see the GOP’s one and only objective as protecting wealthier Americans from tax increases. <br> The next lesson is not about politics or PR. It’s about substance, and this is where the Washington establishment has to get serious. The simple fact is that it’s bunk to claim that “tax reform” alone can produce the revenue we need. <br> One of the great disservices of the Bowles-Simpson commission was that it fed the impression that tax reform could generate so much cash that it would permit a cut in tax rates. <br> Grant Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson credit for good intentions — they were desperate to find a way to get Republicans on their commission to acknowledge the need for new revenue. It’s also worth remembering that their proposal assumed the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a year. Nonetheless, their stress on tax reform with lower rates was more a political deal than wise policy. They sent us down the wrong path. <br> The only way tax reform might raise enough money to prevent a rate increase, let alone create an opportunity for rate cuts, is to reduce popular deductions (like the one on mortgage interest) so deeply that middle-class Americans would get a tax increase, too. And eliminating or sharply undercutting the deduction for state and local taxes is a bad idea. This only penalizes higher-tax states that try to solve their own social problems — for example, by providing health insurance to their low-income residents. <br> And all the schemes to eliminate tax expenditures to avoid rate increases have the effect of protecting just one group: Americans with very high incomes. That’s how the math works. <br> The right thing is to bring back Bill Clinton’s tax rates on the well-off and then have a broad tax reform discussion next year. A similar logic applies to health-care programs, as Jonathan Cohn suggested in the New Republic. Before making big cuts in Medicaid and Medicare, we need to see whether the reforms in the Affordable Care Act can contain medical inflation. <br> The fiscal cliff creates an enormous opportunity to end an era in which it was never, ever permissible to raise taxes. In the pre-Grover days, conservatives believed passionately in pay-as-you-go government. A tough stand by progressives will make it easier for conservatives to return to the path of fiscal responsibility. <br> ejdionne@washpost.com <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Martin Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard University and president emeritus of the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research, was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1984. <br> President Obama’s recent meetings with members of Congress have raised hopes that a major fiscal deal will replace the “sequester” and put the federal debt on a healthier long-term path. But the key barrier to such a deal remains the disagreement between Republicans and Democrats about the balance between raising revenue and cutting government spending. Republicans say they are against any further increase in taxes. Democrats, including the president, say that any budget deal must include additional revenue as well as spending cuts. <br> Fortunately, Democrats indicate that they want to raise the extra revenue without increasing tax rates. Raising revenue without increasing tax rates requires eliminating or reducing the subsidies in the U.S. tax code. Such subsidies, for things as varied as hybrid cars and increased health insurance, are really the government spending through the tax code. That is why they are officially referred to as “tax expenditures.” <br> Reducing those subsidies, then, is really cutting government spending. The resulting deficit reductions show up on the revenue side of the budget, but the economic effect is to cut government spending. <br> Billions of dollars of revenue are lost through many relatively small subsidies, such as the tax break given to homeowners who install better insulation or buy a more efficient refrigerator. These may be desirable actions, but given the current budget situation, the country cannot afford to subsidize them. Anyone opposed to government spending should favor removing these subsidies from the tax code. <br> The big political challenge is dealing with the large tax subsidies to home mortgages, employer-provided health insurance and state and local taxes. Any attempt to eliminate these would almost certainly fail to get enacted. That is why I advocate allowing taxpayers to keep all of their current deductions and exclusions — but limiting the extent to which they can reduce their tax liabilities in this way. <br> More specifically, I believe that Congress should cap the reduction in tax liabilities that taxpayers can gain from using these special features of the tax code. The tax benefits should be limited to a percentage of the individual’s total income. I favor a cap of 2 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI) on the tax benefit that an individual receives from deductions and from the exclusion of municipal bond interest and of the value of employer payments for health insurance. For someone with a 25 percent marginal tax rate, that 2 percent limit on the reduction in taxes translates into a limit of 8 percent of AGI on the deductions and exclusions. <br> This cap should be applied to all deductions except the one for charitable contributions. The full deduction for charitable contributions should be retained, because the money that taxpayers give to charity benefits those organizations rather than the individual taxpayer. <br> A 2 percent limit on the tax benefit from deductions and exclusions would produce about $140 billion in additional revenue if it were applied in 2013. Over the next decade, the additional deficit reduction would total more than $2.1 trillion. With that much extra revenue from tax reform, it would be possible to cut some marginal tax rates. <br> The president has proposed raising revenue by limiting tax subsidies, but his plan would affect only high-income taxpayers. Under his proposal, taxpayers would keep all of their deductions, but deductions would be limited to a 28 percent tax rate. Someone in the 35 percent bracket who spends $20,000 on mortgage interest, for example, would reduce his tax liability not by 35 percent, or $7,000, but only by 28 percent of the $20,000, or $5,600. <br> The president’s plan, unfortunately, is inadequate and unfair. It would raise only $21 billion if applied to 2013 and about $300 billion over the next decade. That’s less than one-sixth of the deficit reduction achieved by a 2 percent cap on tax benefits. And virtually all of that money would come from taxpayers earning more than $200,000. Any serious plan to reduce government spending that is built into tax law should raise more revenue and call on most taxpayers to participate. <br> Tax reform can play a key role in reducing future budget deficits and in making tax law simpler, fairer and more supportive of stronger economic growth. Republicans should recognize that limits on tax subsidies are reductions in government spending. And if Republicans agree to a substantial revenue increase in this way, Democrats should agree to significant structural changes to slow the growth of Social Security and Medicare. <br> The key to breaking the fiscal impasse is to reduce the government spending done through the tax code. <br> Read more from Opinions: <br> Fred Hiatt: Paying for charitable giving <br> Charles Lane: The worst tax deduction <br> Dana Milbank: The Confederacy of Takers <br> The Post’s View: Limiting tax deductions <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 For both parties, the emerging theme of economic mobility is often a reluctant, second choice. <br> Deep down, many Democrats would prefer to focus on economic inequality. But while Americans have theoretical concerns about the income gap, they are consistently skeptical about government’s role as leveler. Explicit talk of redistribution doesn’t get a politician very far. <br> Deep down, many Republicans would prefer to focus on economic growth. But this abstract goal does not touch on the economic concerns of most Americans, including stagnant wages and difficulties getting (and affording) education and skills. In recent presidential elections, Republican talk of entrepreneurship and risk taking has been disconnected from working-class struggles and middle-class fears. <br> So both parties are led, along different routes, to talk about mobility and equality of opportunity. This embrace is largely rhetorical. When Democrats refer to stalled mobility, they are generally still talking about inequality. When Republicans embrace mobility, they often mean cutting taxes and reducing regulations. <br> But it would be a mistake to use “rhetorical” in a dismissive manner. As any speechwriter knows, a change of language can help drive a shift in policy. The challenge, as Yuval Levin of National Affairs puts it, is “to use the move toward mobility rhetoric to drive a substantive move.” <br> The parties have backed into America’s most urgent domestic priority: resisting the development of a class-based society in which birth equals destiny. This division runs like an ugly, concrete wall across the American ideal. On one side are the wealthy and educated, living in communities characterized by greater family stability, economic opportunity and neighborhood cohesion. On the other side is the working class, living in communities featuring economic stagnation, family instability and neighborhood breakdown. The best advice for success? Be born on the right side of the wall. That is not a very American-sounding answer. <br> The entry-level commitment for Republicans in this debate is a recognition that equality of opportunity is not a natural state; it is a social and political achievement. Economic growth is important — but its benefits are shared only if people have the knowledge and human capital to succeed in a modern economy. This preparation requires active, effective, reform-oriented government at every level — and forbids an ideological appeal that is merely anti-government. <br> Democrats lay claim to the mobility issue by arguing that extreme inequality undermines mobility — an assertion for which the economic evidence is mixed. In this view, the job of helping the poor is inseparable from cutting the 1 percent down to size. At a recent economic forum, a fellow panelist — a prominent liberal economist — admitted that wage subsidies such as the earned-income tax credit are the most direct and efficient way to help low-income workers. But she still advocated a raise in the minimum wage, precisely because Wal-Mart would be punished in the process. <br> If this attitude is viewed as the starting point of the mobility debate, Republicans will sit it out. Democrats who insist on this approach are sabotaging the possibility of political progress. The public goal that liberals and conservatives might share is not the equalization of wealth; it is the equalization of opportunity. And that is difficult enough. After decades of economic growth and rising productivity, after decades of social spending, now about $1 trillion a year (at all levels of government), mobility in the United States remains stalled and lags behind that of France, Canada and much of Scandinavia. <br> The presidential field is just beginning to engage these issues. Hillary Clinton is tacking sharply to the left — she would “topple” the 1 percent — with all the disarming authenticity of Mitt Romney declaring himself an “extreme” conservative. But she will surely shift rightward on equal opportunity in the general election, and probably in the most politically obvious and heavy-handed manner possible. <br> On the reform Republican side, Jeb Bush talks of “the right to rise,” has promised a “new vision” of urban renewal and has locked down a strong team of policy advisers and experts. But they have yet to be utilized in any serious, or at least public, way. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) is the most natural fit for a Republican mobility message, which is illustrated by his family story. He is easily the most policy-oriented of the current Republican field, having proposed measures on college affordability, pro-family tax reform and welfare reform that consolidate a number of benefits to the working poor into a more generous wage subsidy. <br> Perhaps the greatest need in American politics: a presidential candidate who passionately advances a vision of mobility instead of settling for it. <br> Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook . <br> Read more about this topic: <br> Harold Meyerson: Two nations, one flag <br> Robert J.

 This week, Washington descends into its annual budget brawl. House Republicans unveiled their plan on Tuesday, with Senate Republicans to follow Wednesday. Their hope is to pass a common budget resolution through both bodies by mid-April. Their incentive is that if — and that is a big if — Republicans in the House and Senate can agree, they can use the process known as “reconciliation” to pass various right-wing passions by majority vote, no filibuster allowed. The House budget plan, for example, calls for repealing Obamacare, partial privatization of Medicare, turning Medicaid and food stamps into block grants for the states, and tax reforms that lower rates and eliminate any taxation on profits reported abroad, turning the rest of the world into a tax haven for multinationals. The president can veto the appropriations bill containing these items, setting up another government shutdown melodrama. This is not the way to run a railroad, much less a government. <br> Budgets bore and numbers numb, so reporters tend to focus on the politics. The press now is touting the fight between so-called “deficit hawks” and “defense hawks.” The former want to adhere to harsh “sequester” spending limits this year and cut them even further in out years. The latter led by the dyspeptic Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) want to blow up sequester limits for the military. But this fight is more bluster than substance. The House budget plan squares the circle by adding some $94 billion to the military’s “Overseas Contingency Operations Fund” — the money spent on fighting wars abroad — that isn’t counted under sequester limits. The real story of the Republican budget is the triumph of the anti-tax hawks. With few exceptions, Republicans are committed to slashing the basic functions of government and programs that support education, food stamps, energy and RD to avoid asking corporations or the wealthy to contribute even one more dime in taxes. <br> Too often neglected in this Beltway brawl is the budget alternative offered by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The fifth annual CPC alternative — “The People’s Budget: A Raise for America” — is about as close to common sense as Congress gets. And it is honest: Its numbers are carefully laid out and add up. It actually says what it would invest in and how it would pay for it. <br> On the investment side, the CPC expands investments in areas vital to our future. It would rebuild America, modernizing our outmoded infrastructure. It would invest to lead the green industrial revolution that is already forging markets and creating jobs across the globe. <br> The CPC understands that we must do the basics in education. It would provide pre-K for every child, the most important single reform we can make in education. It calls for increasing investment in our public schools, helping to mitigate the destructive inequality between rich districts and poor. It would provide students with four years of debt-free college education, and pay for renegotiating existing student loans, relieving the burden now crushing an entire generation. <br> The CPC recognizes that more seniors are facing a retirement crisis. On budget, it would adopt an inflation measure for Social Security that reflects the rising costs seniors face in areas like health care. Off budget, the CPC calls for expanded Social Security benefits, paid for by lifting the income cap on Social Security payroll contributions. No longer would Donald Trump pay a lower rate in Social Security taxes than the police who guard his palaces. <br> The CPC would also expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, giving a break to low-wage workers and to parents struggling with the costs of childcare. And needless to say, the CPC would defend Medicare and Medicaid, not privatize it, and strengthen health-care reform, not eliminate it. <br> The People’s Budget details how to pay for these vital investments while slowly reducing the national debt as a percentage of the economy. The basic theory is to raise revenues by taxing what we want less of and save by cutting spending we can do without. <br> We now suffer dangerously extreme inequality, so the CPC would increase taxes on those who make $1 million or more. High-frequency trading on Wall Street is dangerously unstable, so the CPC would levy a small tax on speculation to slow it down. CEO pay has soared while workers haven’t shared in the profits they have helped to generate, so the CPC would end the loophole that allows companies to write off obscene bonuses and stock options as a business expense. <br> Catastrophic climate change is, even according to the Pentagon, a clear and present danger. The CPC budget would levy a carbon tax, allowing the market to allocate carbon reduction. Much of the revenue is devoted to a rebate so that lower-wage families are made whole from the change. <br> In cutting waste, the CPC turns to where the money is, calling for a relatively modest reduction in military spending over time. It would repeal the ridiculous law that bans Medicare from negotiating bulk discounts on drugs. It would curb insurance company gouging by giving consumers a public option in health care. It would end the pernicious and wasteful subsidies to oil and gas companies. <br> And it would rescue millions from of the shadow economy with comprehensive immigration reform, saving nearly $200 billion over a decade according to Congressional Budget Office projections. <br> What the CPC budget shows is what Washington too often suppresses: There is an alternative. We can afford to build a society that reflects the values and priorities of most Americans. We only have to choose to do so. <br> Read more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Dana Milbank: The House GOP budget is a gimmick <br> Jared Bernstein: The House Republican budget departs from reality <br> Jennifer Rubin: House budget: A political betrayal and a national security disaster <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 As the “fiscal cliff” drama heads toward its climax between Thanksgiving and Christmas, each party is in the grip of a dead idea on taxes that warps the conversation. That means that no matter who “wins” this showdown, the parties’ antique thinking guarantees that any deal they strike will be merely the first of much bigger future adjustments as the baby boomers retire. To see why, it’s useful to think of the United States’ tax debate as being trapped between the cobwebs cluttering Grover Norquist’s mind and those clouding Gov. Jerry Brown’s. <br> Norquist’s dead idea is that we can fund the federal government in an aging United States without higher taxes. Republicans love to say federal taxes should be what they’ve always been in the post World War II period — around 18 or 19 percent of GDP. That’s why they want spending to come down from today’s recession-inflated 24 percent of GDP toward post-war norms of around 20 percent. (Revenue has fallen off a true fiscal cliff to 15 percent of GDP, thanks to the sluggish economy). Balance the budget around 19 percent of GDP, Republicans say, and call it a day. <br> The flaw in this reasoning is that we’re on the verge of doubling the number of seniors on Social Security and Medicare. Ronald Reagan ran government at 22 percent of GDP when the United States’ population was much younger. Even after we take steps to slow the growth of our health and pension programs (which we must), it’s impossible to fund the boomers retirement at historic levels of taxation and balance the budget without decimating government activities devoted to non-elderly purposes — including the RD and infrastructure that help propel future growth. <br> Sorry Grover — in an aging America, federal spending, and taxes, are destined to rise. <br> The Norquist-Paul Ryan reaction is to deny math and demography. They want to use this “historical norm” tax limitation and our aging population to force big cuts in the rest of what government does. But their equally powerful motivation is political: they desperately want to preserve the tax issue as the chief way voters can distinguish what Republicans stand for. <br> After all, if Republicans don’t stand for lower taxes, what contrast do they have with Democrats? How can they contest elections? Ever since 1980, when Reagan put tax cuts at the heart of the GOP agenda, the party’s had a great ride on the issue. But the aging of the population means this centerpiece of Republican economic “thinking” is now totally divorced from reality. <br> If Republicans can’t run on tax cuts, they’ll actually have to come up with other policies to improve Americans’ lives. As we’ve seen in their flailing since the election, the party is so out of practice at doing this that they’re not sure where to begin. But despite Norquist’s death rattles, the GOP ultimately has no choice.  <br> Democrats have a dead idea on taxes, too: the notion that we can put our fiscal house in order only by raising taxes on top earners. Obama ran hard on this myth, but the prizewinner this year is Gov. Jerry Brown, whose Proposition 30 raises marginal income tax rates on top earners in California to a whopping 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. <br> To be fair, Brown knows that relying so heavily on a handful of taxpayers is bad policy. His original plan was to raise sales taxes as part of a broader budget patch, but the teacher’s union planned a rival ballot measure aimed squarely at the rich. Wealthy attorney Molly Munger backed her own tax plan as well (that’s what we do out here in California — everyone who’s anyone tries to govern by proposition). <br> Brown reckoned that if there were three tax hikes on the ballot, they’d all fail. So he cut a deal with the unions to get behind one that resembled theirs. “He came to this compromise because he had no other political choice,” says Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. <br> As a result, while Prop 30’s passage saves schools from devastating cuts for the time being, Brown has planted the seeds of future trouble. Follow the numbers: let’s say federal tax rates on top earners go back to 39.6 percent from 35 percent. Add in Obamacare’s new 3.8 percent tax on investment income and new 1 percent higher Medicare payroll tax on the same folks. Then toss in new top state rates of 11.3 to 13.3 percent (up from 9.3 and 10.3), and presto! Marginal tax rates for self-employed people in California earning $300,000 and up (who pick up both “sides” of the payroll tax on a chunk of their earnings) could reach 55 percent or more. <br> That’s dicey. It will almost certainly affect incentives and behavior. Yet Prop 30’s new inflow of $7 billion a year in a $100 billion budget won’t fix the state’s long-term budget woes, which are driven by spiraling health costs and massive unfunded health and pension benefits — not to mention sweetheart deals like those won by the powerful unionized prison guards, on whose slim ranks California now showers three times more cash each year than it devotes to its system of higher education. <br> The point? At both the state and federal level, middle class benefits and government services can’t be funded in a sustainable way just by ratcheting taxes ever higher on the top. Eventually middle class benefits and services must be supported by the middle class. <br> So we’ll need higher taxes, Grover, but not just on the rich, Jerry. <br> Neither party is ready to give up its dead idea yet. Which means we won’t get the debate we need anytime soon. That debate is this: Given that tax hikes in an aging United States are inevitable — including on the middle class — what’s the best and fairest way to do this with the least harm to economic growth? <br> This is the real “tax reform” conversation we need, and it would take us far beyond the approved Simpson-Bowles vocabulary that limits tax reform to the mantra of “lowering rates and broadening the base.” For starters, in an aging America we should be looking at slashing payroll and corporate taxes to boost jobs and growth and raising taxes on consumption, dirty energy and financial securities transactions to fund the government we want. <br> Whether we avert, postpone or go off the cliff next month — or some blend of all three — this is the conversation we’ll still need to get to in a few years.   <br> Matt Miller is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and co-host of public radio’s “Left, Right Center.” His e-mail address is mattino2@gmail.com. <br> Read more from Opinions: <br> Dana Milbank: Grover Norquist’s rear-guard action on taxes <br> Charles Lane: The worst tax deduction <br> Michael Gerson: Making capitalism work <br> Marc Thiessen: Let’s go over the ‘cliff’ <br> Robert J.

 Ed O’Keefe is a congressional reporter for The Washington Post. <br> The 114th session of Congress convened this past week with 13 new senators and 58 new faces in the House. While top congressional leaders of the past few years remain in place, the freshman lawmakers could soon start influencing the debates on the budget, tax reform and immigration. Who are these freshmen, and what should we expect from them? A look at the Class of 2015 helps dispel some long-held misconceptions about new members of Congress. <br> 1. Freshmen don’t have any power. <br> There’s an old edict that freshman lawmakers should be seen and not heard. Even Edward M. Kennedy, who came into the Senate as a brother of the president, waited 17 months to deliver his first formal floor speech. <br> But these days, freshmen are far less apt to keep quiet. Think of the 85 House Republican freshmen elected as part of the 2010 tea party wave, who forced GOP leaders to seek deeper spending cuts during the debt-ceiling fight with President Obama. Then there’s Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a first-term senator who gets most of the blame for the 2013 government shutdown. And don’t forget Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whom many liberals want to run for president in 2016. She recently earned a minor leadership role in the Senate Democratic caucus, leapfrogging more senior colleagues, because of her national profile. <br> This year, in an attempt to bolster some top recruits, House Republican leaders have tapped three GOP freshmen to chair subcommittees on the Homeland Security Committee: Rep. Martha McSally (Ariz.), Rep. John Ratcliffe (Tex.) and Rep. John Katko (N.Y.). McSally is an Air Force veteran, while Ratcliffe and Katko are former federal prosecutors. <br> Four freshman GOP senators — Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Bill Cassidy (La.), James Lankford (Okla.) and Steve Daines (Mont.) — got seats on the Appropriations Committee, a panel that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hopes to restore to its previous glory as the Senate returns to “regular order” by writing and passing spending bills. All four freshmen previously served in the House, and some have skyrocketed far ahead of older colleagues: Lankford has been in Congress for just four years and Daines for two. <br> Committee assignments are mostly perfunctory in the modern Congress, where the committee system is greatly diminished. But the freshmen will surely tout their roles during their reelection campaigns. <br> 2. Freshmen tend to be naive to the ways of Capitol Hill. <br> Historically, the usual path to Congress has been through the ranks of local or state politics. But a notable number of freshmen arrived on Capitol Hill this year as seasoned congressional aides, political consultants or campaign donors. <br> Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) — who at 30 is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress — was a domestic policy aide to President George W. Bush and helped Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) prepare for the 2012 vice-presidential debate. Rep. David Rouzer (R-N.C.) worked for GOP senators Elizabeth Dole and Jesse Helms; Rep. David Young (R-Iowa) is a former chief of staff to Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa); and Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) was state director for former senator George LeMieux (R-Fla.). <br> There’s also Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.), who has run for office in three states and is a former House aide. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) is a former lobbyist and political operative and the wife of her predecessor, Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.). Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) is a former Virginia lieutenant governor who became a top Obama campaign donor and served as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein. <br> Amid all the political experience, there are a few novices: Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.) is a former CIA officer who served in Pakistan and India, while Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) spent 40 years climbing the corporate ladder. And Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) was a little-known college professor before defeating then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary last year. <br> 3. Freshmen become shoo-ins for reelection. <br> It’s true that the overwhelming majority of incumbents win reelection, but eight freshman House members lost last year. So did three first-term senators. <br> And if a senator does lose reelection, there’s a good chance that it happens early on. The majority of Senate incumbents ousted in the past century have been in their first terms, according to an exhaustive analysis by Smart Politics, a nonpartisan political news site operated by the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs. At least one first-term incumbent has lost reelection in 47 of the 51 election cycles during the direct-election era, the analysis found. But there hasn’t been a freshman blowout in the Senate for quite a while. The largest number of first-term incumbents to suffer defeat was 10 senators — one Republican and nine Democrats — who were ousted in 1918. <br> 4. We’re electing fewer military veterans to Congress. <br> Veterans made up more than three-fourths of Congress at one point last century, but their ranks have gradually diminished in recent political cycles as World War II veterans have died or retired and as Vietnam War vets have also left. <br> Last year, though, 25 military veterans of the post-9/11 era won seats in Congress — a record high, according to veterans groups. Sixteen of the wins were by freshmen members of the House and Senate, including Reps. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), both former Marines, and Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), an Army veteran. <br> Moulton saw intense combat while serving in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 and earned two medals for his service. But he didn’t mention the commendations during his campaign — or even to his parents — until the Boston Globe unearthed details about them last October, shortly before his election. <br> In the Senate, Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) is a Marine reservist who deployed to Afghanistan. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is a lieutenant colonel with the Army National Guard who served during Operation Iraqi Freedom. And Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a former House lawmaker, deployed with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq and served in Afghanistan. He was a member of the Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery in between his war stints. <br> “I like the fact that you will have more defense-oriented members and [members] with military experience,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the most famous congressional war veteran, said in a recent interview. The new recruits “are very pro-defense,” he added, signaling “a victory for the internationalist wing of the Republican Party.” <br> 5. They reflect America. <br> We hear a lot about how Congress is more diverse than ever. And yes, the combined number of women in the House and Senate tops 100 for the first time this year. In the House, 44 African Americans serve along with 34 Hispanics, 10 Asian Americans and two Native Americans. The Senate has two African Americans, three Hispanics and one Asian American. <br> But even the freshman class is disproportionately male (81 percent), white (86.5 percent) and Christian (98.6 percent). <br> Compared with the last Congress, the 114th has nine more Christians, five fewer Jews and one less Buddhist. A recent analysis by the Pew Research Center, using data compiled by CQ Roll Call, found that the most underrepresented group in Congress is “unaffiliated” people, who make up 20 percent of Americans but just 0.2 percent of lawmakers. <br> Members of Congress are also far wealthier than most Americans. The combined net worth of lawmakers topped $2 billion in 2013, according to a CQ Roll Call analysis — and the numbers will easily jump again now that six more millionaires have joined the Senate. <br> ed.okeefe@washpost.com <br> Five myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

 With Republican majorities in both houses, the new Congress should begin by focusing on traditional GOP priorities: improving the nation’s sagging infrastructure, reforming an unwieldy tax code and finding ways to boost middle-class opportunity. <br> When pigs fly, you say? Skepticism is definitely in order. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner have a fundamental choice to make. They can acknowledge the obvious areas of common ground they share with President Obama — thus showing that the Republican Party can participate responsibly in government — or they can throw temper tantrums. <br> McConnell told The Post that one of his goals, as he takes leadership of the Senate, is to avoid doing anything that would make it harder for the party to elect a president next year. “I don’t want the American people to think that, if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that’s going to be a scary outcome,” he said. <br> The scariness of the GOP field probably will also depend on Ted Cruz’s apocalyptic rhetoric and Chris Christie’s progress in anger management. But McConnell is right that the whole “Party of No” routine, which he helped orchestrate, is unlikely to yield further political benefit — and may, at this point, inflict more damage on Republicans than on Democrats. <br> It is perhaps inevitable that the GOP will use its control of Congress to highlight the party’s pet issues — advocacy for the Keystone XL pipeline, for example, and opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Every once in a while, Republicans may even muster the needed 60 votes in the Senate — and force Obama to use his veto. But then what? Passing a bunch of bills that have no chance of ever becoming law is not the best advertisement for effectiveness. <br> McConnell told The Post he wants voters to see his party as a “responsible, right-of-center, governing majority.” Well, two obvious things such a majority should be doing right now are celebrating the economic recovery and looking for ways to ensure that more of its benefits reach the middle class. <br> Growth is accelerating, inflation is virtually nonexistent, stocks had a great year, unemployment is down and the U.S. economy is the envy of the developed world. That all of this has happened under the leadership of a Democratic president may be inconvenient for GOP leaders, but it’s the reality. Sourpuss grousing about how Obama is somehow “killing jobs” sounds ridiculous and out of touch. It seems to me that a “responsible” majority ought to be able to bring itself to say, “Nice job, Mr. President.” Even if it hurts. <br> Such a majority then should recognize that present economic conditions offer the opportunity to address big structural problems — and that addressing these problems can, in turn, broaden and deepen the recovery. <br> Infrastructure is perhaps the most obvious place to begin. Our airports are getting old. Many of our seaports cannot handle the newest generation of container ships. Thousands of our bridges need to be repaired or replaced. Century-old municipal water systems are breaking down. The electrical grid needs to be more robust and secure. And while we invented the Internet, citizens of other countries enjoy networks with faster speeds and lower costs. <br> Republicans used to agree with Democrats that good economic times offer the opportunity to invest in infrastructure — which creates jobs, both now and in the future. Deficits are falling rapidly and interest rates are at historic lows. What are we waiting for? Shouldn’t a “responsible” Congress have a bill on Obama’s desk by the end of the month? <br> Another subject on which Obama and the Republicans in Congress agree, at least in principle, is the need for corporate tax reform. Obama has acknowledged, and Republicans have long contended, that the current top corporate rate of nearly 40 percent is too high — and that the strategies corporations use to avoid paying those taxes, such as moving their headquarters overseas, are detrimental to the national interest. There is a larger debate to be had about overall tax policy, but couldn’t we just start by lowering the corporate rate and closing the loopholes? <br> Finally, a “responsible” party that’s prepared to govern would have some ideas about how to boost economic mobility, which is what we really mean when we talk about “opportunity.” If Republicans think the American Dream means the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, then no, they’re not remotely ready for prime time. <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 When high-mindedness collides with reality, reality usually wins. Remember this when you hear talk of making the next two years a miracle of bipartisan comity. <br> Begin by being skeptical of the lists of what President Obama and the now Republican-controlled Congress should “obviously” agree on. Notice that liberal lists (including mine) start with immigration and sentencing reform while conservative lists focus on free trade and tax reform. Surprise! The election changed no one’s priorities. <br> And don’t be fooled by anyone who pretends that the 2016 election isn’t at the top of everyone’s calculations. <br> With Washington now so deeply divided philosophically, each side is primarily interested in creating a future government more congenial to getting what it wants. Republicans want to win total power two years from now; Democrats want to hang on to the presidency and take back the Senate. <br> Therefore, don’t misread the internal Republican debate. It is not a fight between pristine souls who just want to show they can govern and fierce ideologues who want to keep fighting. Both GOP camps want to strengthen the conservatives’ hand for 2016. They differ on how best to accomplish this. <br> The pro-governing Republicans favor a “first do no harm” approach. Thus did incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wisely rule out government shutdowns and debt-ceiling brinkmanship. He’s happy to work with Obama on trade because doing so advances a free market goal the GOP believes in — and because a trade battle would explode the Democratic coalition. For Republicans, what’s not to like? <br> The more militant conservatives are more candid about the real objective, which is “building the case for Republican governance after 2016.” Those words come from a must-read editorial in National Review, instructively entitled “The Governing Trap.” <br> “A prove-you-can-govern strategy will inevitably divide the party on the same tea-party-vs.-establishment lines that Republicans have just succeeded in overcoming,” the magazine argued. Also: “If voters come to believe that a Republican Congress and a Democratic president are doing a fine job of governing together, why wouldn’t they vote to continue the arrangement in 2016?” <br> They’re saying, in other words, that spending two more years making Obama look bad should remain the GOP’s central goal, lest Republicans make the whole country ready for Hillary Clinton. This is the prevailing view among conservatives. McConnell’s main argument with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), and his followers is not about ends but means. McConnell is no less focused than Cruz on bringing down Obama and discrediting Democratic governance, but McConnell needs to be more subtle about it. <br> Where does this leave Obama and the Democrats? The first to-do item on Obama’s list must be to repair his currently abysmal relations with his own party on Capitol Hill. He will need his party as the GOP goes after him in one “investigative” hearing after another. He also needs them if he goes ahead, as he should, with executive orders on immigration reform. <br> Obama has already drawn a red line on immigration from which there is no easy retreat. And exit polls explain why Republicans, particularly House Speaker John Boehner, have little reason to act before Obama’s gone. <br> Overall, 57 percent of voters favored granting illegal immigrants “a chance to apply for legal status,” while 39 percent preferred deporting them. But those who favored deportation voted for Republican House candidates by better than 3 to 1. Boehner won’t risk alienating this loyal group. Better for Obama to pick a fight in which he is taking action than to give way to passivity and powerlessness. <br> In the end, Obama needs to govern as best he can even as he and his allies prepare for the longer struggle. <br> Democrats were tongue-tied about economics in the campaign. They avoided highlighting the substantial achievements of the Obama years for fear that doing so would make them seem out of touch with voters whose wages are stagnating. But neither did Democrats come up with plausible answers and policies to win over these voters. They lost both ways. <br> A Democratic Party paralyzed on economics won’t deserve to prevail. The president and his party — including Clinton — must find a way of touting their stewardship while advancing a bold but realistic agenda that meets the demands of Americans who are still hurting. This encompasses not only defending government’s role in achieving shared growth but also, as Obama suggested Friday, restoring faith in how government works. <br> Solving the country’s economic riddle would be a much better use of their time than investing in the fantasy that McConnell and Boehner will try to make Obama look good. <br> Read more from E.J.

 Aaron David Miller is a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former adviser to several secretaries of state. He is the author of “The End of Greatness: Why America Can’t Have (and Doesn’t Want) Another Great President” (Palgrave MacMillan), from which this essay is adapted. <br> All presidents disappoint. It comes with the job, the unreasonable expectations Americans have for their presidents, and the inherent conflict and disconnect between campaigning (promising people all they can have) and governing (explaining to people why they won’t get it). <br> So Barack Obama isn’t the first president to fail to meet expectations — and he won’t be the last. But he has come to embody something else, too: the risks and travails of reaching for greatness in the presidency without the crisis, character and capacity necessary to achieve it. <br> “Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans,” the new president declared in his 2009 inaugural address to a 1.8 million-strong crowd on the Mall. “. . . What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.” <br> From pledging an Earth-moving transformation, Obama has been reduced to hitting singles and getting his lonely paragraph right . After drawing early comparisons to Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy all rolled into one, Obama has fallen so low that journalists wonder whether Jimmy Carter is not a more appropriate parallel. <br> Plenty of explanations have been offered: Republicans have been unwilling to work with him, or the president hasn’t reached out to them. The stimulus was too small, or it was far too big. Health-care reform was a historic achievement, or it was a terrible overreach. The president has tried to be too bipartisan, even post-partisan, or he has not been partisan enough. <br> Time is needed to judge the Obama presidency on its merits and in comparison to other occupants of the Oval Office. Some, like Paul Krugman, have already concluded that Obama is already “one of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in American history.” But however historians and the public ultimately rate Obama, the greatness that he sought — and that was expected of him — will probably not be his. As early as 2011, in an extraordinary comment 
 It has long been accepted by the conventionally wise that the Republican Party is waging a “war on women.” <br> Let’s be clear. The war on women is based on just one thing — abortion rights. While it is true that access to abortion has been restricted in several states owing to Republican efforts, it is not true that women as a whole care only or mostly about abortion. <br> I promise, this isn’t another abortion column, not that the horrific number of abortions performed each year shouldn’t make one’s stomach turn. Instead, extremists on the pro-choice left celebrate the “right” to terminate a 20-week-old fetus. Google an image of this stage of fetal development and try to comprehend the glee we witnessed when state senator Wendy Davis, now running for governor, became the belle du jour upon her filibuster to protect that “right” in Texas. <br> Okay, sorry, so I digressed just a little. But it isn’t possible to dissect the alleged war on women without mentioning abortion, since this is the entire content of the war as defined by savvy Democratic operatives. It was an effective strategy in 2012, aided quite a bit by some of the GOP’s lesser lights and looser tongues, not to mention good ol’ slut-talking Rush. <br> On the latter’s offense, and the silliness of the so-called war in general, I defer to Bill Maher, who recently chastised liberals for their selective outrage regarding women’s rights. <br> “We hear a lot about the Republican ‘war on women.’ It’s not cool Rush Limbaugh called somebody a slut. Okay,” said Maher. “But Saudi women can’t vote, or drive, or hold a job or leave the house without a man. Overwhelming majorities in every Muslim country say a wife is always obliged to obey her husband. That all seems like a bigger issue than evangelical Christian bakeries refusing to make gay wedding cakes.” <br> This selective tendency is also apparent when only certain women are deserving of defense in the public arena. Sarah Palin, whose potential vice presidency I politely opposed for legitimate reasons that are now widely embraced, has been outrageously abused in the vilest terms — by Maher among others — and left to twist in the wind. Yet Sandra Fluke, whose appeal for insurance coverage of birth control prompted Limbaugh to call her a “slut,” was elevated to martyr status and perhaps a political career. <br> A more recent example of a war-on-women event occurred in Virginia’s closely watched congressional race between Democrat John Foust and Republican Barbara Comstock. This time it was a Democratic male attacking a Republican female in, shall we say, the most clueless of terms. Lacking facts or finesse, Foust mused to an audience that Comstock hadn’t ever held a “real job.” <br> Meaning, what, that she’s just a mom ? <br> Even if this were so, and it is not, why should Foust get a pass for such an ignorant, sexist remark? Is any Democratic male — even one who manages to insult while pandering — better than any Republican female? In my experience, a woman who can manage a household and juggle the needs of three children while obtaining a law degree from Georgetown University, as Comstock did, can run a corporation or a nation. <br> Like many working women, Comstock did stay home in the early years to raise her children. She is also whip smart, funny, irreverent and fierce. Her résumé includes such non-cookie­baking activities as serving as a senior aide to Rep. Frank Wolf, whose congressional seat she is pursuing. She currently is serving her third term in the Virginia House of Delegates, where she has advanced legislation to thwart human trafficking and supported several conservative positions related to health-care and tax reform. <br> Yes, she’s conservative. And, yes, she also opposes abortion. Which is to say, she doesn’t quite count in the national movement to elect more women to public office. When a Comstock ad recently called Foust’s comments “sexist, bizarre, insensitive, ignorant,” the 10th District’s Democratic Party tweeted, “If @barbaracomstock were a man, she’d be down 20 pts w women. Her record policies are horrible for women.” <br> No, if Comstock were a man, she wouldn’t have to counter such slander. <br> Virginia voters who oppose Comstock’s legislative record have a clear alternative. But if they cast their ballots for Foust, they’ll be electing a man whose disrespect toward women and the single job only women can do — mothering — is at least as offensive as Limbaugh’s name-calling. <br> On the other hand, maybe Foust and Limbaugh cancel each other out — neutralizing the war that never was. <br> Read more from Kathleen Parker’s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> George Will: Joni Ernst’s Iowa campaign makes quick work of the ‘war on women’ <br> Charles Krauthammer: How to debunk the ‘war on women’ <br> Wendy Davis: Why I stood up for Texas women <br> Kathleen Parker: Rush Limbaugh should apologize to Sandra Fluke <br> Dana Milbank: Antiabortion movement faces a cold reality <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, is the House majority leader. <br> Friday, I become the majority leader of the House of Representatives. As I assume my role, Congress has a 12 percent approval rating. While Washington remains gridlocked, many unfortunately see Congress as an institution full of constant conflict and opposition, not ideas. <br> I do not hide from these criticisms. Congress works for the American people, and if we are to lead, we must have the wisdom to listen. <br> What we hear is anxiety. Americans have not lost faith in themselves, but they are losing faith in their government. <br> It’s not hard to see why. In the past six years, Americans have been promised a lot from their government, including an inexpensive and functioning health-care system and an economic recovery that would create well-paying jobs. <br> But Washington attempted state-run solutions for every problem, and none of its promises have been fulfilled. So in 2010, the people responded to President Obama’s first two years by electing a Republican majority in the House. <br> The people chose Republicans for the same reason I did as a kid. I grew up in a family of Democrats, but I became a Republican because of the party’s commitment to a United States of prosperity and opportunity that isn’t given by government but rather is earned by a free and exceptional people. <br> During the troubles of the mid-1970s, Ronald Reagan insisted that Republicans would raise “a banner of bold colors, no pale pastels. A banner instantly recognizable as standing for certain values which will not be compromised.” We must raise that banner higher today. <br> It’s easy to focus on what’s wrong in this country — joblessness, debt and our standing in the world. But although we’ve been down before, we’ve never stayed that way. <br> Good policies can help the country along, but the true strength of this country rests in the people, not Washington. <br> To this end, my House colleagues and I will work to ensure that Washington empowers Americans by restoring the promise of the American Dream. <br> We must reform our tax code to make it simpler and fairer so that our businesses and families aren’t forced to compete on an unequal playing field. <br> Likewise, we can have North American energy independence and affordable energy for hardworking Americans once we set aside our illogical patchwork of regulations. <br> Top-down meddling inhibits our education system, so we must promote choice and local decision-making to ensure that all students have access to quality education. <br> And, most important, House Republicans will focus on ending legislative relics that breed unaccountability and bureaucratic ineptitude. The House did exactly that this week by passing a strongly bipartisan Veterans Affairs reform bill, as did the Senate. This agreement provides choice for our veterans, a necessary and important step to modernizing the VA. <br> Congress must let go of the stale policies of the past and move government to the 21st century. I have always believed that you must win the argument before you can win the vote. In Congress, committees act as idea factories for policies from both sides, and as majority leader I will commit to the committee process and regular order. <br> Yet even positive debate is challenging in today’s political environment. To help restore civility, I spend a lot of time building relationships with anyone willing to work with me. I sweat alongside members of both parties on morning bike rides I lead to the CO Canal in Georgetown. I talk with Democrats and Republicans on our long flights back to California. The door to my office is always open. <br> Friendships alone won’t break Washington’s logjam, but a sense of mutual respect is necessary for constructive dialogue. <br> So come September, when the House returns to session, we will finish the legislative year focusing on the concerns we’ve heard from our districts and across the nation. We will vote on bipartisan legislation that will encourage job creation and restore American opportunity. The House will assert itself as a co-equal branch of government, as our Founders intended. And we will vote to place sensible checks on the administration’s regulatory overreach so that red tape doesn’t choke our fragile economic recovery. <br> The House doesn’t control Washington, but each and every day we will do our part and urge the Senate and president to do theirs. In my new position, I will work with the House to inspire an America of prosperity and opportunity that places trust not in government, but in the people. <br> Read more on this issue: <br> Dana Milbank: House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has an odd way with words <br> Dana Milbank: In House, priorities — like wisdom and understanding — in short supply <br> The Post’s View: VA bill shows that Congress can work when it faces a powerful constituency <br> The Post’s View: Congress needs to extend unemployment benefits <br> Robert J.

 Ray D. Madoff is a professor at Boston College Law School and the author of “Immortality and the Law: The Rising Power of the American Dead. <br> A central question for leaders confronting our fiscal crisis is fairness in the tax system — in particular, whether the wealthiest Americans are paying their fair share. While there appears — or, at least, appeared — to be some agreement between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner that taxes on the wealthy must go up, the amount of the increase remains undecided. Many argue that the wealthy are already paying a disproportionate share of taxes, a view that new data from the Internal Revenue Service appear to support. Missing from the conversation, however, is an appreciation of the way these data fail to accurately describe the true income of the wealthiest Americans. <br> The IRS recently released its analysis of 2010 tax returns, which shows the allocation of taxes over different income groups. This information is both informative and misleading. According to these latest figures, in 2010 the top 1 percent of earners (those with adjusted gross incomes of at least $369,691) paid about 37 percent of all income taxes but reported just less than 19 percent of all income. Based on these data, the U.S. income tax system looks truly progressive. This lends credence to the view that the wealthy are paying even more than their fair share. <br> But statistics can be only as good as the information on which they are based, and here the data are fundamentally misleading. People pay income tax only on amounts that Congress counts as income. This excludes the sources of revenue most commonly enjoyed by the richest Americans: gifts, inheritances, distributions from trusts and proceeds of life insurance. <br> How much tax-free income do the wealthy enjoy each year? While we can all guess — and common sense tells us that the numbers are significant — we cannot know for sure. This income is not only tax-free, but there also is not even an obligation to report it. <br> To illustrate the perversion of this system, imagine two taxpayers, each earning a salary of $50,000. Suppose, however, that during that same year one of the taxpayers is also the beneficiary of a trust that pays for his mortgage and all other living expenses. Suppose the same taxpayer, during the same year, also receives a $25,000 gift from his aunt and uncle, a $7 million inheritance from one set of grandparents and a $50 million distribution from a life insurance policy from his other grandparents. Even though we can all agree that this taxpayer became significantly more enriched than the other over the course of the year, our income tax system ignores all of this non-salary income and regards both taxpayers as if they were identical. Most surprising, the federal government has expressed no interest in even learning about any of these payments. <br> Estate and gift taxes will play no role, either. These examples fit well within current exemptions, and even Obama’s plan to increase estate and gift taxes would still exclude from taxation all of the transfers cited above. <br> It need not be that way. <br> The decision to track income is separate from the decision to tax it. There are many examples where our income tax system requires taxpayers to report income, even if it is not subject to tax. Income from tax-exempt bonds, distributions from Roth IRAs and capital gains on the sale of a house must all be reported on taxpayers’ annual tax returns even if these amounts are not subject to tax. <br> In addition, items that are deductible — such as charitable donations and mortgage interest — must still be reported to the federal government. This reporting plays a valuable function because it gives the government the ability to determine the cost of excluding these items from taxation. Much of the current focus on the cost of the charitable deduction and the mortgage interest deduction stems from the fact that the government can easily calculate the effect of these deductions on the federal budget. <br> It is time for Congress to shine a light on the types of income most enjoyed by the wealthy. Individuals should be required to report all sources of income, including gifts, inheritances, life insurance and distributions from trusts so that we can begin to assess the impact of these exclusions. <br> Everyone agrees that fairness matters when it comes to income taxes. But we cannot have an honest discussion about tax fairness when we are kept in the dark about how much income people actually receive. Only when full reporting is required can we have an accurate picture of people’s true income. Then we can begin to fashion a tax plan that is fair for all Americans. <br> For more on this topic: <br> Robert J.

 Correction: An earlier version of this editorial reported incorrectly that Virginia has the lowest cigarette tax rate in the nation, at 30 cents a pack. Missouri’s rate, at 17 cents a pack, is lower, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The following version has been updated. <br> MARYLAND HAS one of the highest state-imposed cigarette tax rates in the nation ($2 per pack) and, unsurprisingly, one of the lowest smoking rates. Virginia has one of the lowest cigarette tax rates in the nation (30 cents per pack); its smoking rate is almost 20 percent higher than Maryland’s. <br> America is well past the debate about the health effects of smoking, but tobacco taxes in many states remain low, thanks largely to the influence of tobacco companies. Yet it is clear that higher cigarette taxes have a direct effect on smoking rates, and they are particularly effective in dissuading young people from taking up the habit. <br> In Maryland, where the tax on a pack of cigarettes was raised in 1999 (to 36 cents), 2002 (to $1) and 2008 (to the current rate of $2), smoking rates have fallen by about a third, much faster than the national average. At the time of the last increase, Maryland’s tobacco tax was 6th-highest in the nation; since then it has slipped to 12th as other states have leapfrogged each other in an effort to further discourage smoking — and raise revenue in the process. <br> In Annapolis, public health advocates and other groups are now pushing for another $1 increase, which would bump the state tax in Maryland to $3 per pack. Depending on how much of the increase tobacco companies decide to absorb, that could raise the average retail price of cigarettes above $7; it’s currently around $6.40. <br> The projected benefits of a $1 increase in Maryland make a persuasive case. They include $95 million in additional revenue (which health advocates would like to use to extend Medicaid health coverage to the poor); a 10 percent decrease in the rate of youth smoking; thousands of adults who would be persuaded to quit; and the prevention of thousands of premature deaths, which in turn would produce considerable economic benefits. <br> It’s true that raising the tax would cause more Marylanders to cross the border to buy cigarettes in Virginia or North Carolina. But cigarette sales fell much more dramatically in 2008 in Maryland, the District and Delaware, all of which raised their tobacco taxes that year, than they rose in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia, which did not. And while cigarette smuggling remains an unquantifiable challenge, declining smoking rates and the associated public health payoffs are real. <br> Legislation to raise the tax went nowhere in Annapolis this year, possibly because the state has raised so many other taxes in the last few years. Advocates are mounting a push to gather pledges of support from lawmakers to enact the increase next year. <br> Meanwhile, in Virginia, where the tobacco lobby remains virtually unchallenged, the average price of a pack of cigarettes, about $4.60, is among the lowest in the nation. If Virginia lawmakers want to encourage children to take up the habit, they’re doing a great job. <br> Read more from Opinions: <br> Anthony A.

 Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) is about to become the Rodney Dangerfield of District politics. He won’t get much respect over the next eight months as the city’s lame-duck chief executive — quack, quack. Some D.C. Council members suggested they would give due deference to him and his position. But that was polite rhetoric, destined for the nearest trash heap. <br> The dissing of Gray began this week, as the council started its deliberation of his proposed $10.7 billion fiscal 2015 budget and multi-year financial plan. In the past, the process, which continues through May, has been contentious. But this year the tensions between the mayor and council are certain to be amplified as political careers and futures play an outsize role. <br> Some council members also are permanently exiting the scene after losing primary contests; they surely will seek to use the process to carve out legacies. Others still in campaign mode may engage in blatant pandering to voters. Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) and David Catania (I-At Large), both vying to become the city’s next mayor, undoubtedly will seek to elevate their profiles as they prepare to face off in a November general-election smackdown. <br> Gray’s budget, a hodgepodge of policy initiatives and programs, seems to have been developed with reelection in mind. There is something in it for just about every key voting bloc, particularly public school parents and advocates, affordable housing stalwarts, senior citizens and business owners. And out of nowhere he has proposed a public hospital for the campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital in far Southeast. <br> “That’s not going anywhere,” said council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who heads the Committee on Finance and Revenue. Wall Street has consistently warned the city about remaining in the hospital business. “They want us out of it; every rating agency was very clear.” <br> Catania, known for taking a jackhammer to budget proposals, told me, “There is no cogent or coherent vision for this budget. It isn’t taking us anywhere. It’s a chicken in every pot.” He was concerned that Gray proposed to spend education-modernization money on building large high schools while neglecting improvements at middle schools for which residents are clamoring. <br> Gray has provided ample opportunity for disagreements and controversy: He only half-embraced important tax reforms recommended by a commission headed by former mayor Anthony A. Williams. Gray has suggested repealing funding for arts organizations; failed to provide money to implement the D.C. Promise scholarship program, which would provide financial aid for graduating high school students to attend college; and offered a series of capital improvement projects that takes the city excruciatingly close to its mandated 12 percent debt ceiling. <br> More egregious, the mayor proposed using $104 million from this year’s budget to help balance next year’s plan. He also estimated about $200 million in savings, supposedly from contracting and procurement reforms, to prop up the 2016 budget. Those kinds of tricks are reminiscent of the “fifth-quarter” to the tax year created back in the 1990s by former mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly to camouflage fiscal woes. The District may not be in financial trouble, but in his statement Monday Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey DeWitt indicated that “over the past year, overall employment located in the District has slowed, and commercial office vacancies have risen slightly while rents have weakened.” That trend is directly related to federal cuts. While it might get better over time, during the period covered by the financial plan, it could mean fewer of those big surpluses the city has been experiencing. <br> “This is one-time money to pay for ongoing costs. It’s unclear how this practice represents the most prudent use of [the public’s] money,” said council Chairman Phil Mendelson, signaling that those alternative balancing strategies probably will be jettisoned from the final document. <br> Gray seemed willing to work with legislators to make changes to the budget. Truth be told, he might consider redoing the entire proposal. With his loss to Bowser in the April 1 Democratic primary, his budget becomes part of his legacy construction — except as written, it’s all unfinished business or the continuation of projects that predated him. There are few final touches. <br> He can’t complete Skyland Town Center in eight months. He can’t build a soccer stadium; his administration is still trying to finalize the needed land deals. He has helped modernize some schools and recreation centers, but much of that began under his predecessor, as did the development of the city’s network of bike lanes and street cars. Affordable housing, while often discussed, is an unrealized dream. There is his prekindergarten program. <br> Maybe the council could facilitate Gray’s legacy mission, finding something in the budget on which his imprimatur could be stamped. Otherwise, his greatest legacy will be ethics and campaign finance reform, which, in fairness, he would have to share with his former colleagues: disgraced former council members Harry Thomas Jr., Kwame Brown and Michael Brown. <br> Of course, that would be a sad epilogue to Gray’s political career, which began with enormous promise. <br> jonetta@jonettarosebarras.com <br> Read more about this issue: <br> Jonetta Rose Barras: Vincent Gray comes pandering for votes <br> Colbert I.

 An ugly outbreak of whiny victimhood is ravaging some of America’s most exclusive Zip codes. It’s as if some 1 percenters suddenly fear that old warning: “When the people shall have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich.” <br> Not to worry. The hoi polloi would much rather have a Big Mac — and also a job that pays a living wage, with sick leave, health insurance, vacation time and retirement. There was a time when even rich people agreed that these were laudable ambitions. Now, working to put these goals within reach of more Americans amounts to persecution of the wealthy, according to besieged 1 percenters and their defenders. <br> Last week, in a now-infamous letter to the Wall Street Journal, legendary San Francisco venture capitalist Tom Perkins compared “the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the ‘rich’ ” to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. He went so far as to warn that an anti-rich “Kristallnacht” may be coming, referring to the night in 1938 when Jewish-owned stores, homes, hospitals, schools and synagogues were smashed throughout Germany and Austria. <br> As evidence, Perkins cited the Occupy movement; the fact that some people resent how Silicon Valley tech workers have driven up real estate prices and how they ride to work in special buses; and the “demonization of the rich embedded in virtually every word of our local newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle.” He cited the Chronicle’s having called novelist Danielle Steel a “snob” despite her charity work. He neglected to mention that Steel is his former wife. <br> Perkins later apologized for the Kristallnacht reference but stuck to the rest of his thesis. He told Bloomberg TV that the solution to inequality is lower taxes, said he understands his critics because “I have members of my own family in trailer parks, not immediate relatives but family,” and added, “The fact that everyone now hates me is part of the game.” <br> The whole episode could be easily dismissed. If I had a dollar for every crank letter to the editor that gets published, I’d be as rich as Perkins and maybe as delusional. <br> But on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal weighed in with an editorial headlined “Perkinsnacht.” The newspaper wholeheartedly endorsed Perkins’s thesis — that there is what he called “a rising tide of hatred of the successful one percent” — while expressing reservations only about his “unfortunate, albeit provocative” language. <br> Oh dear. I know several members of the Journal’s editorial board personally, and while we often disagree, it’s not as if they are raving lunatics. They are just believers in capitalism (which is great) and trickle-down economic policy (which by now should be thoroughly discredited). So I began to wonder: Why does the national conversation we’re beginning to have about inequality make some conservatives take leave of their senses? Why does it make them spout nonsense about “personal vilification” and the “abuse of government power.” <br> The answer, I believe, is traction. I think the crazy, hair-on-fire rhetoric means that progressives are making progress in winning support for policies designed to lessen inequality. <br> Tax cuts and deregulation have dominated federal policy since the 1980s; during this time, inequality has spiraled out of control. If conservatives have nothing better to sell than more tax cuts and more deregulation, it’s no wonder that people are tuning in to what the other side has to say. <br> Income tax rates for the highest earners remain quite low, in historical terms, while earnings on capital gains — including some “gains” that look a lot like regular income — have been taxed at a measly 15 or 20 percent. Advocating that taxes be raised for the wealthy is not a personal attack on anyone; that includes you, Mr. Perkins, and Ms. Steel as well. It is a policy proposal. No, it wouldn’t solve all the government’s fiscal problems. But yes, it would provide significant revenue while making our tax scheme more progressive and, in the eyes of most people, more fair. And yes, fairness counts. <br> The fabulously wealthy need love, too. But they’ll get more of it if they stop congratulating themselves for all their hard work and realize that poor people work hard, too, sometimes at two or three jobs, and struggle to put food on the table. <br> Relax, Mr. Perkins, they’re not coming for you. They’re waiting for non-special buses to take them to the grocery store. <br> Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

 All hail Grover Norquist! <br> Bow down, Lindsey Graham. The Republican senator from South Carolina dared to say he might consider supporting a tax increase — but then Norquist paid him a visit on Wednesday. “Every once in a while you have somebody with an impure thought like Lindsey Graham,” Norquist told me. But after their talk, Norquist could report that “Graham will never vote for a tax increase.” <br> Kneel before him, Tom Coburn. The Republican senator from Oklahoma had toyed with the idea of supporting a deficit-reduction deal that includes some tax increases, before Norquist conquered him. “He had a moment of weakness where he thought you had to raise taxes to get spending restraint,” Norquist said. “He now knows that’s not true.” <br> Prostrate yourselves, House Republicans. On Thursday, a day after Republican senators hosted Norquist on their side of the Capitol, GOP House members opened up the Ways and Means Committee room so that he could counsel them on The Pledge, an anti-tax edict written by Norquist and signed by all but four House Republicans, most Republican senators and Mitt Romney. <br> Lawmakers leaving their private audience with Norquist were agog at his majesty. “I agree with him tremendously,” reported Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). <br> But Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on Ways and Means, had a less favorable view of the spectacle as he stood in the hallway while Republicans in the committee room kissed Norquist’s ring. <br> “They’re in this committee room to hold royal court for the person who has asked people to take a pledge . . . not their constituents,” Levin complained. “Essentially, Norquist is here to hold feet to the fire when we need open minds.” <br> Norquist doesn’t dispute that. The tax-pledge effort he began a quarter-century ago is now the defining mantra of the party: no tax increases, no how, no way, no matter the consequences. With the possible exception of Newt Gingrich, Norquist has done more than anybody to bring about Washington’s political dysfunction. <br> Since he began, the federal debt has increased roughly eightfold. But Norquist still believes that as soon as next year victory will be his — all because of his pledge. <br> “Because almost all the Republicans took it, it became, actually, the branding of the party,” Norquist told me Thursday. <br> Although I think Norquist’s approach has been disastrous for the country, I am awed by his success with the pledge. Now Senate Democrats are trying to turn him into the GOP bogeyman of this election cycle. <br> “The leader of the Republican Party is up here today on the Hill. . . . You know who it is: It’s Grover Norquist,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said at a news conference Thursday, a couple of days after charging, with some validity, that Norquist “has the entire Republican Party in the palm of his hand.” <br> Norquist didn’t quarrel with the charge, as Fox News’s Chad Pergram put it to him, that he’s giving Republicans “their marching orders.” <br> “The modern Republican Party works with the taxpayer movement,” he replied, satisfied that “post-pledge, post-tea party, they’re not going to raise taxes.” <br> That’s probably because Norquist has convinced them that the long-sought victory is just months away. He predicts that Republicans will keep control of the House, take over the Senate, elect Romney president and promptly enact the Ryan budget. “It would be nice if some Democrats join, but it’s not necessary,” he said, arguing that the plan crafted by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could clear the Senate with only 50 votes as part of the budget “reconciliation” process. <br> This seems unlikely. Even if they could use the procedure Norquist favors (anti-deficit rules make this difficult) Republicans would have to make their plan temporary, like the George W. Bush tax cuts. And the backlash is likely to make the Obamacare rebellion look tame. We’d quickly be back in the stalemate. <br> But Norquist’s loyalists in Congress are holding their ranks, dutifully coordinating talking points with him after their private tutorial Thursday on “how the pledge should be communicated.” <br> “We have a spending problem, and the taxpayer pledge helps us focus on the problem,” House conservative leader Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told reporters as he departed. <br> “The problem in Washington is spending,” echoed Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.). <br> Finally, out came the 55-year-old Norquist, all of 5-foot-6 with a graying beard. He spoke expansively to reporters for more than half an hour, waving off the notion that he might be becoming a PR problem for the party. <br> “There are significantly more Republicans in Congress since they started taking the pledge,” he said. “The advocates of spending more and taxing more are losing.” <br> Losing?

 What might a reasonable, constructive presidential campaign look like? <br> To ask the question invites immediate dissent because we probably can’t even agree across philosophical or political lines what “reasonable” and “constructive” mean. <br> But let’s try an experiment: Can we at least reach consensus on the sort of debate between now and November that could help us solve some of our problems? I’ll let you in on the outcome in advance: Ideology quickly gets in the way of even this modest effort. <br> Start out by defining goals everyone could rally around. We need to get the economy moving faster and bring unemployment down, an all-the-more-urgent imperative after last week’s disappointing jobs report. We want all Americans to share prosperity and to reverse the trend toward widening inequality. We want a sustainable budget where, in good times, revenue more or less matches expenditures. And we want an education system that prepares members of the next generation for productive and rewarding lives. <br> Notice a few things about this list. It does not include social issues. Many Americans on both sides of politics legitimately believe that matters such as abortion, gay marriage, gun control, contraception and religious liberty (I could mention others) are of absolutely central concern. Some of them would reject my agenda at the outset. I’d defend it by insisting that the vast majority of Americans, whatever their views on any of these vexing subjects, want to get to certain basics first. They know the social issues won’t go away. <br> Conservatives might rebel against the way I frame our objectives. In talking about the budget, I do not even bring up reducing taxes. That is because I think the evidence shows that if we are serious about balancing the budget, government needs more revenue. The brute facts of (1) the steady rise in the costs of health care and (2) the aging of the baby boomers mean that we can’t just hack our way to a balanced budget without eviscerating programs such as Medicare and Social Security that most Americans want. <br> Thus a challenge to conservatives: If cutting taxes is really more important to you than fiscal balance, why not just say so? Why pretend that balance matters when your real goal is a sharp reduction in the size of government? Alternatively, if we could agree that revenue is needed, let’s argue about the right mix between spending cuts and tax increases, and about which taxes to raise. <br> And can politicians and commentators stop hiding behind vague promises of “tax reform”? Offer specifics or shut up about tax reform. Let’s also agree that slashing programs for poor people — and I’m one who thinks we should spend more — won’t come anywhere close to resolving our fiscal difficulties. <br> Job creation is at the heart of the campaign, and it is the issue about which we will have the least clarity. To me (and, I would say, to most non-ideological economists), it is perfectly obvious that rolling back government, both here and in Europe, has been exactly the wrong thing to do in a time of high unemployment. To save words, I refer you to a pile of fact-rich Paul Krugman columns. <br> The unemployment numbers would be much better without the massive loss of government jobs, and private-sector job growth would, in turn, be higher as those public workers spent money. It would be helpful if conservatives who disagree would offer evidence for why they are so certain that government austerity will make things better. <br> I’d like to hope we’ll get somewhere on education, but as for rising inequality, many on the right don’t even think it’s a problem. So let’s debate over whether greater inequality impedes faster growth or promotes it. Again, I think the evidence shows that when inequality gets out of hand (see 1929 and now), it’s a drag on the whole economy. Forgive me for noting that conservatives seem to believe that the rich will work harder if we give them more, and the poor will work harder if we give them less. But let’s have it out. Arguing in a serious way about the single question of economic inequality would make all the other nonsense of the next five months endurable. <br> What I do know is that if we don’t use this campaign at least to define the problems we face, we will end up wasting the $2 billion or so this campaign will cost, and a lot of time. <br> ejdionne@washpost.com <br> Read more about this debate from Opinions: <br> Ed Rogers: The referendum on Obama is coming <br> Eugene Robinson: Romney’s pants on fire <br> Fareed Zakaria: The right economic investment for America <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 President Obama is demanding a big long-term budget deal. He won’t sign anything less, he warns, asking, “If not now, when?” <br> How about last December, when he ignored his own debt commission’s recommendations? How about February, when he presented a budget that increases debt by $10 trillion over the next decade? How about April, when he sought a debt-ceiling increase with zero debt reduction attached? <br> All of a sudden he’s a born-again budget balancer prepared to bravely take on his own party by making deep cuts in entitlements. Really? Name one. He’s been saying forever that he’s prepared to discuss, engage, converse about entitlement cuts. But never once has he publicly proposed a single structural change to any entitlement. <br> Hasn’t the White House leaked that he’s prepared to raise the Medicare age or change the cost-of-living calculation? <br> Anonymous talk is cheap. Leaks are designed to manipulate. Offers are floated and disappear. <br> Say it, Mr. President. Give us one single structural change in entitlements. In public. <br> As part of the pose as the forward-looking grown-up rising above all the others who play politics, Obama insists upon a long-term deal. And what is Obama’s definition of long-term? Surprise: An agreement that gets him past Nov. 6, 2012. <br> Nothing could be more political. It’s like his Afghan surge wind-down date. September 2012 has no relation to any military reality on the ground. It is designed solely to position Obama favorably going into the last weeks of his reelection campaign. <br> Yet the Olympian above-the-fray no-politics-here pose is succeeding. A pliant press swallows the White House story line: the great compromiser (“clearly exasperated,” sympathized a Post news story) being stymied by Republican “intransigence” (the noun actually used in another front-page Post news story to describe the Republican position on taxes). <br> The meme having been established, Republicans have been neatly set up to take the fall if a deal is not reached by Aug. 2. Obama is already waving the red flag, warning ominously that Social Security, disabled veterans’ benefits, “critical” medical research, food inspection — without which agriculture shuts down — are in jeopardy. <br> The Republicans are being totally outmaneuvered. The House speaker appears disoriented. It’s time to act. Time to call Obama’s bluff. <br> A long-term deal or nothing? The Republican House should immediately pass a short-term debt-ceiling hike of $500 billion containing $500 billion in budget cuts. That would give us about five months to work on something larger. <br> The fat-cat tax breaks (those corporate jets) that Obama’s talking points endlessly recycle? Republicans should call for urgent negotiations on tax reform along the lines of the Simpson-Bowles commission that, in one option, strips out annually $1.1 trillion of deductions, credits and loopholes while lowering tax rates across the board to a top rate of 23 percent. The president says he wants tax reform, doesn’t he? Well, Mr. President, here are five months to do so. <br> Will the Democratic Senate or the Democratic president refuse this offer and allow the country to default — with all the cataclysmic consequences that the Democrats have been warning about for months — because Obama insists on a deal that is 10 months and seven days longer? <br> That’s indefensible and transparently self-serving. Dare the president to make that case. Dare him to veto — or the Democratic Senate to block — a short-term debt-limit increase. <br> This is certainly better than the McConnell plan, which would simply throw debt reduction back to the president. But if the House cannot do Plan A, McConnell is the fallback Plan B. <br> After all, by what crazy calculation should Republicans allow themselves to be blamed for a debt crisis that could destabilize the economy and even precipitate a double-dip recession? Right now, Obama owns the economy and its 9.2 percent unemployment, 1.9 percent GDP growth and exploding debt about which he’s done nothing. Why bail him out by sharing ownership? <br> You cannot govern this country from one house. Republicans should have learned that from the 1995-96 Gingrich-Clinton fight when the GOP controlled both houses and still lost. <br> If conservatives really want to get the nation’s spending under control, the only way is to win the presidency. Put the question to the country and let the people decide. To seriously jeopardize the election now in pursuit of a long-term, small-government, Ryan-like reform that is inherently unreachable without control of the White House may be good for the soul. But it could very well wreck the cause. 
 In 1983, the British Labor Party under the hard-left Michael Foot issued a 700-page manifesto so radical that one colleague called it “the longest suicide note in history.” House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has just released a recklessly bold, 73-page, 10-year budget plan. At 37 footnotes, it might be the most annotated suicide note in history. <br> That depends on whether (a) President Obama counters with a deficit-reduction plan of equal seriousness, rather than just demagoguing the Ryan plan till next Election Day, (b) there are any Republicans beyond the measured, super-wonky Ryan who can explain and defend a plan of such daunting scope and complexity, and (c) Americans are serious people. <br> My guesses: No. Not really. And I hope so (we will find out definitively in November 2012). <br> The conventional line of attack on Ryan’s plan is already taking shape: It cuts poverty programs and “privatizes” Medicare in order to cut taxes for the rich. <br> Major demagoguery on all three counts. <br> (1) The reforms of the poverty programs are meant to change an incentive structure that today perversely encourages states to inflate the number of dependents (because the states then get more “free” federal matching money) and also encourages individuals to stay on the dole. The 1996 welfare reform was similarly designed to reverse that entitlement’s powerful incentives to dependency. Ryan’s idea is to extend the same logic of rewarding work to the non-cash parts of the poverty program — from food stamps to public housing. <br> When you hear this being denounced as throwing the poor in the snow, remember that these same charges were hurled with equal fury in 1996. President Clinton’s own assistant health and human services secretary, Peter Edelman, resigned in protest, predicting that abolishing welfare would throw a million children into poverty. On the contrary. Within five years child poverty had declined by more than 2.5 million — one of the reasons the 1996 welfare reform is considered one of the social policy successes of our time. <br> (2) Critics are describing Ryan’s Medicare reform as privatization, a deliberately loaded term designed to instantly discredit the idea. Yet the idea is essentially to apply to all of Medicare the system under which Medicare Part D has been such a success: a guaranteed insurance subsidy. Thus instead of paying the health provider directly (fee-for-service), Medicare would give seniors about $15,000 of “premium support,” letting the recipient choose among a menu of approved health insurance plans. <br> Call this privatization if you like, but then would you call the Part D prescription benefit “privatized”? If so, there’s a lot to be said for it. Part D is both popular and successful. It actually beat its cost projections — a near miraculous exception to just about every health-care program known to man. <br> Under Ryan’s plan, everyone 55 and over is unaffected. Younger workers get the insurance subsidy starting in 2022. By eventually ending the current fee-for-service system that drives up demand and therefore prices, this reform is far more likely to ensure the survival of Medicare than the current near-insolvent system. <br> (3) The final charge — cutting taxes for the rich — is the most scurrilous. That would be the same as calling the Ronald Reagan-Bill Bradley 1986 tax reform “cutting taxes for the rich.” In fact, it was designed for revenue neutrality. It cut rates — and for everyone — by eliminating loopholes, including corrupt exemptions and economically counterproductive tax expenditures, to yield what is generally considered by left and right an extraordinarily successful piece of economic legislation. <br> Ryan’s plan is classic tax reform — which even Obama says the country needs: It broadens the tax base by eliminating loopholes that, in turn, provide the revenue for reducing rates. Tax reform is one of those rare public policies that produce social fairness and economic efficiency at the same time. For both corporate and individual taxes, Ryan’s plan performs the desperately needed task of cleaning out the myriad of accumulated cutouts and loopholes that have choked the tax code since 1986. <br> Ryan’s overall plan tilts at every windmill imaginable, including corporate welfare and agricultural subsidies. The only thing left out is Social Security. Which proves only that Ryan is not completely suicidal. <br> But the blueprint is brave and profoundly forward-looking. It seeks nothing less than to adapt the currently unsustainable welfare state to the demographic realities of the 21st century. Will it survive the inevitable barrage of mindless, election-driven, 30-second attack ads (see above)? Alternate question: Does Obama have half of Ryan’s courage? <br> I think not (on both counts). But let’s hope so. 
 WHAT HAVE House Republicans managed to accomplish in a week of government shutdown? <br> Damage the livelihood of millions of Americans? Check. Government secretaries, food-truck operators, cleaners who work in motels near national parks: They’re all hurting. <br> Waste billions of taxpayer dollars? Check. It costs a lot to shut agencies, Web sites and parks, and it will cost a lot to reopen them. Meanwhile, the House has voted to pay the salaries, eventually, of hundreds of thousands of employees whom it has ordered not to work. That’s an odd way to manage an enterprise. <br> Interfere with key government operations? Check. The National Transportation Safety Board can’t investigate an accident last weekend on Metro’s Red Line that claimed the life of a worker. That could make future accidents more likely. On the other side of the world, U.S. allies from Tokyo to Singapore are wondering whether they can rely on a nation whose president has to go AWOL from a key summit meeting in their region. <br> Rattle the markets, slow an economy in recovery, interrupt potentially lifesaving research at the National Institutes of Health? Check, check and check. <br> Derail the hated Obamacare? Ch . . . — oh, no, wait a minute. That was the GOP’s ostensible purpose for this travesty of misgovernment, but the online insurance markets created by that law opened on schedule last week and continue to operate. In fact, the Republicans managed only to distract attention from the computer glitches that would have gobbled up all the news attention if the government weren’t shut. <br> In a revealing moment Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” host George Stephanopoulos replayed a clip from last year in whichHouse Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) explained the foolishness of the tactic that he is now, a year later, pursuing. “It’s pretty clear that the president was reelected,” Mr. Boehner said then. “Obamacare is the law of the land. If we were to put Obamacare into the CR [continuing resolution] and send it over to the Senate, we were risking shutting down the government. That is not our goal.” <br> Cowed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and bullied by the most conservative members of his caucus, Mr. Boehner has done exactly what he said made no sense. Now he doesn’t know how to get out of the predicament. A shutdown is bad; a default on the debt, which looms 10 days from now, could be catastrophic. The speaker is demanding that President Obama negotiate, while setting “red lines” for those hypothetical talks (“Very simple. We’re not raising taxes.”). It’s not an impressive strategy. <br> At some point, Mr. Obama and the Democrats will have to throw the speaker a lifeline. As tempted as they may be to see the Republicans blamed for economic disaster, giving the Democrats a chance to recapture the House in 2014, the potential damage to the nation is too great — and Americans could end up blaming everyone who seems to have a hand in this mess. A temporary extension of the debt ceiling, a reopening of the government and a commitment to engage in a process that leads to budget and tax reform: The ingredients of a deal are there. <br> But throwing a lifeline is pointless until the victim realizes he may be drowning. It’s not clear the Republicans have reached that point. The danger is they will take the country down with them. <br> Read more about this topic: <br> E.J. Dionne Jr.: The tea party’s last stand 
 Heraldo Muñoz is an assistant secretary-general of the United Nations and the United Nations Development Program director for Latin America and the Caribbean. He is the author of “The Dictator’s Shadow: Life Under Augusto Pinochet.” <br> Forty years after Chile’s dreadful 9/11, when Gen. Augusto Pinochet overthrew democratically elected President Salvador Allende, Americans still ask me: Wasn’t he responsible for the economic miracle that made Chile a success story? <br> After the coup in Egypt in July, a Wall Street Journal editorial argued that “Egyptians would be lucky if their new ruling generals turn out to be in the mold of Chile’s Augusto Pinochet,” who, it said, “hired free-market reformers and midwifed a transition to democracy.” Some years ago, Jonah Goldberg made a similar argument in a Los Angeles Times column titled “Iraq needs a Pinochet.” <br> As an established Pinochet opponent, I can affirm that he personified a disturbing contradiction. He won praise for transforming the economy, operated by the “Chicago Boys” (Chilean students of Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago), into the most prosperous in Latin America. He encouraged export growth, removed trade barriers, established an independent central bank able to control interest and exchange rates, and privatized social security and state companies. Chile became the Washington Consensus model for countries seeking to put their house in order. <br> The main problem for Pinochet’s apologists was his brutality and corruption. This is why, although the U.S. government intervened to destabilize Allende before and after he came to power and initially backed Pinochet, the dictator never found lasting friendship in Washington. If only he had modernized Chile’s economy without assassinating, torturing and exiling tens of thousands of dissidents and getting caught hiding offshore bank accounts. What seems to matter for some Pinochet defenders is that, much like Mussolini, he made the trains run on time. <br> It should be noted, however, that the groundwork for Pinochet’s economic modernization of Chile was laid by his predecessors under democratic rule. Land reform in the 1960s and early ’70s broke up inefficient semi-feudal estates, allowing the military regime to stimulate an export-oriented economy driven by large-scale agricultural production. Some aspects of Chile’s modernization began around 1920. By the 1973 coup, most Chileans enjoyed a high level of education (the illiteracy rate was less than 10 percent in 1970), and malnutrition and infant mortality had been declining for decades. Chilean universities were among the best in the Americas; the country’s central bank, Internal Revenue Service and General Comptroller’s Office were all solid state institutions. <br> Could Chile have reached prosperity without Pinochet? My answer is yes. Many Latin American countries that endured economic crises in the 1970s and ’80s, including Brazil and Peru, introduced tough economic reforms — not without vigorous opposition. <br> A Pinochet-type regime is not a necessary evil. No nation needs a tyrant to modernize and attain well-being. As Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa has written, reforms imposed by dictatorships always result in “atrocities that leave civic and ethical sequels infinitely costlier than the status quo.” In the end, economic liberty seldom thrives in the absence of political freedom. <br> The return of democracy in 1990 started to remedy the social costs of the Pinochet era. In the next two decades, Chile grew at more than 5 percent per year, almost doubling its growth rates of the three previous decades. Meanwhile, Chile’s poverty rate plummeted from 40.8 percent in 1990 to 9.9 percent in 2011; meat consumption increased from about 80 pounds per capita in 1990 to about 186 pounds; the share of homes with refrigerators jumped from 55 percent to 92 percent; the share of homes with washing machines rocketed from 37 percent to 82 percent. But U.N. Development Program data from 2010 show that Chile is still among the 15 most unequal countries in the world, though subsidies soften the gross gap in income inequality. <br> Chile’s social miracle is yet to come. To reduce social and economic inequalities, efforts need to be made toward affordable, quality education and tax reform. Recent street demonstrations in Chile and elsewhere in the region are being led by the new middle classes. Highly indebted and frustrated by lingering inequalities, they feel vulnerable and are demanding efficient public services and decent treatment. <br> Like the various identities Pinochet used in his secret bank accounts, he means different things to different groups. Some will continue to underscore that he championed economic reforms that transformed Chile and influenced other nations. <br> Ultimately, however, Pinochet should be remembered more as a notorious symbol of repression than an economic reformer. One symbol of a new era came two months ago when the name of Santiago’s September 11 Avenue, designated to celebrate the date of Pinochet’s 1973 coup, was finally changed, thanks to the initiative of a mayor new to politics. Although his long shadow remains, the Pinochet days are over. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 There has been a strong and troubling shift in market rewards for a small minority relative to the rewards available to most citizens. A recent Congressional Budget Office study found that incomes of the top 1 percent of the U.S. population (adjusted for inflation) rose 275 percent from 1979 to 2007, while income for the middle class grew only 40 percent. Even this dismal figure overstates the fortunes of typical Americans. In 1965, only one in 20 men ages 25 to 54 was not working; by the end of this decade, it is likely to be one in six, even if a full cyclical recovery is achieved. <br> Another calculation suggests that if the income distribution had remained constant from 1979 to 2007, incomes of the top 1 percent would be 59 percent, or $780,000, lower and that incomes among the bottom 80 percent would be 21 percent, or more than $10,000, higher. <br> Those looking to remain serene in the face of these trends or who favor policies that would disproportionately cut taxes at the high end — and exacerbate inequality — assert that snapshot inequality is all right as long as there is mobility within people’s lifetimes and across generations. In fact, there is too little of both. Inequality in lifetime incomes is only marginally smaller than inequality in a single year. And intergenerational mobility in the United States is now poor by international standards. <br> Why has the top 1 percent done so well relative to the rest? The answer lies substantially in changes in technology and in globalization. When George Eastman revolutionized photography, he did very well, and because he needed a large number of Americans to carry out his vision, the city of Rochester, N.Y., had a thriving middle class for two generations. When Steve Jobs revolutionized personal computing, he and Apple shareholders did very well, but those shareholders are all over the world, and a much smaller benefit flowed to middle-class American workers, both because production was outsourced and because the production of computers and software was not terribly labor-intensive. <br> The market system distributes rewards increasingly inequitably. On one side, the debate is framed in zero-sum terms, and the disappointing lack of income growth for middle-class workers is blamed on the success of the wealthy. Those with this view should consider whether it would be better if the United States had more, or fewer, entrepreneurs like those who founded Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook. Each did contribute significantly to rising inequality. It is easy to resent the level and extent of the increase in CEO salaries, but firms that have a single owner, such as private equity firms, pay successful chief executives more than public companies do. And for all their problems, American global companies have done very well compared with those headquartered in more egalitarian societies over the past two decades. Where great fortunes are earned by providing great products or services that benefit large numbers of people, they should not be denigrated. <br> Meanwhile, those who call concerns about rising inequality misplaced or a product of class warfare are even further off base. The extent of the change in the income distribution is such that it is no longer true that the overall growth rate of the economy is the principal determinant of middle-class income growth — how the growth pie is distributed is at least equally important. The observation that most of the increase in inequality reflects gains for those at the very top at the expense of everyone else further belies the idea that simply strengthening the economy will reduce inequality. Focusing on American competitiveness, as many urge, could easily exacerbate inequality while doing little for most Americans if the focus is placed on measures such as corporate tax cuts or the protection of intellectual property for the benefit of companies that are not primarily producing in the United States. <br> We need more and better responses to rising inequality. Here are three places to start. <br> First, government must not facilitate increases in inequality by rewarding the wealthy with special concessions. Where governments dispose of assets or allocate licenses, preference should be on the use of auctions to which all have access. Where government provides implicit or explicit insurance, premiums should be based on the market rather than in consultation with the affected industry. Government’s general posture should be standing up for capitalism rather than for well-connected capitalists. <br> Second, there is scope for pro-fairness, pro-growth tax reform. The moment when more great fortunes are being created and the federal deficit is growing is hardly the time for the estate tax to be eviscerated. And there is no reason tax changes in a period of sharply rising inequality should reinforce the trends in pretax incomes produced by the marketplace. <br> Third, the public sector must ensure greater equity in areas of the most fundamental importance. It will always be the case in a market economy that some will have mansions, art, etc. More troubling is that middle-class students’ ability to attend college has been seriously compromised by increasing tuitions and sharp cutbacks at public universities, and that, over the past generation, a gap has opened between the life expectancy of the affluent and the ordinary. <br> Neither the politics of polarization nor those of noblesse oblige on behalf of the fortunate will serve to protect the interests of the middle class in the post-industrial economy. <br> The writer, a professor and past president at Harvard University, was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 As the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (widely known as the “supercommittee”) begins its work, many have asked what we would counsel based on our work last year as co-chairmen of the president’s fiscal commission. We can summarize this advice in seven words: Go big, be bold and be smart. <br> The stakes for this committee are very high. If the panel is unable to reach agreement on a credible deficit-reduction plan, and the across-the-board cuts agreed to in the August debt-ceiling deal are allowed to take effect, the consequences to our economy and our political system would be serious, if not devastating. Such an outcome would produce not only bad policy, by cutting spending indiscriminately without setting priorities, but would further undermine public and market confidence in the political system’s ability to resolve problems. <br> Given the tremendous challenges the committee faces and the dire consequences of failure, some have questioned why we and others have called on its members to reach an agreement that goes well beyond the goal of $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction. We believe that going big could actually improve the chances of success, in terms of the politics and the economics of debt reduction. <br> We have called for at least $4 trillion in savings because it is the minimum amount of deficit reduction necessary to stabilize the U.S. debt and put it on a downward path as a percentage of gross domestic product. A package that achieved $1.5 trillion in savings would generate a great deal of opposition from affected constituencies but would still leave in place a large and growing debt burden. <br> When we presented our co-chairmen’s proposal to the rest of the fiscal commission in November, Washington insiders were shocked that we so aggressively exceeded our mandate. They were sure that the proposal would need to be scaled back to get a majority vote. It turned out that the opposite was true. The more comprehensive we made it, the easier our job became. The tougher our proposal, the more people came aboard. <br> Commission members were willing to take on their sacred cows and fight special interests — but only if they saw others doing the same and if what they were voting for solved the country’s problems. This spirit of shared sacrifice gained us broad bipartisan support, spanning from Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin to Republican Sen. Tom Coburn. We would not have garnered that type of support had we not taken on defense, domestic programs, the solvency of Social Security, health care, and spending in the tax code all at once. <br> The supercommittee’s work is not simply arithmetic. Its members must be smart in how they achieve savings. They should avoid making immediate deep cuts that would jeopardize our fragile economic recovery. They need to set priorities, such as reducing lower-priority spending while preserving funding for key investments necessary to compete in a knowledge-based global economy. And they should not make cuts that would harm the disadvantaged. <br> We are encouraged that President Obama has embraced the goal of stabilizing the debt and the target of achieving at least $4 trillion in deficit reduction. Unfortunately, his proposal falls short of this goal by counting war savings that were already planned; and while it does (barely) stabilize the debt, it does so at a dangerously high level and with no margin for error. We are disappointed, too, that the president did not address the long-term solvency of Social Security. Nonetheless, it represents a step forward. <br> The president has said that he won’t support major cuts to entitlements unless the package includes additional revenue, but the opposite must be true as well. The president must be willing to support real savings in entitlements that deal with long-term costs. We can’t simply cut or tax our way out of this problem. Bringing our debt under control will require tackling the growth of entitlements and reforming the tax code to promote economic growth and generate enough revenue to meet our commitments. <br> The work done by our commission and others has shown that it is possible to reform entitlement programs in a way that preserves and even strengthens the safety net for the most vulnerable while achieving significant savings. Similarly, by pursuing comprehensive tax reform that eliminates or reduces many of the $1.1 trillion in tax expenditures, we can raise revenue in a way that improves progressivity in the tax code — because these tax expenditures disproportionately benefit upper-income taxpayers — while promoting economic growth by removing economic distortions from tax expenditures and reducing marginal tax rates. <br> If the supercommittee is bold, it can put forward a smart, well-formulated deficit reduction plan that not only reduces our deficit but also maintains our economic health and restores public confidence in America’s ability to govern wisely and prudently. Failure to do so will incur a great price. <br> Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, who served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, served as co-chairmen of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 I</span>am a job creator. <br> I am not a job creator in the sense that I actually create jobs. I have never knowingly created a job, and my long-term business plan, approved unanimously by my board of directors, does not call for the creation of a single one. <br> But I am a job creator in the sense Republicans mean when they say “don’t tax our job creators more” (House budget committee Chairman Paul Ryan) or “we cannot increase taxes on the job creators” (House Speaker John A. Boehner). This is because, in the eyes of the government, I am a small business — and, as the House Republicans like to say, “small businesses are the job creators.” <br> Like the overwhelming majority of small businesses, I am a one-man operation. And, like most small businesses, I would not hire anybody even if the government dropped my tax rate to zero. <br> According to Small Business Administration statistics, based on 2009 Census data, 21.1 million of the 27 million small businesses in the United States are “non-employer firms,” which have no workers other than the owner. Of those, 18.7 million are “sole proprietors,” 950,000 are partnerships and 1.4 million are corporations, like me. <br> When lawmakers talk about small businesses as the engine of growth, they bring to mind entrepreneurs building start-ups from their garages. But when officials talk about protecting the “job creators” from tax hikes, they are mostly protecting a bunch of doctors, lawyers, freelancers, contractors and the like. <br> On the advice of my accountants, I formed a “C corporation,” which means that, as a legal entity, I am pretty much the same as General Motors and Google. But I run a lean operation. While my business, Ink-Stained Inc., produces the occasional book, TV appearance and speech, it is probably not going to win any best-prac­tices awards. <br> Disagreement is rare during board meetings at Ink-Stained Inc. world headquarters (my house), because I am the chairman, chief executive, president, treasurer, secretary, chief technology officer and mail-room clerk. Occasionally board members complain about environmental regulations, not because these regulations affect us but because that is what we have heard corporations are supposed to do. <br> We administer a modest pension plan for our sole employee, and we reimburse a few health-care expenses. We have big, professional-looking checks, and we attempt to keep our accounts balanced, although our chief financial officer (also me) is a lagging performer. We once considered hiring our wife as a consultant to help us organize our finances, but the HR department was unable to come to terms with her. We have so far repelled all attempts at unionization. <br> I should add that I am in no danger of being caught in the net of President Obama’s proposed millionaires’ tax. I pay the accountants a few thousand dollars, and they make sure I am not paying more in taxes than I should be. (Note to the IRS: They do this in ways that are conservative, entirely above-board and so innocuous that they should not attract your interest in the slightest.) <br> While there is something absurd about being a one-man corporation, it’s a rational response to an irrational tax code. If lawmakers got serious about tax reform that removed loopholes, the money spent on accountants and actuaries (valuable though they are) could instead be used to grow the economy or to pay the federal debt. But that’s a matter for another day. <br> At the moment, the Ink-Stained Inc. case study, should the Harvard Business School wish to study it, is a reminder to be skeptical of the “job creator” argument in the tax debate. “It’s a good example of the murkiness of what we mean by small business and the connection to jobs,” William Gale, co-director of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center, told me. “There’s sort of this notion of small-business innovation and job creation that just doesn’t necessarily hold.” <br> That’s even more so with Obama’s “Buffett Rule,” under which millionaires would have to pay a higher tax rate than a typical middle-class worker. As a practical matter, most already do. Gale said the rule would raise the taxes on only a few thousand people, perhaps as few as 1,000. <br> In a nation of more than 300 million, that’s not going to make a dent in job creation. Even the data analysts at Ink-Stained Inc. could figure out that one — that is, if we had any data analysts. 
 The open secret of many global corporations’ success — and occasionally, downfall — is to fall between the cracks. Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., created an Irish subsidiary with no employees, into which it funneled roughly $30 billion between 2009 and 2012 on which neither Ireland nor the United States levied taxes. Then there is American International Group (AIG), the New York-based insurer, whose London office sold insurance policies on derivatives that the company lacked the funds to redeem when banks demanded their money during the 2008 financial meltdown. The U.S. government was compelled to fork over a guarantee of $85 billion — which eventually expanded to $182 billion in taxpayer dollars — to keep the banks in business. Neither U.S. nor British regulators kept an eye on AIG’s risky practices as it rose. Only as it plummeted, threatening to drag the global economy down with it, did regulators notice that AIG’s London office operated in what was effectively a regulation-free zone. <br> All of which is to say that the system of sovereign nation-states — a pretty impressive creation in its day — has become a plaything for big business in the age of globalization and digital communication. The world is full of places with dirt-cheap labor, low or no taxes and scant or ­non-existent regulation. It’s also full of jurisdictional gaps between and among nations — as Apple discovered to its glee, and AIG to its woe. <br> The legal evasion of corporate taxes by shifting income to low-tax climes isn’t only a U.S. problem. Low-tax trolling is on the agenda of the Group of Eight leaders’ meeting next month. But absent a global sovereign, there will always be countries with tax rates lower than their neighbors’ and companies seeking to take advantage of that disparity. Reducing the nominal tax rate on corporate profits in the United States to 25 percent, or 15 percent, from the current 35 percent won’t deter some future Apple from shifting profits to some future Ireland if the tax rate there is zero. <br> So, what to do? A number of economists favor abandoning corporate taxes altogether and raising taxes correspondingly on shareholders’ dividends and capital gains. Raising those taxes is long overdue in any case, as those rates are much lower than the rates on income from work. In an era when investments in U.S. corporations are as likely to generate jobs abroad as at home, the preference given to capital income over labor income makes no sense — unless the policy goal is simply to favor the rich. <br> But, as F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said, the rich are different from you and me: They have more political power. It’s hard to imagine Congress — even a more morally and economically sentient Congress than the current one, which is not hard to imagine — raising the tax rate on capital income to the point that it covers the revenue loss caused by abolishing corporate taxes. <br> There may, however, be another solution: taxing corporations on their revenue rather than their profits. If Apple gets 60 percent of its revenue from sales in the United States, Apple should pay U.S. taxes on that revenue. Let France collect taxes from Apple on its sales in France, China on its sales in China and so forth. Taking production and the location of corporate headquarters out of the equation would end the noxious practices of placing factories where the taxes are lowest and creating dummy subsidiaries to funnel profits through low-tax countries. Companies would still roam the globe in search of the cheapest labor, though a better Congress might one day seek to reward businesses for keeping and generating high-value-added jobs in the United States. <br> Taxing companies on sales instead of profits would have its own complexities, of course. Last year, RBC Capital Markets found that the companies listed on the Standard Poor’s 500-stock index sell nearly half their products abroad, so the tax rate on U.S. sales would have to be sufficiently high to make up for lost revenue (not that any company would contemplate abandoning the massive U.S. market). Moreover, a corporation can have high sales revenue and still have a bad year. But shifting from taxing profits to sales is basically a recalibration of the cost of doing business — and one that would put an end to rampant tax arbitrage. <br> Ultimately, what’s needed are global standards for taxes, labor and regulation. Until they exist, let’s do what we can to stop game-playing that benefits only the rich. <br> Read more from Harold Meyerson’s archive or follow him on Twitter. <br> Read more from PostOpinions: <br> Matt Miller: This Apple is not rotten.

 In the standoff over the debt crisis, it’s easy to point the finger at the Tea Party. Even conservative commentators have argued that its uncompromising ideology is at the heart of the problem. But there have often been strong ideological movements in American politics, represented by politicians such as William Jennings Bryan, Barry Goldwater and George McGovern. Yet between elections, people still found ways to compromise and govern. What has steadily changed over the past three or four decades is not so much the ideological intensity (though it has grown) but the structure of politics, making it more beholden to narrow, specialized interests — including ideological ones — rather than broader national ones. <br> There was no golden age in Washington when people were more high-minded than they are today. But 40 years ago, the rules and organizing framework of politics made it easier for the two parties to work together. Since then, a series of changes has led to the narrowcasting of American politics. Redistricting has created safe seats so that, for most House members, their only concern is a challenge from the right (for Republicans) and the left (for Democrats). <br> Party primaries have been taken over by small groups of activists who push even popular senators to extreme positions. In Utah, 3,500 conservative activists managed to take the well-regarded Sen. Robert Bennett (R) off the ballot. GOP senators such as Orrin Hatch and John McCain have moved farther to the right, hoping to stave off similar assaults. <br> Changes in congressional rules have also made it far more difficult to enact large, compromise legislation. In the wake of Watergate, “sunshine rules” were put in place that required open committee meetings and recorded votes. The purpose was to make Congress more open and responsive, and so it has become — to lobbyists, money and special interests. <br> The political scientist James Thurber recalled watching lobbyists with their cellphones at a congressional hearing on the 1986 tax reforms. “They started dialing the instant anyone in the room even thought about changing a tax break. Their calls . . . brought a deluge of protest borne by phone, letter, and fax. There is no buffer allowing a Representative to think about what’s going on. In the old days you had a few months or weeks, at least a few days. Now you may have a few seconds before the wave hits.” To pass that landmark legislation, eliminating hundreds of tax deductions and loopholes, Dan Rostenkowski, then chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, had to insist on a return to closed hearings during the bill’s markup. <br> Polarization has been fueled by a new media, which have also been narrowcast. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in which he suggested that he might further the conservative agenda through an occasional compromise. That provoked a tirade from Rush Limbaugh, which then produced a torrent of angry e-mails and phone calls to Issa’s office. Issa quickly and publicly apologized to Limbaugh and promised only opposition to President Obama. Multiply that example a thousandfold, and you have the daily dynamic of Congress. <br> It’s depressing — but the fact that our politics are the result of structural shifts means that they can be changed. Mickey Edwards, a Republican and a former House member from Oklahoma, has a highly intelligent essay in Atlantic magazine, suggesting a series of reforms that could make a difference. Some of them are large-scale, such as creating truly open primaries and handing over the power of redistricting to independent commissions. Others are seemingly small but crucial changes in congressional procedure and practice, for example, filling committee vacancies by lot and staffing committees with professionals rather than with political apparatchiks. <br> Some political scientists long hoped that American parties would become more ideologically pure and coherent, like European parties. They have gotten their wish, and the result is abysmal — and predictable. America does not have a parliamentary system in which one party takes control of all levers of power — executive and legislative — enacts its agenda and then goes back to the voters. Power in the United States is shared by a set of institutions with overlapping authorities. The parties have to cooperate for anything to get done. That’s why the Founding Fathers despised political parties — Tea Party please note — and barely tolerated even the looser notion of “factions.” <br> Edwards’s proposed reforms are smart. There are others to consider as well. What’s most important is to recognize that we can change the incentives that produce demonstrably bad government in Washington. We are not condemned to have a political system whose chief characteristics are venom, dysfunction and paralysis. 
 Here we go again. An approaching crisis. A looming deadline. Nervous markets. And then, from the miasma of gridlock, rises our president, calling upon those unruly congressional children to quit squabbling, stop kicking the can down the road and get serious about debt. <br> This from the man who: <br> • Ignored the debt problem for two years by kicking the can to a commission. <br> • Promptly ignored the commission’s December 2010 report. <br> • Delivered a State of the Union address in January that didn’t even mention the word “debt” until 35 minutes in. <br> • Delivered in February a budget so embarrassing — it actually increased the deficit — that the Democratic-controlled Senate rejected it 97 to 0. <br> • Took a budget mulligan with his April 13 debt-plan speech. Asked in Congress how this new “budget framework” would affect the actual federal budget, Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf replied with a devastating “We don’t estimate speeches.” You can’t assign numbers to air. <br> President Obama assailed the lesser mortals who inhabit Congress for not having seriously dealt with a problem he had not dealt with at all, then scolded Congress for being even less responsible than his own children. They apparently get their homework done on time. <br> My compliments. But the Republican House did do its homework. It’s called a budget. It passed the House on April 15. The Democratic Senate has produced no budget. Not just this year, but for two years running. As for the schoolmaster in chief, he produced two 2012 budget facsimiles: The first (February) was a farce and the second (April) was empty, dismissed by the CBO as nothing but words untethered to real numbers. <br> Obama has run disastrous annual deficits of around $1.5 trillion while insisting for months on a “clean” debt-ceiling increase, i.e., with no budget cuts at all. Yet suddenly he now rises to champion major long-term debt reduction, scorning any suggestions of a short-term debt-limit deal as can-kicking. <br> The flip-flop is transparently political. A short-term deal means another debt-ceiling fight before Election Day, a debate that would put Obama on the defensive and distract from the Mediscare campaign to which the Democrats are clinging to save them in 2012. <br> A clever strategy it is: Do nothing (see above); invite the Republicans to propose real debt reduction first; and when they do — voting for the Ryan budget and its now infamous and courageous Medicare reform — demagogue them to death. <br> And then up the ante by demanding Republican agreement to tax increases. So: First you get the GOP to seize the left’s third rail by daring to lay a finger on entitlements. Then you demand the GOP seize the right’s third rail by violating its no-tax pledge. A full-spectrum electrocution. Brilliant. <br> And what have been Obama’s own debt-reduction ideas? In last week’s news conference, he railed against the tax break for corporate jet owners — six times. <br> I did the math. If you collect that tax for the next 5,000 years — that is not a typo — it would equal the new debt Obama racked up last year alone. To put it another way, if we had levied this tax at the time of John the Baptist and collected it every year since — first in shekels, then in dollars — we would have 500 years to go before we could offset half of the debt added by Obama last year alone. <br> Obama’s other favorite debt-reduction refrain is canceling an oil-company tax break. Well, if you collect that oil tax and the corporate jet tax for the next 50 years — you will not yet have offset Obama’s deficit spending for February 2011. <br> After his Thursday meeting with bipartisan congressional leadership, Obama adopted yet another persona: Cynic in chief became compromiser in chief. Highly placed leaks are portraying him as heroically prepared to offer Social Security and Medicare cuts. <br> We shall see. It’s no mystery what is needed. First, entitlement reform that changes the inflation measure, introduces means testing, then syncs the (lower) Medicare eligibility age with Social Security’s and indexes them both to longevity. And second, real tax reform, both corporate and individual, that eliminates myriad loopholes in return for lower tax rates for everyone. <br> That’s real debt reduction. Yet even now, we don’t know where the president stands on any of this. Until we do, I’ll follow the Elmendorf Rule: We don’t estimate leaks. Let’s see if Obama can suspend his 2012 electioneering long enough to keep the economy from going over the debt cliff. 
 Bob Woodward (woodwardb@washpost.com) is an associate editor of The Post. His latest book is “The Price of Politics.” Evelyn M. Duffy contributed to this column. <br> Misunderstanding, misstatements and all the classic contortions of partisan message management surround the sequester, the term for the $85 billion in ugly and largely irrational federal spending cuts set by law to begin Friday. <br> What is the non-budget wonk to make of this? Who is responsible? What really happened? <br> The finger-pointing began during the third presidential debate last fall, on Oct. 22, when President Obama blamed Congress. “The sequester is not something that I’ve proposed,” Obama said. “It is something that Congress has proposed.” <br> The White House chief of staff at the time, Jack Lew, who had been budget director during the negotiations that set up the sequester in 2011, backed up the president two days later. <br> “There was an insistence on the part of Republicans in Congress for there to be some automatic trigger,” Lew said while campaigning in Florida. It “was very much rooted in the Republican congressional insistence that there be an automatic measure.” <br> The president and Lew had this wrong. My extensive reporting for my book “The Price of Politics” shows that the automatic spending cuts were initiated by the White House and were the brainchild of Lew and White House congressional relations chief Rob Nabors — probably the foremost experts on budget issues in the senior ranks of the federal government. <br> Obama personally approved of the plan for Lew and Nabors to propose the sequester to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). They did so at 2:30 p.m. July 27, 2011, according to interviews with two senior White House aides who were directly involved. <br> Nabors has told others that they checked with the president before going to see Reid. A mandatory sequester was the only action-forcing mechanism they could devise. Nabors has said, “We didn’t actually think it would be that hard to convince them” — Reid and the Republicans — to adopt the sequester. “It really was the only thing we had. There was not a lot of other options left on the table.” <br> A majority of Republicans did vote for the Budget Control Act that summer, which included the sequester. Key Republican staffers said they didn’t even initially know what a sequester was — because the concept stemmed from the budget wars of the 1980s, when they were not in government. <br> At the Feb. 13 Senate Finance Committee hearing on Lew’s nomination to become Treasury secretary, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) asked Lew about the account in my book: “Woodward credits you with originating the plan for sequestration. Was he right or wrong?” <br> “It’s a little more complicated than that,” Lew responded, “and even in his account, it was a little more complicated than that. We were in a negotiation where the failure would have meant the default of the government of the United States.” <br> “Did you make the suggestion?” Burr asked. <br> “Well, what I did was said that with all other options closed, we needed to look for an option where we could agree on how to resolve our differences. And we went back to the 1984 plan that Senator [Phil] Gramm and Senator [Warren] Rudman worked on and said that that would be a basis for having a consequence that would be so unacceptable to everyone that we would be able to get action.” <br> In other words, yes. <br> But then Burr asked about the president’s statement during the presidential debate, that the Republicans originated it. <br> Lew, being a good lawyer and a loyal presidential adviser, then shifted to denial mode: “Senator, the demand for an enforcement mechanism was not something that the administration was pushing at that moment.” <br> That statement was not accurate. <br> On Tuesday, Obama appeared at the White House with a group of police officers and firefighters to denounce the sequester as a “meat-cleaver approach” that would jeopardize military readiness and investments in education, energy and readiness. He also said it would cost jobs. But, the president said, the substitute would have to include new revenue through tax reform. <br> At noon that same day, White House press secretary Jay Carney shifted position and accepted sequester paternity. <br> “The sequester was something that was discussed,” Carney said. Walking back the earlier statements, he added carefully, “and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward.” <br> This was an acknowledgment that the president and Lew had been wrong. <br> Why does this matter? <br> First, months of White House dissembling further eroded any semblance of trust between Obama and congressional Republicans. (The Republicans are by no means blameless and have had their own episodes of denial and bald-faced message management.) <br> Second, Lew testified during his confirmation hearing that the Republicans would not go along with new revenue in the portion of the deficit-reduction plan that became the sequester. Reinforcing Lew’s point, a senior White House official said Friday, “The sequester was an option we were forced to take because the Republicans would not do tax increases.” <br> In fact, the final deal reached between Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in 2011 included an agreement that there would be no tax increases in the sequester in exchange for what the president was insisting on: an agreement that the nation’s debt ceiling would be increased for 18 months, so Obama would not have to go through another such negotiation in 2012, when he was running for reelection. <br> So when the president asks that a substitute for the sequester include not just spending cuts but also new revenue, he is moving the goal posts. His call for a balanced approach is reasonable, and he makes a strong case that those in the top income brackets could and should pay more. But that was not the deal he made. <br> Read more from PostOpinions: <br> Bob Woodward: Time for our leaders to delegate on the budget <br> Robert J.

 PRESIDENT OBAMA hardly mentioned climate change during long stretches of his first term. As he rebuilds his administration and refines his second-term agenda, he should give this challenge the priority it deserves. <br> The biggest disappointment of Mr. Obama’s energy and environmental record was his failure to advance a bill that would have put a price on carbon dioxide emissions, which is the economically sensible way to cut them. Congress, too, bears blame for this, but the president allowed other priorities, such as health-care legislation and Wall Street reform, to gobble up his attention. By the time climate’s turn came, Washington was exhausted, and he could not even achieve a backup approach such as requiring that some of the country’s electricity come from clean sources. <br> Consequently the administration focused on what it could do without Congress. Here the record is brighter. Mr. Obama pushed through landmark fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks, an achievement that will reduce both oil use and the country’s carbon footprint. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set air quality standards that all but guarantee that utilities won’t build any more hazardous coal-fired power plants. <br> The president also welcomed the revolution in domestic energy production that taps into vast deposits of natural gas, which burns cleaner than coal. The EPA and the Interior Department sided neither with environmentalists who want to shut down unconventional gas development nor with energy firms that would rather not see essential regulation. <br> Taken together, these efforts have helped put the country on a path toward reduced emissions, though it’s not as ambitious or as efficient a policy program as pricing carbon could have been. <br> In the next four years, there is more Mr. Obama can do administratively. His administration must ensure that natural gas production doesn’t result in excess greenhouse-gas pollution. The EPA can set carbon emissions standards on existing power plants and industrial sources, though regulators must be sensitive to compliance costs if they do so. <br> But the best policies to reduce the country’s emissions would require congressional action. Unfortunately, the president seems unwilling to push for a carbon tax or some other carbon-pricing policy during any tax reform negotiations. Given that a carbon tax could raise money and efficiently address greenhouse emissions, it seems like a perfect fit. Bipartisan coalitions could also unite around less controversial legislation that promotes energy efficiency and funds basic research into energy technology. <br> Straight talk is important. Policies to reduce emissions should not be justified with appeals to green jobs or energy independence. Americans should hear from their leaders about the risks the planet faces and why it makes sense to spend now to head off more costly consequences later. <br> More on this debate: <br> The Post’s View: After a hot year, a climate agenda <br> The Post’s View: California’s climate change experiment <br> The Post’s View: The carbon tax <br> Eugene Robinson: Crazy from the heat <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Frank Luntz, a pollster, is the author of “Win: The Key Principles to Take Your Business From Ordinary to Extraordinary.” <br> This coming week, House Republicans will gather in Williamsburg, Va., to discuss what went wrong in 2012. I’ve attended more than a dozen such congressional retreats since 1993, and I can already imagine how the conversations will go. Someone will undoubtedly come to the microphone to declare that what the GOP needs is a better brand, missing the essential point that candidates and political parties are about reputation, trust and ideas. You can’t sell them like soap or detergent. <br> But what you say in defense of those ideas matters, and what people hear matters even more. <br> Congressional Republicans are currently defined as nothing more than opponents of the president and friends of the powerful. This isn’t my opinion — it’s America’s opinion. My polling firm asked voters nationwide on election night to identify who or what the GOP was fighting for. Twice as many said “the wealthy” and “big business” than “hardworking taxpayers” or “small business.” <br> Their image is even worse today. The congressional Republicans’ message during the “fiscal cliff” debate last month was confused and chaotic. The debt-ceiling vote next month and the budget debate after that promise more of the same — unless House and Senate Republicans stop bickering and start coordinating and talking differently. <br> Just saying “no” to the president has its limits. House Republicans, since they have a megaphone that Senate Republicans don’t , will continue to be diminished until they start defining and stop being defined. <br> Talk is cheap, of course, but bad language is costly. While the new GOP House majority is the second-largest since World War II, more people cast votes for Democratic House candidates than for Republican candidates. On the Senate side, the Democratic advantage was even larger. The GOP paid a price for its out-of-touch language in November and could pay again in 2014, just as it did in 2006, unless the party changes course. <br> Changing course starts with a values-based approach, and that means talking to Americans about accountability, personal responsibility and freedom — and linking those values to GOP policies. For example, in 1994, congressional Republican candidates developed the Contract With America to announce “a detailed agenda for national renewal, a written commitment with no fine print . . . to make us all proud again of the way free people govern themselves.” <br> It was a response to voters who were fed up with politicians who said one thing in their districts and then voted differently in Washington. In 2013, House Republicans need a similar tone that starts with the value of listening, not speaking. When people feel they’re heard and understood, they’ll listen. <br> The next step is to be more empathetic. Voters will not give you a chance to solve their problems if they think you don’t understand them, especially at a time when Americans feel no one is fighting for them. For example, among 2012 voters who wanted their president to “care about people like me,” President Obama crushed Mitt Romney 81 percent to 18 percent. In part, that’s because the president’s rhetoric is always couched in the language of fairness and justice. He asks the “wealthiest 2 percent” to “pay their fair share” — without defining what “fair share” means. He doesn’t have to; voters ascribe their own definitions. <br> Republicans on Capitol Hill have great thinkers and communicators with serious ideas and specific answers, from Reps. Paul Ryan and Dave Camp to Sens. Marco Rubio and Pat Toomey. The party should unleash them — now. But they need a new language to communicate their ideas effectively; it starts with abandoning ugly phrases such as “a hostage you might take a chance at shooting” to describe budget negotiations. And Republicans need to stop expressing a willingness to shut down the government if they don’t get their way on the debt ceiling. Americans don’t want a government shutdown — for any reason. <br> Now consider Obama’s strategy and approach. His pollsters do exactly what I do, figuring out which words resonate with voters — but they have a more willing, disciplined client. Nearly every White House speech during the fiscal cliff debate emphasized a “balanced, responsible approach” — sometimes more than once. Every time you hear phrases like that, know that a pollster crafted them because they resonate with Americans who are angry with the incessant bickering and partisan gridlock in Washington. <br> Never mind that the fiscal cliff legislation Obama just signed has more than $40 in tax increases for every $1 in cuts or that Social Security and Medicare are hurtling toward insolvency. And it doesn’t matter that the president says he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling; thanks to his effective messaging, it is Republicans who are being blamed for intransigence. <br> Republicans have done little to combat the Democratic charge that they care more about chief executives in corner offices than struggling workers in factories. While Congress debated and delayed, Obama took his case to the American people. He used campaign-style rallies to extol the fairness of raising taxes on the rich and attacked Republicans for blocking progress. Voters liked what they heard — and that’s why Obama has an overwhelming 58 percent to 32 percent advantage over congressional Republicans in polls when it comes to “protecting the middle class.” <br> In response, Republicans such as John McCain took to the Senate floor to criticize the president for grandstanding when he should have been governing. McCain was right: What Obama did wasn’t presidential or constructive — but it was effective. Republicans need to stop decrying the lack of decorum and listen to voters, rather than lecturing them. And then the first sentence out of their mouths should express respect for the American people, not disdain for the president they just reelected. <br> Another way for congressional Republicans to gain an advantage is to reframe the questions being asked, because whoever controls the question determines the answer. Since his first election, Obama has been asking America, “Should the rich pay more?” Thanks to public disdain for lobbyists and tax loopholes available only to the wealthy, election exit polls put support for this notion at 60 percent. But change the question to “Should Washington take more?,” and the answer is a resounding no. <br> That’s the question Republicans need to ask, along with: Is Washington spending your hard-earned money efficiently and effectively? Are we in this mess because Washington takes too little of your money or because it wastes too much? <br> But language can’t just pose powerful questions; it must also paint commanding pictures. House Republicans talk about how Congress shouldn’t “kick the can down the road” — hardly an urgent image. Similarly, they must stop accusing their opponents of “committing fiscal child abuse,” a phrase several Republicans have used. That visual is insulting to everyone. A more powerful metaphor would be “piling debt on our children” or “mortgaging the American dream.” <br> House Republicans also need to humanize the issues they care about. Making a political argument about the size of the national debt connects intellectually, but invoking the personal responsibility of parents connects emotionally. The presidents who communicated in emotional terms — JFK, Reagan, Clinton and Obama — have been able to move public opinion to get what they wanted, while those who took a more intellectual approach — Carter and George H.W. Bush — were defeated by public opinion. <br> Instead of being the party of small businesses and job creators, House Republicans should become the party of hardworking taxpayers. After all, a small percentage of Americans think of themselves as job creators, but every American considers him or herself a hardworking taxpayer. It’s an even more powerful identity than the “middle class” the Democrats speak of so often. If the choice is between the party that fights for hardworking taxpayers and the party that fights for the middle class, Republicans win. <br> Conservatism thrives only when it’s infused with optimism — when it’s about what people can do when they’re in control. That was the secret of Ronald Reagan’s success. Republicans need to be more than just the party of people “who built it” — they should be the party of people who want to build it even better. Speak to voters’ aspirations, not just their pocketbooks, and emphasize how GOP solutions help the want-to-haves, not just the already-haves. That’s personal responsibility in action. <br> For example, when Republicans speak disdainfully about becoming a “food stamp nation,” it reinforces voters’ suspicions that they are callous. Instead, they should offer a positive message about how hard work, personal responsibility and earned success are better than government dependency. And instead of talking about “upward mobility,” Republicans should summarize the American dream concisely: “If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to get ahead.” Obama stole that line from them. It’s time to steal it back. <br> The unforced GOP language errors are many. Here’s a start: <br> ●Instead of smaller government, they should talk about more efficient and effective government. The former is ideological language of the 1980s; the latter is practical language of today. <br> ●Instead of tax reform, talk about making the IRS code simpler, flatter and fairer. Speak to what people really hate about the code: its complexity. <br> ●In addition to cutting spending, they must talk about controlling — not capping — it. What angers Americans more than how much politicians spend today is how much more they know Washington will waste tomorrow. A “cap” can be lifted, but “controls” are constant. <br> ●Instead of entitlement reform or controlling the growth of Medicare and Social Security, talk about how to save and strengthen these programs so they are there when voters need them. After all, they paid for them. <br> ●Better than discussing economic opportunity and growth, Republicans should talk about creating a healthier and more secure economy. Everyone benefits when economic health is restored. And while economic opportunity would be nice, security is a necessity. <br> Beyond fiscal policy, Republicans need to revamp their messaging on other issues. For example, the tragic school shooting in Newtown, Conn., offered Republicans a chance to discuss public safety — a more personal issue than “crime” — on a human level. That hasn’t happened, but it still can. Most people agree that there is a middle ground between gun-control hard-liners, who see every crime as an excuse to enact new laws, and the National Rifle Association, which sees every crime as an excuse to sell more guns. The Second Amendment deserves defending, but do Republicans truly believe that anyone should be able to buy any gun, anywhere, at any time? If yes, they’re on the side of less than 10 percent of America. If not, they need to say so. <br> Immigration is a similar example. There’s a good reason Romney did worse among Hispanics than any GOP presidential candidate since 1996. You can’t tell people to “self-deport.” While he was talking about illegal immigrants, who can’t cast ballots, many Hispanic Americans — who are voting in growing numbers — were certainly turned off by that comment. The immigration debate is about rule of law, but those laws should be enforced with compassion. The consensus among Americans is for “tall fences and wide gates” — a greater effort to prevent illegal immigration while welcoming those who come here for the right reasons and in the right way. <br> Most Hispanics agree. They’re not asking for open borders or blanket amnesty. They just don’t want to be regarded as criminals. And because of oft-repeated phrases such as “illegal aliens,” Hispanic voters don’t think Republicans like, welcome or respect them. So how can they vote Republican? Immigration reform that brings people out of the shadows is the last, best opportunity for the party to reset its broken relationship with Hispanics. <br> Congressional Republicans must reintroduce themselves to the American people. It’s up to them to prove that personal responsibility is better than government dependency and that setting priorities is more compassionate than bailouts or bankruptcy. America is listening — and they want a Republican Party that listens to them, too. <br> Read more from Outlook, friend us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 This is not a good time to be starting out in life. Jobs are scarce, and those that exist often pay unexpectedly low wages. Beginning a family — always stressful and uncertain — is increasingly a stretch. The weak economy begets weak family formation. We instinctively know this; several new studies now deepen our understanding. <br> When the labor market operates smoothly, it creates an economic escalator. Just out of high school or college, young workers typically switch jobs frequently until they find something that fits their talent and temperament. Job changes often mean higher pay; people move to advance themselves. The more they succeed, the more confident they feel in marrying and having children. <br> The most startling evidence of the broken escalator is the collapse in marriages and births. Marriage has been declining for years. Now, in a new study, the Pew Research Center finds that in 2011 the U.S. birth rate (births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44) fell to its lowest level since at least 1920, the earliest year of reliable statistics. From 2007 to 2011, the U.S. birth rate dropped almost 9 percent. The total fertility rate — the estimated number of children born to adult women in their lifetime — has fallen four straight years to 1.9 (the replacement rate is 2.1). <br> States with large economic setbacks suffered steeper birth rate drops, Pew says. Interestingly, births to immigrants fell more sharply than for native-born Americans. In 2010 — the latest detailed data — they dropped 13 percent from 2007 compared with a 5 percent decline for native-born women. Hispanics, both foreign and U.S.-born, had big birth-rate declines, reflecting exceptionally high unemployment and wealth losses from the recession, Pew says. <br> The bleak labor market has hurt all age groups, but none more than the young. Consider the 23.4 million Americans who, on average, were considered “underemployed” over the past year. This group consists of 12.7 million officially unemployed; 8.2 million working part time but wanting full-time jobs; and 2.5 million desiring work but so discouraged they’d stopped looking. Of all these workers, 41 percent (9.5 million) were 30 or under, far in excess of their labor force share of 27 percent, reports Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that provided these numbers. <br> Fully one-fifth of younger workers belong to the “underemployed.” As Shierholz notes, the young always have higher unemployment rates. It’s just worse now. “Young workers are relatively new to the labor market — often looking for their first or second job — and so may be passed over in hiring due to lack of experience,” she says. “If employed, their lack of seniority makes them candidates for being laid off.” <br> But it’s more than the lack of jobs — or full-time jobs — that hurts the young. Wages have also sagged because too many applicants are chasing too few openings. <br> Traditionally, U.S. labor markets have featured enormous turnover: Workers voluntarily leave jobs or are fired. Job changes vastly exceed net job creation, as hires often fill slots that someone else just left. On the whole, this has been a good thing, argues a new study. Workers can often find a better-paying job. But this “churning,” as the study calls it, is abating. Because employers are creating fewer net new jobs, workers won’t give up the ones they’ve got. As the labor market freezes up, the young lose bargaining power. <br> “Because job change accounts for a substantial portion of earnings growth, especially for younger workers, this decrease in churning reflects a decrease in workers’ opportunities for [higher wages],” write the study’s authors, economists John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland and Henry Hyatt, Erika McEntarfer and Liliana Sousa of the Census Bureau. <br> The glut of job seekers depresses wages in a second way, argues the study. New firms — which create a disproportionate share of new jobs — don’t have to pay as much to hire. In 2001, workers at firms 10 years old or less earned 85 percent as much as workers at older firms. By 2011, they were paid only 70 percent as much. And these newer firms matter. From 1998 to 2011, they created 40 percent of net new jobs despite representing only 25 percent of total employment. <br> It’s usually a mistake to generalize about entire generations. The bad luck and bad timing of today’s 20-somethings may pass. Birth rates could bounce back. “In the past, women who have postponed births make up for it later,” says Pew’s D’Vera Cohn. The economic recovery may strengthen; the retirement of baby boomers will create new job openings; and surveys indicate the young remain optimistic despite setbacks. <br> So the economic escalator may again accelerate. Still, the question nags: Could this become a lost generation? <br> Read more from Opinions: <br> Robert J. Samuelson: The death of tax reform <br> 5 myths about the unemployed <br> Robert J.

 Why are Republicans playing the Democrats’ game that the “fiscal cliff” is all about taxation? <br> House Speaker John Boehner already made the preemptive concession of agreeing to raise revenue. But the insistence on doing so by eliminating deductions without raising marginal rates is now the subject of fierce Republican infighting. <br> Where is the other part of President Obama’s vaunted “balanced approach”? Where are the spending cuts, both discretionary and entitlement: Medicare, Medicaid and now Obamacare (the health-care trio) and Social Security? <br> Social Security is the easiest to solve. So you get a sense of the Democrats’ inclination to reform entitlements when Dick Durbin, the Senate Democrats’ No. 2, says Social Security is off the table because it “does not add a penny to our deficit.” <br> This is absurd. In 2012, Social Security adds $165 billion to the deficit. Democrats pretend that Social Security is covered through 2033 by its trust fund. Except that the trust fund is a fiction, a mere “bookkeeping” device, as the Office of Management and Budget itself has written. The trust fund’s IOUs “do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits.” Future benefits “will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures.” <br> And draining the Treasury, as 10,000 baby boomers retire every day. Yet that’s off the table. And on Wednesday, the president threw down the gauntlet by demanding tax hikes now — with spending cuts to come next year. Meaning, until after Republicans have fallen on their swords, given up the tax issue and forfeited their political leverage. <br> Ronald Reagan once fell for a “tax now, cut later” deal that he later deeply regretted. Dems got the tax; he never got the cuts. Obama’s audacious new gambit is not a serious proposal to solve our fiscal problems. It’s a raw partisan maneuver meant to neuter the Republicans by getting them to cave on their signature issue as the hold-the-line party on taxes. <br> The objective is to ignite exactly the kind of internecine warfare on taxes now going on among Republicans. And to bury Grover Norquist. <br> I am not now, nor have ever been, a Norquistian. I don’t believe the current level of taxation is divinely ordained. Nor do I believe in pledges of any kind. But Norquist is the only guy in town to consistently resist the tax-and-spend Democrats’ stampede for ever-higher taxes to fund ever more reckless spending. <br> The hunt for Norquist’s scalp is a key part of the larger partisan project to make the Republicans do a George H.W. Bush and renege on their heretofore firm stand on taxes. Bush never recovered. <br> Why are the Republicans playing along? Because it is assumed that Obama has the upper hand. Unless Republicans acquiesce and get the best deal they can right now, tax rates will rise across the board on Jan. 1, and the GOP will be left without any bargaining chips. <br> But what about Obama? If we all cliff-dive, he gets to preside over yet another recession. It will wreck his second term. Sure, Republicans will get blamed. But Obama is never running again. He cares about his legacy. You think he wants a second term with a double-dip recession, 9 percent unemployment and a totally gridlocked Congress? Republicans have to stop playing as if they have no cards. <br> Obama is claiming an electoral mandate to raise taxes on the top 2 percent. Perhaps, but remember those incessant campaign ads promising a return to the economic nirvana of the Clinton years? Well, George W. Bush cut rates across the board, not just for the top 2 percent. Going back to the Clinton rates means middle-class tax hikes that yield four times the revenue that you get from just the rich. <br> So give Obama the full Clinton. Let him live with that. And with what also lies on the other side of the cliff: 28 million Americans newly subject to the ruinous alternative minimum tax. <br> Republicans must stop acting like supplicants. If Obama so loves those Clinton rates, Republicans should say: Then go over the cliff and have them all. <br> And add: But if you want a grand bargain, then deal. If we give way on taxes, we want, in return, serious discretionary cuts, clearly spelled-out entitlement cuts and real tax reform. <br> Otherwise, strap on your parachute, Mr. President.

 Before the “fiscal cliff” comes the political roller coaster. Agreement will seem unattainable until, suddenly, it isn’t. The sickening plunge will feel endless until the car starts to climb again. But at the moment, things are not looking good. <br> The public talk from Republicans has been heartening, certainly. They have offered not only soothing words about compromise but also explicit acknowledgment that revenue must be on the table. The no-new-taxes pledge has lost its punch. As Joe Biden would say, this is a big deal, folks. <br> The problem is that the behind-the-scenes deal-making has been way more disappointing than the public posturing. After the kumbaya White House meeting Friday with congressional leaders, it took until the following Monday evening for Republicans to return to the White House with an initial offer. <br> It was, in a word, pathetic. <br> As described to me by several sources with direct knowledge, the “bargain” was that all the Bush tax cuts would be extended. Revenue would be raised through later tax reform — although no amount was specified and, as important, no trigger mechanism put in place to enforce the deal. In return for the vague promise of future revenue, the defense-spending sequester would be canceled, the age for Medicare eligibility would rise and changes would be made to the formula for calculating increases in Social Security benefits. Cuts now, revenue later. Sound familiar? <br> Oh, and by the way, that increase in the debt ceiling? Republicans want to address that separately, a key issue for the administration. <br> Even as an opening bid, this offer is dishearteningly low-ball and insincere. It does not bode well for crafting a deal by year-end. A reasonable offer would contain, at the very least, a revenue number, an enforcement mechanism and a debt-limit increase. <br> The White House has an important responsibility here too. In his meeting with the leaders, the president emphasized his willingness to tackle entitlement reform. He said he was braced for, and willing to take on, blowback from liberals in his party and outside groups. <br> In previous negotiations, the president was willing to raise the Medicare eligibility age, change the formula for calculating Social Security increases and cut Medicaid. Intervening events changed the calculus. The election strengthened his bargaining position. The Supreme Court’s health-care ruling, making the Medicaid expansion optional for states, further complicated matters. Raising the Medicare age becomes harder if lower-income seniors aren’t eligible for Medicaid. Cutting Medicaid is more difficult when the administration wants to entice states to participate. <br> But as the president has long recognized, entitlement reform is essential — to the politics of crafting a bargain and the substance of achieving fiscal stability. So what, exactly, does he propose? Republicans can’t take the tax plunge if Democrats aren’t willing to give on entitlements — not later but simultaneously. <br> Another cause for pessimism is the willingness of extremes on both sides to engage in cliff-jumping. From the right, the theory is that automatic cuts are better than no cuts at all, and that Republicans would get to blame Democrats for raising taxes and imperiling national security. <br> From the left, the theory is that time is on their side, that with the scheduled expiration of the Bush tax cuts comes leverage and, absent any action, trillions in new revenue. The left has a mirror-image assessment of the blame game: Republicans would pay the price for holding tax cuts for nearly everyone hostage to tax cuts for the 2 percent. <br> All this makes for an especially dangerous game of fiscal chicken. And what begins as tactical bravado can easily edge into unintended stalemate. <br> A few weeks past the cliff would be extremely messy but not necessarily disastrous. People could wait to file their 2012 tax returns until the alternative minimum tax is patched. Medicare could hold off on reimbursements until rates are increased. Government agencies could postpone cuts. <br> The threat of delay is twofold: that the protracted resolution would further depress investors’ confidence in the capacity of the government to manage its affairs, and that the standoff could drag on. It will be difficult for a newly constituted Congress — one scarcely scheduled to be in session — to resolve this question in the first few weeks of January. A resolution by, say, the beginning of February might avert a recession but still take a big toll on growth. <br> For a meaningful deal to be reached, more groundwork should have been laid by now.

 MARYLANDERS VOTED resoundingly in 2008 to permit slot-machine gambling in their state. This fall they are likely to approve an expansion that would add a sixth casino to the five authorized and allow table games such as roulette at all of them. <br> State officials make the case that the expansion will yield tens of millions of dollars in new revenue — a projection resting on seat-of-the-pants guesses and rosy assumptions. They are reckoning, without much evidence, that a small state can sustain one of the densest arrays of gambling venues in the nation — despite stiff competition just beyond its borders. <br> None of this is very persuasive. Gambling, which is sensitive to economic gyrations, is a flimsy foundation on which to build a state’s economic development program. As in other states, gambling’s promise of gushers of new money for Maryland’s coffers has almost certainly been oversold. <br> The best argument for expansion, therefore, comes not from state politicians in Annapolis but from local officials in Prince George’s County, where the sixth casino, an enormous one, would be located. While a glitzy mega-casino strikes us as a poor branding strategy, particularly for a jurisdiction whose image has been badly stained by corruption, it may have a local economic upside. <br> Officials in Prince George’s, led by County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, argue that the county has for years been starved of revenue by one of the nation’s tightest voter-imposed ceilings on property taxes. The tax cap, known by the acronym TRIM (Tax Reform Initiative by Marylanders), has been in place since 1978 and was reaffirmed by county voters in 1996. While county budgeters have lived within its strictures, it has severely limited initiatives. <br> While the state’s take from an expansion of gambling is a matter of some conjecture, Prince George’s, by hosting a casino, would be more assured of the shot in the arm that new revenue provides. That would help the county, a perpetual beggar, to pay its bills and fund new ideas. <br> Just as promisingly, it would advance the prospects of a desperately needed new regional hospital in Prince George’s, whose financing, in the formulation of State Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert), could be assured only by new gambling revenue. In our view, Mr. Miller’s use of the hospital to help secure support for an expansion of gambling smacks of extortion. But now that the expansion seems likely, let him make good on the deal. <br> At best, gambling is a mixed bag for Maryland — with a daunting downside in social costs. It has distorted state politics for years. Nonetheless, barring some sudden reversal in the electorate’s mood, its expansion seems all but assured. If it pays dividends for Prince George’s, that at least would be a silver lining in the cloud the issue has cast over the state. <br> More on this debate: <br> The Post’s View: In Maryland, gambling giants betting on TV ads to sway voters <br> The Post’s View: Maryland gambling, wagging the dog <br> Richard L.

 Rep. Allen West, a Florida Republican, was recently captured on video asserting that there are “78 to 81” Democrats in Congress who are members of the Communist Party. Of course, it’s not unusual for some renegade lawmaker from either side of the aisle to say something outrageous. What made West’s comment — right out of the McCarthyite playbook of the 1950s — so striking was the almost complete lack of condemnation from Republican congressional leaders or other major party figures, including the remaining presidential candidates. <br> It’s not that the GOP leadership agrees with West; it is that such extreme remarks and views are now taken for granted. <br> We have been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party. <br> The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition. <br> When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country’s challenges. <br> “Both sides do it” or “There is plenty of blame to go around” are the traditional refuges for an American news media intent on proving its lack of bias, while political scientists prefer generality and neutrality when discussing partisan polarization. Many self-styled bipartisan groups, in their search for common ground, propose solutions that move both sides to the center, a strategy that is simply untenable when one side is so far out of reach. <br> It is clear that the center of gravity in the Republican Party has shifted sharply to the right. Its once-legendary moderate and center-right legislators in the House and the Senate — think Bob Michel, Mickey Edwards, John Danforth, Chuck Hagel — are virtually extinct. <br> The post-McGovern Democratic Party, by contrast, while losing the bulk of its conservative Dixiecrat contingent in the decades after the civil rights revolution, has retained a more diverse base. Since the Clinton presidency, it has hewed to the center-left on issues from welfare reform to fiscal policy. While the Democrats may have moved from their 40-yard line to their 25, the Republicans have gone from their 40 to somewhere behind their goal post. <br> What happened? Of course, there were larger forces at work beyond the realignment of the South. They included the mobilization of social conservatives after the 1973Roe v. Wade decision, the anti-tax movement launched in 1978 by California’s Proposition 13, the rise of conservative talk radio after a congressional pay raise in 1989, and the emergence of Fox News and right-wing blogs. But the real move to the bedrock right starts with two names: Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist. <br> From the day he entered Congress in 1979, Gingrich had a strategy to create a Republican majority in the House: convincing voters that the institution was so corrupt that anyone would be better than the incumbents, especially those in the Democratic majority. It took him 16 years, but by bringing ethics charges against Democratic leaders; provoking them into overreactions that enraged Republicans and united them to vote against Democratic initiatives; exploiting scandals to create even more public disgust with politicians; and then recruiting GOP candidates around the country to run against Washington, Democrats and Congress, Gingrich accomplished his goal. <br> Ironically, after becoming speaker, Gingrich wanted to enhance Congress’s reputation and was content to compromise with President Bill Clinton when it served his interests. But the forces Gingrich unleashed destroyed whatever comity existed across party lines, activated an extreme and virulently anti-Washington base — most recently represented by tea party activists — and helped drive moderate Republicans out of Congress. (Some of his progeny, elected in the early 1990s, moved to the Senate and polarized its culture in the same way.) <br> Norquist, meanwhile, founded Americans for Tax Reform in 1985 and rolled out his Taxpayer Protection Pledge the following year. The pledge, which binds its signers to never support a tax increase (that includes closing tax loopholes), had been signed as of last year by 238 of the 242 House Republicans and 41 of the 47 GOP senators, according to ATR. The Norquist tax pledge has led to other pledges, on issues such as climate change, that create additional litmus tests that box in moderates and make cross-party coalitions nearly impossible. For Republicans concerned about a primary challenge from the right, the failure to sign such pledges is simply too risky. <br> Today, thanks to the GOP, compromise has gone out the window in Washington. In the first two years of the Obama administration, nearly every presidential initiative met with vehement, rancorous and unanimous Republican opposition in the House and the Senate, followed by efforts to delegitimize the results and repeal the policies. The filibuster, once relegated to a handful of major national issues in a given Congress, became a routine weapon of obstruction, applied even to widely supported bills or presidential nominations. And Republicans in the Senate have abused the confirmation process to block any and every nominee to posts such as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, solely to keep laws that were legitimately enacted from being implemented. <br> In the third and now fourth years of the Obama presidency, divided government has produced something closer to complete gridlock than we have ever seen in our time in Washington, with partisan divides even leading last year to America’s first credit downgrade. <br> On financial stabilization and economic recovery, on deficits and debt, on climate change and health-care reform, Republicans have been the force behind the widening ideological gaps and the strategic use of partisanship. In the presidential campaign and in Congress, GOP leaders have embraced fanciful policies on taxes and spending, kowtowing to their party’s most strident voices. <br> Republicans often dismiss nonpartisan analyses of the nature of problems and the impact of policies when those assessments don’t fit their ideology. In the face of the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, the party’s leaders and their outside acolytes insisted on obeisance to a supply-side view of economic growth — thus fulfilling Norquist’s pledge — while ignoring contrary considerations. <br> The results can border on the absurd: In early 2009, several of the eight Republican co-sponsors of a bipartisan health-care reform plan dropped their support; by early 2010, the others had turned on their own proposal so that there would be zero GOP backing for any bill that came within a mile of Obama’s reform initiative. As one co-sponsor, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), told The Washington Post’s Ezra Klein: “I liked it because it was bipartisan. I wouldn’t have voted for it.” <br> And seven Republican co-sponsors of a Senate resolution to create a debt-reduction panel voted in January 2010 against their own resolution, solely to keep it from getting to the 60-vote threshold Republicans demanded and thus denying the president a seeming victory. <br> This attitude filters down far deeper than the party leadership. Rank-and-file GOP voters endorse the strategy that the party’s elites have adopted, eschewing compromise to solve problems and insisting on principle, even if it leads to gridlock. Democratic voters, by contrast, along with self-identified independents, are more likely to favor deal-making over deadlock. <br> Democrats are hardly blameless, and they have their own extreme wing and their own predilection for hardball politics. But these tendencies do not routinely veer outside the normal bounds of robust politics. If anything, under the presidencies of Clinton and Obama, the Democrats have become more of a status-quo party. They are centrist protectors of government, reluctantly willing to revamp programs and trim retirement and health benefits to maintain its central commitments in the face of fiscal pressures. <br> No doubt, Democrats were not exactly warm and fuzzy toward George W. Bush during his presidency. But recall that they worked hand in glove with the Republican president on the No Child Left Behind Act, provided crucial votes in the Senate for his tax cuts, joined with Republicans for all the steps taken after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and supplied the key votes for the Bush administration’s financial bailout at the height of the economic crisis in 2008. The difference is striking. <br> The GOP’s evolution has become too much for some longtime Republicans. Former senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraskacalled his party “irresponsible” in an interview with the Financial Times in August, at the height of the debt-ceiling battle. “I think the Republican Party is captive to political movements that are very ideological, that are very narrow,” he said. “I’ve never seen so much intolerance as I see today in American politics.” <br> And Mike Lofgren, a veteran Republican congressional staffer, wrote an anguished diatribe last year about why he was ending his career on the Hill after nearly three decades. “The Republican Party is becoming less and less like a traditional political party in a representative democracy and becoming more like an apocalyptic cult, or one of the intensely ideological authoritarian parties of 20th century Europe,” he wrote on the Truthout Web site. <br> Shortly before Rep. West went off the rails with his accusations of communism in the Democratic Party, political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, who have long tracked historical trends in political polarization, said their studies of congressional votes found that Republicans are now more conservative than they have been in more than a century. Their data show a dramatic uptick in polarization, mostly caused by the sharp rightward move of the GOP. <br> If our democracy is to regain its health and vitality, the culture and ideological center of the Republican Party must change. In the short run, without a massive (and unlikely) across-the-board rejection of the GOP at the polls, that will not happen. If anything, Washington’s ideological divide will probably grow after the 2012 elections. <br> In the House, some of the remaining centrist and conservative “Blue Dog” Democrats have been targeted for extinction by redistricting, while even ardent tea party Republicans, such as freshman Rep. Alan Nunnelee (Miss.), have faced primary challenges from the right for being too accommodationist. And Mitt Romney’s rhetoric and positions offer no indication that he would govern differently if his party captures the White House and both chambers of Congress. <br> We understand the values of mainstream journalists, including the effort to report both sides of a story. But a balanced treatment of an unbalanced phenomenon distorts reality. If the political dynamics of Washington are unlikely to change anytime soon, at least we should change the way that reality is portrayed to the public. <br> Our advice to the press: Don’t seek professional safety through the even-handed, unfiltered presentation of opposing views. Which politician is telling the truth? Who is taking hostages, at what risks and to what ends? <br> Also, stop lending legitimacy to Senate filibusters by treating a 60-vote hurdle as routine. The framers certainly didn’t intend it to be. Report individual senators’ abusive use of holds and identify every time the minority party uses a filibuster to kill a bill or nomination with majority support. <br> Look ahead to the likely consequences of voters’ choices in the November elections. How would the candidates govern? What could they accomplish? What differences can people expect from a unified Republican or Democratic government, or one divided between the parties? <br> In the end, while the press can make certain political choices understandable, it is up to voters to decide. If they can punish ideological extremism at the polls and look skeptically upon candidates who profess to reject all dialogue and bargaining with opponents, then an insurgent outlier party will have some impetus to return to the center. Otherwise, our politics will get worse before it gets better. <br> tmann@brookings.edu <br> nornstein@aei.org <br> Thomas E. Mann is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and Norman J.

 “Why can’t we all get along?” The iconic question has become the fixation of much of Washington’s chattering class. David Brooks and Thomas Friedman censure President Obama for blowing the “Grand Bargain” or not embracing the recommendations of Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, co-chairs of the deficit reduction commission. Self-proclaimed bipartisan efforts — No Labels, Americans Elect — call for putting aside partisan squabbles and electing moderates who can get things done. <br> All this chatter leaves out one thing — any sense of reality. The old bipartisanship, such as it was, was built on the postwar economy that worked for everyone. Top-end taxes were at 90 percent, providing the resources to invest in essential programs such as the interstate highways, the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe, the G.I. bill and housing subsidies that educated a generation and built the suburbs. <br> In those days, U.S. companies exported goods rather than jobs, and a decent argument could be made that what was good for General Motors was in fact good for America. It wasn’t perfect. The “other America” lived lives of quiet desperation. Segregation still was brutally enforced. But the bipartisan consensus reflected an economy that was working for many, not just the few. <br> That is no longer true, and hasn’t been for years. Multinationals ship jobs abroad and park profits overseas to avoid taxes. Wall Street blew up the economy but got bailed out, with the bankers continuing to pocket the big bucks. Three-fourths of the country thinks the recession hasn’t ended. And no wonder: Wages are still falling and mass unemployment inflicts grinding misery. In 2010, the top 1 percent captured an obscene 93 percent of the rewards of “recovery.” <br> Not surprisingly, more and more Americans at both ends of the spectrum think Washington is corrupted by big money and big business. And when the parties do come together — as they recently did to pass the corporate-championed, falsely named JOBS Act that declares open season for fraudulent corporate stock offerings — they simply prove the case. <br> Also ignored in the plea for cooperation is the simple reality that the Republican Party has been captured by an extreme-right wrecking crew, who have not the slightest interest in compromise. Rather they are intent on gutting modern government, outside of the bloated military. Grover Norquist was delivering his normal incendiary rant in 2001 when he said he aimed to shrink government “to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.” At the time, I doubt even he expected that this year’s Republican House budget — devised by the Beltway favorite Paul Ryan — would actually aspire to that standard, reducing discretionary spending by 2050 to levels that can be met only by dismantling all of government outside of the military, Social Security, Medicare and other health programs. <br> Obama, a mediator by instinct and experience, paid a deep price by trying to pursue bipartisan cooperation. He wasted months on health care as Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) engaged in phantom negotiations with supposed Republican moderates. The president turned prematurely to deficit reduction, and then to seeking a grand bargain with John Boehner, impervious to the reality that Boehner could not produce his caucus for any kind of tax hikes. Now, for the election, the president has begun to clarify the stark differences between the parties, to the benefit of his reelection and the public’s understanding. <br> But what makes the elite consensus so dangerous is that we’re headed into a train wreck after the election that will require some kind of a deal. By the end of the year, if nothing is done, the Bush tax cuts, the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment benefits will expire, and the automatic sequester will cut another $110 billion out of discretionary spending for the remainder of the fiscal year. This would surely cripple the weak recovery we have, and very likely drive the economy into recession. <br> But the terms of the “grand bargain” represented by the Obama-Boehner negotiations or the Simpson-Bowles recommendations are skewed dramatically to the right. The basic outline exchanges cuts in Social Security and Medicare for “tax reform,” promising to lower tax rates while closing enough loopholes to raise revenues. That requires erasing the mortgage deduction for middle-class homeowners or ending the employer deduction for providing health care to employees. This notion of “shared sacrifice” is unconscionable, given that working Americans have been sacrificing for years and weren’t even invited to the Wall Street bacchanalia that created the mess. <br> Worse, the entire frame of the discussion — driven by Washington elites — is perverse. We should be focused on how to put people to work. How much should we take advantage of record-low interest rates and borrow to rebuild America and put construction workers back to work? How much should we raise taxes on Wall Street and multinationals to pay for rehiring teachers, and direct employment of young people? <br> Instead, guided once more by a misbegotten elite consensus, we’re going to argue about how much of a hit a barely growing economy should take. That’s a consensus the country can’t afford. <br> Read more from Opinions: <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: Deepening the progressive bench <br> Harold Meyerson: Class warfare on Wall Street <br> Katrina vanden Heuvel: Time to run for office, 99 percenters <br> Greg Sargent: The ‘centrist dodge’ <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 Lawrence H. Summers, a former economic adviser to President Obama, was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. <br> Economic forecasters divide into two groups: those who cannot know the future but think they can, and those who recognize their inability to know the future. Shifts in the economy are rarely forecast and often not fully recognized until they have been underway for some time. So judgments about the U.S. economy have to be tentative. What can be said is that for the first time in five years a resumption of growth significantly above the economy’s potential now appears to be a substantial possibility. Put differently, after years when the risks to the consensus modest growth forecast were to the downside, they are now very much two-sided. <br> As winter turned to spring in 2010 and 2011, many observers thought they detected evidence that the economy had decisively turned, only to be disappointed a few months later. A variety of considerations suggest that this time may be different. Employment growth has been running well ahead of population growth. The stock-market level is higher and its expected volatility lower than at any time since the crisis began in 2007, suggesting that the uncertainty hanging over business has declined. Consumers who have been deferring purchases of cars and other durable goods have created pent-up demand. The housing market seems to be stabilizing. For years the rate of family formation has been way below normal, as young people moved in with their parents. At some point they will set out on their own, creating a virtuous circle of a stronger housing market, more family formation and demand, and further improvement in housing conditions. Innovation around mobile information technology, social networking, and newly discovered oil and natural gas is likely, assuming appropriate regulatory policies, to drive significant investment and job creation. <br> True, salient risks remain of high oil prices, further problems in Europe, and financial fallout from anxiety about future deficits. Unlike in 2010 and 2011, however, it is likely that these risks are already priced into markets and factored into outlooks for consumer and business spending. There has already been a significant escalation in oil prices. The European situation is hardly resolved, but it is unlikely to deteriorate as much in the next months as it did last year. And market participants report great alarm about the deficit situation. So it would not take great news in any of these areas for them to actually contribute to upward revisions in current forecasts. <br> What are the implications for macroeconomic policy? Such recovery as we are enjoying is less a reflection of the natural resilience of the American economy than of the extraordinary steps that both fiscal and monetary policymakers have taken to offset private-sector deleveraging — a process that is far from complete. A convalescing patient who does not finish the full course of treatment takes a grave risk. So too the most serious risk to recovery over the next several years is no longer financial strains or external shocks but that policy will shift too quickly away from maintaining adequate demand toward a concern with traditional fiscal and monetary prudence. <br> On even a pessimistic reading of the economy’s potential, unemployment remains 2 percentage points above normal levels; employment, 5 million jobs below potential, and GDP, close to $1 trillion short of potential. Even with the economy creating 300,000 jobs a month and growing at 4 percent, it would take several years to re-attain normal conditions. So a lurch back this year toward the kind of policies that are appropriate in normal times would be quite premature. <br> Indeed, recent research on what economists label hysteresis effects suggests that slowing could have highly adverse consequences. Brad Delong and I argue in a recent paper that it is even possible premature and excessive movements toward fiscal contraction, by shrinking the economy, risk exacerbating long-run budget problems. <br> How then to respond to valid concerns about fiscal sustainability, excessive credit creation and the eventual return to normality in a world where policy credibility is essential? The right approach is policies that commit to normalizing conditions but only when certain thresholds are crossed. The Federal Reserve might commit to maintain the current Fed funds rate until some threshold with respect to unemployment or expected inflation is crossed. Commitments to fund infrastructure over many years might include a financing mechanism such as a gasoline tax that would be triggered when some level of employment or output growth has been achieved. Tax reform could phase in new rates in pace with the rising economic performance. <br> Contingent commitments have the virtue of providing clarity to households and businesses as to how policy will play out, and in areas where legislation is necessary, eliminating political uncertainty. They allow policymakers to project a simultaneous commitment to near-term expansion and medium-term prudence — exactly what we require right now. An element of contingency in policy is always there in a volatile world. Recognizing it explicitly is the way to provide confidence and protect credibility in a world whose future no one can gauge with precision. <br> Lawrence H.

 In their debates, ads and speeches, the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination are vying for the label of most Reagan-esque. <br> On taxes, “I take the Reagan approach,” former senator Rick Santorum said at a recent Florida debate. <br> On the economy, “under Ronald Reagan, we had . . . the right laws, the right regulators, the right leadership,” former House speaker Newt Gingrich said in a debate before his South Carolina primary victory. <br> Judging from the candidates’ tax proposals, they seem to believe that the most Reagan-like candidate is the one with the biggest tax cut. 
 Jeb Bush, a Republican, is co-chair of the Hispanic Leadership Network Conference and a former governor of Florida. <br> In the 15 states that are likely to decide who controls the White House and the Senate in 2013, Hispanic voters will represent the margin of victory. <br> For the Republican Party, the stakes could not be greater. Just eight years after the party’s successful effort to woo Hispanic voters in 2004, this community — the fastest-growing group in the United States, according to census data — has drifted away. <br> Although Democrats hold the edge, Republicans have an opportunity. We also have a record of winning Hispanic voters in certain statewide and national elections. Here are four suggestions on how Republican candidates can regain momentum with the most powerful swing voters. <br> First, we need to recognize this is not a monochromatic community but, rather, a deeply diverse one. Hispanics in this country include Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and many others. Some came here 50 years ago to make a better life; others came last year. Some have lots of education, some have none. The traditional Republican emphasis on the importance of the individual has never been more relevant. <br> Nevertheless, there are common features and dreams across this community. Hispanics understand, either personally or through close family members, what it means to come here as an immigrant. They know how hard it is to function without a full working knowledge of English. They have often felt the sting of prejudice and the threats of gang violence. They tire of the stereotypes built by the media and some politicians. Like all voters, Hispanics respond to candidates who show respect and understanding for their experiences. <br> Second, we should echo the aspirations of these voters. The American immigrant experience is the most aspirational story ever told. Immigrants left all that was familiar to them to come here and make a better life for their families. That they believe this is possible only in America is the best expression of American exceptionalism I know. And on this score, Republicans have a winning message and record as the party of the entrepreneur. We are the party of the family business, and the family business is the economic heart of Hispanic communities. <br> Third, we should press for an overhaul of our education system. Republicans have the field to themselves on this issue. Teachers unions and education bureaucrats have blocked Democrats from serious reform — it will happen only with Republican political leadership. But we have to move beyond simplistic plans to “get rid of the Department of Education” and focus on substantive, broad-based reform that includes school choice, robust accountability for underperforming schools and the elimination of social promotion, in which kids are passed along without mastering grade-level skills. Such improvements, it was noted in 2009, plus efforts to embrace digital learning, helped Hispanic students in Florida lead the nation among their peers. And Hispanic voters, who often feel their children are trapped in failing schools, notice. <br> Finally, we need to think of immigration reform as an economic issue, not just a border security issue. Numerous polls show that Hispanics agree with Republicans on the necessity of a secure border and enforceable and fair immigration laws to reduce illegal immigration and strengthen legal immigration. <br> Hispanics recognize that Democrats have failed to deliver on immigration reform, having chosen to spend their political capital on other priorities. <br> Republicans should reengage on this issue and reframe it. Start by recognizing that new Americans strengthen our economy. We need more people to come to this country, ready to work and to contribute their creativity to our economy. U.S. immigration policies should reflect that principle. Just as Republicans believe in free trade of goods, we should support the freer flow of human talent. <br> We need to connect immigration to other pro-growth policies, so that new Americans can apply their talents here and succeed. The United States needs an economy that is vibrant and dynamic, open to the contributions of new entrants. We have to reduce regulations across our economy, whenever they impede economic dynamism and flexibility in the labor market. We need secure energy supplies, radical tax reform and a reduced footprint of power of the state. <br> Immigration reform requires economic reforms. We must be able to assure new Americans the opportunity to succeed and contribute their talents. <br> And when they come, as surely they will, we must welcome them, no matter whether they speak Spanish or Creole or Portuguese. When we hear foreign languages in the streets of America, that is a validation of the Republican vision to create a place where people want to come and make their lives. Hispanics here speak or are learning English — not French, Chinese or Hindi. There is a lesson in that, and Republicans should be the ones to champion it. <br> More on this debate from PostOpinions: <br> Rubin: Can Republicans win over Hispanic voters? <br> Gerson: GOP candidates’ cynical accommodation of anger on immigration <br> Meyerson: Will Republicans continue to ostracize key voters? <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 With his speech in Kansas, President Obama has begun a national conversation about the economy and the role of government. In presenting his view, Obama shifted the economic conversation from deficits to the crucial issue of growth. After all, deficits matter because they could have a harmful effect on growth. The question we should all ask is: What would make this economy grow? <br> One theory heard a lot these days is that the economy is burdened by excessive government regulation, interference and taxes. All these pressures on business, especially small business, are keeping the economy down. Cut them, the Republican candidates all say, and the economy will be unleashed. It’s a compelling picture, but the data simply do not support it. <br> A World Economic Forum survey that ranks countries on their overall economic competitiveness puts the United States fifth; the countries ahead of it, including Singapore and Finland, are tiny, with populations around 5 percent that of the United States. The World Bank publishes a report that looks at “Doing Business” across the globe. The United States ranks No. 4, again behind a handful of tiny countries. As is the case with the World Economic Forum, that ranking has not changed much over the years. <br> The Kauffman Foundation, which looks at the level of U.S. entre­pre­neur­ship, found that in 2010, 340 out of every 100,000 Americans started a business each month. That rate hasn’t changed much in the past few years; it is only slightly higher than in 2007, before the recession. Regarding regulations, Bloomberg News has crunched the numbers and found that the Obama administration has not reviewed or issued significantly more rules than its predecessors. <br> The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released a study last week measuring tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The United States came in 27th out of 30 countries. Taxes are low in historical terms as well, the lowest since the early 1950s. But the complexity of the U.S. tax code clearly exacts a price in terms of economic growth and competitiveness. The World Bank study finds that the only category in which the United States is not in the top 20 is “paying taxes,” where it ranks a miserable 72. (The U.S. ranking has shifted from 76 in the 2008 report to 46 in 2009 to 61 in 2010.) Tax reform that gets rid of the loopholes, deductions and credits — and the inherent corruption related to them — would clearly help the economy. <br> So, outside of the tax code, the United States does not seem to have slipped very much in terms of competitiveness and ease of doing business. What has changed? The answer is pretty clear. Only five years ago, American infrastructure used to be ranked in the top 10 by the World Economic Forum. Now we’re 24th. U.S. air infrastructure has gone from 12th to 31st, roads from eighth to 20th. <br> The drop in human capital is greater. The United States used to have the world’s largest percentage of college graduates. We’re now No. 14, according to the most recent OECD data, and American students routinely rank toward the bottom of the developed world. The situation in science education is more drastic. The number of engineering degrees conferred annually decreased more than 11 percent between 1989 and 2000. Even with the increase in college attendance over the past two decades, there were fewer engineering and engineering technologies graduates in 2009 (84,636) than in 1989 (85,002). Research and development spending has risen under Obama, but the basic trend has been downward for two decades. In percentage terms, the federal share of research spending — which funds basic science — is half of what it was in the 1950s. <br> In other words, the big shift in the United States over the past two decades is not a rise in regulations and taxation but a decline in investment — in physical and human capital. And investment is the crucial locomotive of long-term growth. Michael Spence, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, points out that the United States got out of the Great Depression because of the spending associated with World War II but also because during the war, it dramatically reduced its consumption and expanded investments. People spent less, saved more and bought war bonds. That surge in investment — by people and government — produced a generation of growth after the war. If we want the next generation of growth, we need a similarly serious strategy of investment. 
 When Sen. Rob Portman finished a speech and news conference on Monday afternoon about the failure of the supercommittee on which he served, I attempted to bestow a premature label on the Ohio Republican. <br> “Thank you, Mr. Vice President.” <br> “That’s never going to happen,” Portman replied with a smile. As evidence, he offered, “What’s the one thing you wouldn’t want to do if you wanted to be the VP candidate? Join the supercommittee.” <br> I’m not convinced. <br> Had he joined the supercommittee and reached a debt-slashing deal, Portman’s political hopes might well have been doomed: The compromise would inevitably have included tax increases that are poison to the Republican voter base. But if he joined the supercommittee and refused to back down from the Republican no-new-taxes pledge, then the pyrrhic victory would – and did – leave Portman’s conservative credentials intact. <br> Democrats involved in the supercommittee tell me they’re disappointed in Portman, claiming he talked kumbaya in public but was unbending in private negotiations. They suspect he is looking out for his own ambitions, whether that means becoming the vice presidential nominee or rising into Senate leadership. <br> I hope he does get chosen as the vice presidential nominee. After the amateur hour that has been the GOP nominating process, the selection of a genuine grown-up such as Portman -- a longtime House member and President George W. Bush’s trade representative and budget director – would be reassuring. <br> The problem is that Portman appears to feel the need to shed his sensible disposition and to stiff-arm the opposition in order to be considered seriously for a promotion. <br> When Portman appeared at the American Enterprise Institute Monday afternoon to give his supercommittee postmortem, he struck a tone that was, for him, unusually partisan. Though he repeatedly spoke of the urgency of the debt problem, he spent more time blaming the Democrats. “This administration has now presided over a 21 percent increase in the size of government,” he charged. “The president at this point seems intent on doubling down on his policies.” Portman accused Obama of “ignoring the recommendations... of his own debt-reduction committee” and of an “absence of presidential leadership.” <br> “In the end,” the senator said, “the same core philosophical differences that have paralyzed Congress from making progress also prevented the committee as well from coming to agreement.” <br> Undoubtedly. But the committee members’ task was to overcome the differences. Portman on Monday was, for the most part, emphasizing them. “You’ve heard those pushing for trillions in higher taxes appeal to the need for a balanced approach,” he said. “The basic philosophy is I’ll give you a dollar in spending cuts if you give me a dollar in new taxes.” Actually, they’d give Portman two or three dollars in cuts for every dollar in new taxes – as evidenced by the same Bowles-Simpson commission Portman scolded Obama for ignoring. <br> Portman praised House budget committee chairman Paul Ryan’s tax-cutting plan and congressional Republicans’ “cut, cap and balance” legislation. He said Republicans had been willing to grant some increase in taxes (a matter of some dispute) but “we were not successful in that effort because most Democrats were not willing to work from that framework.” <br> Portman sought to explain away his earlier statement praising Democrats on the supercommittee for putting entitlement reform on the table: “I also said they only did so in the context of huge new tax increases.” As for why the supercommittee couldn’t reach even a small agreement, Portman said: “You’ll have to ask the Democrats.” <br> The member of the now-defunct committee said he would now attempt to enact some of the elements of the budget negotiations that Republicans favor, such as a tax reform package that doesn’t increase taxes. And he said he’ll seek to have any cuts in payroll taxes paid for by cutting mandatory programs, which include Medicare and Social Security. <br> The Post’s Felicia Sonmez asked if he would support a Senate vote on the Bowles-Simpson proposal. Portman avoided commitment, saying there’s “no legislative language that’s vetted and scored.” <br> Even when serving red meat, Portman sounds calm and even, reading from his text in a monotone, licking his lips often, and spicing his talk with accounting terms such as sequesters and extenders and reconciliation. <br> “Clearly, Washington is not working,” he said when he reached the end of his text. “We’ve always come together as Americans to solve tough problems. . . . We can solve this problem too, but only if we work together as Republicans, Democrats and independents.” <br> I bet Portman believes that. He’s one of the good guys in this town. But all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. <br> danamilbank@washpost.com <br> More from PostOpinions: <br> Cohen: Romney trades principles for votes <br> Gerson: Wrongs and righteous <br> Insiders: What worries Team Obama 
 The deficit that should most worry us is a deficit of reasonableness. The problems the United States confronts are large but not insoluble. Yet sensible solutions that are broadly popular can’t be enacted. <br> Why? Because an ideological bloc that sees every crisis as an opportunity to reduce the size of government holds enough power in Congress to stop us from doing what needs to be done. <br> Some of my middle-of-the-road columnist friends keep ascribing our difficulties to structural problems in our politics. A few call for a centrist third party. But the problem we face isn’t about structures or the party system. It’s about ideology — specifically a right-wing ideology that has temporarily taken over the Republican Party and needs to be defeated before we can have a reasonable debate between moderate conservatives and moderate progressives about our country’s future. <br> A centrist third party would divide the opposition to the right wing and ease its triumph. That’s the last thing authentic moderates should want. <br> Let’s look at the record, starting with the congressional supercommittee’s failure to reach agreement on a plan to reduce the fiscal deficit. It’s absurd to pretend that we can shrink the deficit over the long term without substantial tax increases. <br> No matter how hard policymakers try to trim spending on Medicare, its costs will go up for many years simply because so many baby boomers will be retiring between now and 2029. Moreover, employers will keep cutting back on coverage for their workers as long as the price of insurance continues to go up. <br> However we manage it, in other words, government will be required to pay an ever larger share of our nation’s health-care bills. That means the government’s share of the economy is destined to rise — unless we decide to leave a large part of our population with little or no protection against illness. <br> The least we can do under those circumstances is to repeal the tax cuts for the wealthy enacted under President George W. Bush. Yet the only revenue conservatives on the supercommittee put on the table involved $300 billion, most of it from ill-defined tax reforms, in exchange for lower tax rates on the rich and making something like $3.7 trillion worth of tax cuts permanent. <br> Progressives have already made clear that they are willing not only to increase revenue but also to cut Medicare costs. The Obama health-care law did both, and it was attacked by Republicans for doing so. Democrats on the supercommittee offered substantial entitlement cuts. But they rightly refused a deal that would squander years of future revenue in the name of keeping taxes low on the wealthiest Americans. <br> What might a reasonable budget argument look like? Progressives would propose fewer spending cuts in exchange for tax increases that would fall mainly on the wealthy: higher rates on top incomes, capital gains and estates, along with a financial transactions tax. Conservatives would counter with larger spending cuts coupled with taxes on consumption rather than on investment. Out of such a debate might come a sensible deal, based on a shared acknowledgment that long-term balance requires both thrift and new revenue. <br> In the meantime, a broad range of economists agree that America’s sputtering jobs machine needs a sharp and quick jolt. It is unconscionable that in the face of mass unemployment, Republicans continue to foil measures to spur employment, including an extension of the payroll tax holiday. How can conservatives declare simultaneously that (1) it would be a terrible crime to raise taxes on the rich in the long term, and (2) it is an act of virtue to raise taxes on the middle class immediately? Has class warfare ever been so naked? <br> Then there is immigration. Common sense says there is no way the United States can or should deport some 11 million illegal immigrants. But when Newt Gingrich spoke of this reality — and suggested that conservatives ought to worry about how deportations would break up families — he was said to have committed a gaffe that will end his ride as the Republican front-runner. In today’s GOP, it’s becoming dangerous to be sensible. <br> We need moderation all right, but a moderate third party is the one way to guarantee we won’t get it. If moderates really want to move the conversation to the center, they should devote their energies to confronting those who are blocking the way. And at this moment, the obstruction is coming from a radicalized right. <br> ejdionne@washpost.com <br> More from PostOpinions <br> Samuelson: Our sickly medical system <br> Sargent: Romney can’t stop flip-flopping <br> Rubin: Romney — don’t cut defense 
 We do not choose to add more to the blame game for failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction , but one Democratic talking point needs debunking: that the talks failed because of Republicans’ attachment to the Bush tax cuts. <br> The untold story of the negotiations is the significance of the Republican offer of fundamental tax reform. It is critical to understand the interplay between the proposal (dubbed the “Toomey plan”) and existing tax law. <br> First, a bit of history. The 2001 and 2003 changes to the tax code reduced marginal rates for all taxpayers as well as the rates for capital gains, dividends and the death tax. For technical reasons, all of these provisions expire at the end of next year — meaning that if Congress does not act, Americans will face the largest tax increase in our history. <br> This prospect has put a wet blanket over job creation and economic recovery. It would be the wrong medicine for our ailing economy. As President Obama has famously said, “You don’t raise taxes in a recession.” Partially to avoid this result, but also to try to meet the Democrats partway — given their absolute insistence on big, new tax increases — Republicans offered a proposal that would have both reformed the current code and produced significant new tax revenue. <br> Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin rightly called the Toomey plan a “breakthrough” in the negotiations; indeed, it was the only truly new idea offered during this process. <br> The essence of the plan was to dramatically reduce the deductions and credits wealthier taxpayers can claim to reduce their tax liability. That would generate enough revenue to both permanently reduce marginal rates for all taxpayers and provide more than $250 billion for deficit reduction. Added to other receipts, taxes and fees, the Republican plan amounted to more than $500 billion in deficit reduction revenue and $900 billion in spending reductions. We believe this lowering of the rates and broadening of the tax base would have spurred economic growth, created jobs and, in the process, generated billions more in revenue from growth in the economy. <br> Now, here’s the key: None of this can happen if the current law’s automatic tax increases occur on Jan. 1, 2013. We can’t both reform the code as Republicans propose and undo it all 12 months later. <br> Democrats made a point of saying that they would accept the new tax revenue in the plan but that they still also wanted the 2013 tax increase — which, of course, would negate the benefits of the proposal. <br> Why do Republicans believe our proposal is preferable to the automatic 2013 rate increases? Apart from the fact that our economy could not withstand the almost $4 trillion tax increase, it would directly and adversely affect small-business investment decisions. Business decisions are highly sensitive to the rates of the capital gains, dividends and death tax, as well as marginal tax rates. That’s why Republicans would leave them alone and raise revenue instead by limiting personal itemized deductions and credits that have much less impact on investment decisions by small-business owners. <br> The point is, it matters both how and how much the government takes from taxpayers. <br> So it was not some political attachment to the Bush tax cuts that stymied committee success but, rather, the refusal of the committee’s Democrats to acknowledge the inconsistency in claiming to accept the amount and way the Republican plan would raise tax revenue while insisting that the 2013 tax increases (at least those affecting investment decisions) must also occur. <br> At no time in the negotiations did the Democratic committee members drop their insistence that, one way or the other, any deal had to include a trillion dollars in new taxes. Republicans believe that would kill job creation and economic recovery. In the long run, a strong economy producing more wealth (and, therefore, more tax revenue) is how we will both reduce the deficit and regain the prosperity that all Americans deserve. <br> The writers are the Republican members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. Jon Kyl is a senator from Arizona. Rob Portman is a senator from Ohio. Pat Toomey is a senator from Pennsylvania. Jeb Hensarling is a representative from Texas. Fred Upton and Dave Camp are representatives from Michigan. 
 This might seem a tough time to celebrate Thanksgiving. The national mood is pessimistic. The economy continues to limp along. The failure of the supercommittee has come to symbolize the breakdown of not just governance but democratic politics. Yet there are reasons to be cheerful about the United States this week. <br> The United States continues to have the most dynamic economy in the developed world. We are enamored of Germany for having maintained its manufacturing base through timely reforms. That’s good, and we could learn a lot from other countries. But let’s note that Germany’s great companies are products of the second industrial revolution — from the early 20th century — clustering around cars, chemicals and machine tools. Germany has one notable company in the information economy, SAP. The post-industrial, information economy is dominated by the United States. The industries of the future, from biotechnology to nanotechnology, are dominated by the United States. The best research centers, universities and companies remain American. <br> We also have the most dynamic society in the developed world. While Japan has entered and Italy and Germany are approaching a demographic death spiral, the United States remains young, vibrant and active. Demographics is not destiny, but it helps mightily to have a growing society, with a healthy share of young workers — who are also taxpayers. This country still attracts the most immigrants and most investment in the world. <br> The United States has gone through a big bust, which has cast a long shadow on its economy. But to put it in perspective, it is not nearly as bad as the one that crippled Japan almost two decades ago. In a recent debate, former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers pointed out that housing prices in Japan dropped not by a third (as they have here) but by 85 percent; that the Japanese stock market plunged to a level that would be equivalent to the Dow falling to 2,600; and that the Japanese output gap — the difference between GDP growth and projected growth before the crisis — was 50 percent, not the 6 or 7 percent in the United States. <br> We should worry about what’s happening in Europe. But really, those problems are of a different order. Greece and other countries have debt problems. But they also have much larger competitiveness problems: They don’t make much that the world wants to buy. Italy’s economy has not grown in more than a decade. And crucially, these countries’ debts are denominated in a currency that they don’t control. The United States, by contrast, controls its currency, which is also the world’s reserve currency. That might produce a lack of discipline that has long-term risks, but it is unlikely to produce a European-style debt crisis anytime soon. Notice that as Europe faces its troubles, the borrowing costs for the United States keep dropping. <br> What about our political dysfunctions? These are real, but things are changing. Over the past two years we’ve seen political leadership from both parties at the state and local level. Governors such as Andrew Cuomo, Chris Christie and Jerry Brown are tackling deeply entrenched problems, such as pension shortfalls, that threaten to destroy state budgets. <br> A groundswell for deeper political reform has also begun to grow. In California, a committee of prominent Democrats and Republicans — Gray Davis, George Shultz, Eli Broad, Willie Brown, Condoleezza Rice and others — has produced a remarkable report endorsing a series of deep reforms. Next, they will put these on referendums to garner public support. The “Think Long” Committee has proposed fundamental tax reform that, while lowering rates, would yield $10 billion in new revenue to pay down debts and invest in education and infrastructure. It has outlined a series of smart structural changes to ensure better governance in the future. Nicolas Berggruen, the young, public-spirited billionaire who organized this effort, says, “The Committee has shown that difficult bi-partisan compromise can be reached if politics is set aside and the public interest is put first.” Other civic movements — Americans Elect, No Labels, Opportunity Nation — are out there trying to spur change through bottom-up activism. <br> Structural reform is crucial. We need sensible solutions to the problems of growth and deficits. But these exist. Simpson-Bowles and other commissions have already shown the way to lower deficits. The larger challenge is structural reforms to stop small minorities from blocking reform. We need to highlight the corrupt ways that Washington works — with Senate filibusters, secret and arbitrary holds and a broken budget process — and create a much more streamlined structure of governance for the 21st century. <br> The United States has problems. But unlike many other countries, it also has solutions. And since politicians won’t, citizens are increasingly finding ways to propose these solutions. That’s something to be thankful for — and hopeful about. 
 Here is a surefire way to cut $7.1 trillion from the deficit over the next decade. Do nothing. <br> That’s right. If Congress simply fails to act between now and Jan. 1, 2013, the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush expire, $1.2 trillion in additional budget cuts go through under the terms of last summer’s debt-ceiling deal, and a variety of other tax cuts also go away. <br> Knowing this, are you still sure that a “failure” by the congressional supercommittee to reach a deal would be such a disaster? <br> In an ideal world, of course, reasonable members of Congress could agree to a balanced package of long-term spending cuts and tax increases to begin bringing the deficit down, coupled with short-term measures to boost the economy. <br> But genuine compromise can’t happen because Republicans refuse to accept any significant tax increases. This is not a partisan statement. It is just a description of the facts. It is maddening that the media are so desperate to avoid being attacked as “liberal” that they cannot describe the situation as it is. <br> Democrats have put huge spending cuts on the table — and keep offering more and more and more. All the Democrats ask in return is that the cuts be balanced by some revenue. <br> By rejecting their offers, Republicans induce Democrats who are anxious for some deal — any deal — to keep coming their way. This approach is wrong and irresponsible but brilliant as a negotiating strategy. As my Post colleague Ezra Klein wrote this week: “Over the past year, Republicans have learned something important about negotiating budget deals with Democrats: If you don’t like their offer, just wait a couple of months.” <br> Finally, the Republicans decided they needed to look slightly flexible. So they came up with $300 billion in supposed revenue from a promised tax reform in a plan that also included a proposal to slash tax rates for the rich. There is a lot more tax-cutting here than revenue. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (Tex.), the Republican co-chairman of the supercommittee who said Tuesday that this was the GOP’s final offer, reversed field Wednesday, declaring himself open to other ideas. <br> Even Democrats inclined to capitulate know how shameful agreeing to such a deal would be. And mainstream, centrist deficit hawks should be grateful if a deal on such terms is killed. What Republicans want to do in effect is to make at least 90 percent of the Bush tax cuts permanent. This would make deficit reduction even harder in the future. <br> That’s where the do-nothing strategy comes in. Championed early this year in the New Republic by New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait, it looks even better now because of the spending cuts scheduled to go through if the supercommittee doesn’t act. <br> Already, Hensarling is suggesting undoing the promised defense reductions. Here is an opportunity to challenge the fake deficit hawks among conservatives: If military spending is so important, why are they not willing to ask wealthy Americans to finance it with slightly higher taxes? <br> The prospect of $7.1 trillion in tax increases and some cuts that would begin taking effect in January 2013 (thanks to Jim Horney of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities for walking me through the math) should hearten every deficit foe now prepared to mourn a failure by the supercommittee. <br> Because the bulk of the $7.1 trillion comes from automatic revenue increases, the power in future negotiations would shift toward those seeking a balance between cuts and taxes. Doing nothing is not an option when it comes to job creation. Congress still needs to act. But on the deficit, inaction now could lead to wiser action later. <br> Yes, this strategy works better if President Obama is reelected. Yet if Republicans take over the federal government in 2012, it should fall to them to enact the draconian cuts required to protect the wealthiest Americans from tax increases. No moderate or progressive should want to be complicit in this. <br> A balanced deal would be nice but it’s now impossible — and not because of some vague congressional “dysfunction” the media like to talk about. Sane fiscal policies are blocked because one party refuses to accept the need to roll back the excesses of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. If Congress does nothing, those tax cuts go away. That’s why a “failure” by the supercommittee to endorse a deeply flawed deal is actually a victory for sensible deficit reduction. <br> ejdionne@washpost.com <br> More from PostOpinions\ <br> Milbank: Going big to save the supercommittee <br> Will: Spending’s ascending, thanks to liberals <br> Ignatius: For GOP, covert action in plain sight 
 This is one columnist’s stab at what a candidate might sound like if he or she were trying to appeal to the majority of voters in the middle of the electorate who feel both parties are failing us. <br> My fellow alienated Americans: <br> How’s this for something different? I want to raise your taxes, cut spending on programs you like, and force you to rethink how we run our schools, banks, armies, hospitals and elections. And I want you to cheer when I’m done. Because if you embrace the “decade of renewal” I’m calling for, we’ll emerge with a more competitive, sustainable and just America — the kind of America we all want to leave to our children. <br> I’m running for president as an independent because we need to change the debate if we’re going to change the country. Neither of our two major parties has a strategy for solving our biggest problems; they have strategies for winning elections, which isn’t the same thing. Democrats and Republicans will tell you, as I do, that they want to make America competitive again, keep faith with our deepest values of fairness and opportunity, and fix our broken political system. But the Democrats’ timid half-measures and the Republicans’ mindless anti-government creed can’t begin to get us there. Both parties are prisoner to interest groups and ideological litmus tests that prevent them from blending the best of liberal and conservative thinking. And neither party trusts you enough to lay out the facts and explain the steps we need to take to truly fix things — in fact, their pollsters tell them that if they do, you’ll vote them out. <br> Well, I’m happy to take on that job. I won’t give you the usual pabulum about how we’re going to “save the American Dream” or restore our supremacy as the sole superpower. The loss of our economic dominance was at some point inevitable. We’ve had quite a run since World War II, when we were the only economy left standing, and others were bound to start catching up. The spread of capitalism is helping hundreds of millions of people rise out of poverty in India and China. That’s a fantastic thing for humanity. And if we manage it right, that can also be a positive thing for the United States, because the growing wealth of nations means billions of new customers for the kind of goods and services America ingenuity can produce. <br> We can make this an era of opportunities, not threats. But only if we think differently. When the changes reshaping the global economy are dramatic, incremental responses won’t suffice. We need a bold agenda equal to the scale of our challenges. <br> I believe that it will take seven big domestic initiatives to get America back on track. Bear with me if I go a little deep on the details, because that’s the only way for you to see what I mean. <br> 1. Fix the economy. Our economy is working off a massive hangover of debt that makes this recession and recovery different from those we’ve gone through before. That means we need to make major moves to get jobs and growth back to anything like what we think of as normal. It also means that, for a couple years, worries about the budget deficit have to take a backseat to spurring growth. Fix the economy, and it’ll be easier to fix the budget. <br> To boost jobs and growth, we first need major, permanent tax reform. I propose we slash, and over five years eliminate, our sky-high corporate income and payroll taxes, and, once unemployment comes down to 6 percent again, we replace those job-killing, wage-crushing taxes with new taxes on consumption and dirty energy. This is the way to unleash a new era of entrepreneurial innovation while funding the government we need. <br> At the same time, to win back the million jobs now lost because China’s currency manipulation artificially raises the price of our exports to that country, I would impose a proportionate tax on imports from China. Let me be clear: China’s rise as an economic power is a good thing for the world and a great thing for the Chinese people. China is not the source of all our economic woes. But we can no longer allow China’s brazen currency manipulation — nor its routine theft of American intellectual property — to tilt the playing field unfairly against American jobs. <br> Next, until private-sector job growth gets back to where it should be, we should use government funds to create millions of short-term, labor-intensive service jobs in fields like education, elder care, public health and safety, and urban infrastructure maintenance. I would also put Americans to work on the countless roads, bridges, airports, schools and sewer systems across the country that need to be modernized. <br> Finally, over the longer-term, we need to make sure in-person service-sector work is well compensated. Global economic integration is putting downward pressure on the wages of American jobs that can be performed elsewhere. But in-person service work — jobs ranging from home health care to retail sales to teaching to personal grooming and more, accounting for roughly 30 million jobs in the United States — is immune to these pressures, since it can’t be offshored. If we could find ways to guarantee that this kind of work delivers a middle-class living, it would offer an important measure of security and optimism for millions. <br> I’ll also develop new “carrots” and “sticks” to get multinational firms to locate more manufacturing and high-value jobs in America. <br> 2. Fix education. We’ve been tinkering at the edges when it comes to school improvement, because we’ve ignored the most important question: Who should teach? While the world’s highest-performing school systems — those in places like Singapore, Finland and South Korea — recruit their teachers from the top third of their graduating class, we recruit ours from the middle and bottom thirds, especially for schools in poor neighborhoods. This “strategy” isn’t working. Up through the 1970s, the quality of our teacher corps was in effect subsidized by discrimination, because women and minorities didn’t have many other job opportunities. All that’s changed, but as career options have multiplied for those who used to become teachers, salaries haven’t kept pace to attract top talent. <br> I see an America where our most talented young people flock to the classroom, not to Wall Street. They should see teaching as the most exciting profession in the country — with top teachers and principals able to earn $150,000 a year or more. To get there will take federal investment. We’ll need to stop condemning millions of poor children to schools that can never get great teachers and principals because they’ve been shortchanged by a 19th century system of local school finance that’s rigged against them. This investment should also help to fund universal preschool from age 3, and longer school days and years, where we lag our major economic competitors. <br> 3. Fix health care. We need to make sure every person in America has basic health coverage that doesn’t break the bank. To achieve that, Democrats must accept a private insurance industry and Republicans must accept that some people can’t afford decent policies on their own. This “grand bargain” is about liberals agreeing that innovation shouldn’t be regulated out of U.S. health care and conservatives agreeing that justice has to be regulated into it. The 50 million uninsured may seem invisible, but today their ranks are equal to the combined populations of Oklahoma, Connecticut, Iowa, Mississippi, Kansas, Kentucky, Arkansas, Utah, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico, West Virginia, Nebraska, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Montana, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming. Would America turn its back on these 25 states if they all lacked basic health coverage? That is what we’ve been doing for decades. <br> Making the system more efficient is the key to access and affordability. But change won’t come easy, because while there’s much to admire in American health care, our Medical-Industrial Complex knows that every dollar of health-care “waste” is somebody’s dollar of income. It’s time to learn from a nation like Singapore, which spends 4 percent of GDP on health care and gets as good or better results than we do spending 17 percent. Singapore’s blend of market forces, public provision and personal responsibility shows it is possible to do more with less. I applaud President Obama for taking on the health-care challenge and for persisting in spite of wrongheaded GOP charges that his extension of Mitt Romney’s reform in Massachusetts is a “socialist takeover.” Repealing President Obama’s legislation would be a terrible step backward. But the law can be dramatically improved before it is fully phased in. We should “mend it, not end it.” <br> I’d tweak President Obama’s reform so that it aims for less costly catastrophic insurance for every American, which would cap health expenses as a percent of income. I’d then give vouchers, or funded health-savings accounts, to folks who need help buying primary and preventive care via the fitness-club model being pioneered around the country (unlimited care for a flat monthly fee). I’d replace today’s malpractice litigation lottery with a system that protects doctors from liability so long as they’ve followed evidence-based best practices. This would put an end to the “defensive medicine” that runs up costs — a common-sense reform that Democrats shamefully reject as a sop to the trial lawyers who fund their campaigns. It’s also time we got corporations out of the business of running our welfare state — they’ve got enough to do to compete with China and India — and ensure that every American has access to group rates through health reform’s insurance exchanges. <br> 4. Rein in Wall Street. The banking system is now more concentrated than it was before the financial crisis. There are two ways to avoid the “too big to fail” threat that still exists. We can limit the risks these big banks take — though regulators don’t have a great track record of getting this right. The most important thing we can do, therefore, is make sure big banks have enough capital to absorb any conceivable losses. Yet bank lobbyists are now swarming Washington to keep capital requirements low – in part because higher levels of capital reduce what top bankers can pay themselves. Their bonuses are often based on such metrics as a firm’s “return on equity,” which can be goosed by continually piling debt atop a tiny equity base. That’s Wall Street’s plan. Heads, I win; tails, taxpayers lose. Again. <br> Fixing this is not complicated, it just takes the will to reject the banks’ demands. I would boost capital requirements for our “too big to fail” banks toward 20 percent, as Switzerland has done — well beyond the inadequate 5-percent to 7-percent levels bank lobbyists are counting on. I’ll also ban “naked credit default swaps” – those fancy securities that let traders buy the financial equivalent of insurance on other people’s lives. These instruments serve no social purpose other than to enrich the bankers who peddle them while turning our financial system into the casino that just cost millions of Americans their jobs. The banks will squeal, but does anyone think we should listen to their pleas after their greed, mismanagement and poor judgment nearly brought down the world economy? It’s time for finance to serve our broader society, not the other way around. And it’s past time to prosecute those whose crimes contributed to the crisis. <br> 5. Fix our broken political system. We’ll never get where we need to go unless we deepen our democracy. I have several proposals that go beyond the usual “small ball” in this terrain, so please keep an open mind. <br> First, let’s enter everyone who votes in a national election into a lottery. Prizes could range from $10 million for a winner to dozens of $1 million runners-up. For a modest cost, this would lift turnout from today’s pathetic 60 percent in presidential years, and one-third in off-years, closer to 100 percent every time. Unorthodox? You bet. But we need to shake things up. <br> Next, on campaign finance, we should stop deluding ourselves that we can ever get private money out of politics. We can’t. It’s like ants in the kitchen. You plug one hole and they come back somewhere else. Instead, let’s offset this private cash by giving each voter 50 publicly funded “patriot dollars” to contribute to the candidate or cause of her choice in national elections. This would introduce $6 billion each election cycle — more than enough to offset private donations. And it would encourage candidates to appeal to average Americans rather than just grovel before wealthy donors. Pair this publicly funded voucher with instant Web-based disclosure of all donations and we’d have a far more level, transparent playing field. <br> Finally, let’s lower the voting age to 15. From debt to schools, and climate to pensions, the distinctive feature of public life today is a shocking disregard for the future. Yes, politicians blather on about “our children and grandchildren” all the time – but when it comes to what they do, the future doesn’t have a vote. We should give our elected leaders a reason not simply to praise children but to pander to them. A crusade to amend the constitution to lower the voting age would inspire a generation that’s being robbed by the adults in power to enter the arena and raise its voice. <br> It’s also time we restored majority rule to America by scrapping the filibuster in the Senate. We can’t govern ourselves if national legislation can be blocked by senators who represent as little as 15 percent of the country. <br> 6. Require national service. The conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. was right: The proper response to the blessings that are every American’s patrimony is gratitude. It’s only right that this be expressed through a period of mandatory service of some kind by every young American, who will not only give back to his country but, in the process, get to know fellow citizens from every race and place and background. <br> 7. Get our fiscal house in order. Finally, I would aim to balance the budget by 2018 and make sure we can sustainably fund the government by enacting measures that would start once the economy has fully recovered and unemployment is back near 6 percent. We’ll need both spending cuts and tax increases borne fairly by every sector of society. <br> On the spending side, let me mention the three big areas we need to tackle. <br> First, national security is job one for any president. To make sure that no power can threaten us, I believe we must spend far more than any conceivable rival. But I also believe, in the Eisenhower tradition, that we need to be smart hawks. If Ike were here, he’d say it was crazy that the defense budget is 50 percent higher in real terms than it was throughout the Cold War. That’s why I’d insist we spend seven times more than China – but not nine times more, as our two political parties want; 13 times more than Russia, but not 17 times more; and 26 times more than Iran, North Korea and Syria combined – but not 33 times more. The result would be an annual military budget of $550 billion, not $700 billion. <br> Second, on Social Security, the path to solvency starts with a fresh look at automatic increases built into the system that few Americans are aware of — increases that no politician dares mention for fear of being attacked for “cutting” Social Security. I’m not talking about the way benefits are hiked each year to keep up with inflation; no problem there. But under today’s formulas, the starting benefits for future retirees are substantially higher than for current retirees. For example, today, medium wage retirees get a starting benefit of about $18,000. Similar retirees in the year 2030 are slated to get roughly $24,000 in today’s dollars; by 2050, the number in today’s dollars rises to $29,000. Doubling the number of retirees on Social Security as the boomers age is a major fiscal challenge. Promising a 60 percent increase in starting benefits on top of this creates a budget hole that is frightening. <br> Advocates for these built-in increases, which didn’t exist before the late 1970s, say Social Security should always replace the same portion of wages as it does today; since real wages will grow as the economy grows, so should benefits. That’s a worthy objective. But in an era when health care and pensions for seniors are poised to crowd out cash for every other public priority, or else require tax increases beyond what anyone thinks would be good for the economy, that shouldn’t be our only objective. <br> Halting these automatic benefit escalators a few years from now would make Social Security solvent in one stroke. It would assure that every retiring senior receives slightly higher benefits than new retirees do today. Yet it would leave America the room to address new needs down the road. This is the kind of action a prudent nation takes. If, years from now, we think seniors need additional protection, 76 million baby boomers will be breathing down our politicians’ necks clamoring for it. <br> Third, it’s the same with Medicare. Given how inefficient our health-care system is, we simply have to establish targets that get growth in health costs in line with the growth rate of our economy, and ideally something well below that. We know this is possible, because every other advanced nation does more with less. And it’s the only way to free up resources to invest in the infrastructure, education, and research and development that fuels long-term growth. <br> For both Social Security and Medicare, we’ll also need to phase in higher eligibility ages to reflect the longer lifespans Americans now enjoy — with eligibility exceptions for those engaged in physical labor. Higher-income Americans will also need to contribute something more to these programs, and receive a bit less, to make the boomers’ golden years affordable for the country. <br> Getting our fiscal house in order will also mean higher taxes. New taxes on dirty energy would push markets toward the clean energy solutions that reduce carbon emissions and our dependence on unstable foreign regimes. And we could offset the impact on folks with lower incomes with lower payroll taxes. I would challenge the oil companies to support this vision, as several did when Ross Perot proposed higher gas taxes in 1992. I would also introduce a tiny tax on Wall Street trading transactions and a 50 percent tax bracket for Americans earning more than $5 million a year. This isn’t an attempt to “punish” anyone’s success — it’s about asking the most fortunate among us to help in ways that won’t affect their lifestyle or incentives. Finally, I’d end the Bush tax cuts for all Americans, not just for those earning more than $250,000. Anyone who looks honestly at the numbers knows this is necessary as our population ages. <br> Some people will say these ideas involve too much tough medicine and too little optimism. But I am optimistic. I believe Americans are ready for the sturdier brand of hope that comes from dealing squarely with the facts. And if we come together for a decade of renewal, we’ll emerge with an America that’s more competitive, sustainable and just. We won’t have to storm the beaches of Normandy or Guadalcanal. We’ll just have to accept slightly higher taxes and some trims in future spending on programs we like, and we’ll have to commit to making our health care and education systems more productive. We’ll need to think creatively about the national interest, not just our own. Isn’t a stronger America worth these modest sacrifices? <br> As you may have noticed, I haven’t said anything about abortion, the death penalty, guns or gay marriage. These are important issues, but they’re not the most important things a president should address in the years ahead. As a result, I won’t discuss them at all in the campaign. If they’re your top priority, I’m not your candidate. <br> Can we win with this message and this agenda? That’s up to you. Republicans and Democrats have a longtime lock on things. They’ve rigged the system when it comes to getting on the ballot and raising money. <br> But two things are clear. First, a third-party movement in 2012 won’t be a “spoiler.” There is little risk of a Ralph Nader-style result that diverts a handful of votes and throws the election to a candidate those voters can’t abide. The terrain this campaign is contesting is very different. Most Americans now tell pollsters they’re open to a third party. The millions of Americans ready to stand behind the banner of pragmatic renewal means we’ll be playing for keeps, not tinkering at the margins. <br> Plus, we don’t have to win the election to change the country. As historian Richard Hofstadter suggested, the role of third parties in American politics is to sting like a bee and then die. I say, let the stinging begin! If we get 30 percent of the vote, we’ll make more than enough noise to transform the debate. And once we start proving there’s a constituency for honest talk and real answers, there’s no telling where it will lead. <br> In the end, in a democracy, we get the government we deserve, and I’m wagering most of us think we deserve better. That iron law of politics still holds: Politicians will scramble to lead any parade that forms. Let’s get busy organizing the right parade, and together we might just save the country. <br> Matt Miller writes a weekly online column for The Post. 
 During his recent speech to Congress, President Obama gave Republicans this ideological glove to the face: “We all remember Abraham Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union. . . . But in the middle of a Civil War, he was also a leader who looked to the future — a Republican president who mobilized government to build the Transcontinental Railroad, launch the National Academy of Sciences, set up the first land-grant colleges.” <br> It is a familiar rhetorical tactic — an attempt to checkmate your opponent by moving his own king. During Ronald Reagan’s 1980 Republican convention speech, he quoted Franklin Roosevelt on the need to “eliminate unnecessary functions of government.” Countless Republicans have offered up John F. Kennedy on the efficacy of tax cuts. <br> But invoking Lincoln at the seance is always risky. He is not a tame spirit. <br> There is little doubt that the greatest Republican would now be viewed, in portions of his party, as a RINO — a Republican in Name Only. Lincoln was a lifelong advocate of Whig economics, in which government took a limited but vigorous role in promoting economic opportunity. Lincoln foresaw a vast, prosperous, commercial republic, bound and strengthened by a national bank and by publicly financed roads, canals and rails. He had little patience with Thomas Jefferson’s anti-government ideology. A great nation, in Lincoln’s view, would require free labor, public education and avenues for commerce. <br> This type of Republicanism is a challenge to Tea Party ideology, as Obama implied in his speech. Yet Obama still looks awkward in the stovepipe hat. Lincoln was an enthusiast for entrepreneurial capitalism. Government’s goal was to promote opportunity and social mobility, not to assure certain economic outcomes. Lincoln asserted a “harmony of interests” between the working class and the wealthy, since the goal of the working class, in his view, was to become the wealthy. “We do not propose any war upon capital,” he said. The objective is “to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else.” <br> But Obama’s largest economic failing comes on precisely the point where he praises Lincoln as a leader who looked to the future. <br> It is now clear that the economic crisis faced by Obama at the beginning of his term was not a normal recession. Cleaning up after a financial panic adds an extra degree of difficulty. But this downturn also intensified a set of concerns about the continued viability of the American economic model in a time of aggressive global competition. An insatiable entitlement system, a burdensome tax code, a gridlocked political system and a broadly failing education system (apart from world-class universities) are leading many to suspect that America’s global standing is in relative decline. <br> Yet Obama’s response to this extraordinary challenge was utterly ordinary. He pushed a typical Democratic stimulus plan, which mainly transferred funds to state and local governments and public-employee unions. He added a new health entitlement and argued for higher taxes on the wealthy. In Obama’s favor, his Race to the Top education reform was innovative. But he made the entitlement problem worse, ignored his own Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction commission, directed attention away from meaningful tax reform and — with three years of budget deficits each exceeding $1 trillion — provoked a bitter national argument on the size and role of government. How could anyone have imagined that Obama’s tired, mid-century Keynesianism would reassure investors, creditors and consumers? And it didn’t. <br> Obama’s joint-session speech at least mentioned some of the real issues — an unsustainable Medicare system and a complex, inefficient tax code. But his policy initiatives are still largely focused on mitigating current employment problems, not on unleashing the next round of American growth and enterprise. The modern equivalent of Lincoln’s transcontinental railroad is not to build another one right next to it. It is, among other things, serious entitlement reform, a simpler tax code and regulatory structure, and education reform — particularly on teacher quality and parental choice — that would make education unions scream and swoon. <br> America has stumbled into the age of shoddy. Our deficits mount, our politicians squabble, our credit is downgraded, our firms can’t compete, our workers lose hope, our military is about to be hollowed out by massive cuts. Obama can rightly complain that he didn’t cause all of this. But he also didn’t muster much ideological creativity to fight it. He has been unable to think anew and act anew — and so fails the Lincoln test. 
 WITH A HANDFUL of exceptions, every Republican member of Congress has signed a pledge against increasing taxes. Would allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire as scheduled in 2012 violate this vow? We posed this question to Grover Norquist, its author and enforcer, and his answer was both surprising and encouraging: No. <br> In other words, according to Mr. Norquist’s interpretation of the Americans for Tax Reform pledge, lawmakers have the technical leeway to bring in as much as $4 trillion in new tax revenue — the cost of extending President George W. Bush’s tax cuts for another decade — without being accused of breaking their promise. “Not continuing a tax cut is not technically a tax increase,” Mr. Norquist told us. So it doesn’t violate the pledge? “We wouldn’t hold it that way,” he said. <br> Of course, letting the tax cuts expire is decidedly not Mr. Norquist’s preference. Indeed, as a matter of policy, he is passionately opposed to a single dime in new tax revenue. But the fact that Mr. Norquist interprets his own pledge to permit such conduct suggests that Republican lawmakers who have been browbeaten into abjuring any tax increase, at any time, for any reason, may not be as boxed in as they believe. The official Republican line has been that allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire, even for those earning more than $250,000, would be a job-killing tax increase. The fact that the godfather of the pledge does not interpret the lapse as an increase is significant. <br> Mr. Norquist’s comments come at a moment of remarkable and welcome fluidity in what had seemed to be a solid wall of Republican opposition to raising any tax revenue at any time for any reason. The surprising reemergence and expansion of the Senate Gang of Six this week was accompanied by a flurry of statements from Republican senators endorsing a proposal that included $1 trillion in new tax revenue. “This is a serious, bipartisan proposal that will help stop Washington from spending money that we don’t have, and I support it,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the GOP conference chair. “A fair compromise,” said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.). There may not be time to translate the gang plan into law as the debt ceiling looms, but these reactions suggest that future negotiations could be conducted from a base line of reality. <br> Too often in recent years, the tax debate has resembled a one-way ratchet: Taxes can go down but never back up, except if a booming economy produces additional revenue. It is important to remember that the Bush tax cuts were passed at a moment when, hard as it may be to believe, enormous surpluses were in sight and a big worry among economic poobahs was whether the debt was being paid off too quickly. There is no policy basis for insisting that these tax rates are graven in stone and immune to change given the changed circumstances. And the Norquist pledge, it turns out, is not a suicide pact preventing such a sober reassessment. 
 Donald Trump’s pathological political exhibitionism has ended, Newt Gingrich has incinerated himself with an incoherent retraction tour, Mitt Romney has reaffirmed his enthusiasm for his Massachusetts health-care law, rendering himself incapable of articulating the case against Obamacare and the entitlement state generally, Haley Barbour, Mike Huckabee and Mitch Daniels, aware of the axiom that anyone who will do what must be done to become president should not be allowed to be president, are out. <br> Watching this from his new home in Washington’s tony Kalorama neighborhood and his office at 1455 Pennsylvania Ave., Jon Huntsman, 51, former Utah governor and recently resigned ambassador to China, contemplates moving his office two blocks west. The Republican contest may soon acquire a photogenic family and a distinctive foreign policy voice. <br> The independently wealthy Huntsmans have seven children, among them two adopted daughters from China and India, and a son at Annapolis aspiring to be a Navy SEAL. Huntsman’s economic policies are Republican orthodoxy. His national security policies may make him the neoconservatives’ nightmare but a welcome novelty for a larger constituency. <br> “Capital is a coward,” Huntsman says, meaning capital is rational — it flees risky environments, which Obama administration policies create. He favors tax reform to stimulate capital formation, including a corporate tax rate of 24 percent or lower. He thinks lower but more inclusive income tax rates would be good economics — and good civics, reducing the share of households (47 percent in 2009) that pay no income taxes. At first saying Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget “is worthy of consideration” and later endorsing it, he says: “If you’re frightened of Ryan’s road map, you have not looked at our accumulating debt.” <br> Speaking in Washington this month, he will explain the need to “clean up the map” of foreign policy. He is among the sizable American majority disturbed that there is no discernible winning outcome in, or exit strategy from, Afghanistan, where, he says, there is now, and will be when we leave, a civil war that need not greatly concern us. <br> He believes significant savings can be found in the process of making the defense budget congruent with more judicious uses of U.S. military assets. This means more reliance on special operations, fewer interventions requiring large deployments — and no absent-minded interventions like that in Libya. <br> How will the Republican nominating electorate, preoccupied with questions about domestic policy and the role of government, respond to a candidate stressing national security and those national security positions? Huntsman replies: “I don’t know, but we’re about to find out.” <br> With one of his 2012 rivals, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, Huntsman co-chaired John McCain’s 2008 campaign, from which he has drawn key advisers. Like McCain, Huntsman will bypass Iowa. “I don’t like subsidies,” he says, so he opposes the Church of Ethanol, the established religion out “where the tall corn grows.” New Hampshire, however, he says, “likes margin-of-error candidates with a message.” In South Carolina, his cadre of supporters includes Mike Campbell, Huckabee’s 2008 state chairman. Huntsman hopes for a respectable showing in Michigan, and he will also focus on Florida, where his wife is from and his campaign headquarters will be, in Orlando. <br> If Barack Obama wins a second term, this will be the first time there have been three consecutive two-term presidencies since Jefferson, Madison and Monroe between 1801 and 1825. The Republican nominee will be chosen by a relatively small cohort consisting of those Americans most determined that this not happen. Nominating electorates make up in intensity what they lack in size. They pay close attention to presidential politics early, and participate in cold-weather events, because they have a heat fueled by ideology. Cool-hand Huntsman, with his polished persona and the complementary fluencies of a governor and a diplomat, might find those virtues are, if not defects, of secondary importance in the competition to enkindle Republicans eager to feast on rhetorical red meat. <br> So it is difficult to chart Huntsman’s path to the Republicans’ Tampa convention through a nominating electorate that is understandably furious about Obama’s demonstrably imprudent and constitutionally dubious domestic policies. Even if that electorate approves Huntsman’s un-Obamalike health-care reforms in Utah and forgives his flirtation with a fanciful climate-change regime among Western states, he faces the worthy but daunting challenge of bringing Tea Party Republicans — disproportionately important in the nominating process — to a boil about foreign policy. 
 Where is the Senate? <br> Our country is facing the greatest threat to our freedom and future since 1941. Any honest view of our debt, deficits, size of government and demographic challenges shows we must make major changes if we are going to pass on the American way of life to our children. Each week seems to bring new warning signs: slower-than-expected growth (already as much as 25 to 33 percent every year, some estimate), higher-than-expected unemployment numbers, admonitions to get our act together from the international financial community. <br> If these facts are true — and very few policymakers deny them — why has the U.S. Senate become the least deliberative “greatest deliberative body” in the world? <br> The lack of leadership and initiative in the Senate is appalling. As of this week, the Senate has held just 72 roll call votes this year, about one per legislative day on mostly noncontroversial and inconsequential matters. By this time last year, we had taken more than twice that number of votes (152). By this time in 2009, we had taken 192 votes. If we continue to avoid tough choices, we will lose control of our economic destiny and go down in history as the Senate that lost America. Our epitaph will read: Never before in the field of legislating was so much ignored by so many for so long. <br> For the past several months I have been meeting with a small group of senators from both parties, informally known as the Gang of Six, that was designed to force the idle — not gridlocked — Senate, and then the House and the president, to enact a long-term deficit-reduction package. Our talks reached an impasse this week when, in my view, it became clear we would not be able to produce a balanced, specific and comprehensive deal that would improve on, and in some ways meet, the standard set by the Bowles-Simpson plan. <br> I understand the disappointment, and real danger, associated with our impasse. The question, though, is not how we tried and failed but why the Senate has not even tried. Commissions and “gangs” form when members lose confidence in the institutions in which they serve. Working groups have their place — but they should support, not replace, the open work of the full Senate. The truth is that we already have a permanent standing debt commission. It’s called Congress. <br> We are facing what Democrat Erskine Bowles calls the most predictable economic crisis in history. There is no excuse for not having bills on the Senate floor with an open amendment process that allows the American people to fully comprehend not only the magnitude of our problems but the possible solutions. The people need to hear the Senate debate the central issues of our time. The limited progress that has been made to bring sobriety to Congress, such as the end of the earmark orgy, was made possible through a relentless floor campaign publicizing amendment after amendment and cut after cut. Change happens when the American people see real debate, not partisan political theater. <br> As the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid bears special responsibility for failing to direct attention to the central challenges of our time. His floor strategy seems to be focused on saving Democrats more than democracy. I would relish a debate on tax earmarks, spending cuts and competing budgets (if there were competing budgets), yet the votes he seems most interested in scheduling — such as tax breaks for big oil companies — are designed for short-term political gain rather than long-term deficit reduction. <br> It is not realistic to expect six members to pull the Senate out of its dysfunction and lethargy. Some will ask why we should have more hope in an open, deliberative process, in which all senators are engaged, when a dedicated few did not succeed. The America I know comes together when tough times call for us to do so. It’s time for the Senate to earn its reputation as the world’s greatest deliberative body and help lead that effort. The constituency to help 60 senators agree on a balanced deficit-reduction plan already exists among the public. The public rightly prefers spending cuts over revenue increases, but numerous polls indicate the vast majority of Americans would support the only type of plan that would ever make it out of Congress and be signed into law: one that favors spending cuts over revenue increases but includes both. <br> Getting there, however, will require the Senate to put forward specific solutions and win public support for serious entitlement reform and tax reform. In the coming weeks I’ll be putting forward my own proposal that puts everything on the table and cuts $9 trillion in spending over the next decade. I hope my colleagues present their ideas as well. I’m confident that in a free and open debate, the best solutions for America will prevail, but only if we have the debate. <br> History has not been kind to republics that pretend they can borrow and spend beyond their means indefinitely. We can cheat history, but only if we act quickly. If senators put our national security ahead of our political security, the American people will see there is no problem we cannot solve. Let the debate begin. <br> The writer is a Republican senator from Oklahoma. <br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. 
 President Obama made one of the most important speeches of his presidency on Wednesday. It was an eloquent defense of his basic approach to government and outlined specifically how he would tackle the nation’s long-term debt problems. For people who have been searching for Barack Obama’s core beliefs, this speech is perhaps the single best place to start — though it fell short in one important aspect. <br> Obama revealed himself to be a left-of-center Democrat, but not very far left. To begin with, he accepts the proposition that the deficit is America’s biggest challenge; proposed a set of measures that would reduce the deficit, with large spending cuts in all programs and — crucially — proposed a fail-safe so that if the deficit targets are not met, Congress would immediately cut spending further or raise more taxes. <br> This last feature may be the most important specific proposal in Obama’s plan, and a sign of its credibility, because it addresses the glaring flaw in almost every budget proposal: magical assumptions about economic growth, tax revenue, efficiencies and cost reductions. On paper, of course, these assumptions show the deficit falling drastically. A fail-safe ensures that if the assumptions don’t work out — which is highly likely — and the deficit expands, Congress is forced to act. <br> Obama presented a vision of an activist government that will make crucial investments in education, infrastructure and research. These investments have been as much a part of American history, he noted, as a vibrant market economy. Without such government support, there would be no American semiconductor industry, no early adoption of computers, no Internet, no global-positioning system. <br> Obama also pointed out that other countries are investing heavily in these areas. Since 1998, for example, China has tripled the percentage of its gross domestic product devoted to education. The number of college students quintupled, from 1 million in 1997 to 5.5 million in 2007. Public funding for universities is collapsing in America while growing massively in China. In this increasingly competitive landscape, should we further cut education? <br> On taxes, the president’s position is correct and inevitable. For a generation, we have kept taxes low as spending crept ever higher, and we made up the difference by borrowing. Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan is honest in showing that if these low rates are maintained and, indeed, reduced further, domestic discretionary spending would have to decline to levels not seen since the 1920s. As the Financial Times’ Martin Wolf points out, it would mean the virtual elimination of the Defense Department. America’s tax burden will have to rise; the real debate is simply in what manner. Tax reform — closing loopholes and deductions — is clearly the best approach. <br> Then there are the entitlement programs. Here, Obama was at his most eloquent but least pragmatic. He made a passionate case for maintaining a basic social safety net for all, particularly the elderly and the poor, that I think will resonate with most Americans. But he lost his courage in proposing sensible reforms to these programs. The number of people eligible for Social Security and Medicare will double by 2030. At that point, those two programs plus Medicaid will take up about 60 percent of the federal budget. We need radical thinking to make them affordable, if only to be able to spend on all the investments that Obama believes in. <br> The president argues that his approach to cost-cutting in health care is better than Ryan’s approach, which shifts costs onto individuals — and assumes that individual choice will magically get costs to plummet. Probably true, but the nation will probably also need to try every approach — using Medicare’s buying power to force costs down, shifting from a fee-for-service to a fee-for-outcomes approach, and having consumers pay more — to truly drive down costs. For Social Security, we should also raise the retirement age, means-test benefits and change the indexing formula. As a society, we must determine roughly what percentage of the federal budget will pay for entitlement programs rather than simply allowing demographics and escalating costs to drive these costs ever higher. <br> I praised Paul Ryan for his courage in presenting a budget that takes risks and proposes painful cuts. It has also had the effect of spurring Barack Obama to present his own serious proposal. I prefer Obama’s approach — which is also closer to that of the Simpson-Bowles commission — with more cuts to entitlements. But what’s critical is that, finally, after years of kicking the can down the road, we are having the national debate about America’s future. 
 Political moderates and on-the-fencers have had it easy up to now on budget issues. They could condemn “both sides” and insist on the need for “courage” in tackling the deficit. <br> Thanks to Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget and the Republicans’ maximalist stance in negotiations to avert a government shutdown, the days of straddling are over. <br> Ryan’s truly outrageous proposal, built on heaping sacrifice onto the poor, slashing scholarship aid to college students and bestowing benefits on the rich, ought to force middle-of-the-roaders to take sides. No one who is even remotely moderate can possibly support what Ryan has in mind. <br> And please, let’s dispense with the idea that Ryan is courageous in offering his design. There is nothing courageous about asking for give-backs from the least advantaged and least powerful in our society. It takes no guts to demand a lot from groups that have little to give and tend to vote against your party anyway. <br> And there is nothing daring about a conservative Republican delivering yet more benefits to the wealthiest people in our society, the sort who privately finance the big ad campaigns to elect conservatives to Congress. <br> Ryan gives the game away by including the repeal of financial reform in his “budget” plan. What does this have to do with fiscal balance? Welcome to the Wall Street Protection Act of 2011. <br> Oh, yes, and this budget has nothing to do with deficit reduction. Ryan would hack away at expenditures for the poor. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates he gets about two-thirds of his $4.3 trillion in actual cuts from programs for low- income Americans. Note that this $4.3 trillion almost exactly matches the $4.2 trillion he proposes in tax cuts over a decade. Welcome to the Bah Humbug Act of 2011. <br> But you’d expect a progressive to feel this way. What’s striking is that Ryan is pushing moderates to stand up for a government that will have enough money to perform the functions now seen as basic in the 21st century. These notably include helping those who can’t afford health insurance to get decent medical care, a goal Ryan would have the government abandon, slowly but surely. <br> Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, the co-chairs of the deficit commission and the heroes of the budget-cutting center, put out a statement saying some nice things about the idea of the Ryan budget. They called it “serious, honest, straightforward,” even though there is much about its accounting that is none of those. <br> But then they got to the real point, declaring themselves “concerned that it falls short of the balanced, comprehensive approach” needed for bipartisan accord because it “largely exempts defense spending from reductions and would not apply any of the savings from eliminating or reducing tax expenditures as part of tax reform to deficit reduction.” <br> Ryan, they argued, “relies on much larger reductions in domestic discretionary spending than does the commission proposal, while also calling for savings in some safety-net programs — cuts which would place a disproportionately adverse effect on certain disadvantaged populations.” <br> This is much like what I said, with an added layer of diplomacy. When even deficit hawks begin choking, however politely, on a proposal whose main motivation is ideological, you know there is an opening for a coalition between moderates and progressives on behalf of sane, decent government. <br> The Republican approach to shutdown talks should reinforce this possibility. Democrats have nearly given away the store to avoid a crackup, yet Republican leaders, under pressure from their right wing, have continued to ask for more and more and more. My word, even President Obama has finally gotten impatient. <br> However the shutdown saga ends, the negotiating styles of the two sides ought to tell moderates that they can no longer pretend that the two ends of our politics are equally “extreme.” No, conservatives are the ones who’ve been radicalized. The Ryan budget is definitive evidence of this. <br> It is conservatives who would transform our government from a very modestly compassionate instrument into a machine dedicated to expanding existing privileges while doing as little as possible for the marginalized and the aspiring — those who, with a little help from government, might find it a bit easier to reach for better lives. <br> Moderation involves a balance between government and the private sector, between risk and security, between our respect for incentives and our desire for greater fairness. The war against moderation has begun. Will moderates join the battle? 
 If there were any doubts about the political skills of the new White House team under Chief of Staff William Daley, they have now been satisfied. <br> Recently, the Congressional Budget Office reported that President Obama’s budget had underestimated the deficit over the next 10 years by $2.3 trillion. Deficits will exceed 4 percent of gross domestic product each year, with the federal debt eventually rising to 87 percent of the total economy. Obama’s budget plans are a gaudy spectacle of irresponsibility. <br> In spite of this, Obama now has Republicans cornered in budget negotiations. By accepting $33 billion in cuts for the remainder of 2011, Obama has taken the middle ground and exploited a major division within the Republican coalition. The administration has transformed a weak record into a strong political position. <br> What made this possible was Obama’s willingness to betray progressives in Congress even before the budget conflict began. In February, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had criticized spending reductions in the range of $30 billion as “draconian” and “unworkable.” Now that figure is a floor. The left has already lost the budget battle — though the right has not yet won it. Obama clearly takes liberals for granted, shoring up his own fiscal reputation at their expense. Given their quiescence, it seems a good strategy. <br> This maneuver has also placed House Speaker John Boehner in exactly the position he wanted to avoid. Obama’s offer is more than reasonable. A $30 billion reduction, after all, was the initial Republican negotiating position back in early February. Given that Republicans control only the House, this level of cuts would normally be viewed as a remarkable success. But a portion of the Republican conference longs for a confrontation that results in a government shutdown, preferring a fight over a victory. And the only worse outcome for Boehner than a politically risky shutdown is a deeply split conference, pitting the Republican establishment against Tea Party purists — a result that would undermine all future Republican progress. <br> So Obama has managed to lighten his liberal baggage, turn Republicans against each other and ensure they would be (justifiably) blamed for a shutdown. Not a bad month’s work. <br> This strategy may succeed because Republicans are genuinely divided. One bloc — the faction of the serious — is led by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), author of the 2012 House Republican budget. Few details of that document are surprising, but the cumulative effect is comprehensive and impressive. House Republicans propose major tax reform, including lower top rates, a broadened tax base and the closing of loopholes. The plan sets hard spending caps and adopts a number of recommendations from the president’s fiscal commission, which were largely ignored by the president himself. Ryan’s proposal takes on corporate welfare and farm subsidies, consolidates job-training programs, and includes welfare and litigation reforms. Most important, Ryan begins the Medicare debate in earnest, proposing a system of means-tested premium supports — taking seriously the challenge of 80 million baby boomers beginning to make their way into the system. Unlike his more libertarian colleagues, Ryan makes the case that entitlement reform, properly designed, can actually strengthen the social safety net for the poorest. <br> The less-than-serious faction of the Republican Party is intent on squeezing more savings out of the 2011 budget or pursuing a government shutdown as an end in itself. Some of this bloc is composed of House freshmen, who share the unrealistic expectations of the Tea Party base — the undoing of modern government by one-half of one branch of that government. Others are more senior members of the Republican caucus — representatives such as Mike Pence and Michele Bachmann — who seek to raise their profiles by establishing themselves as rebel leaders. <br> Even by the most exacting conservative standards, the contrast of ambition and sophistication should be clear. Ryan Republicans are talking about trillions in eventual entitlement savings that would release America from perpetual debt and allow some room for future discretionary spending. They are proposing a series of broad structural reforms, each of which will be a plank in the 2012 Republican platform. Pence Republicans seek billions in savings achieved through a strategy that, in 1995, helped rescue the Clinton presidency. Their policy platform shows all the creativity and strategic positioning of a stop sign. <br> Boehner’s task is to persuade House Republicans to take a good deal for the rest of the year and focus on next year’s battle over the Ryan budget. This fight will be considerably more difficult — and dramatically more consequential. 
 On Sunday, America celebrates the 100th birthday of Ronald Reagan, whose presidency is a touchstone for the modern conservative movement. In 2011, it is virtually impossible for a major Republican politician to succeed without citing Reagan as a role model. But much of what today's voters think they know about the 40th president is more myth than reality, misconceptions resulting from the passage of time or from calculated attempts to rebuild or remake Reagan's legacy. So, what are we getting wrong about the Gipper? <br> 1. Reagan was one of our most popular presidents. <br> It's true that Reagan is popular more than two decades after leaving office. A CNN/Opinion Research poll last month gave him the third-highest approval rating among presidents of the past 50 years, behind John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton. But Reagan's average approval rating during the eight years that he was in office was nothing spectacular - 52.8 percent, according to Gallup. That places the 40th president not just behind Kennedy, Clinton and Dwight Eisenhower, but also Lyndon Johnson and George H.W. Bush, neither of whom are talked up as candidates for Mount Rushmore. <br> During his presidency, Reagan's popularity had high peaks - after the attempt on his life in 1981, for example - and huge valleys. In 1982, as the national unemployment rate spiked above 10 percent, Reagan's approval rating fell to 35 percent. At the height of the Iran-Contra scandal, nearly one-third of Americans wanted him to resign. <br> In the early 1990s, shortly after Reagan left office, several polls found even the much-maligned Jimmy Carter to be more popular. Only since Reagan's 1994 disclosure that he had Alzheimer's disease - along with lobbying efforts by conservatives, such as Grover Norquist's Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, which pushed to rename Washington's National Airport for the president - has his popularity steadily climbed. <br> 2. Reagan was a tax-cutter. <br> Certainly, Reagan's boldest move as president was his 1981 tax cut, a sweeping measure that slashed the marginal rate on the wealthiest Americans from 70 percent to 50 percent. The legislation also included smaller cuts in lower tax brackets, as well as big breaks for corporations and the oil industry. But the following year, as the economy was mired in recession and the federal deficit was spiraling out of control, even groups such as the Business Roundtable lobbied Reagan to raise taxes. And he did: The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 was, at the time, the largest peacetime tax increase in U.S. history. <br> Ultimately, Reagan signed measures that increased federal taxes every year of his two-term presidency except the first and the last. These included a higher gasoline levy, a 1986 tax reform deal that included the largest corporate tax increase in American history, and a substantial raise in payroll taxes in 1983 as part of a deal to keep Social Security solvent. While wealthy Americans benefitted from Reagan's tax policies, blue-collar Americans paid a higher percentage of their income in taxes when Reagan left office than when he came in. <br> 3. Reagan was a hawk. <br> Long before he was elected president, Reagan predicted that the Soviet Union would collapse because of communism's inherent corruption and inefficiency. His forecast proved accurate, but it is not clear that his military buildup moved the process forward. Though Reagan expanded the U.S. military and launched new weapons programs, his real contributions to the end of the Cold War were his willingness to negotiate arms reductions with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his encouragement of Gorbachev as a domestic reformer. Indeed, a USA Today poll taken four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall found that 43 percent of Americans credited Gorbachev, while only 14 percent cited Reagan. <br> With the exception of the 1986 bombing of Libya, Reagan also disappointed hawkish aides with his unwillingness to retaliate militarily for terrorism in the Middle East. According to biographer Lou Cannon, the president called the death of innocent civilians in anti-terror operations "terrorism itself." <br> In 1987, Reagan aide Paul Bremer, later George W. Bush's point man in Baghdad, even argued that terrorism suspects should be tried in civilian courts. "A major element of our strategy has been to delegitimize terrorists, to get society to see them for what they are - criminals - and to use democracy's most potent tool, the rule of law, against them," Bremer said. In 1988, Reagan signed the United Nations Convention Against Torture, which stated that torture could be used under "no exceptional circumstances, whatsoever." <br> 4. Reagan shrank the federal government. <br> Reagan famously declared at his 1981 inauguration that "in the present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." This rhetorical flourish didn't stop the 40th president from increasing the federal government's size by every possible measure during his eight years in office. <br> Federal spending grew by an average of 2.5 percent a year, adjusted for inflation, while Reagan was president. The national debt exploded, increasing from about $700 billion to nearly $3 trillion. Many experts believe that Reagan's massive deficits not only worsened the recession of the early 1990s but doomed his successor, George H.W. Bush, to a one-term presidency by forcing him to abandon his "no new taxes" pledge. <br> The number of federal employees grew from 2.8 million to 3 million under Reagan, in large part because of his buildup at the Pentagon. (It took the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton to trim the employee rolls back to 2.7 million.) Reagan also abandoned a campaign pledge to get rid of two Cabinet agencies - Energy and Education - and added a new one, Veterans Affairs. <br> 5. Reagan was a conservative culture warrior. <br> Reagan's contributions to the culture wars of the 1980s were largely rhetorical and symbolic. Although he published a book in 1983 about his staunch opposition to abortion (overlooking the fact that he had legalized abortion in California as governor in the late 1960s), he never sought a constitutional ban on abortion. In fact, Reagan began the odd practice of speaking to anti-abortion rallies by phone instead of in person - a custom continued by subsequent Republican presidents. He also advocated prayer in public schools in speeches, but never in legislation. <br> In 1981, Reagan unintentionally did more than any other president to prevent the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling from being overturned when he appointed Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court. O'Connor mostly upheld abortion rights during her 25 years as a justice. <br> No wonder that home-schooling advocate Michael Ferris was one of many right-wing activists complaining about Reagan by the end of his presidency, writing that his White House "offered us a bunch of political trinkets." <br> Will Bunch is the author of "Tear Down This Myth: The Right-Wing Distortion of the Reagan Legacy." He is a senior writer for the Philadelphia Daily News and a senior fellow with Media Matters for America. <br> Want to challenge everything you know? Visit the Five Myths archive.
